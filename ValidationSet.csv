"Energy  Rural  May 06, 2010   Administrator-USDA Rural Utilities Service If you lived in a rural area 75 years ago, you probably didn’t have electricity. Water for livestock, cooking, cleaning and bathing had to be hand pumped from a well. Farmers risked milk spoilage in the summer, and people often got sick from lack of refrigeration of their food.  On May 11, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an executive order to create the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) to bring power to rural areas. It was a resounding success.  Nothing before or since has transformed rural America like the REA.  Today’s Rural Utilities Service (RUS), part of the USDA Rural Development mission area, continues the work of REA. Just this week, four former REA and RUS administrators gathered in USDA’s radio studio, reflecting on their roles from 1993 to the present. Their observations will soon be available via podcast.  Rural Development, through RUS, is aggressively building a program to finance renewable energy, and rural America is rapidly becoming a greater energy producer for the nation. Not only is this part of President Obama’s clean energy economy, but it will also create quality jobs in rural America.  Working with other federal agencies, rural electric cooperatives and other utilities, we are taking steps to modernize the electric grid and improve energy efficiency.  While working to improve electric transmission services we are also meeting a new challenge: Delivering broadband to rural communities.  Without broadband, rural businesses are placed at a disadvantage and our children face diminished educational opportunities. Our next great achievement will be to build a system that will connect even the most remote places in America to the web.   Rural America’s future is bright, thanks to the thousands of men and women who have worked in or with the REA and now the RUS over the past three-quarters of a century.  Chances are, if you live in rural America, some of those people are your neighbors, as close as your local electric cooperative.  They achieved a modern miracle, lighting rural America. This week, take a minute and think about all the good they’ve done.  They’ve achieved the greatest success in a government technology program of all time.     (Left to right) Christopher McLean, Administrator,  2000-2001; Wally Beyer 1993-1999; James Andrew 2005-2009;  Glenn English (CEO-NRECA);  Hilda Gay Legg 2001-2005; Jonathan Adelstein 2009 – present; Dallas Tonsager (Undersecretary, USDA Rural Development); gathered on May 4 at the U.S. Capitol for an event marking the beginnings of the effort to bring electricity to rural America.

"Recreation and Heritage, USDA Forest Service in  Forestry  Jan 06, 2020  Azul Aguayo, observes the wonders of nature in a new way during a Forest therapy activity. USDA Photo/Tamberly Conway In September 2017, Hurricane Maria, a deadly category 5 hurricane devastated Dominica, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Amidst the devastation was the El Yunque National Forest, the only tropical rainforest among the USDA Forest Service’s 193 million acres. Reliably lush and green, the forest was left denuded and nearly unrecognizable. Today, El Yunque is bouncing back and many places like the Quedabra Grande Recreation Area are being reopened, thanks to the work of more than 100 volunteers on National Public Lands Day 2019. National Public Lands Day is celebrated every September and is the nation’s largest single-day volunteer event in support of America’s public lands. Volunteers helped to clear trails and remove overgrown vegetation, debris and trash from the area to extend, and improve recreation opportunities to communities in the forest’s southwestern region. The joint effort was made possible through Forest Service partnerships with Fundacion Amigos de El Yunque and Corazon Latino. In addition to the service work, volunteers were also able to take part in the first-ever citizen science project on the El Yunque. Called “Redescubre el Yunque,” or “Rediscover El Yunque,” and led by Amigos de El Yunque, participants collected data to monitor forest health, composition and recovery. One of the most unique aspects of this day of service, was “Forest Bathing,” or Forest Therapy, an activity in which participants embrace their surroundings using all of their senses to connect more deeply with nature. A Forest Service representative, serving as an Association of Nature and Forest Therapy Certified Guide, offered a two-hour session, in which participants slowed down, took in their surroundings and reflected on the “more-than-human-world” around them. “Seeing this experience transform people first hand is simply amazing,” said Tamberly Conway, partnerships, diversity and inclusion specialist with the Forest Service, who also serves as a certified guide for the Association of Nature and Forest Therapy. “Witnessing people take in the sights, sounds and sensations of the forest around them and then listening to how it impacted them was extremely powerful.” Participant evaluations revealed their experience connected them more deeply to the land and built a sense of community among strangers. Many said that the experience evoked an intense appreciation for the natural world and created a stronger desire to take care of the forest, which is sacred to the Puerto Rican people. Ricardo Burke, Forest Therapy participant, communes with the more-than-human-world. USDA Photo/Tamberly Conway “Nature is our true home, it provides us with everything we need,” said Ricardo Burke, one of the participants. “Forest Therapy connects us with our most natural selves in which we realize an opening, contact and visualization, guided in a safe environment.” The good news is that you don’t need a certified guide to seek a similar experience when visiting your national forests. Get out to experience your national forests by slowing down and focusing on your sensory connections. It can unite you with your forests in profound ways that can’t be measured, and the experience can also drive a desire to lend a hand in caring for these lands. You can visit our volunteer page to find those opportunities or call a forest or grassland near you to learn how to connect to your national forests.

"Director of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  May 16, 2014   As an entomologist, the notion of eating insects isn’t new to me. However, for most Americans, the thought can make their stomachs churn. And yet, maybe seeing insects on their dinner plates is something Americans should get used to seeing. Yesterday, I delivered the keynote address at the Insects as Food Conference, which was hosted by the FAO and Wageningen University in the Netherlands. As director of USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), my goal is to ensure that the science we invest in leads to solutions to today’s most pressing challenges. One of those challenges relates to our world’s growing population, which is expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050. We need to find new ways to feed all people while minimally impacting the environment. This “9 Billion Problem” has implications for how we grow and view food now and in the future. Insects have served as a human food source for tens of thousands of years and may be part of our toolkit in the future in helping solve global food security challenges. Today, insect eating is rare in the developed world but remains a source of food for people in developing countries in Central and South America, Africa and Asia. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, 1,900 different insect species are consumed by 2 billion people in more than 80 countries across Asia, Africa and the Americas. There are many advantages to having insects as food. Insects contain more protein and are lower in fat than traditional meats, and contain a number of micronutrients critical for human well-being. Because of their incredible physiological efficiency, insects require significantly less food to develop on. Insects save a substantial amount of energy and natural resources by their ability to get their heat from the surrounding environment. The environmental impact of insects is also significantly minimal. Finally, their reproduction rate is much higher, making them much easier to raise. However, for all the advantages of eating insects, there are still many unanswered questions. Little is known about the nutritional quality and safety of eating certain insects. What would it look like to “farm” insects at a mass scale and are there any constraints that need to be considered? There are many unanswered questions about regulation and policy decisions. And of course, as I mentioned above, would eating insects be culturally acceptable to Americans? As we work toward addressing issues such as food security, climate change, food safety, sustainable energy and childhood obesity, we might have to start thinking outside the box to find viable solutions. Incorporating insects on the dinner plate is just one small step in this direction, but it might lead to big outcomes around the world.

These challenges highlight the need for further research, discussion, and consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks of incorporating insects into human diets."
"USDA FNS SWRO Public Affairs Specialist in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 10, 2011   On May 26, I got to go back home to the Rio Grande Valley – the southernmost region in the continental United States – to help promote new sites for the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). The SFSP provides free, nutritious meals and snacks to help children in low-income neighborhoods get the nutrition they need to learn, play, and grow, throughout the summer months when they are out of school. My agency, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service, along with our state partner, the Texas Department of Agriculture, collaborated with local leaders from the Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley to bring SFSP feeding sites to the area, where unemployment figures are the highest in Texas and many families struggle to make ends meet. Local San Juan area children sample the nutritious meals that will be distributed to more than 1,500 children at feeding sites this summer. Along with Catholic leaders and local elected officials, we held a press conference in the historic national shrine of the Basilica of Our Lady of San Juan Del Valle. The shrine located in San Juan is the most visited site in the Rio Grande Valley, where parishioners visit in times of crisis or to give thanks for prayers answered.  We felt it was appropriate to launch our new feeding initiative at the shrine since so many see it as a symbol of hope. Catholic Bishop Daniel Flores opened the press conference with a blessing to more than 100 people in attendance. Local school children from the San Juan area were invited to sample food that will be served by the SFSP’s vendor, Chapita’s, and participate in special games – which would be similar to the feeding site activities. My agency is grateful that Catholic Charities has agreed to sponsor 25 feeding locations this summer. Sites are located throughout Cameron, Hidalgo and Willacy counties. An estimated 1,500 children will be served snacks and/or lunches. We appreciate Catholic Charities for going above and beyond with the SFSP. The agency partnered with other communities to set up sites in rural areas and colonias (unincorporated areas outside of cities where there is no running water or sewage system). Those residents have a hard time getting access to assistance. We at the USDA Food and Nutrition Service are committed to President Barack Obama’s goal of ending childhood hunger, and Catholic Charities will help us reach that goal by providing the staff to administer these meals to children. Last year in Texas 2.3 million children qualified for free and reduced-price meals in the National School Lunch Program, which makes the neighborhoods they live in eligible to participate in SFSP. Only 162,636 Texas children (less than 7 percent) took part in SFSP in 2010. Our agency would like to thank representatives from the Texas Department of Agriculture, Texas Health and Human Services Commission, the office of U.S. Representative Blake Farenthold (R-Brownsville) and the office of U.S. Representative Ruben Hinojosa (D-McAllen) for joining us that afternoon and underscoring the need to support this program. We also got a nice proclamation from the City of San Juan, which honored Catholic Charities for stepping up to feed children in the area.

"Spotlight on Rural America  Cross posted from the White House blog:  Today, I am hosting a forum focused on the rural economy at the Iowa state fair.  But, Rural America has been in the spotlight all this week as I joined President Obama to travel across parts of Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois, visiting rural communities to discuss his Administration’s efforts to create jobs and drive economic growth.  From investments in rural broadband to efforts to support small-business innovation, the President talked about his commitment to rural America – and he listened to what local residents had to say. The centerpiece of his trip was the Rural Economic Forum, held Tuesday at Northeast Iowa Community College in Peosta.  There, 200 small business owners, farmers, retirees, elected officials and others came together to discuss their ideas for a revitalized rural economy.  I was pleased to participate in that forum, along with my Cabinet colleagues Housing and Urban Development Secretary Donovan, Transportation Secretary LaHood, and Administrator Mills of the Small Business Administration.

"Spotting of Rare Snake in Georgia Shows Conservation Works  A recent sighting of a threatened snake in Georgia by partners of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) shows how conservation work helps wildlife. The Orianne Society and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, two key NRCS partners, spotted an Eastern indigo snake in an area where NRCS and landowners have worked together to restore wetlands, an ecosystem where the species typically spends several months of the year. The Eastern indigo snake is a large nonvenomous snake found in Georgia and Florida. Its historic range also included Mississippi, Alabama and South Carolina, and it’s the nation’s longest native snake. The snake was listed as threatened in 1978 because of a lack of habitat and people capturing for pets or killing them.

Photo courtesy of Food Donation Connection. Thirty-one percent of food that is available at supermarkets, restaurants, and in households goes uneaten – food that was nurtured and harvested in the fields and ends up in a landfill.  Increasingly food processing facilities, food service companies, supermarkets, and restaurants are recognizing the need to reduce, recover, and recycle all of this wasted food.  The momentum is building as more and more address the problem and take action to keep good food from entering landfills. A week from today - on September 24, Wednesday at 2:00 pm – 3:00 pm Eastern – you can join us for a webinar on “Supermarkets and Restaurants Fighting Food Waste and Saving Money” that will feature industry representatives discussing how they are leading the fight against food waste.  There will also be time devoted to dialogue, Q&As, and the sharing of resources. Register for the webinar here: https://www4.gotomeeting.com/register/241692455. Why is there so much waste at the retail level?  Consumers naturally tend to choose only the shiniest looking apple and freshest milk at the store.  So what happens to “ugly,” misshapen, or slightly out of proportion fruits and vegetables that might have looked similar to the ones in your garden?  What happens to that carton of milk or loaf of bread that is nearing its expiration or sell-by date? Across the country, supermarkets and restaurants are coming up with innovative approaches to keep that apple and that carton of milk out of landfills or sewage drains.  They are adopting innovative new approaches to reduce the amount of food that goes unsold, recover more wholesome unsold food to donate to people who need it, and recycle food discards to energy generation or composting. Here in the U.S., the Grocery Manufacturers Association (representing food and beverage companies), the Food Marketing Institute (representing food retailers/grocery stores), and the National Restaurant Association (representing the foodservice industry) have formed the Food Waste Reduction Alliance.  By improving food labeling, ordering and inventory management, marketing of “ugly” produce, partnerships with food banks and gleaning organizations, and compost and bioenergy production, supermarkets and retailers are doing their part to reduce, recover, and recycle food waste.  There are numerous ways to fight food waste and many of these ideas will be shared on the “Supermarkets and Restaurants Fighting Food Waste and Saving Money” webinar. Please join us to learn, get inspired, and share your ideas and activities on September 24.  Register here: https://www4.gotomeeting.com/register/241692455.

"Improving the Safety of Leafy Greens  Food safety is a top priority for consumers, especially when it comes to the leafy greens in salads. Researchers at the University of Arizona have discovered natural methods to sanitize these vegetables using ingredients commonly found in the kitchen, such as oregano, cinnamon, and vinegar. Plant extracts, essential oils, and organic sanitizers have all proved effective in killing bacteria on leafy greens and extending their shelf life. When emulsified in the water used to wash these leaves, the approach compares to (and sometimes even works better than) bleach or hydrogen peroxide.

"Celebrating American Agriculture: All USDA Foods are Local to Someone  March is National Nutrition Month. Throughout the month, USDA will be highlighting results of our efforts to improve access to safe, healthy food for all Americans and supporting the health of our next generation.  Fish and fowl, sowing and reaping, nutrition and agriculture… certain words and concepts naturally go hand in hand, and March is a month to celebrate both the foundation and purpose of the American food system. With March designated as National Nutrition Month and March 15 as National Agriculture Day, the time is ripe to reflect on healthy eating goals and to express gratitude for the farmers, fishers, and ranchers who provide the foods to fuel our nation. USDA’s Food Distribution Programs work at the intersection of nutrition and agriculture. Each year, USDA purchases more than 2 billion pounds of food worth nearly $2 billion from American farmers and distributes the food to schools, food banks, Indian Tribal Organizations, disaster feeding organizations, and other charitable institutions and feeding organizations.

"#Newfarmers: Please Join me at the Table Coming from a farming family in Georgia, I know firsthand the risks farmers take each and every day. The work is hard, the margins are slim and Mother Nature can be fickle. The questions that my family is asking about what happens to our farm in the future are questions that are shared by farmers across the country. Where will the next generation of farmers come from? Who will they be? Where will they live? How will they get started? What do they need to succeed? Yesterday, I hosted a Google+ Hangout with Kate Danner and Alejandro Tecum, two passionate individuals who share a love of agriculture. They spoke about the challenges and experiences of new farmers across the country. With the recent Agricultural Census indicating the average age of farmers continues to rise and opportunities for new farmers are growing, I wanted to know why Kate and Alejandro got into agriculture and what advice they could offer to others interested in doing the same.

"U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Feb 11, 2016  Forest Service scientists use a greenhouse in Washington State to grow bluebunch wheatgrass as part of their current reciprocal transplant project. It is one of the largest and most intensive projects of its kind ever attempted. Wildfires in sagebrush and other range ecosystems are increasing in frequency and severity, often in relation to drought conditions and intrusive species like cheatgrass, a non-native, highly flammable invasive species that establishes itself as a monoculture and crowds out native grasses and forbs. “What’s preferable to a monoculture is a diverse plant community that includes native grasses, forbs and shrubs,” said Francis Kilkenny, leader for the Great Basin Native Plant Project, a joint effort of the U.S. Forest Service and the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management, or BLM. Restoring a disturbed ecosystem back to health has positive practical consequences as well. A district manager with BLM can easily obtain and plant several seed types to optimize a restoration project. Preliminary research helps the manager identify which seed varieties have the best chance of succeeding in a given region of the country at a particular elevation, at particular time of the year and under current climate conditions. But, those findings do not come easily. It takes decades to develop successful new seed varieties for grasses. Research on forbs (broad-leaved non-woody plants) and shrubs still has a long way to go. What they’ve learned so far is that in addition to the right climate conditions, timing of seed planting makes a big difference. Method of planting also matters. Tamping seeds into the soil is better than blowing them from a plane, for instance. Keeping livestock off newly seeded rangeland for at least three years really improves the likelihood of a successful restoration effort. And, long-term monitoring is critical to our understanding of what seed mixes and restoration techniques yield long-term restoration success. Delivering this kind of knowledge to land managers is the other side of the coin. Collecting existing research results into a single digital library, holding webinars, producing an annual report of new findings, establishing a National Seed Strategy, and trading information with groups like the Great Basin Fire Exchange have all advanced national restoration efforts. “We’ve learned an awful lot about what doesn’t work, but our knowledge has advanced considerably since the Dust Bowl,” Kilkenny said. NOTE: A new report by the U.S. Forest Service, Effects of Drought on Forests and Rangelands in the United States: A Comprehensive Science Synthesis, provides a national assessment by 77 scientists of peer-reviewed research on the impacts of drought on U.S. forests and rangelands. This report will help the Forest Service better manage grasslands and forests impacted by drought, wildfire, invasive plants and other challenges made worse by climate change. “Our forests and rangelands are national treasures, and because they are threatened, we are threatened,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. “This report confirms what we are seeing, that every region of the country is impacted by the direct and indirect effects of drought conditions and volatile weather patterns. Sixty million Americans rely on drinking water that originates on our 193 million acres of national forest and grasslands. They support 200,000 jobs and contribute over $13 billion to local economies every year.” The report establishes a comprehensive baseline of available data that land managers can use to test how well their efforts to improve drought resilience and adaptation practices are working nationwide.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area in  Research and Science  Apr 28, 2021  The Economic Research Service estimates that in 2010, America wasted approximately 133 billion pounds of food. That’s the equivalent of every American discarding three average-sized apples every day. Not the “apple a day” advice we’re used to hearing. Today, on Stop Food Waste Day, we’re sharing five examples of how USDA is using scientific ingenuity to curb food loss and waste.  Preserving Produce Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists developed a clamshell container for fresh-fruit storage that maintains superior freshness, including preventing the softening and shriveling of strawberries, blueberries, and cherry tomatoes.  Applying Automation Automated sorting separates low-quality fruit from fresh-market, higher-quality fruit. ARS researchers designed and constructed an in-orchard apple sorting system that is compact, reliable, and capable of sorting 11 or more apples per second.  Upcycling “Unwanted” Fruit Many manufacturers and consumers overlook produce that is undersized or blemished. Using food scraps, ARS scientists created the world’s first 100% fruit bar by forming dried fruit into a bar.  Strengthening Safe Foods Reducing pathogen spread helps minimize food loss and waste. In fiscal year 2020, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) invested a total of $40 million in food safety research such as developing new methods to ensure food processing systems can effectively control salmonella.  Championing Consumers NIFA-invested researchers are examining how consumer behavior affects food waste. Community-based nutrition education programs, like the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program, help individuals, families, and communities determine how to use their resources to purchase and prepare healthy food while minimizing waste.

"Counselor for Agricultural Affairs-Vietnam, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Nov 18,  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack (right) speaking at Hanoi University of Agriculture, Hanoi, Vietnam on Wednesday, November 16, . There are many things that Americans are known for, including dreaming big, working hard to turn those dreams into a reality, and reaching out to help others who are also trying to make their dreams come true. During his trip to Hanoi, Vietnam, earlier this week, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack—whose own personal story and history of public service epitomizes these very characteristics—challenged a packed auditorium of more than 600 students and faculty at the Hanoi University of Agriculture (HUA) to be the generation whose dreams transform their communities, their country and their world. HUA, Vietnam’s oldest and largest agricultural university, was the perfect setting for this message, as many of its alumni have been instrumental in helping Vietnam transform in just 25 years from a food aid recipient to one of the world’s top agricultural producers and exporters. In fact, Vietnam is one of the world’s fastest growing economies and an important market for U.S. agricultural products. In the past decade, Vietnam jumped from the fiftieth to fifteenth position as a market for U.S. farm exports. At the same time, the United States has become a growing market for Vietnamese goods such as rice, coffee, cashew, spices and seafood. Two-way trade between the United States and Vietnam is strong for each partner. Although Vietnam no longer faces the problem of chronic food shortages, Secretary Vilsack reminded the students that new threats to the country’s food supply—whether from the impact of climate change to the decimation of crops and livestock through disease—needed to be anticipated, countered and controlled. “What is the best way to do that?” asked the Secretary. Embrace science—just like Dr. Norman Borlaug. When Secretary Vilsack told the capacity crowd about Dr. Borlaug’s green revolution, the estimated 1 billion lives he saved, and the World Food Prize he established, you could almost feel the dreams taking flight from the eager students. Secretary Vilsack closed his remarks by challenging the audience to aspire to make a difference, not by dreaming of things as they are, but as they should be. I know that somewhere in that auditorium, someone is going to do just that. Note: Vilsack is visiting with Asian Pacific partners in Vietnam and China to help strengthen trade relations and support the American brand throughout the region.

"Affordable Care Act provides incentives to encourage doctors to serve in rural America, funds rural health centers, helps rural Americans get access to care  USDA awarding more than $10 million in grants to support telemedicine and rural health research  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .14  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  Washington, D.C., Nov. 20, – Today, on National Rural Health Day, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced more than $10 million in grants through two U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs to improve access to health care for rural Americans across the nation. The Secretary also highlighted initiatives created by the Affordable Care Act that specifically address critical health needs in rural communities.""Delivering these programs to rural communities that often do not have access to quality, affordable medical and educational services has tremendous economic and social benefits,"" Vilsack said. ""They also mean that people who live and work in rural areas will not have to travel long distances for specialized health care services. These investments mean that students in rural high schools will have educational opportunities often not available outside urban areas.""Through the Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) program, USDA has helped hundreds of rural communities deliver care in remote areas since it began two decades ago. Today, USDA's Rural Development is awarding $20.4 million in grants that will provide rural Americans access to medical services, improve educational opportunities, and support Native American communities. Fiscal Year Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grant recipientsRural residents are more likely to report a fair to poor health status and have higher rates of health complications, morbidity and mortality due to challenges associated with low levels of employment and education, geographic barriers and isolation, lack of quality nutrition and health education, and lack of access to health care.USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is awarding 12 grants totaling more than $1.4 million to universities aimed at enhancing the quality of life in rural areas through improved health and safety education efforts. NIFA funded the grants through the Rural Health and Safety Education program which addresses these challenges by developing programs that provide the necessary health information to rural residents. The program has three main focus areas: 1) individual and family nutrition and health education; 2) farm safety education; and 3) rural health leadership development education.Projects funded in fiscal year focus on a diversity of rural health and safety issues, from diabetes education, obesity prevention, and physical activity and healthy nutrition education, to eco-healthy child care promotion, and rural expansion of 4-H Healthy Living program. Fiscal Year Rural Health and Safety Education Grant recipientsIn addition to today's announcements, Secretary Vilsack encouraged rural Americans to take advantage of the Health Insurance Marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act and discussed the health care reform law's specific benefits for rural communities.""Rural residents have higher rates of chronic conditions. This can be exacerbated by a lack of doctors or clinics in rural communities,"" Secretary Vilsack continued. ""The Affordable Care Act is improving the health of rural communities and giving all families the security they deserve. No one should go without healthcare because of where they live, or be forced to leave the communities they love to get the coverage they need.""Rural Americans suffer from higher rates of chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. The Affordable Care Act has taken steps to address the unique challenges rural communities face when it comes to getting the health care they need.One in five uninsured Americans lives in a rural area, and yet on average only 10 percent of the nation's physicians practice in these communities. The Affordable Care Act has significantly increased the size of the National Health Service Corps, which offers scholarships and loan repayment to health practitioners in return for practicing in rural communities and other underserved areas. More than 3,500 Corps members now serve in rural areas, and an average of 86 percent of them will remain in their communities even after completing their service.The Affordable Care Act also invests significantly in expanding services at community health centers, where 7.5 million rural Americans get access to primary and preventive care. That comes on top of the more than $3 billion USDA has invested since to strengthen health infrastructure in rural areas, building rural hospitals and health clinics and expanding access to health care in remote rural areas through telemedicine.Not only can a lack of health insurance coverage help lead to high rates of chronic conditions, it threatens rural families economic health as well. Before the Affordable Care Act passed, the average rural family paid nearly 50% of all health costs out of pocket. One in five farmers is in debt because of medical bills. Uninsured individuals living in rural areas are able to use the Marketplaces to compare qualified health plan insurance options based on price, benefits, quality, and other factors with a clear picture of premiums and cost-sharing amounts to help them choose the qualified health insurance plan that best fits their needs.Open Enrollment for the Health Insurance Marketplace began Nov. 15, , and runs through Feb. 15, . Those who have plans can continue them without re-enrolling. However, consumers are encouraged to visit HealthCare.gov to review and compare health plan options and find out if they are eligible for financial assistance, which can help pay monthly premiums and reduce out-of-pocket costs when receiving services. In order to have coverage effective on Jan. 1, , consumers must enroll or update their coverage by December 15.Consumers can find local help at: Localhelp.healthcare.gov or call the Federally-facilitated Marketplace Call Center at 1-800-318-.

"FSA Outreach Marketing Specialist in  Conservation  Aug 26,  Elsa Torres’ father, Jose, inspired her to buy an orchard and farm on her own. For Elsa Torres, farming is more than just a job or a livelihood. It’s an inspiration. Ever since she was a young girl, Elsa can remember working in orchard fields with her father, Jose Torres. It was something she loved and cherished. “My father is the person I admire the most,” said Elsa. “He came from Mexico with nothing and for 25 years he worked on an orchard that he now owns. He didn’t start out with a formal education.  But now he’s a business owner.  He’s an example of the American dream and how someone who works hard can become a success.” In , when the opportunity came to purchase that orchard Jose bought the land. Elsa knew she could do the same someday so that her two children could experience the joy she had growing up on a farm. “I love working out in the fields and the smell of fresh cut grass while trees are blooming,” said Elsa, who now has her own family and works a full-time job but still helps her father by managing the financial side of his orchard business. “It’s busy, but you gain a sense of appreciation for growing things.” So a year ago, when she stumbled across a 50-acre corner lot loaded with fruit trees and wine grapes she knew it was her chance to become an entrepreneur. But she couldn’t tell if that particular Wapato, Washington property was up for sale. She went home and called a realtor to see if any farm property in the area was available. “The realtor said he had one going on the market and it had everything we wanted, fruit trees, grape vines and room for expansion. He told me the name of the road and it was the same 50-acre corner lot,” said Elsa. “That’s when I knew it was meant to be.” Like many beginning farmers, Elsa found it difficult to obtain financing to buy the land. After being turned down for a loan by five different banks, she contacted the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) for help. “Elsa was unable to secure financing from a private agricultural lender because she lacked the capital needed for the down payment,” said Scott Smith, farm loan officer with the Yakima County FSA office in Washington State. “Through the FSA direct farm ownership loan program, we were able to provide the needed financing to allow her to purchase a farm.” The direct farm ownership loan program provides farmers and ranchers the opportunity to purchase farmland, construct and repair buildings and make farm improvements with no down payment and a maximum loan amount of $300,000. In fiscal year , FSA obligated 2,563 direct farm ownership loans totaling more than $448 million. Elsa also received help from the Northwest Farm Credit Service’s Jumpstart program. Now, she owns her own farm, is selling grapes to a local winery and thinking about expanding her operation. For now, Elsa is happy to grow into her own and continue the family orchard business. “It’s a total family operation. My husband, dad, brother, nephew and sister all help out,” said Elsa. “It’s busy, but we will be just fine.” To learn more about how USDA helps new farmers, visit www.usda.gov/newfarmers.   For more information on FSA farm loans, visit www.fsa.usda.gov/farmloans or find your local FSA county office at  Elsa named her farm B&J Orchards & Vineyard after her children.

"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way from the Summit: How REE is Using New Strategies to Reach Even Newer Poultry Handlers  During a walk along tree-shading sidewalks in the “burbs”; you’re accustomed to seeing games of hopscotch, bike rides, and maybe even the occasional Golden Retriever. However, one residential backyard, nearly 6 miles from downtown Atlanta, calls into question whether this is suburbia at all. There were swings, a tree house, and even patio furniture. Yet one feature certified this was not your mother’s suburban home: over a dozen chickens living comfortably in a custom made “Coop de Ville.”    The rise of “backyard poultry” is one of many agricultural phenomena tied to a growing food consciousness and increased urbanization. And while USDA’s fundamental job doesn’t change, the Department does because the challenges do.  The recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at increasingly popular backyard chicken coops underscore this. While this concern was not clearly expressed in the Act of Congress that created the Department, the mandate was. USDA still works to “acquire and to diffuse…information” towards facilitating the protected growth of American agriculture. That service is what brought Research, Education, and Economics Undersecretary Dr. Catherine Woteki to this residence in Decatur, GA. Accompanied by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service officials and a man known best as the “Chicken Whisperer,” Dr. Woteki toured the site and helped to shed light on current HPAI research and important biosafety measures.

"APHIS Aquaculture Program Manager, Riverdale, MD in  Animals  Plants  Jun 06,   If someone told you there were simple things you could do to keep fish from dying and protect our waters, you’d want to know more, right? Well, if you’re a boater or angler in the Great Lakes region, there’s a lot you can do to stop the spread of a fish disease called viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS). VHS kills freshwater and marine fish, including some species of bass, trout and perch. The good news is you can help fight the disease by remembering to clean boats and fishing equipment. It’s also important not to transfer bait, water and mud from one waterway to another. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) created a Focus On Fish Health campaign to let boaters and anglers know that they’re on the front lines of slowing the spread of VHS. Find out more at www.FocusOnFishHealth.org. The Focus On Fish website has some great information on the disease--such as how to recognize signs of VHS--and advice on how to dispose of dead fish and unused bait. If you belong to a boating or angling group, the APHIS website tells you how to get free materials, including palm cards and Power Point tools, so you can get the word out to others. And while you are out on the water having fun, be sure to bring your camera!  Enter our photo contest, where you can submit pictures of the biggest fish you ever caught or share memories of good times on the water. There are two categories: Your Best Catch and Family Fun on the Water. Winning photos get posted on the Focus On Fish Health website. If you win, you get a free tee-shirt, duffle bag and hat. You can submit up to three photos each month and winners will be announced at the end of June, July and August. For more information on contest rules and , visit www.FocusOnFishHealth.org.

"Renewable Energy on Farms Study Released - First to Look at Role of State-Level Policies  USDA has published a study examining states’ adoption rates of distributed generation for solar and wind energy on U.S. farms. The results show that states with higher energy prices, more organic acres per farm, and more Internet connectivity adopt renewable electricity at higher rates.  For solar systems, full-farm ownership and solar resources were also significant factors.  Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) targets were found to increase state level renewable electricity adoption at the distributed-generation scale while electric cooperative prevalence in the state was found to have a negative relationship to renewable electricity adoption share.

"White House Executive Chef in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  May 17,   Cross posted from the Let's Move! Blog:  Growing up in the Philippines, my mother was my main source of inspiration for cooking. I came from a family of eleven kids, and as a child, I would constantly volunteer to help her in the kitchen. My mother would prepare such amazing authentic Filipino food, and cooking for her was almost second nature. She didn’t think about it, she just knew what ingredients to use, how much of each to use, and how to combine their flavors in ways that would satisfy everyone in the family. So Filipino food for me is much more than just adobo, longganisa, or tocino and fried rice – it represents a huge part of my culture, and most importantly, it is what connects me with my family. And that’s why it’s so important to me that we think about Filipino food not just in terms of what’s delicious, but in terms of what’s healthy and nourishing for our families. That’s why I’ve teamed up with Chef Ming Tsai, the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, the First Lady’s Let’s Move initiative, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help promote healthy and traditional Asian American and Pacific Islander cuisine. Following a healthy cooking and eating lifestyle has always been important for me as a chef and a mom, and with the USDA’s MyPlate food icon, we have a powerful visual reminder about how to build healthy meals for our families. But no matter where you’re from, there’s no reason to have to sacrifice the food you love, or sacrifice the food that expresses your culture, in order to maintain a healthy and nutritious diet. I hope that after watching Chef Ming Tsai and I prepare healthy and delicious AAPI recipes in the White House kitchen, you too will be inspired to try your own take at making healthy, ethnic food for your own families to eat. Watch the video and try it at home with the recipes below! Recipes: Shrimp, Chicken and Vegetable Fried Rice  Ingredients (Serves 4): 3 tbsp Canola Oil 6 oz chicken breast, julienned 1/2 lb peeled and deveined shrimp, medium, halved length wise 1 small onion, sliced 1 bunch scallions, sliced, 2 tbs green part saved for garnish 6 cloves garlic, minced 6 oz shiitake mushroom, sliced 2 carrots, julienned 1 cup julliened napa cabbage 2 small bokchoy, washed and julliened 4 cups house rice (50/50 brown/white rice combo) 3 tbsp light tamari, wheat free soy sauce 1 tbsp vegetarian oyster sauce 1 tsp sesame oil Salt and pepper to taste (Note: Rice vinegar can be used in place of salt) Pre heat a large skillet or wok on a medium heat.

"Spice It Up in the New Year - MyPlate Holiday Makeover Week 8  The MyPlate Team offers the final “Makeover Monday” recipe this week on the USDA blog and the MyPlate Facebook page. I love mushrooms and could probably eat them every day. They come in a variety of sizes, shapes, , textures, and flavors and can be worked into every meal. On their own, mushrooms are pretty healthful – very low in calories, free of cholesterol and (almost) free of fat. They are also naturally low in sodium, high in potassium, and are generally high in vitamins and minerals. Stuffing mushrooms just makes something wonderful ever better!  But what you stuff in these tasty little vegetables can make or break the dish. Typically, mushrooms are stuffed with foods containing saturated fats and sodium. So, if you’re trying to watch one or both of these in the New Year, consider various herbs and spices!

"Listening and Learning From Local Food Stakeholders in New Mexico  As part of National Farmers Market Week, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) Administrator Anne L. Alonzo and I traveled to New Mexico, the Land of Enchantment. The bustling Santa Fe Farmers Market was the perfect place to kick off the week! While there, we also traveled to the beautiful countryside and met with key local food stakeholders during a special session and visits to local farms.   The round table forum and farm visits allowed farmers, ranchers, and local food organizations to share their experiences. We heard from Danny Farrar, who owns Rancho La Jolla in Velarde and is also a member of the Farm to School Board of Directors. He told us that many of the northern New Mexico farmers who sell at farmers markets are growing fruits and vegetables on small family farms of just 3 to 5 acres and on land passed down through generations.

"NRCS Oregon in  Conservation  Jun 29,  Beth Hoinacki shows an aspect of her crop rotation and cover crop plan.  U.S. trends in organic farming point to a growing industry. USDA agencies like the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) support organic growers by offering funding and technical guidance—both to farmers already growing organic crops, and to those who want to transition to organic production. Luckily for Beth Hoinacki, she heard about NRCS’ Organic Initiative right around the same time that she was pursuing organic certification for her operation, Goodfoot Farm. Hoinacki and her husband, Adam Ryan, purchased 10 acres of land situated along the bank of the Luckiamute River in Kings Valley, Ore. in, which they later named “Goodfoot Farm.” They were interested in the Organic Initiative because it helps producers create a conservation plan and apply approved methods targeting specific concerns on their operation. NRCS District Conservationist Tom Snyder and Hoinacki look through her fence to the recently completed grass waterway and hedgerow funded by NRCS’ EQIP Organic Initiative.  Hoinacki credits the Initiative with helping them start projects critical to soil and water quality that they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to address on the farm, where they grow a variety of produce, including blueberries, onions, garlic, potatoes and winter squash. One project helped the couple install a grassed waterway to reduce erosion in order to minimize sediment runoff into the river and improve habitat for threatened and endangered fish. In addition, they’ve planted a hedgerow for pollinator habitat, pursued a waste management plan to protect water quality and developed crop rotation and installed cover crops to improve soil health. Two curly-feathered Sebastopol and two American lavender geese help control grass and weeds on Goodfoot Farm. Hoinacki says that they’ve recently been interested in biodynamic agriculture ­because it takes a more holistic approach to farming. She says that organic methods focus primarily on allowed off-farm inputs on crops or fields, whereas the biodynamic approach is more about creating a plan and purpose for a farm to realize its potential as a natural, self-sustaining system. Hoinacki’s goal is to have a natural system that reduces the need for pest and fertility products to be imported from off the farm. She says that the biodynamic method has influenced her thinking in designing the farm, and NRCS’ Organic Initiative allows her the flexibility to pursue her goals by supporting beneficial plant life for habitat and developing a natural ecosystem within the production system. A nearly-completed culvert in Beth Hoinacki’s grass waterway, engineered by NRCS.  The future of Goodfoot Farm tastes profitable as U.S. organic fruit and vegetable sales continue to grow.

"Deputy Administrator of APHIS’ Animal Care program in  Animals  Dec 02,  We see the headlines about natural disasters all the time – hurricanes in the South, wildfires in the West, flooding, tornadoes, and the list goes on. But do we stop to think about how those natural disasters affect animals, especially those housed in zoos, sanctuaries, and other licensed facilities? In addition to preparing themselves and their families for various emergencies, Animal Welfare Act licensees must also consider how to protect the welfare of all of their animals when the unexpected happens. A critical part of ensuring animal welfare is making sure facilities can continue to provide food, water, housing, protection, and appropriate veterinary care for animals during an emergency, especially if facilities are damaged or animal handlers cannot get to the facility. This means anticipating potential emergencies, planning ahead, and training staff to protect animals. USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service just announced a final rule that requires regulated facilities to proactively develop contingency plans to safeguard their animals.

For three days, the Urban Field Station, located at Fort Totten in Queens, New York City, served as a home base for scientists participating in a workshop titled, “Urban Natures: Engaging Social Science Perspectives.” The workshop was a rare opportunity for Ph.D. candidates and early-career faculty members in disciplines including geography, environmental psychology, natural resource management, and environmental studies, to explore the connections between research and practice in social-ecological systems in a peer-to-peer setting.

"US Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 16,  Ghost stories illustration by Mary Horning, US Forest Service. Shadows start falling fast while you scurry to gather the last scraps of dead wood before it’s too dark – and too scary – to leave the relative security of the campsite on your favorite National Forest or Grassland. But, once the fire is safely lit, everyone gathers around to start roasting marshmallows and listen to…ghost stories! No one really knows when or how the tradition of telling scary ghost stories around a campfire began. It just did, and we really like to do it. In fact, there are many books out there that provide those with less creative story telling talents to get a group of outdoors enthusiasts nervously shifting their eyes and jumping at the sound of what was certainly a twig being broken by the heavy foot of a monstrous creature in the night or, yes, even a clumsy ghost. There are many reasons most of us, to some degree, are afraid of the dark especially while outside. Some believe it’s simply an evolved trait that kept us from, well, being eaten by the above mentioned monstrous creature in the night. All I know is as a creative writer myself, I really looked forward to trying out my story telling skills around a campfire. Sometimes my spooky tales are really creative like the ghost of Isabella who haunted a nearby meadow searching for her child who wandered off and was never seen again. And, sometimes, my stories are complete rip-offs from classics like Washington Irving’s headless horseman, albeit with a little twist. My headless dude was a lumberjack who literally lost his head in a bizarre tree cutting accident that really challenged my imagination to the delight of those around me. But, bad, good or just silly—ghost stories that really scare you are best served around a campfire with friends and family. So start your summer this Great Outdoors Month and Get Outdoors with some really spooky and memorable fun!

"NRCS Arkansas in  Conservation  Jul 13,  The stream bank next to Deanna Young’s home after stabilization. Although raging waters had subsided at Deanna Young’s home in Ponca, Ark., a flood of emotions hit her when she found out USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) would pay 100 percent of the cost of protecting her home from falling into Adds Creek. “I couldn’t hold back the tears,” Young said. “My prayers had been answered.” After the creek flooded her property in April, washing away the stream bank next to the house where she lives with her three children, Young had qualified for help under the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program. But the program asks beneficiaries to come up with one-quarter of the cost of rebuilding after a flood damages their property. Young couldn’t afford the cost-share, and the bank turned down her loan request. The mother of three, who works a full-time job at a Christian book warehouse and also holds down two part-time jobs cleaning buildings and mowing a cemetery, wasn’t sure what to do next. But Margaret Lonadier, NRCS district conservationist for Boone and Newton counties, continued to follow up with Young—and she had an idea. Although the EWP program doesn’t normally allow NRCS to pay 100 percent of the cost of repairs to an individuals’ property, a waiver can be granted for unusual situations or circumstances. And, when the cost-share became an issue, Lonadier sent a note to Arkansas State Conservationist Mike Sullivan, who is the person authorized to pursue waivers in the state. The cost-share waiver was approved, and work began almost immediately on the Youngs’ property. It was completed in June. The project stabilized the stream bank, which is only 8 feet from Young’s house. During the flood, a 10-foot-wide by 240-foot-long swath of the stream bank was washed down Adds Creek to the Buffalo National River. Stabilizing the stream bank will not only protect the home, but will also prevent more sediment from washing into the Buffalo National River. Sediment is a major cause of water pollution. Margaret Lonadier (left), NRCS district conservationist for Boone and Newton counties, and Deanna Young discuss the work that will done to stabilize the stream bank beside Young’s house.  The bank was stacked with gabions, rectangular wire containers filled with rocks and soil. The gabions will reinforce the stream bank and act as a 9-foot-tall retaining wall protecting Young’s home.

"U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Apr 07,  Current range permittee Lynn Sanguinetti and Fred Wong, U.S. Forest Service district ranger, stand in front of a cabin once used by Chinese cowboys in . The cabin is on the Stanislaus National Forest. (U.S. Forest Service) The often-forgotten footprints of Chinese immigrant laborers cover the floor of America’s national forests, railroads and mines. These laborers left behind physical and cultural remnants of the past woven into the fabric of our country. The U.S. Forest Service is partnering with The Chinese American Historical Society and others to ensure the legacy of these early American immigrants is long remembered. The partnership is working on a website scheduled to launch in April that will highlight more than 50 Chinese heritage sites with self-guided tour information for destinations in California and Nevada. The partnership goal is to schedule guided tours during the summer of in both states. “Traces of Chinese history, long forgotten by many, can be found within the present day boundary of the Stanislaus National Forest,” said Lisa DeHart, a Forest Service archaeologist in California. “Chinese laborers contributed to building portions of the Columbia and Stanislaus Miners Ditch, segments of the Westside Lumber Companies railroad grade and the Big Gap Flume. “However, few people are aware that Chinese men also were cowboys, as evidenced by the Chinese names left behind on the wall of the Cooper Cabin, a high-elevation range cabin in the Emigrant Wilderness.” The retelling of these stories is important because their existence during the mid- to late-s often solicited hatred. Newspaper articles focused more on describing Chinese as foreign threats to the American workforce and editorial cartoons were often racist. In reality, many Chinese immigrants were driven from mining camps and eventually Chinatowns through intimidation, arson, violence and murder. Those who managed to survive were either returned to China or moved into larger cities. But the evidence of their hard work and dedicated contributions remain scattered across the physical landscape, in documents deep in the recesses of local historical societies and in government records. Through our research on the Stanislaus and other forests, we have found many interesting historical sites that highlight Chinese-American contributions to developing of the west. Those examples include what many would suspect: railroad tunnels, railroad and road grades, water ditches and tunnels, flumes, stone walls and corrals, battlefields, agriculture, wine cellars, lumber camps, mining camps, Chinatowns, businesses, temples, and more. The wooden Big Gap suspension flume is an example of incredible engineering for . It towered 25 stories high and spanned almost a half-mile across and brought water to the mines, ranges and farms of the surrounding communities. Only documentation remains of the flume, which rotted and was replaced by the end of that century. Hundreds of miles of stone walls built by Chinese stone masons also attest to their industry. The walls snaked through the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and were used to manage cattle on Quick Ranch in Mariposa County in the mid-s. The Forest Service and other government and non-government agencies are remembering the past and the nation’s rich historic and cultural heritage as part of Preservation50, a three-year celebration of the enactment of the National Historic Preservation Act of . The Act made the federal government a full partner and a leader in historic preservation. The Forest Service program, Windows on the Past, will explore some of the more than 370,000 recorded cultural sites on the agency’s national forests and grasslands.

"Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19?  Last year, as COVID-19 rattled the world economy and disrupted trade flows, agricultural trade remained mostly stable, falling only two percent during the initial wave of infections and lockdowns, before bouncing back and ending the year up 3.5 percent. But the growth in agricultural trade doesn’t mean that trade flows were insulated from the effects of the pandemic. Much of was in fact shaped by other factors. For instance, 95% of global agricultural trade growth came from China and was driven in part by non-pandemic related factors of increased feed demand, efforts to restock grain reserves, and policy factors. A recent paper by USDA’s Office of the Chief Economist, Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19? Findings from an Econometric Assessment (, 1.4 ) (Arita et al.), suggests that while agricultural trade remained stable at the aggregate level, a deeper empirical analysis reveals there were still significant disruptions due to the pandemic.

"for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services Michael Scuse in  Trade  Apr 11,  Acting Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services Michael Scuse takes a handful of U.S. soybeans used at a ‘tempeh/tofu village’ production site in East Jakarta on April 6. Scuse visited the village – which uses 100 percent U.S. soybeans to produce tempeh and tofu, which are soy-based stables of the Indonesian diet – during an Agribusiness Trade and Investment Mission to Indonesia that he led last week. Photographer, Danumurthi Mahendra, U.S. Embassy, Jakarta  This is the third in a series of three blogs affiliated with USDA’s Agribusiness Trade and Investment Mission, which was led by Acting Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services Michael Scuse.  While leading this week’s Agribusiness Trade and Investment Mission to Indonesia, I’ve been gratified to see firsthand how U.S. food and agricultural products are benefitting the Indonesian people. My itinerary included a visit to a tempeh and tofu production compound, or village, in the Cipayung neighborhood of East Jakarta, where local workers are using U.S. soybeans to produce nutritious, affordable, high-quality food products. Tempeh, a cake made from fermented soybeans, and tofu or soybean curd, are staples of the Indonesian diet. Those with limited incomes rely on these relatively inexpensive, soy-based products for their high protein and nutrient content. Demand for the products continues to grow, especially in Greater Jakarta, which has one of the fastest-growing population rates of any urban area in the world. But historically, tempeh and tofu production has been small-scale, informal and often unhygienic. In January , the American Soybean Association-International Marketing (ASA-IM) – which receives export market development funding from USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service – established Forum Tempeh Indonesia (FTI) to provide support to small-scale tempeh producers at the village level, particularly in the area of proper hygiene.  Mercy Corps International, a U.S.-based humanitarian organization, has partnered with FTI to renovate tempeh and tofu production facilities in Jakarta under a pilot project. Supported by technical assistance through ASA, as well as private-sector funding, FTI and Mercy Corps have upgraded tempeh village facilities, hygiene practices and production equipment. As a result, production costs at these project sites have been reduced by as much as 30 percent. Despite Indonesia’s growing demand for soybeans, the country’s domestic production is relatively limited. In fact, more than ates. U.S. soybean sales to Indonesia have grown 40 percent in the last six years, reaching a record $805 million in calendar year and making it our fifth-largest market. All of the soybeans used at the Cipayung tempeh village come from the United States. On my visit, I watched each step in the production process, and couldn’t help but feel pride in that U.S. support has helped to improve production of a food source important to Indonesians, and that U.S. soybeans are playing such a crucial role in feeding the Indonesian people and the world.

Agencies are advised to not rely solely on translation software, either as an expectation of external users or for our own translation of documents. However, translation services can verify any translation received from software. The United States is a multilingual Country. According to a U.S. Census Bureau survey, nearly 68 million people in the U.S. speak a language other than English at home. Each year the U.S. welcomes more than 800,000 new citizens from all over the world. President Biden’s Executive Order entitled, Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, dated February 16, , states, “Agencies shall consider opportunities to …. (e) improve accessibility for people with disabilities and improve language access services to ensure that all communities can engage with agencies’ respective civil rights offices, including by fully implementing Executive Order 6 of August 11, (Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency).” USDA’s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights (OASCR) leads the Departmental language access program in concert with programs managed at the mission area, agency, or staff office levels. Executive Order 6 and Title VI provide meaningful access to USDA programs for members of the public who have limited English proficiency. Departmental Regulation -005, dated June 4, , establishes policies and procedures and requires each USDA agency to prepare a language access plan covering Federally conducted programs and activities, that include needs and capacity assessment; oral language assistance services; written translations; policies and procedures; notification of the availability of free language services; staff training; assessing accessibility, and quality. USDA Limited English Proficiency Translation and Interpretation Services Guide Names and Pronouns Using an individual's correct pronouns is a powerful affirmation of self for transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals. It validates one's identity, encourages authenticity and builds inclusive and supportive cultures. USDA's correspondence and communication should aim to adopt the use of gender-inclusive pronouns; and normalize clarifying pronouns in communication to eliminate the possibility of misgendering individuals. As a default, the pronouns “they/them/their” should be used in USDA sponsored communications, outreach, and correspondence rather than ""he/she pronouns, unless Program guidance specifically directs otherwise. An individual communicates their pronouns. For example, “Hi my name is John Doe and my pronouns are he/him/his” instead of “Hi my name is John Doe.” A good practice is to inquire into an individual's preferred greeting. If they share, we must respect an individual's request. This also applies to non-written communication such as when interacting in person, via phone, and video calls. Gender Inclusive Communications Guidebook (, 550 ) Tools for Readability and Accessibility Section 508 Standards are established and maintained by the U.S. Access Board. Under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of , agencies must give disabled employees and members of the public access to information that is comparable to the access available to others. USDA’s written products must meet the minimum Level-A and Level-AA Success Criteria of the Web Content Accessibility (WCAG) — the globally recognized for creating accessible digital experiences from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). WCAG 2.0 outlines the principles, , testable success criteria, and techniques needed to optimize content. The standard for most documents you will encounter or create must meet the standards for /UA-1. There are four principles known as “POUR,” where all online content should be:  Perceivable - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive (it can’t be invisible to all of their senses).  Operable - User interface components and navigation must be operable (the interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform).  Understandable - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable (the content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding).  Robust - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technology (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible).

"Deputy Undersecretary, Rural Development in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Nov 05,   The people of Winston County, Mississippi faced many of the same problems as other rural communities across the nation: declining population, rising prices, and family farmers in need of capital, business tools, and new markets for their products.  But they were determined to overcome these challenges. When native son Frank Taylor returned to his hometown after college he established the Winston County Self-Help Cooperative, a consortium of local farmers that pool their resources to receive training in business development, conservation, health, and other topics of concern.  The Cooperative also has a youth program, which teaches vital skills to the next generation of Winston County farmers. Meet youth program leader and “mommy, auntie, granny” Jean Harper as she shows off the youth farm run by the Cooperative, which will grow collards, cabbage, string beans, and more.  Winston County Self-Help Cooperative, whose motto is “Saving Rural America,” received a Small and Socially Disadvantaged Producer Grant to expand their operations into the surrounding counties of central Mississippi.  They were assisted by Kenneth Randle of the Mississippi Rural Development office. This is just one great example of how USDA is making a difference every day, every way.  For more great stories check out our other videos here and here, and follow our channel on YouTube.

"Director of the Northeast Climate Hub in  Sep 11,   As Director of the USDA Northeast Climate Hub, I am pleased to announce new partnerships with 12 land grant universities. This partnership effort will give the region’s farmers, foresters, and land managers better access to information and tools for adapting to climate and weather variability. The Northeast Climate Hub is one of seven hubs around the country formed to address increasing climate and weather related risks to agriculture such as devastating floods, crippling droughts, extreme storms, fires, and invasive pests. The purpose of the agreements is to create a network for information sharing and exchange. Universities will be active partners in developing, implementing, and evaluating decision support materials for producers that describe how to best cope with and even take advantage of increasing variability in weather. Universities with which the Northeast Climate Hub has entered into agreements are: University of Maine, University of New Hampshire, University of Vermont, University of Rhode Island, Cornell University, Rutgers University, West Virginia University, University of Delaware, University of Maryland, Pennsylvania State University, University of Massachusetts and the University of Connecticut. The Climate Hub will fund university projects geared toward solutions and adaptation tools that are applicable to farming and forestry practices at regional and local scales. Our ultimate purpose is to provide science-based, region-specific information and technologies that enable climate-smart decision-making. The land grant universities have a long and successful history of delivering science in forms that people can use.” Hosted by the USDA Forest Service’s Northern Research Station, the Northeast Climate Hub, based in New Hampshire, is a partnership among the Forest Service, Agricultural Research Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and other federal, state and private organizations within the northeast region. The Northeast Climate Hub stretches from Maine to West Virginia and includes the Northern Forest Sub-Hub focused on forestry. USDA regional Hubs are also located in the Southeast, Midwest, Southern Plains, Northern Plains, Southwest and Pacific Northwest.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Farm Service Agency in  Rural  Oct 12,   USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA)—the agency responsible for equitably serving all farmers, ranchers, and agricultural partners in the United States with effective agricultural programs—recently launched a Spanish-language Twitter account. We hope it helps to reach Hispanic farmers and ranchers in a new way. We’ll “tweet” the latest information on farm programs, loan announcements and emergency designations. We’ll also issue updates via Twitter on the Hispanic and women farmers claims process. “We are excited to offer a tool that reaches folks for whom English is not their first language,” said FSA Administrator Bruce Nelson. “As the population of Hispanic farmers and ranchers continues to grow, we need to grow with them and provide resources to help educate and inform all of our customers.” As part of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack’s cultural transformation initiative, the department has taken steps to ensure that all farmers and ranchers have equal access to programs available through the Farm Service Agency. Over the last fiscal year, more than 5,650 loans and $509 million in support were obligated to minority and women farmers under FSA's loan programs. The agency also saw its lowest number of civil rights complaints since the agency began. Out of 2 million producers the agency has served, 37 complaints were received. “We have come a long way and we will continue to serve all farmers and ranchers who have dedicated their lives to feeding the American people,” said Nelson.

Science has always been a big part of Carlye’s life. By the age of seven she had already written her first ‘report’ on bacteria (one of Carlye’s favorite topics). To this day, she still studies many different areas of science. She now hopes to join the F.B.I which is where I come in. I was the perpetrator used in one of her science fair experiments. She decided she was going to study and test how wind affects Blood Spatter Analysis for the first science fair at Round Up. So she designed me: a tall, strong, athletic, single perpetrator who enjoys working out and smashes sponges into the wall for a living. Despite my stunning good looks and dashing smile, she ended up placing second! She is currently working on a research project on mental illness and crime. Recently, Carlye learned about the 4-H National Youth Science Day and is thrilled that more kids are becoming involved in science at a young age, especially since she’s loved science from an early age. Fortunately for her, she has not only learned about different realms in science but also interview skills, and time-management techniques. Whoa!! Look at the time! I must hurry and take a quick jog then prepare for my interview for a job in the weed-whacking industry. Thankfully, Carlye gave me some tips.

"Producers get a New Revenue Source, Waterfowl Habitat is Preserved and Industry Benefits from Conservation Effort  Earlier this week, USDA highlighted the creation of a market for carbon credits generated on working grasslands. Landowners benefit because they receive compensation for the carbon credits generated on their lands. They get a new source of revenue, while thriving grasslands provide nesting habitat for wildlife, are more resilient to extreme weather, and help mitigate the impact of climate change. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, recently purchased almost 40,000 carbon dioxide reduction tons generated on working ranch grasslands in the Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. It was the first purchase of its type.  Robert Bonnie, USDA's under secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the purchase and USDA's involvement in the project at an event at USDA headquarters. He was joined by Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Greg Martin, executive director for global public policy, General Motors; Sean Penrith, executive director of The Climate Trust and Paul Schmidt, chief conservation officer of Ducks Unlimited. The under secretary thanked Senator Stabenow, Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, for her staunch support for the program, which she said is delivering “real world measurable results.” Bonnie said he hopes this purchase will set a pattern for future carbon credit sales.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Agricultural Research Service Information Staff in  Research and Science  Dec 21,   This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Even in a tropical paradise like Hawaii, Christmas just isn’t Christmas to some folks without an evergreen tree decked out with twinkling lights and sparkling ornaments. But some USDA scientists worry about that Yule tree being decked out with something else: invasive western yellowjackets. These black-and-yellow-striped predators normally build their nests in the ground. But for close to a century, they’ve also been successful at sneaking into Hawaii aboard holiday trees harvested in the Pacific Northwest. First spotted in Hawaii in , the western yellowjacket (Vespula pensylvanica) remains a target for researchers and regulators who have observed the stinging invader competing with Hawaii’s birds for native insect prey. Applications of insecticide before the trees are harvested have proven 100 percent effective in killing the yellowjackets, and residues of insecticides applied 6 weeks earlier were still killing the pests at harvest. A process of literally shaking these trees, however, offers a pesticide-free alternative to ridding them of yellowjackets.  In the past, Hawaii’s agricultural regulators have that 10 percent of Christmas trees bound for the islands be shaken manually to detect hitchhiking pests if an inspector is present at harvest, or 100 percent of the trees be shaken mechanically if no inspector is present.  But there’s no precise rule about how long the tree should be shaken, and the duration could make a big difference in the number of pests dislodged. Scientists with USDA’s Agricultural Research Service teamed with colleagues from Washington State University, the University of Hawaii and the Hawaii Department of Agriculture to evaluate the efficacy of shaking the trees.  Although their research demonstrated that current shaking techniques won’t dislodge all the yellowjackets, Hawaiian authorities have since stepped up protection efforts by requiring that all incoming Yule trees undergo shaking.  These scientists are working to make pesticide-free shaking treatments more effective to help ensure Hawaii’s holiday celebrants don’t find more than they wanted under their Christmas trees. Washington State University plant pathologist Gary Chastagner uses a mechanical tree shaker at a commercial shipping yard in western Oregon.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research portfolio. It is astounding to reflect at the end of the year and realize once again how many pieces came together each day, each week, and each month to make sure the United States has the best official agricultural statistics. It is something of a well-oiled machine made up of America’s farmers, statisticians, modern technology, deep agricultural knowledge, and the most basic elements of human interaction - trust and hard work - that brings forth these useful and objective on time year after year since . It takes hundreds of thousands of producers responding to a multitude of surveys each year, in addition to the every-five-year Census of Agriculture which USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) conducted this year, to provide the source information about U.S. farm production.  For this, we thank each individual producer who takes the time to complete the surveys.  Get a first look at the Census of Agriculture on February 20, at the Ag Outlook Forum. The small army of dedicated NASS staff and enumerators prepare the surveys, gather the information from producers, analyze and aggregate the information and then prepare and release the . Everyone takes their jobs seriously and is committed to producing the best agricultural statistics available. We are honoring many this week with an award ceremony and certificates of recognition for truly outstanding contributions. And why do we need these agricultural statistics? On a practical level, there are examples such as a Pennsylvania township using information about dairy farms to determine which roads to plow first in a snow storm so that milk could get to market instead of potentially being dumped. And the beginning farmer who used to determine where to locate her organic farm based on the proximity of farm services, other organic farms, and other criteria that would create a favorable business environment her operation. Or the trucking company that wanted to determine the best location to expand based on where large volumes of certain grains and byproducts are produced. In the big picture, we need them to understand local and global food supply, ensure smooth domestic and international trade, and to inform local and national food, land and farm policy. Many federal agencies and policy makers use the information for programs such as crop insurance, determining the use of and need for conservation programs, animal health and financial assistance. Since we collect the information personally, we often hear from producers just how important these are to them. And not just the producers – researchers, commodity market analysts, agricultural businesses, food companies, and students are among many others can tell you how they used the nearly every day.   Take a minute and explore the broad array of NASS to learn more about agriculture in your county and nation and tell us how you use NASS .

"Foreign Agricultural Service Public Affairs Specialist in  USDA Results  Trade  Oct 18,  Dutch Chef Eric Troost prepares an upscale dish using U.S. beef during a cooking demonstration for about 130 Belgian chefs Sept. 24. The demo was part of the first U.S. beef tasting event held in Belgium, which was hosted by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) office in The Hague, Netherlands, and the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF). The tasting was part of ongoing efforts to help expand U.S. beef exports to the European Union (EU). (Photo courtesy FAS The Hague)  The European Union (EU) is a relatively new market for U.S. beef exports. It wasn’t until August when the United States began exporting high-quality beef (marbled with a high fat content) to the EU under a negotiated tariff rate quota for non-hormone treated beef. Today, about 25 percent of U.S. beef exports to the EU are high-quality cuts such as tenderloin, strip loin and rib eye mostly used by upscale restaurants. The remaining beef exports include medium and lower quality cuts such as flank steak, chuck eye roll, briskets and shoulder clods. Finer restaurants in the EU traditionally do not integrate these cuts into their menus To help introduce these secondary cuts and expand U.S. beef exports to the EU, the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) office in The Hague, Netherlands, partnered with the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) and a Belgium-based meat importer and distributor to host the first U.S. beef tasting event in Belgium Sept. 24. USMEF’s international marketing efforts on behalf of U.S. beef, pork, lamb and veal are funded by the FAS Market Access Program (MAP) and Foreign Market Development programs to support activities such as this event. During the U.S. beef tasting event, approximately 130 Belgian chefs learned about the preparation of these less familiar beef cuts. Local Dutch Chef Eric Troost presented various cooking demonstrations including slowly cooked top sirloin with barbecue sauce, tartar of shoulder clod with artichoke and shallots and top blade with beets, coriander and sesame vinaigrette. The chefs were excited to learn cooking techniques for the secondary beef cuts, which are nearly 40 percent cheaper than primary beef cuts, said Mary Ellen Smith, agricultural attaché at the FAS office in The Hague. “Typically, secondary cuts from European beef cannot be used for finer dishes, so the Belgian chefs were intrigued by the various cooking methods that take advantage of the unique marbling in U.S. beef,” she said. “Events like these help introduce new U.S. products not only to the chefs that prepare them but to the thousands of European consumers that they serve.” The U.S. beef tasting event is just one example of how FAS’s market development programs have a long history of helping farmers, ranchers, and businesses of all sizes build and maintain commercial markets for U.S. food and agricultural products around the world. It also helps support President Obama’s National Export Initiative, which aims to double U.S. exports by the end of . Click here to view a video recap of the U.S. beef tasting event in Belgium.

"Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Jul 03,  A family dinner of marinated chicken and grilled vegetables. Photo by Christopher Leonard.  With Independence Day just around the corner, families across the nation are making preparations to honor the day as the grill chef, king of Castle Suburbia, lord of the living room, master of the flames, marches forth. With a meaty feast to honor the day, the Fourth of July has become almost as much a celebration of grilling greatness as it is a celebration of the nation’s independence. However, all that glitters isn’t gold and an infection of Salmonellosis can quickly knock the grill king off his throne and onto another. Fittingly, the Fourth of July sits in the middle of grilling season. The amber flames roaring up between the grill grates can easily give the false impression of bringing death to all bacteria. However, don’t be misled. Preparing burgers on the grill is a quest that must be tackled safely. Taking the four oaths of food safety (clean, separate, cook and chill) will ensure a feast free from visits to the porcelain throne, or worse, a trip to the emergency room. The battle against foodborne illness begins on the way home from the store. Separating raw meat products from ready-to-eat products on the journey home is an essential step in preventing cross-contamination. Cooking hamburgers to 160 degrees will safely kill Salmonella and dangerous E. coli bacteria, but it does no good if you contaminated a salad with raw meat juice. And the specter of Salmonella isn’t constrained to poultry. No, the risk from this bug reaches to beef, pork and other meats as well as poultry. Ever hear the phrase “clean as you cook?” It’s sage advice considering cross contamination can ruin nearly any dish. Cutting boards, cabinet handles, countertops, basically anything you may touch with your dirty, meaty hands can potentially transmit pathogens. A recent FSIS-sponsored study asked 80 consumers to prepare a meal including a fruit salad and meat dish. The meat provided was inoculated with L. casei, a bacterium found in yogurt, to test average food safety preparation. Half of the group heard food safety messages and half did not. Despite this, 90 percent of the fruit salads were contaminated with the target bacteria. Kitchen towels were a major source of contamination, but the sink, refrigerator, oven and trash cabinet handles were also contaminated, just waiting to infect something else. Check back soon for more information on this study’s findings. If the grill king’s subjects use proper techniques (see FoodSafety.gov for tips), there is still the matter of cooking the meat. Despite the common advice of cooking to color or checking juices, the ONLY way of ensuring doneness is with a food thermometer. Nothing else, short of dragon fire will do. Finally, keep cool by keeping food cool. Don’t leave food out in the hot summer air without a way to chill it. Again, fightback.org is a good source for tips on what foods can stay out and for how long. Stick to these four oaths of food safety and the grill king and his guests will enjoy the feast to honor the day. Make it a safe one.

"NRCS Illinois in  Initiatives  Conservation  Mar 10,  This adolescent chick, hatched and raised at the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, is one of ten whooping cranes released in Louisiana in February . Who would believe that within a year of the restoration of a Lawrence County, Illinois floodplain, two endangered birds could find it? This recently happened when a breeding pair of whooping cranes took a break from their northern migration to enjoy the newly restored wetland. Whooping cranes are considered one of the most endangered wetland-dependant species in North America. These magnificent creatures, found only in North America, are the tallest birds on the continent, and are beloved for their distinctive call and intricate mating dance. In , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that the total population of whooping cranes in the U.S. was fewer than 400. Whooping cranes generally mate for life, and may return to the same watering holes again and again over the years. The creation of the 330-acre floodplain, in the historical Purgatory Swamp between the Wabash and Embarras Rivers, was an almost immediate boon for migrating and regional wildlife. As soon as the restoration work was completed, water pooled into a wet area that attracted the pair of whooping cranes, who stopped by this week. The cranes had previously been banded as No.4 Female and No. 16 Male, according to a source with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and are probably on their way back to their nesting site in Wisconsin or Canada. This floodplain project was one of 11 Illinois Emergency Watershed Protection – Floodplain Easement Program projects funded by the Obama Administration’s American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of (Recovery Act). In the past century, over half of the floodplains in Illinois have been altered by levees, lock and dams, and stream channelization. Water that enters these lands not only takes longer to drain, but also causes millions of dollars in crop damage. To help reduce damage to flood-prone lands, and the associated costs for farmers and local governments, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service offers landowners a chance to take flood-prone areas out of production through conservation easements, beginning the process of restoring these lands to their original function as floodplains. Though restoring a floodplain is not a quick process, some benefits are visible almost immediately—like the appearance of the pair of endangered birds! And some of the benefits of wetlands, like downstream flood prevention and water quality protection, are less visible, but just as important. Learn more about NRCS ARRA Programs.

Photo by: Yolanda Rivera, NRCS Florida. Students at a public high school in Florida are receiving some hands-on experience and invaluable mentoring from the staff at USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) as a result of a USDA grant. Project Grow aims to educate high school students about careers and college education requirements for career positions with NRCS in an agency effort to meet future staffing needs. NRCS is shifting to a younger age group for recruitment to evaluate if it’s effective in raising awareness for potential new staff members. The grant in helped fund workshops for this school year and the next for high school students at TERRA Environmental Research Institute in Miami-Dade County. The 1.5-hour sessions share the educational requirements for various NRCS positions as well as hands-on activities to demonstrate skills, methods and tools used by staff. Each workshop is personalized from the perspective of the NRCS staff member who shares their unique educational background, experiences and career path.  So far this year, NRCS soil scientists, district conservationists, soil conservationists, agricultural engineers and resource conservationists have presented. Next school year, NRCS staff in southern Florida will present on career positions specializing in natural resources inventory, engineering, soil science, range conservation and grazing lands management. “The presentations and hands-on activities have been very instrumental in providing my students with many lessons,” said Surey Rios, a teacher at TERRA. “We are looking forward to the next presenters.” The visits from NRCS staff were important because it helps students see the real-world applications of concepts that they are learning and hear the life stories of other adults, Rios said. She also said they enable students to learn about careers beyond those of their parents and about different education tracts. Project Grow is funded through a two-year grant from NRCS in partnership with Florida International University, Fairchild Tropical Botanic Gardens and TERRA. TERRA is a public high school for students who excel in math and science, coinciding with the background for many NRCS positions in the management of natural resources on private lands in the United States.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 12,  Warm Fire, . Over the last three decades, fire season lengths have increased by 60-80 days and annual acreages burned have more than doubled to over 7 million acres annually. In addition, growing housing development in forests has put more people and houses in harms’ way, also making firefighting efforts more expensive. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service, Southwestern Region, Kaibab National Forest. Forests significantly contribute to our quality of life, but climate change is adversely affecting natural resources in rural and urban areas across the U.S. A new report released by the White House, the National Climate Assessment, explores many related issues including how a warming planet affects our forests. With contributions from U.S. Forest Service scientists, the report is one of the most comprehensive examinations of climate change and its effects on forested land. It concludes that a warming climate will complicate future management of public, private and tribal forests. “Climate change is currently triggering multiple, sometimes contrasting, responses from our forests,” said Dave Cleaves, U.S. Forest Service Climate Change Advisor. “Longer growing seasons and gradually warming temperatures are helping trees grow faster in some areas, but in other areas, these longer and warmer growing seasons increase late summer moisture stress and reduce tree growth.” The Forest Service integrates climate change awareness, mitigation and adaptation into the management of its 193 million acres through the Climate Change Performance Scorecard.  For example, this tool has encouraged national forests to identify vulnerable water resources, plant more climate-resilient tree species, research carbon storage capacity and more. Some of the other ways the Forest Service manages wildlands includes reducing the potential for large crown fires expected in a warmer climate by removing hazardous fuels and managing for lower stem densities in dry forests, managing forest genetic diversity to increase resilience to a warmer climate and restoring riparian areas adjacent to streams to ensure cold-water fish habitat during summer low-flow periods. Public and private forests in the U.S. will increasingly be vulnerable to ecosystem changes and tree mortality through fire, insect infestations, drought and disease outbreaks. At the same time, the need for healthy forests will only continue to increase. Forests provide an expanding opportunity to support emerging bioenergy markets and carbon credit systems. It is likely such uses will interact with the demand for wood products, healthy watersheds and recreational opportunities. There will also be continued economic pressures encouraging a shift from forestland to agricultural or urban land uses. According to Linda Joyce, a Forest Service scientist, and one of the authors of the report, climate-smart management practices are being developed and implemented, and the agency is maintaining its focus on retaining forests as forests restoring forest health and resilience, and reforesting private and federal lands. However, Joyce emphasized that implementation of climate-smart management practices can be increased only through effective integration of scientific information in management of our national wildlands.

Integrating climate change awareness, mitigation, and adaptation into forest management through tools like the Climate Change Performance Scorecard. Private landowners can also adopt these strategies, as well as others such as: 1. Developing and implementing climate-smart management practices. 2. Creating carbon credit systems that support reforestation and afforestation efforts. 3. Partnering with government agencies to access funding and expertise for forest conservation and restoration projects. 4.

"Posted by Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack in  USDA Results  Rural  Jun 09,   Cross posted from the White House blog: This morning, President Obama signed an Executive Order establishing a White House Rural Council, the first entity of its kind established to focus on policy initiatives for Rural Americans.  The President’s signature on this document represents a truly historic moment for the nation.  I am honored to serve as the Chair of the Council and work directly with my Cabinet colleagues from across the federal government to improve the economic conditions and quality of life for millions of Rural Americans. President Obama has already established an impressive record in rural areas, which the Rural Council will build on.  The Administration’s record includes substantial investments in rural America to modernize our Nation’s infrastructure, provide broadband access to 10 million Americans, enhance energy independence, expand educational opportunities, and provide affordable health care.  Nevertheless, the President believes that even more needs to be done in order to fully capitalize on the emerging opportunities in Rural America.  Despite recent advances, rural communities continue to struggle to maintain the population and businesses needed for sustained economic growth. The White House Rural Council will focus on actions to better coordinate and streamline federal program efforts in rural America, and to better leverage federal investments.  The collaboration will result in better programs and services in rural communities and maximize the benefits of those programs. Economic growth, prosperity, and the creation of quality jobs are on the minds of every citizen.  This morning, the White House Rural Council met and discussed ways to increase the availability of working capital investment.  This is absolutely essential in order for small towns and rural areas to attract new businesses, spur growth and create jobs.  This is especially true in the sectors of economic growth involving new technological innovations and development of renewable energy – areas where Rural America has the most promise, but faces the most difficult competitive challenges. In addition, I am greatly looking forward to utilizing the Rural Council as a means of connecting with Rural America and to continue the important dialogue the Administration has worked to establish with rural communities since regarding the needs and challenges that Rural America faces.  In the coming months, my Cabinet colleagues and I will be communicating Rural America to ensure that every American is aware of the programs and services they can access.  And we will get the most direct and current input from rural stakeholders to ensure we provide the best service possible. In the end, millions of Americans are counting on us to ensure that young people growing up in rural places have a bright future ahead – that they can envision a tomorrow that includes a job, and a vibrant rural community that they can call home.  Ensuring that tomorrow begins with the actions we take today.  And today, I am proud to be part of the President’s White House Rural Council and to help “Win the Future” for Rural America.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement in  Equity  Initiatives  Apr 23,  Kristina Edwards learned about the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Scholars Program her senior year in high school. One year later, she was named an Scholar and remained one for the entirety of her time at Prairie View A&M in Texas. “Receiving this honor made me proud of my accomplishments,” she said. “I was excited and relieved. The scholarship made me feel financially secure and enabled me to confidently focus solely on my education.” Monetary benefits of the program include a full-ride scholarship covering tuition, room and board, fees and the cost of books. Scholars also have the opportunity to participate in internships at USDA. Kristina became interested in agriculture, specifically nutrition and dietetics, to improve her health and break the generational cycles of chronic disease in her family. She wanted to concentrate solely on nutritional science until she interned with the USDA Economic Research Service and the Farm Service Agency and discovered skills she didn’t even know she had. “I learned about analysis, interpreting , and presenting it in a unique way,” she said. “Those skills I gained in my internship opened me up to things I never thought I’d excel at. I didn’t think of myself as a or numbers person, but it turns out I’m actually pretty good at it.” The scholarship also introduced her to the USDA liaison at her university, Horace Hodge, who played a critical role in assisting Kristina with her aspirations. “Even today, I still connect with Horace and keep in touch,” she said. “He made me feel important enough that it felt like having a personal mentor.” USDA liaisons like Horace serve as key representatives for USDA across America, connecting communities, students, faculty and staff, farmers, ranchers, foresters and others to the Department’s programs and initiatives. Kristina expressed gratitude and shared insight about the program to future scholars. “I’m glad I had this experience because I now have a more well-rounded background,” she said. “Students need to be open-minded and open to working in an area that may not exactly match your background, because you may discover strengths.” Today she still makes a difference in the agriculture realm, performing analytics as a fellow for a humanitarian group that provides support in the food security sector. After completion of the fellowship in , she plans to obtain her master’s degree and potentially work for a government agency.

"-Young, Under Secretary, Research, Education, and Economics & USDA Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  May 15,  We are at a pivotal moment for USDA and U.S. agriculture. Last week, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and I launched the “USDA Science and Research Strategy, -: Cultivating Scientific Innovation (, 21.4 )”. The strategy reflects a three-year vision for transforming U.S. agriculture through science and innovation. The message is clear: our agricultural and forestry systems must be more productive, profitable, resilient, and sustainable than ever before. These systems must work for all who need them, not just for a few. The Science and Research Strategy is our answer to how research and innovative technologies can advance agricultural production while simultaneously tackling the world’s greatest challenges. In this Strategy, we’ve identified USDA’s highest scientific priorities. Aligning with USDA’s Strategic Plan for -, (, 9.6 ) these priorities reflect input from our stakeholders and partners. USDA’s five science priorities are:  Accelerating Innovative Technologies & Practices  Driving Climate-Smart Solutions  Bolstering Nutrition Security & Health  Cultivating Resilient Ecosystems  Translating Research into Action Our crosscutting priorities reflect the expert feedback from scientific leaders across USDA and external stakeholders from across our diverse agricultural enterprise. These new priorities represent the complexity of the obstacles we face and will guide how USDA plans to meet this moment through science, , innovation, and partnerships. Interwoven throughout this Strategy and centered at the heart of each priority is our commitment to equity. By supporting a more equitable and just science enterprise, we will drive real and meaningful impact for the people we serve. Our Science & Research Strategy is meant to spur innovation and collaboration across all sectors. This is a call to action for our stakeholders and partners nationwide to propose bold, audacious actions to advance the priorities we’ve set forth. Join the conversation! As we implement this Strategy over the next three years, your voices are critical. I encourage everyone to review this plan and share how your work intersects—or could intersect—with these priorities. Through open science, transparency, and collaboration, we can find revolutionary solutions to transform our nation’s food and agricultural systems to benefit the many and the most. Working together, in alignment with USDA’s Science & Research Strategy, let's continue to push the boundaries of possibility for agriculture and forestry to create a better world for all.

"Addressing California’s Water Challenges Through Action and Collaboration  Cross posted from DOI News: California is in the throes of the worst drought in the 160 years during which records have been kept. As a result, the state’s overextended water system is in crisis. All segments of California’s economy— one of the largest in the world—are experiencing the effects of this drought. The economic, social and environmental impacts on agriculture, industry, jobs, communities’ drinking water and the ecosystem will reverberate across the country, and that is why actions need to be taken to address the situation not just in the short term, but also to sustain the state over the long run. Following two years of dry conditions, on January 17, California Governor Jerry Brown proclaimed a State of Emergency for drought. Subsequently, the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce have committed to helping California prepare for and lessen drought impacts.

"Acting Arizona Rural Development State Director in  Rural  Jun 16,   The parents were leery about another rental, fearing having to move yet again. Rather serendipitously, the mother saw information on line about USDA Rural Development housing programs. She made a call that changed their lives. As it turned out, the house that they eventually found and qualified for was part of a “green home” renovation in conjunction with other local agencies. The family was able to purchase their home with a loan direct from Rural Development, give their four children a stable home and neighborhood, and the home itself has proven to be so efficient that they are saving monthly on their utility bills. The family received homebuyer education classes and credit counseling as part of the programs they participated in. The mother said “We are lucky to have found out about you! We have nothing but high praise for the process. Thank you for your dedication to helping families like ours purchase a home.” In Yavapai County another Rural Development program has helped families transition into stable home situations and sometimes rescued them from homelessness. With this program non-profits are able to rent for $1 a year Non-Program Real Estate Owned (foreclosed) REO homes owned by Rural Development. During the ten year rental agreement, the non-profit uses the home as transitional housing. In Cottonwood, Arizona, a church entered into such an agreement with USDA nine years ago. Since then, they have helped five families. The church limits the time a family can stay to two years and during that time they provide the family with job training and credit counseling. They also charge a “rental fee” to the family. Rent is calculated based on the family’s income and expenses. The rent that is received is used to do any repairs and upkeep, pay property taxes and insurance and any remaining amount is put into an escrow account for the family to use as a down payment when their two year rental agreement is up. According to the spokesman for the church, the tenants are also to put an additional 20 percent  above that rental amount into the account—a way to teach the value of saving. The second family who lived in the home included a mother and her two children. The family was living in a homeless shelter before moving into the house. In the two years that they were in the home, they learned important life skills such as maintaining the property and making regular payments. We built the houses that helped build this great nation after World War II. We helped build the communities and many of facilities and infrastructure that make them function. In the tradition of barn-raising, we have given these rural communities what they needed to help themselves. And they have shown their gratitude by working to ensure that their debts are repaid so we can help the next small town or rural resident in the same way we helped them.

"US Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 23,  Members of the Highway 89 Stewardship Team ceremonially broke ground in early May to begin construction on two wildlife underpasses in northeast California. Photo credit: Sagehen Creek Field Station Every year in the U.S. roughly 200 people are killed in as many as 2 million wildlife-vehicle collisions and at a cost of more than $8 billion, according to the Western Transportation Institute. But the U.S. Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest Research Station scientists, along with their collaborators in the Highway 89 Stewardship Team, are paving the way to reduce those statistics with their latest project. The team broke ground last May on its second and third wildlife underpasses along a 25-mile stretch of Highway 89 between Truckee and Sierraville, California. “Studies have shown that well-placed wildlife crossings, coupled with fencing, can reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions by as much as 75 to 100 percent,” said Sandra Jacobson, a wildlife biologist with Pacific Southwest Research Station. While wildlife crossings exist across the country, the Highway 89 crossings will be unique in their value to science. Built to near identical dimensions and only located a mile apart from each other, the underpasses will allow scientists to manipulate conditions to learn what might make an underpass more appealing to wildlife. For instance there might be things that cancel out noise or add cover within the tunnels that might promote use among smaller animals. The tunnels are adjacent to the University of California, Berkeley’s Sagehen Creek Field Station in the Sagehen Experimental Forest, which will give scientists access to the forest’s research facilities and monitoring equipment. The $2.8 million project was funded largely in part by a Federal Highways Transportation Enhancement grant. The underpasses should be completed and operational by the fall.

"in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 24,   At USDA, we are working hard to ensure that America’s next generation has access to the healthy foods they need to grow, learn, achieve, and eventually to compete and succeed on a global stage. We are focused on feeding a healthier future, but we are also learning that the country as a whole is making the shift towards a more health-conscious society. USDA recently released a study that shows that the diets of American adults are improving. More people are reading nutrition labels and using that information to make healthier food choices at the grocery stores. We are eating out less and sitting down around the supper table with family more. At USDA, we have made it a priority to support this progress by ensuring that our programs empower the American public to make smart choices every day at school, at home and in their communities. We are offering more nutritious food options and backing that up with the best available science-based advice on what to eat and why to eat it. Our MyPlate symbol makes it easier for people to visualize what a healthy meal should like on the plate, and is being used around the country in school cafeterias, in nutrition education programs and on food packaging. Tools like the SuperTracker are helping people establish and apply proper nutrition and dietary habits in their everyday lives. We have also partnered with the Treasury and Health and Human Services Departments to help improve access to nutritious food in underserved communities. With our external and federal partners, we are supporting initiatives that expand healthy food options in communities, improve people’s ability to purchase that food, and create economic opportunities for America’s farmers and small businesses across the country. Americans now have expanded opportunity to access healthy products from local farmers and ranchers through farmers markets, thanks in part to a more than 50 percent increase in the number of markets supported by USDA. Shoppers using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits now have access to more fruits and vegetables, as a result of USDA and our partners’ concerted efforts to expand SNAP card reader technology to nearly 4,000 farmers markets across the country. Through our Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), which serves more than half of all babies born in the United States, we are ensuring that very young children get the vital nutrients they need during their most vulnerable years. Recent credit WIC for its key role in the tremendous progress we’ve in the fight against childhood obesity, as rates among low-income children are now declining for the first time since the s. Our schools are building upon that progress by serving healthier breakfasts, lunches and snacks—chock full of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy and lean protein—to students. Ninety percent of our nation’s schools are fully meeting the new nutritional standards for school meals and we expect the remainder to follow soon behind. This progress is due in part to the commitment of public and private entities—not just USDA and this Administration, but our local leader partners in schools, small businesses, and state capitols across the country—charged with implementing practical, modern policies that work out in the real world, not just inside the Beltway. We have made significant headway, but our work is not done. We continue to invest in critical programs that ensure that healthy, safe, affordable food is available to children and families. As always, we are pushing Congress to finish the work of a passing a new Food, Farm and Jobs Bill that continues to build upon these efforts and supports a healthier next generation of American leaders.

"On the Map: The Land, Water and Conservation Fund  There is a Federal program that you may not have heard of, but it is responsible for conserving millions of acres of recreational and conservation lands for Americans to enjoy, and it helps fund local parks, provide access to rivers and trails, and preserve wildlife habitat in every state in the Union.  This program is the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) and each year, the Department of the Interior and Department of Agriculture request funding from Congress to support grants to states and high priority federal recreational and conservation investments. Locating and learning about these special places is now easier than ever through a new interactive map. The map enables everyone to explore the 173 public projects proposed for investment in 43 states, including important waterfowl nesting habitat in the Prairie Potholes, battlefields and historic sites from Pennsylvania to Washington, scenic vistas in iconic locations like Maine’s Acadia National Park, and recreation sites in national monuments in California and Arizona. Land and Water Conservation funds secure access for the American public to their Federal lands.  For 50 years, the law has been one of the most successful programs for recreation and conservation in our history. LWCF has provided funding to local communities that supported the construction of more than 40,000 city parks, hiking and biking trails, and boat ramps, and access to thousands of acres of fishing and hunting and  important wildlife habitat.

"Deputy Director of Capacity Building and Development, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Aug 13,   The Waters family farm in Orrick, Mo. had a few unusual guests last week when dozens of African ministers came to learn about their corn, soybean and wheat farm. To embrace the 9th African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Forum’s theme, “New Strategies for a Changing World,” the organizers made some innovative changes, splitting the forum between Washington DC and Kansas City, Mo. Why Kansas City? As a major agricultural hub, Kansas City was ideal for bringing American and African agribusinesses and investors together. It also took the forum beyond policy discussions and into the field, literally. It was the perfect place to demonstrate the close relationship between American farmers and “the people’s department,” as USDA was originally named by Abraham Lincoln. Tom and Karla Waters explained how they plant, harvest, store, and sell crops in their seventh generation farm operation. USDA Farm Service Agency’s county director and an extension agent discussed how the Department supports smallholder farmers and large scale operations such as the Waters’ 5,000 acres through research and training at land-grant universities, and marketing and credit programs. In the Foreign Agricultural Service, I oversee capacity building and development programs, many in Africa. I talked about how our technical assistance programs help give farmers in Africa the same knowledge and tools available to farmers in the United States, through partnerships and coordination with farm groups, governments, and other public and private organizations. The ministers and delegates asked questions about purchasing seeds, planting cycles, irrigation, value-added end products, how prices are determined, and how to make a profit. On the policy side, they gained valuable insight about the Farm Service Agency’s network of service centers where farm loan managers, rural development officers, and extension agents serve the agricultural needs of communities throughout the United States. By seeing the producer-government relationship in action at the farm, I hope the ministers and delegates will take some new ideas and practices to use back home.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Forestry  Oct 29,  Mexican free-tailed bats exiting Bracken Bat Cave. Photo credit: USFWS/Ann Froschauer Most people associate pollination with bees and birds but often forget the work of their furry colleagues: bats. Bats take the night shift, playing a major role in pollinating crops and spreading seeds. One important bat is the Mexican long-nose bat, which dwells in large colonies. Their range includes the southern parts of Texas, California, New Mexico and Arizona. Throughout time, plants and mammals have shared a dependency on one another that is mutually beneficial. So naturally, these bats feed on flowers, including those of valuable commercial crops, like figs, dates, mangoes and peaches, which have flowers that only open at night. These mammal pollinators are finicky eaters with a specific palate. Dining on plant pollen and drinking sweet nectar is a delicacy at its batty-best. They tend to enjoy a flower that’s mild in scent and not bright in color. Simply speaking, white or pale crop flowers attract the night pollinators to feed on them. Mexican long-nose bats can fly extensive distances to gather nectar from specific plants. A lesser long-nosed bat pollinates a cross section of a saguaro cactus flower. Photo by Merlin D. Tuttle, Bat Conservation International. “When they are in Texas and New Mexico, they feed on the nectar of agave flowers too,” said Cyndee Watson, a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The common feeding features of pollinating bats are elongated snouts and tongues, combined with smaller and fewer teeth. This aids in the rapid collection of nectar. “Bats get pollen on their faces and bodies and go to the next flower. That is how cross pollination happens,” Watson said. Mexican long-nose bats visit up to 30 flowers each night, feeding and transporting pollen. They use a sonar system, through which the echoes of sound waves determine the shapes of surrounding objects. Because the powerful echoes emit higher frequencies and vibrations, bats can detect the existence of swift flying predators, too. The seeds and fruits that compose part of our diet would not exist without the interaction between flowering plants and pollinators, including bats. Bats serve a purpose with other popular pollinators, and they’re just as important as the day shift birds and bees, which feed on daytime flowering plants. Some states where large populations of bats live are also working to ensure bats always have a place to call home after a nighttime feeding. “Texas is trying to install bat condo structures where the furry friends can make a home,” said James Rogers, a wildlife biologist with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service. NRCS works with farmers, ranchers and forest landowners to implement conservation practices on the ground that have numerous environmental benefits, including ones that provide habitat and food for pollinators. For example, through the Farm Bill, landowners have an opportunity to receive financial assistance through conservation programs and practices, which can include planting cover crops and riparian buffers that target these beneficial pollinators. Bats’ survival depends on improved conservation practices to ensure they have healthy ecosystems to hang around in. Throughout the summer, wildlife biologists conduct nighttime surveys to learn more about the many bats that live in the Coconino National Forest. Scientists gather information about species, population, and habitat. This bat from the genus Myotis is having its wing examined.

"Leaf Litter Keeps Ground-Roosting Bats Warm  When winter weather arrives, most bats hibernate in caves, but a few species migrate to warmer areas. Warmer being relative, the migrating bats may still end up in places that are too cold for comfort, and sometimes hibernate under leaf litter for short periods of time. Roger Perry, a wildlife biologist at the U.S. Forest Service’s Southern Research Station, studied these temporary hibernation sites to find out how much protection they offered bats, and how much energy bats expend to stay alive.

"After the Fire - Wood Waste Put to Work  Biochar, or wood waste, is a porous carbon substance that results from burning wood in the absence of oxygen. It is typically created when burning chunks of wood are covered by ash, soil or a lid, which insulates the coals and starves them of oxygen. This fire remnant provides a valuable addition to soil for agriculture and gardening purposes as well as contributing to overall forest health.

"'Tis the Season to Talk Turkey  The Thanksgiving season is upon us, time for family homecomings, parades, and football games. More importantly, time for the annual turkey feast. As the marketing season hits full stride, the question on everyone’s lips this year is…will there be a shortage of turkeys? The simple answer is: no. To fully answer the question though, we have to go back to late March when commercial turkey flocks in the Upper Midwestern production region were overtaken by rapid outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). HPAI, while harmless to humans, is devastating to turkeys and within a few short weeks over 7.5 million commercial turkeys succumbed to the disease.  While the total loss represented just over three percent of the total number of birds raised in the U.S. in , the short time period during which losses occurred left the industry scrambling to cover their business needs.

"NRCS Project Liaison, USDA Northeast Climate Hub in  USDA Results  May 20,  Organic farmer on his computer accessing information regarding climate conditions. USDA photo All this month we will be taking a look at what a changing climate means to Agriculture. The ten regional USDA Climate Hubs were established to synthesize and translate climate science and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers that are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA's Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate. In the Northeast and Midwest U.S., a changing climate is expected to continue impacting agriculture for the foreseeable future.  From Minnesota to Maine and Maryland to Missouri, increasingly severe weather, variable temperatures, and at times droughty soil conditions are exacerbating the existing challenge of managing productive lands without degrading natural resources.  To help farmers adjust their practices or even transform their operations (“adapt”) to meet these challenges, the USDA Northeast, Midwest, and Northern Forests Climate Hubs collaborated to develop “Adaptation Resources for Agriculture,” a compilation of information about climate change considerations and responses.  Authors from the U.S. Forest Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the Agricultural Research Service teamed up to review climate change literature and develop easy to understand guidance for on-farm decision-making. “Adaptation Resources for Agriculture” includes a regional summary of climate change effects on agriculture, a compilation of adaptation strategies and approaches, and a workbook to identify farm specific response options leading to flexible adaptive actions.  The workbook is intended for use in a small workshop setting to enable farmer engagement in understanding how climate change impacts their enterprise and natural resources and how to respond for the benefit of current and future generations. Based upon the “Forest Adaptation Resources” developed by the U.S. Forest Service and Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science in and Adaptation Workbook demonstrations completed by hundreds of users across a wide variety of projects on public and private lands, “Adaptation Resources for Agriculture” has been developed specifically to meet the unique needs of agricultural producers.  Many climate science concepts apply to both agriculture and forestry anywhere in the nation, including sustaining the fundamental functions of soil and water resources, reducing the impacts of biological stressors or extreme weather, and managing the enterprise as part of a larger landscape. In each region, agricultural producers will experience different types and degrees of climate change effects depending on their site specific conditions and capacity to cope with impacts or to take advantage of opportunities.   For example, the Midwest and the Northeast have experienced a significant increase in extreme precipitation since the mid-’s resulting in delayed planting, increased soil erosion, loss of nutrients, flood damage, and resulting increases in expenses or decrease in yields.  Three examples of typical farms in the region highlighted in the publication: corn and soybean production in Iowa; beef grazing in Missouri; and confined dairy in Pennsylvania, demonstrate how an adaptation perspective helps farmers overcome ever increasing challenges of climate change, as well as take advantage of possible opportunities. The publication is intended to serve as a template for other regions to create adaptation strategies and approaches relevant to their expected climate change conditions and typical agricultural commodities.  It is currently under review and scheduled for public release later this year.   Several workshops are planned to introduce “Adaptation Resources for Agriculture” to educators, conservationists and producers, including a session at the Soil and Water Conservation Society annual conference in Louisville, KY in July and the National Small Farms Conference in Virginia in September. Whether you’re able to attend these workshops or not, you can discover more updates like this from the Northeast Climate Hub by signing-up for their newsletter and by following them on Twitter at @USDAClimateHubs.

"in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Feb 02,   Last week was an exciting week for America’s school lunchrooms.  Our new meal standards were announced and they will help improve the health of millions of children.  These new standards represent one of five major components of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of .  There’s more to come: The ability to take nutrition standards beyond the lunch line - for the first time ever, rules for foods and beverages sold in vending machines and other venues on school campuses will contribute to a healthy diet;  Increased funding for schools – an additional 6 cents a meal will be available -- the first real increase in 30 years – tied to strong performance in serving improved meals; Common-sense pricing standards for schools will ensure that revenues from non-Federal sources keep pace with the Federal commitment to healthy school meals and properly align with costs; and Training and technical assistance will help schools achieve and monitor compliance. Through the establishment of a new grant program, The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of will also allow the USDA to take a giant step forward in facilitating growth in farm to school programs, in which schools bring in locally produced food from neighboring farms.  The USDA Farm to School Team, an outgrowth of the  Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative, has been busy the last couple of years trying to figure out how Farm to School efforts can best contribute to improved health and well being of kids participating in school meals.  The Team has done great work and people can access the resources collected and follow their travels from the FNS website. This week, we took another important step as Deborah Kane  began work at the USDA as the National Director of USDA’s Farm to School Program.  Deborah Kane comes to USDA from Ecotrust in Portland, Oregon, where she founded and ran Food-Hub.org, a groundbreaking food hub connecting farmers and buyers, including schools, across the Northwest.  She was also recognized by the White House as a “Champion of Change” for her work in regional food system development. Deborah will work with the Secretary and me, along with leaders from the Agricultural Marketing Service, Food and Nutrition Service, and the USDA Farm to School Team to promote and expand our Farm to School efforts by implementing the provisions provided in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of , overseeing a new farm to school grant program, and continuing to find creative ways to increase schools’ access to local foods.  Deborah joins a great Team at USDA already at work on Farm to School and primed for even greater success.  USDA expects to enhance schools’ ability to work with regional producers, create economic opportunities for food producers of all kinds and empower schools to increase or augment programming that builds food literacy among the nation’s children.

"National Agricultural Statistics Service Public Affairs Specialist in  Research and Science  Mar 17,  The states that produce some of the most nutritious and most consumed commodities within each of the five food groups. Many people want to cultivate healthier eating habits and March, National Nutrition Month, may be a great time to start. USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service’s MyPlate website is a resource available to help get on (or back on) the nutrition track. MyPlate itself is divided into five major food groups – vegetables, fruits, grains, protein foods, and dairy and fortified soy alternatives. But do you ever wonder where your food comes from, and how much our hardworking farmers and ranchers produce in a year? Here are facts about some of America’s favorite, nutritious foods: According to USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS), the tomato is one of the most commonly eaten vegetables in the country. In , U.S. farmers produced 24.1 billion pounds of tomatoes with California producing more than 97%. Apples are also a big hit in the U.S.. In , our growers produced nearly 11 billion pounds, nearly 69% of which came from Washington state. The average yield from each of Washington’s 172,000 total apple bearing acres was 44,200 pounds! For , check out the Non-Citrus Fruits & Nuts Annual Report. Wheat, a health-promoting grain found in many foods, is one of our largest field crops. In , U.S. farmers produced 1.8 billion bushels of it, with North Dakota producing more than 17% of the total. For animal protein, according to ERS, chicken still tops the list in American diets. In , 58.3 billion pounds of chicken were produced in the U.S., more than 14% or 8.3 billion pounds in the top producing state of Georgia. New will be available on April 29 in the Poultry Production and Value Report. Finally, there is dairy. Versatile and packed with important nutrients, fluid beverage milk is one of the most consumed dairy products in the country. Americans consumed more than 46.4 billion pounds, or 5.4 billion gallons, of it last year alone. At the farm level (milk produced and used in all dairy products), U.S. farmers produced a whopping 223.2 billion pounds in ; California was the No. 1 milk producer with 41.3 billion pounds.

Heart-healthy pecans are the focus of a project in Georgia to help educate health-conscious consumers on the nutritional values of tree nuts. Photo by Judy Baxter. This Saturday is National Nut Day, a perfect opportunity to honor nature’s nutritional dynamo– the nut.  It seems that Americans are more than a little nutty about nuts, which are considered specialty crops.  Nearly one out of every 10 of us eats nuts, or a nut product, at least once a day.  Almonds, walnuts and pecans are the top three nuts consumed in the United States* and the production of almonds, walnuts and pistachios has more than doubled in the last decade. Tree nuts – which include almonds, walnuts, pecans, pistachios, hazelnuts, and macadamia nuts – are a great source of plant protein.  Several nuts play a role in preventing heart disease or lowering cholesterol.  Although they are high in calories, nuts are a fiber-rich, phytonutrient, antioxidant (i.e.-Vitamin E), highly portable food that can enhance dinner, compliment dessert or stand alone as a tasty snack. California is the country's leading producer of tree nuts. Nearly 90 percent of each year's tree nut production is harvested from the state's orchards, including almost all almonds, pistachios and walnuts. Together, Georgia, New Mexico and Texas produce 75 percent of the U.S. pecan crop.  U.S. tree nut production since the mid-s has generated, on average, nearly $4 billion in annual farm cash receipts, with almonds, walnuts, pistachios, and pecans accounting for most of the sales. Earlier this month, we announced the award of ates and its territories.  In one project, the Georgia Department of Agriculture will partner with the state’s Agricultural Commodity Commission for Pecans.  They will promote pecans and educate health-conscious consumers on the importance of its antioxidant and health benefits by placing heart healthy billboards in strategic locations throughout the state.  Their outreach efforts will also include two minutes of pecan in-flight video on all Delta flights in November. In California, the Department of Food and Agriculture will partner with the Center for Produce Safety at the University of California to develop and implement new strategies for preventing salmonella contamination in almonds and pistachios.  The science-based strategies will focus on the transfer of the microbial dust and contaminants carrying salmonella from livestock farms and ranches to nearby almond and pistachio orchards.  They’ll also take a look at the contaminants found in places that handle almond and pistachio shelling/hulling. These projects along with several others will help strengthen the market for specialty crops, such as fruits, vegetables, dried fruits, horticulture and nursery crops, including floriculture, and tree nuts.  Find out what projects were funded in your area.

"Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  May 17,  ARS testing demonstrates the efficacy of DEET—used on the left hand—in repelling mosquitoes. For over 75 years, USDA scientists have been developing ways to protect the U.S. military around the world from powerful adversaries—mosquitoes and other biting arthropods that cause disease. Their work began in in a small USDA field laboratory in Orlando, where scientists made key discoveries about new chemicals for controlling these pests. At the time, the most effective repellents lasted only 2 hours, and the U.S. military needed a repellent that could protect for 10 hours. In , testing in Orlando confirmed DEET was an effective repellent; it was soon adopted for use by the U.S. Army, became commercially available by —and is still used widely today. Scientists at the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), USDA’s chief in-house research agency, have continued their search for better repellents ever since. They used the USDA database of 30,000 compounds to develop a model that used chemical structure for predicting how long a repellent would keep pests away. This model predicted that some compounds would be more effective than DEET, and subsequent research confirmed some compounds did indeed repel pests more than three times longer than DEET. In , the Department of Defense initiated a partnership with USDA and others as part of the Deployed War-Fighter Protection (DWFP) program. Its' mission: to develop and test management tools for pest and vector species that transmit diseases to deployed U.S. troops. ARS scientists in Gainesville, Florida; Beltsville, Maryland; and Oxford, Mississippi, have contributed discoveries about repellent as part of the DWFP research and accomplishments. ARS has also collaborated with the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Systems Center since to optimize the arthropod bite protection of factory-produced permethrin-treated uniforms. Treating uniforms became standard practice in the s, first with a miticide, and starting in with permethrin. ARS National Program Leader Uli Bernier has been responsible for developing protocols to evaluate uniform protection against mosquitoes, and in conducted a study that led to the registration of etofenprox as an alternative clothing repellent. He recently staffed an ARS information table at the 5th USA Science & Engineering Festival Expo, where he said visitors wanted to learn more about a new pest-resistant tropical lightweight uniform on display. Visitors were also fascinated by a cage of mosquitoes used for research—but unlike USDA researchers, they were reluctant to place their hand in a cage full of mosquitoes!

I was privileged to go to the State of Mississippi on Dec. 9, for a HealthierUS School Challenge event.  Actually, I was there for three events and 11 schools received either USDA’s Gold of Distinction Awards or Gold Awards.  One of the six schools that was recognized for the Gold of Distinction Award was Purvis High School in Purvis, Miss.  This school is actually the first high school in the country to win this award and counting the other five Gold of Distinction award winners; these six schools are the first in Mississippi to be recognized for this particular award. Certainly nutrition staff, along with parents, teachers and students, have played a huge role in Lamar County School District’s success. The Child Nutrition Department for the district has a centralized menu providing daily:  four entrees, chef or specialty salads, three to four fruit and vegetable choices, and whole grain bread and croutons baked daily.  An annual PTO Academy is conducted keeping parents and faculty abreast of wellness policy regulations and fresh ideas on healthier snacks and fundraising. In addition, some of the schools have their own gardens. Some require walking a few laps around the track or field before starting free play at recess.  The Child Nutrition Staff has a lot of training every year in food preparation and presentation, and whole grain breads are baked from scratch daily at all of the schools. I think you can readily see why Lamar County School District is an outstanding organization that encourages wellness.  So many of its schools are providing an excellent nutrition environment and exercise opportunities for their students.  I was encouraged by what I saw and I hope many more schools will follow Lamar County School District’s example.      USDA’s HealthierUS School Challenge recognizes schools that create and maintain healthy school environments by promoting good nutrition and physical activity.  It’s a key component of First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! campaign to end childhood obesity within a generation.

"Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 01,  The adult periodical cicada emerges from its 17-year nymph stage, molts and arises as a winged adult. This spring will see the return of the large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. (U.S. Forest Service photo/ Bob Rabaglia) The buzz this spring has started, and some people may think it’s fodder for a new sci-fi movie. But this year’s spring brings a drama closer to home than you think - the pending emergence of brood II of the periodical cicada. Cicadas are large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. As the male cicadas sing their intense mating songs, some brand it as the sound of summer. “Annual cicadas, known as dog-day cicadas in the U.S., are found throughout the world,” said Sandy Liebhold, a research entomologist with the U.S Forest Service’s Northern Research Station. “But the periodical cicadas emerge in massive groups known as “broods” once every 13 or 17 years and are completely unique to North America.” There are 15 brood cycles, each designated by roman numerals. In the U.S., brood II is on track to crawl out of the ground very soon after a 17-year hiatus. They’ll emerge into one of the most densely populated urban/suburban forests in the world. The mass emergence of brood II into the state and private forests of the tri-state area of eastern Connecticut, upstate New York, and northern New Jersey will sound a bit different than the familiar dog-day cicadas. Male cicadas use a special membrane to echo a series of clicks through its abdomen to attract females for reproduction. In chorus, the brood may sound like an insect-sized fleet of jets preparing for lift off, but the sound should be enjoyed as a wonderful spectacle of the mating ritual in the animal world. Once mated, females will lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind, known in the scientific world as oviposition injury, can be quite striking and lead to “flagging” -- the dieback of small limbs. Forest health aerial surveys conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation reported more than 8,700 acres with flagging left behind from the brood XIV emergence on Cape Cod in . The scarring is mostly superficial but can have a mild impact on the growth of individual host trees. However, the mass emergence can benefit the longer, overall health of eastern forests. After mating and laying eggs, adult cicadas die and fall to the forest floor. The nutrients released from the mass decay of the brood create a jolt of healthy nutrients available to forest organisms. Researchers have shown that this pulse of nutrition leads to an increase of beneficial microbes and nitrogen in soil, increased tree growth and more robust wildflowers. Finally, after three to four weeks, the eggs hatch, the larvae wander under the forest floor where they feed on roots and start the process over again. So, why every 13 to 17 years? Scientists have been pondering this ecological phenomenon for centuries. “There is no doubt that by simultaneously emerging at those long intervals, periodical cicadas are able to saturate predators thereby maintaining high population levels,” said Liebhold. Recent research also hypothesizes that periodical cicadas emerge when predator birds are at a lower density, suggesting that these amazing insects have queued into a larger ecological cycle – wow! This is what we know but there is still a lot of mystery surrounding these time-travelling bugs. So if you find yourself one of the lucky ones to experience their visit, just sit back and enjoy this remarkable wonder of eastern forests. Michael Bohne is an entomologist and forest health group leader with the U.S. Forest Service in Durham, N.H. After mating, female cicadas lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind can lead to the dieback of small limbs called flagging. Such was the case for these bur oak trees in central Iowa in after a brood emergence of the 17-year cicada.

"USDA Food and Nutrition Service, Midwest Region in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Feb 08,  First graders at E. J. Brown Elementary School in Dayton, Ohio, eat cauliflower with lowfat ranch dip, as part of their school’s Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. According to school nurse Virginia Noe, the students “gobbled up” the cauliflower, with and without the dip. Recently, an interesting letter came across my desk. The letter was from an Ohio school nurse who wanted USDA to know that students at E. J. Brown Elementary School in Dayton, Ohio, LOVE their USDA-funded Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), now in its second year.  And that makes E.J. Brown’s school nurse Virginia Noe, who wrote the letter, a huge fan of the program and its many positive effects on student eating behavior, health and learning.  Noe shared her thoughts in the enthusiastic and heartfelt letter. “The positive response of our student body, staff and parents has been overwhelming. Many tasted pears, plums, jicama and spinach for the first time. Students learned that not all apples are red!” said Virginia. Besides expanding their healthy food options, the students researched where produce is grown and, with the help of school staff, started a school garden. As with some other urban districts, many E. J. Brown students have limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables. Thus, they highly value the program and are eager to see what produce is being served each day. Noe that students who were at first hesitant to try new varieties gradually became more adventuresome. And when their first year’s funding ended in March of last year, the students’ disappointment was “palpable.” One parent said, “I would rather they ran out of money for field trips than the fruits and vegetables,” adding, “No more canned pineapple for us because the fresh tastes so much better.” E.J. Brown is one of 20 schools in Dayton and 111 in the state of Ohio to receive a Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program grant this school year. Noe is grateful that the school received FFVP funding for a second year. She believes the FFVP is money well spent, as it positively affects the entire student body. “As our country struggles to fight childhood obesity, the impact of learning about and experiencing healthy snacks can be lifelong.” She notes that the FFVP is aligned with key national health and wellness initiatives, including Healthy People /, school wellness mandates, and the First Lady Michelle Obama’s Lets Move! initiative.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Apr 17,  A Conservation Innovation Grant recipient accepts award from the U.S. Water Alliance. Photo courtesy NRCS. When USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded a Conservation Innovation Grant to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in , the notion of administering the nation’s largest water quality trading program in the Ohio River Basin was a twinkle in the eye of EPRI scientist Jessica Fox. Fast forward to —the multi-state water-trading program is a reality, and the Institute was one of three entities to be awarded this year’s Water Prize by the U.S. Water Alliance. Through Conservation Innovation Grants, NRCS funds projects that develop innovative approaches and technologies for natural resource conservation on agricultural lands. These grants have funded more than 60 environmental markets projects, including a number of the nation’s leading market efforts. EPRI’s program, launched when the states of Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana signed a multi-state compact in , works with agricultural producers who voluntarily implement conservation practices that reduce nutrient runoff into local waters. Through the program’s first trades in March , three energy companies purchased these credits and retired them for associated nutrient and ecosystem benefits. On April 13, In front of a crowded auditorium at the National Geographic Society in Washington, DC, Former EPA Deputy Administrator Bob Perciasepe awarded the prize to Fox who accepted on behalf of EPRI. Perciasepe expressed admiration for EPRI’s ability to innovate and engage stakeholders from Duke Energy to the Ohio Farm Bureau, and everyone in between. In her award acceptance remarks, Fox noted that part of the project’s success is that EPRI was never satisfied with developing the nation’s largest water quality trading program, or executing the first trades. “We are always pushing and striving, looking forward to the next chapter.” The next chapter for the Institute begins on May 20 when it holds a public auction for nutrient credits in New York City. These credits were generated through the installation of cover crops, livestock fencing and other conservation practices on 30 farms last summer.

"Looking Back While Preparing to Move Forward with Summer Meals  This week is National Summer Food Service Program Kickoff Week, an important time to emphasize USDA’s commitment to ensure children and teens have access to safe, nutritious meals when school lets out. Through the Summer Food Service Program, federal assistance is provided for state agencies and non-profit sponsors to help children in eligible high-need areas get the proper nutrition they need during the summer when schools are not in session. Thanks to the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act, students across the country are getting healthier school meals with more whole grains, fruits and vegetables, lean protein and low-fat dairy, as well as less sugar, fat, and sodium.  With more than 90 percent of schools meeting the healthy meal standards, children are getting the nutrition needed to reach their full potential. But poor nutrition during the summer months can also affect children’s academic performance during the school year.  USDA’s summer feeding programs help children get the nourishing food they need all year long so they come back to school in the fall ready to learn.

"Program Analyst, AMS National Organic Program in  Farming  Initiatives  Oct 07,  Before coming to the USDA National Organic Program (NOP), Laura Gallagher worked on farms and with community gardening organizations in the Midwest and Northeast providing training and education. Now Laura helps NOP manage the Organic Integrity Learning Center (OILC) and the Human Capital Capacity Building Initiative to help build the future of the organic workforce. The Learning Center is free, open to all, and offers courses on critical organic oversight skills. More than 5,850 people have signed up and taken one or more of the 22 full-length courses and eight microlearning courses available. The microlearning courses are new, and Laura highlighted these bite-sized courses as especially helpful for busy certifiers and inspectors, saying: “We designed microlearning for quick, on-the-go training that can cover key aspects of a topic in about 10 to 15 minutes.” Certifiers and inspectors can also use microlearning to supplement formal training, as a resource for new staff and as a refresher on NOP processes and oversight tools. Laura says, “There are more coming. Any time our accreditation managers get frequent questions on a particular part of the organic regulations or certifiers are unsure about how to follow a process, that topic is added to the microlearning agenda.” Like a lot of the NOP team, Laura has a passion for growing things and sharing the results.

USDA photo. “Water conservation begins where the first drop of rain falls…most likely on private working lands.” This is a favorite saying of Tom Vandivier, a Texas cattle rancher and recipient of the Sand County Foundation’s Leopold Conservation Award (LCA). Tom was one of more than two dozen recipients of the LCA – which recognized landowners for achievement in environmental improvement on agricultural land – in Washington, D.C. last week.  I was fortunate to meet with them here at USDA headquarters to talk about the importance of conservation and the need to spread the message that investing in conservation practices on our farm and ranch lands not only protects water, air and wildlife – it also makes economic sense. Jill Giacomini Basch is a LCA recipient who, with her father and three sisters, owns a family dairy in Marin County, Calif.  I had a chance to meet with the Giacomini family during my tour of several California farms last month. Jill explained that conservation improves the way they run their business. Partnerships with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and others have helped them protect their land and water resources, and ensure their dairy will be prosperous for the next generation. “We have very close ties with NRCS and other programs,” Jill said. “They have helped us with our water allocation -- above ground storage pond facilities and spring well drilling.  With the USDA we were able to utilize new technology to install a methane digester to help mitigate waste run off into the nearby lagoon, but also eventually the Point Reyes National Seashore.  Because of the methane digester, we generate about 65 percent of our on farm energy needs.” “Much of the work we’ve done has been through NRCS programs,” Tom added. “NRCS is very important to us.  We’re very much about conservation. The stewardship practices that we’ve accomplished on our property have enhanced water resources in the state of Texas.  I think it’s a message that needs to be spread so others can take similar stewardship practices and hopefully have the same results in their perspective states.” Jon Bednarski, LCA recipient, shared his story as well.  He started farming 12 years ago outside of Louisville, Ky.  After meeting with NRCS, he discovered he was farming a “sensitive” piece of land, upstream of Louisville’s drinking water source. Since then he has managed his operation to help protect water quality. The group discussed the need for conservation in the face of extreme weather – including the significant drought conditions in 11 western states.  As we were meeting, the U.S. Senate was in the process of voting on the Agricultural Act of . I talked about how important this legislation is to providing the tools and programs necessary for USDA to help farmers, ranchers and forestland owners manage the risk and uncertainty associated with extreme weather and climate change.  Conservation programs will be streamlined to better target limited resources to areas of highest need, while building on record conservation and stewardship efforts already underway.  I also previewed Secretary Tom Vilsack’s announcement of USDA’s new regional hubs to help agriculture and forestry mitigate the impacts of a changing climate. The group also discussed the importance of passing on to the next generation the passion for agriculture and land stewardship.  There is a new energy in America around opportunities in agriculture. The Agricultural Act of will provide our communities with additional support to attract new economic opportunity and create jobs.  We all agreed that outreach and education is crucial.  USDA will continue to work with the LCA recipients and other partners to make that happen.  To view a video about the meeting click here.

The second annual South Dakota Local Foods Conference was held recently to continue the dialogue on local foods among producers, consumers, farmer’s markets, retailers, schools and others.  The conference provided attendees from across the state two days of breakout sessions, networking, and instruction. USDA Rural Development State Director, Elsie Meeks attended the conference, taking the opportunity to award South Dakota State University (SDSU) Extension a Rural Business Opportunity Grant of $50,000.  The Rural Development funds will be used to build capacity in South Dakota’s local food system through the establishment of an online Local Foods Center which will create structured connections between local growers and resource providers. “The online Local Foods Center and Local Foods conference are examples of how USDA Rural Development is dedicated to supporting economic growth in rural areas.  It has been a USDA-wide focus to provide resources and support to American farmers and ranchers,” said Meeks.  “Supporting local and regional food systems provides an economic boost to rural communities in South Dakota.” An example of locally produced food served to attendees at the South Dakota Local Foods Conference. The first day of the conference focused on production of specialty crops with sessions on herbicide drift, marketing of food, insect pest management and winemaking. The second day of the conference began with Diana Endicott, founder and director of Good Natured Family Farms' Alliance in Kansas. Endicott gave an overview of the Alliance's collaboration model with a supermarket chain, highlighting aspects of the system, including production, processing, distribution and marketing strategies. Other topics at the Local Foods Conference included fruit and vegetable consumption; regulations facing specialty crop producers; business planning; Farm to School; social media; farmers' markets; local foods on Native American reservations; and preservation of specialty foods. Attendees enjoyed locally grown foods provided at the breaks and luncheon. “Consumers in South Dakota want to know where their food comes from. We've found that producers are excited to share their food and their story with their customers,” said Alison Kiesz of the South Dakota Department of Agriculture. “This conference was a great way to bring everyone together to promote local foods in South Dakota.” The conference was a collaborative effort of the South Dakota Department of Agriculture, SDSU Extension Service, USDA Rural Development, Dakota Rural Action, Buy Fresh Buy Local South Dakota and the South Dakota Specialty Producers Association.

"USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Nov 19,   Uh, oh! Thanksgiving is right around the corner. You bought a turkey on sale last year and froze it. You know it’s safe because you recently read that frozen turkeys are safe indefinitely and keep good quality for a year. But what you don’t know is how or when to thaw it. First of all, turkey should never be thawed on the counter or in hot water. These methods are NOT considered safe and may lead to foodborne illness. Also, never thaw a turkey in a garage, basement, car, on the kitchen counter, outdoors or on the porch. Turkey, as any perishable food, must be kept at a safe temperature during ""the big thaw."" If not, once the turkey begins to thaw and becomes warmer than 40 °F, bacteria present before freezing can begin to multiply. Even though the center of the bird may still be frozen as it thaws on the counter, the outer layer of the turkey could be in the ""Danger Zone,"" between 40 and 140 °F — temperatures where bacteria multiply rapidly. Now that you know how NOT to thaw, let’s talk about the safe ways to thaw a turkey. Refrigerator Thawing Plan ahead. A frozen turkey will require at least 24 hours for every 5 pounds of weight. After thawing in the refrigerator, a turkey should remain safe and good quality for an additional day or two before cooking. A bird thawed in the refrigerator can be refrozen without cooking, although there may be some loss of quality. Cold Water Thawing This method is faster than refrigerator thawing but requires more attention. The turkey must be kept in its original package to keep bacteria from the air or surrounding environment from being introduced and to keep the turkey from absorbing water. The turkey should be submerged in cold tap water, changing the water every 30 minutes so it continues to thaw. It should take about 30 minutes per pound to thaw. Once thawed by the cold water method, cook your turkey immediately. Check out the Turkey Thawing Chart for proper timing. Microwave Thawing After thawing turkey in a microwave oven, cook immediately because some areas of the food may become warm and begin to cook during the thawing process (bringing the food to ""Danger Zone"" temperatures). Holding partially cooked food is not recommended because any bacteria present wouldn't have been destroyed and the food may have reached optimal temperatures for bacteria to grow.

"El Super Bowl, las Ollas de Cocción Lenta, e Inocuidad Alimentaria: Un Equipo Invencible  Por la mayoría del año, mi olla de cocción lenta se queda guardada en un anaquel en mi cocina. Pero, cuando se acerca el día del Super Bowl, la saco y empiezo a cocinar chili con carne, albóndigas u otras comidas calientes de fiesta. Lo que me más gusta de mi olla es que puede cocinar los alimentos inocuamente y a la misma vez me permite ahorrar tiempo cuando me ocupo preparándome para el gran juego. Durante esta época del año, La Línea de Carnes y Aves del USDA recibe muchas preguntas acerca de las ollas de cocción lenta.

"i-Tree Project Leader, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Mar 09,   My team at the U.S. Forest Service Northern Research Station recently completed a study of the District of Columbia’s urban forest using the publicly available, free iTree software suite. Understanding an urban forest's structure, function and value can promote management decisions that will improve human health and environmental quality. Urban trees clean our air, capture stormwater and provide huge energy savings. These tremendously important forests are composed of a mix of native and exotic tree species. In Washington, about 70% of the trees are from species native to North America, while 1% is native to the state or district. Species exotic to the District of Columbia make up 30 percent of the population. Most exotic tree species have an origin from Asia .  This urban forest removes an estimated 492 tons of air pollution per year with an associated value of $2.30 million, and reduces energy-related costs from residential buildings by $3.45 million annually. This study gives us a better understanding of the real value trees bring to our nation’s capital. But the benefits don’t stop there – urban trees across the U.S. are working for us every day. Key findings of our Washington, D.C., study • Number of trees: 2,584,000 • Tree cover: 28.1% • Most common species: American beech, Callery pear, Tulip tree • Percentage of trees less than 6"" diameter: 62.6% • Pollution removal: 492 tons/year ($2.30 million/year) • Carbon storage: 596,000 tons ($12.3 million) • Carbon sequestration: 19,000 tons/year ($393 thousand/year) • Building energy savings: $3.45 million / year • Avoided carbon emissions: $129 thousand / year • Structural values: $3.99 billion U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell will unveil i-Tree v.4 tomorrow in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia.

"Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 30,   Today, USDA proposed the establishment of minimum national professional standards and training requirements for school nutrition professionals who manage and operate the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. The standards, another key provision of the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of (HHFKA), aim to institute education and certification standards for school nutrition professionals. These new standards will ensure that school nutrition personnel have the training and tools they need to plan, prepare and purchase healthy products to create nutritious, safe and enjoyable school meals. As a former school nutrition director I can tell you that school nutrition professionals across the country are pleased with the new meal patterns established by the HHFKA, which requires schools to prepare healthier meals for 32 million children each day. Schools are at the forefront of national efforts to improve nutrition and reduce obesity in our Nation’s children. Since the start of the - School Year, I have visited dozens of schools and witnessed students embracing healthier meal options as schools successfully implement the latest lunch, breakfast and snack standards.  In fact, our most our most recent show that roughly 90 percent of schools are reporting that they are meeting the new standards, a 12 percent increase from June . Many school nutrition professionals already complete annual training that is similar to what we are recommending; for others, the standards will be new. These proposed standards will ensure that all school nutrition professionals meet the same national requirements as they prepare healthy meals served in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. The professional standards proposed by USDA will focus on training opportunities and strengthen the school nutrition profession. This proposal would: Create minimum hiring standards for school food authority directors based on a school district’s size; Establish minimum hiring standards for State directors of school nutrition and State distributing agencies; and Require minimum annual training for all new and current school nutrition professionals. School nutrition professionals, educators, and members of the nutrition community from around the country have voiced their support for strengthening school meals programs by setting professional standards. We received a tremendous amount of feedback from State agencies, school districts, and several professional associations as we developed the proposed standards; we now look forward to receiving additional comments that may help us fine tune these standards to ensure the greatest benefit. USDA is committed to working closely with school nutrition directors, managers and staff to meet the proposed requirements once they are in place. Our Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) will continue collaborating with partners to identify free and low-cost training at locations that are convenient and easily accessible. FNS will also be working with our partners to develop an easily accessible national database that will list available trainings by State. As our nation continues to fight childhood obesity, we commend our schools for making so much progress in offering healthier options during the school day.  Many of our kids spend the majority of their waking hours each day in school, and consume half their daily calories from school meals. By enhancing school nutrition careers, we are giving our hard-working and caring professionals the tools and training needed to create a healthy school environment where our children are healthy, engaged, and productive learners. The school nutrition community has expressed their support for establishing professional standards. Click to enlarge.

"in  Initiatives  Feb 24,   This week young people across the country are celebrating FFA Week.  During this time, members of Future Farmers of America (FFA) get a chance to educate the public about agriculture, but also to learn more about the industry themselves. In January, in his State of the Union address, President Obama focused on the importance of providing a world-class education to all American youth.  He called on us to out-educate our global competitors so that we keep great jobs here and strengthen the American economy in the long-term. FFA is playing an important role in providing that education for hundreds of thousands of America’s young people. FFA is providing opportunities for young people to learn about food and agriculture, to help them become community leaders, and to prepare them to compete for the jobs of the 21st century.  It is teaching younger generations how to make informed choices in agriculture and natural resources systems – a skill set that will grow our next generation of farmers. It is preparing students for successful careers in agriculture that stimulate the economy and supply our nation with food, feed and fiber we rely on. I am proud to say that in addition to FFA, and other youth organizations like 4H, USDA supports universities that are training the next generation of innovators.  America has an aging farming population, and as the folks running our farm lands grow older, we look toward the future for a group that is ready and able to take over this important sector of the American economy. Last month I visited with FFA to talk to the students that comprise this year’s National FFA Officer Team. I challenged them to spend time with their friends and other FFA members to think about what they envision for the future of agriculture.  I told them that USDA was committed to continuing our work in educating the next generation of producers and agricultural professionals.  And I signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to deepen USDA’s involvement with FFA and to supplement its important mission. At the end of the day, we need to cultivate a community of young people who pursue a future in agriculture so together we can revitalize not only rural America, but the country as a whole. Today’s students must become tomorrow’s farmers, ranchers, growers, scientists and agriculturalists.  These folks will guarantee us a safe and affordable food supply, and preserve our land for generations.  It is for these reasons that groups such as FFA are integral to our success as a nation.

USDA photo. As part of Bird Health Awareness Week, USDA recently hosted a webinar on “Growing Chicks into Healthy Chickens.”  Dr. Martin Smeltzer, Andy Schneider (aka the “Chicken Whisperer”) and Dr. Claudia Dunkley spent an hour helping backyard bird owners learn more about keeping their flocks healthy.  Around 300 people participated in the webinar, most of who are just getting started with backyard birds. The goal of Bird Health Awareness Week is to help protect backyard birds from disease. The webinar focused on the cute little baby birds known as chicks. Now, I am not a poultry person, but I love eggs, so I thought this would be something interesting to learn.  I found out that raising backyard poultry is a growing trend.  People like to raise chicks into adults for their eggs, and for the entertainment value of having birds in their backyard. I didn’t know there were so many rules when it comes to starting a flock. You need to think about why you want to raise backyard birds and what you intend to do with them.  You also need to find out if it is legal where you live - check city and local ordinances and find out if you need a permit.  If you have one, you should also check with your Homeowners Association.   Look to see if inspections or other steps are to start a flock, and be sure to buy chicks from a National Poultry Improvement Plan- approved source to ensure they start out healthy. I was surprised to find out that young chicks must be separated from older birds, for them to be secure and safe from disease.  Let chicks grow into birds in a separate, clean environment before introducing them into your flock that contains older birds. There are two major diseases that can threaten backyard birds - Avian Influenza and Exotic Newcastle Disease. The webinar discussed six simple steps to help protect your birds from disease.  We also learned what potential signs of illness might include and what to do if you think your birds might be sick. Are you considering raising birds or want some tips for adding to your current flock?  The full webinar is available online, including nutrition tips and other information to help you grow a healthy and happy flock in your own backyard!

As USDA Director of Tribal Relations, I want to particularly note the historic appointment of the first tribal citizen of which we are aware to serve on a DGA advisory committee, Dr. Valarie Blue Bird Jernigan, a member of the Choctaw tribe. Dr. Blue Bird Jernigan’s extensive qualifications include a doctorate and master’s public health and serving as executive director of the Center for Indigenous Health Research and Policy at Oklahoma State University, where she is a professor of Rural Health. In addition to the DGAs, USDA is committed to providing technical assistance and removing barriers to serving traditional foods in our food and nutrition programs, as part of our Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative. This work is part of the Biden-Harris administration’s commitment to recognizing Indigenous Knowledge in federal policy, research, and decision-making processes. USDA looks forward to working with this diverse committee and listening and learning from the unique expertise and perspective of Dr. Blue Bird Jernigan.

"Turkey Tips Step 2: Preparing Your Feast  Preparing for Thanksgiving can become hectic. On Tuesday we tried to make your trip to the grocery store a little easier, by explaining the labels you’ll find on turkeys for sale. Now that you have your bird, you’re probably thinking about putting your game face on and getting that meal ready. In between trying to convince your 21-year-old nephew to sit at the kid’s table (because there’s no room at the adult table) and figuring out how you’ll answer your relatives’ questions about where your current relationship is going, we want to help you prepare your meal. With such thoughts possibly running through your head, proper food safety practices are sometimes treated like pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving: always but too often ignored and overshadowed.  Chris Bernstein, Food Safety Education Staff, Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA  Posted in  Health and Safety  Nov 20,   2 Responses",What are some common labels found on turkeys for sale that can help consumers prepare their Thanksgiving meal safely?,"Air-chilled turkeys are processed using air rather than water, which results in a slightly lower risk of contamination. 2. ""Hormone-free"" or ""No Added Hormones"": These labels mean the turkey didn't receive added hormones to promote growth. 3. ""No antibiotics"", ""Raised Without Antibiotics"", ""Free-range"", ""pasture-raised"", and ""organic"": While these terms may help you feel good about your meal choice, they don't necessarily ensure greater food safety than conventionally raised turkeys.

"USDA Office of Communications with assistance from Joan Messina, USDA Illinois Public Information Coordinator in  USDA Results  Food and Nutrition  Feb 10,   Earlier this month, Deputy Agriculture Secretary Kathleen Merrigan announced almost 300 Value Added Producer Grant recipients across the Nation.  Each one of those recipients has a story, and a dream that, with help from USDA, will become reality. From producing pumpkin puree and gourmet cheese to expanding a caviar production operation in Idaho (Yes, Idaho), Rural Americans are using these matching grants to grow their businesses and bring high quality products to market. Using funding provided through the USDA Value Added Producer Grant program, an Idaho producer will expand sales of gourmet caviar. Photo by Ashley Smith, Times-News staff photographer, used with permission. The Deputy Secretary made the announcement in Illinois: home to four of this year’s recipients. Living Water Farms, Inc. is a three-year-old family-owned company that focuses on the production of hydroponic greens for specialty markets in the Midwest.  Located in Strawn, two hours south of Chicago’s Loop, three generations of the Kilgus family are part of a group called Stewards of the Land which was organized to market produce from small farms.  The hydroponic complex was developed to consider year-round sales. Living Water Farms applied for a VAPG to expand the market for their greens.  Their current market includes Illinois supermarkets, high-end restaurants in Chicago and St. Louis and a Midwest college food service program. The grant will help them evaluate their brand and expand their distribution to other restaurants, specialty retail and institutional outlets. Another grant went to Justin Kilgus, who, along with his brother Trent, started raising meat goats as a 4-H project in on their parents’ farm.  The VAPG grant will be used for two purposes: to create a 10-year business plan, and to identify additional local markets for fully dressed, fresh goat meat cuts.  They currently sell their products to a number of up-scale restaurants. For seven generations, the Marcoot family has milked Jersey cows in Southern Illinois and has gained a national reputation for dairy excellence.  In , they built a small farmstead Creamery on the farm where they process all of their milk into Jersey-based artisan cheeses.  The new Creamery features a cheese-make room, a second processing room, an aging cellar and an on-farm retail store.  The dairy now uses the milk produced solely by their cows for 12 cheese varieties requiring three distinct processes.  The farm will use its grant to expand sales and markets by producing a range of small batch, artisan cheeses exclusively from their milk to meet the needs of the local marketplace and its consumers. Lime Rock Brown Swiss Cheese, LLC uses its Grade A Brown Swiss milk to make a variety of high quality cheeses for local market sale.  Brown Swiss milk, with its higher protein and fat component, makes excellent specialty cheeses because of its silky, smooth texture and rich flavor.  Lime Rock will use its grant for working capital to expand markets and customer base for the on-farm cheese produced from Grade A Brown Swiss milk.

"USDA Minnesota Public Information Officer in  Energy  Rural  Apr 22,   The use of biofuels needs to expand throughout all of the United States. That’s what Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told an audience of about 50 producers, stakeholders and agency leaders during a renewable energy roundtable discussion at CHS Inc. in Inver Grove Heights, Minn. on Wednesday. Vilsack was joined by Gov. Mark Dayton and Sen. Amy Klobuchar at the event. Vilsack shared how USDA Rural Development’s Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) helps reduce America’s dependence on foreign oil. He also highlighted how a new provision in the program finances the installation of flex fuel pumps at convenience stores and fuel filling facilities throughout rural America. Vilsack said that America faces many challenges because of its heavy dependence on foreign oil. He also highlighted President Obama’s goal of reducing the country’s foreign oil dependence by one-third. The new flex fuel provision in the REAP program is another step in reaching that goal. “We need to keep working to get more E-85 pumps more conveniently located,” Vilsack said. Partnership and collaboration also will help us reach the President’s goal, Vilsack said. The USDA is working with several organizations, including the Department of Energy, to advance the biofuels industry in the United States. Increasing the flow of private capital and improving farmers’ bottom lines is another factor that will help move the renewable fuels industry forward. Vilsack said it is essential that the USDA continue to provide loan guarantee programs to farmers and engage private industry to invest in biofuels initiatives. “The future of biofuels is unlimited,” Vilsack said. “There are a lot of opportunities in this country.” Vilsack concluded the discussion by reminding attendees that investing in renewable fuels and America’s farmers will not be possible if we let our rural infrastructure decline. Healthcare facilities, schools, broadband Internet, business development and wastewater treatment help build strong rural communities that support agriculture, create jobs and advance the use of renewable fuels.

"Civil Engineer, NRCS Massachusetts in  Conservation  Oct 12,  NRCS Massachusetts civil engineer Jim Lyons oversees operations at the Nichols Dam. Just before Tropical Storm Irene hit Massachusetts, employees of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), including me, were informed of the storm’s potential impact on a dam rehabilitation project that was underway in Westborough, Mass., a suburban community west of Boston. At the time, NRCS was working to widen the auxiliary spillway at the George H. Nichols Dam, a flood retention structure owned by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). This project was made possible with nearly $2 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of (the Recovery Act) funds. The Recovery Act was created by the Obama Administration to boost the nation’s economy, in part by developing and improving infrastructure like dams. A spillway acts like a safety valve to prevent water from flowing over the top of the dam in a storm, which can damage the dam and compromise its structural integrity. With the new spillway excavated, the dam was in danger of breaching if the eight inches of rain that were forecast for the following 12 hours actually occurred. The potential for major flooding and property damage was significant. I immediately contacted the contractor and asked that they begin preparations for the storm, including the construction of an earthen berm in the new auxiliary spillway to protect the dam from breaching. I also called the city’s Conservation Commission for permission to lower the water level in the reservoir to increase its capacity. On Saturday, the day of the storm, my work began at 4 a.m. I coordinated with local emergency management officials and state dam safety personnel, and ensured that the contractor completed the work. Contractors consult with federal, state and local officials on preparations to help the Nichols Dam weather Tropical Storm Irene The rain started at 1 p.m.; construction continued until 9 p.m. I went home at 11 that night. By 3 a.m. I was back on site to monitor precipitation and the impoundment level. I left to get some sleep but was back again by 6 a.m. By this time, the rain and wind intensity had increased. Throughout the morning, I measured precipitation and reservoir levels and forwarded the to engineering consultants who were revising various mathematical models of potential flood impact based on the forecasted rainfall. Ultimately, the reservoir crested at 2 inches below the existing auxiliary spillway. By the time Irene was done with us, many trees were down and most of the area was without power, including the construction trailer. The weekend was certainly long and exhausting, but it was rewarding, too: the dam weathered the storm with only minor damage. Learn more about NRCS Recovery Act Programs.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service in  Health and Safety  Dec 23,  The USDA National Agricultural Library’s Agricultural Law Information Partnership website is a resource to help people find information relating to agricultural law. (Illustration credit: Jody Shuart, ARS). Success in any part of agriculture today means being able to successfully navigate local, state and federal laws and regulations — from water rights to food safety regulations, from crop insurance to organic certification. To help people find such legal information, the National Agricultural Library (NAL) has recently developed the Agricultural Law Information Partnership website. This partnership is a collaboration between NAL, the National Agricultural Law Center at the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture (NALC), and the Center for Agriculture and Food Systems (CAFS) at the Vermont Law School. For each subject area, the Agricultural Law Information Partnership website provides an overview and a portal to a wide range of resources for farmers, producers, consumers, researchers and legal professionals. The initial topics include animal welfare, organic food, food production and sales regulations, new farmer, veterans farming, and water quality and quantity laws. More areas will be added as new material becomes available. While users cannot consider the information on the website to be legal advice, all content is reviewed before it is added by law librarian Kirstin Nelson, who coordinates the new program for NAL. The partnership not only gathers links to legal resources but also funds research projects that fill gaps in available information and the development of new tools. The first two of these are already completed and available online: the National Gleaning Project and the Farmland Tenure Resource Project, both initiatives of the Center for Agriculture and Food Systems. Information about the U.S. Farm Bill and other resources can be found on the USDA National Agricultural Library’s new Agricultural Law Information Partnership website. (Photo credit: Architect of the Capitol). The National Gleaning Project is a clearinghouse for food recovery-related information, connecting organizations with opportunities to collaborate at all levels, and a guide to national and state laws and regulations pertaining to gleaning and food donation. The Farmland Tenure Resource Project is an online legal resource aimed at helping farmers, landowners and farmer/landowner-advocates to understand and navigate the various legal issues related to transferring farmland in New England. This includes financing, taxation, acquisition and insurance. Another resource within the partnership has been developed by the Agricultural & Food Law Consortium, a four-university alliance led by the NALC. The consortium has done extensive research and outreach, including a year-round webinar series and a multi-state annual legal conference addressing topics such as the Endangered Species Act, animal welfare standards in aquaculture, use of drones in agriculture, environmental regulations, and shale oil and gas development.

"State Executive Director, Hawaii State & Pacific Basin, Farm Service Agency in  Energy  Aug 15,  Diane Ley, State Executive Director, Hawaii Farm Service Agency, prepares to depart Hickam Air Force Base for the Great Green Fleet demonstration. USDA Photo.  WOW! The word “wow” only moderately conveys the historic events that unfolded this summer during the Department of Navy’s Rim of the Pacific Exercises (RIMPAC) Great Green Fleet (GGF) demonstration. The might and power of the United States Navy coupled with that of scores of other Pacific Rim counties was impressive, but moreover a number of the great ships and aircraft were fueled by a mix of algae and animal fats. Yes, advanced biofuels produced from American grown algae and waste animal fats powering the all-powerful military platforms! The man with the vision behind this innovation, Secretary of Navy Ray Mabus, would proudly note the Navy’s continuing global leadership as an innovator – having led maritime vessels from sails to coal-fired steam, from coal to oil and nuclear; and now the transition to advanced biofuels. Tom Vilsack, Secretary of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) would later expounded upon that message of innovation, “We can, as a nation, change the fuel production and distribution paradigm in the world, if we are consistent in our efforts to increase our production and use of domestic biofuels which are important to our energy and national security as well as create jobs.” For nearly four years, Secretaries Mabus and Vilsack have made a coordinated and concerted effort to support the development and stand-up of a domestic biofuels sector. The USDA has lent support to furthering research and business start-ups for biomass production and waste stream diversion, and the Navy has sought to test, demonstrate and accelerate investments in advanced biofuels for use in its many platforms. Both secretaries have identified the importance of establishing geographically diverse supply sources of biomass and biofuels and noted that the State of Hawaii has a strategic role to play; hence, the RIMPAC exercises off-shore from Honolulu Hawaii was a perfect match to demonstrate the capacity advanced biofuels in the GGF. On the designated day for the GGF demonstration, I represented the USDA and traveled with navy and congressional staff and representatives of the several airlines; assembling before daybreak for briefings and preparations for transport on a propeller-driven aircraft out to the USS Nimitz, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. We donned military issue life jackets, goggles and cranial helmets with ear muffs; yet, the ear protection only afforded limited attenuation of the excessive noise throughout much of the day. We headed out onto tarmac of Hickam Air Force Base and took seats facing the back of the no-frills plane. Squinting to see in the suddenly dark space as the back hatch closed, a mixture of 50 percent biofuels and fossil fuels raced through the aircraft’s engines, and the roar became deafening. The engines, gorged with the algae and animal fat mix; and the plane roared down the runway and into the sky. Traveling 45 miles due north of Honolulu, through the aircraft’s single viewing pane, naval vessels could be seen dotting the sea and the horizon. Cruisers, destroyers and then the USS Nimitz came into view. Ships and planes off the coast of Hawaii, participating in the Great Green Fleet demonstration. After we landed on the Nimitz and scrambled out of the aircraft, we were hit by the full might of steel upon the sea – the carrier’s deck 1,100 feet in length and 250 feet wide with a 10-story high bridge for observation and traffic control. Jets everywhere, attended to by squadrons of seamen grabbed in Navy Working Uniforms, colored light-weight turtle necks defining each squad’s role in the GGF demonstration. Keeping to an aggressive schedule, we viewed various operations including radar and navigation rooms; a tactical operation room for RIMPAC led this year by the Chilean Navy; and anchors the size of an office. Secretary Mabus heralded the multi-day GGF demonstration, which was supported with the purchase of 450,000 gallons of non-food waste (used cooking oil) from Louisiana-based Dynamic Fuels LLC, included algae produced by Solazyme. Meeting the Navy’s criteria, the fuel was: 1) “drop-in” and compatible with existing technology; 2) derived from non-food sources; and 3) its combustion would not increase the carbon footprint. Back at the Flag Deck, the GGF demonstrations ramped up with a dozen jets in high idle, rocking and trembling with a deafening roar of engines each waiting to be catapulted from the deck of the USS Nimitz. Once air-born, the 50/50 biofuel blend kicked in and the jets soared and flashed by the carrier at great speed and in tight formation. Flying the world’s most advanced aircraft with precise precision, the pilots accomplished mid-air refueling and touch and go maneuvers. The crew on deck and the spectators were enveloped fumes from fuel, oils and metallic dust; combined with heat emanating from the engines and the thunderous rumble, and everyone agreed that this was as Secretary Mabus stated, “A historic day.” For more about the Navy’s Great Green Fleet visit the Green Fleet website, or to read or listen to secretaries Mabus and Vilsack debrief on the Great Green Fleet visit the USDA website.

"Agricultural Marketing Service Administrator in  Trade  Jul 08,  This partnership will streamline access to the growing Korean organic market for American producers and businesses, benefiting the thriving organic industry and supporting jobs and businesses on a global scale. USDA Photo Courtesy of Miles McEvoy. Last week, we celebrated another victory for the global organic community – the announcement of an organic equivalency agreement between the U.S. and the Republic of Korea. We are thrilled with the outcome! Beginning July 1, , processed organic products certified in Korea or in the U.S. may be sold as organic in either country, eliminating significant barriers and creating opportunities for American businesses across the organic supply chain as well as setting the foundation for additional organic agricultural trade agreements. Consumers in Korea will now be able to enjoy a wide range of U.S. organic exports including condiments, cereal, baby food, frozen meals, milk, and other processed products. Under this Administration, the United States has also established organic trade arrangements with Canada, the European Union, and Japan. The Korean arrangement will streamline access to the growing Korean organic market for American producers and businesses, benefiting the thriving organic sector and supporting jobs and businesses on a global scale. The new arrangement also reflects the strength of the USDA organic standards – the U.S. organic program sets the gold standard, which is one reason that Korea chose to work with the U.S. on its “first” organic equivalency arrangement.  It also serves as an example of how closely the U.S. and Korea are working together to address emerging issues and strengthen our trade relationship. In , Korea was the 6th largest market for U.S. agricultural exports—providing about one quarter of Korea’s agricultural imports and purchasing more than $5 billion of U.S. food and agricultural products. According to U.S. industry estimates, the U.S. exported around $35 million of processed organic products to Korea in .  These exports came to a virtual standstill in January , when Korea implemented mandatory organic certification requirements that U.S. organic exports to be certified to Korean standards.  U.S. operations wanting to access the Korean organic market were faced with a double set of fees, inspections, and paperwork. The U.S. negotiating team – led by representatives from the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), and the Agricultural Marketing Service’s (AMS) National Organic Program (NOP) led by Deputy Administrator Miles McEvoy – worked expeditiously to reestablish access to Korea’s organic market while protecting the integrity of USDA’s organic standards. Negotiations encompassed a side-by-side comparison of the USDA organic regulations and the Korean organic standards to determine if an equivalency arrangement would work. We also sent an audit team to Korea to evaluate their organic certification and enforcement provisions.  After the thorough review, U.S. and Korean officials finalized the organic equivalency arrangement. Both the U.S. and Korea are committed to ensuring that all traded products retain their organic integrity from farm to market. Through the NOP, USDA has helped organic farmers and businesses achieve $35 billion annually in U.S. retail sales.  The organic community includes over 25,000 organic businesses in more than 120 different countries around the world, and the combined organic markets of the countries with which we have equivalency arrangements are valued at more than $50 billion.  AMS and NOP are proud of USDA organic integrity, which helps propel strong growth in consumer demand for certified organic products and creates opportunities worldwide for American organic businesses.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .15  Contact:USDA Office of Communications 720-  LINCOLN, Neb., Sept. 17, - This week, following the recent announcement of $2 million in Conservation Innovation Grants to support water quality trading markets, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hosted a joint workshop to expand markets for water quality benefits generated on farms, ranches and forest lands.Water quality trading is an innovative approach to reduce pollution and efficiently achieve water quality goals. Trading is based on the fact that sources in a watershed can face very different costs to control the same pollutant. Trading programs allow facilities facing higher pollution control costs to meet their regulatory obligations by purchasing environmentally equivalent (or superior) pollution reductions from another source at lower cost, thus achieving the same water quality improvement at lower overall cost.USDA and EPA signed a partnership agreement in to advance water quality trading and other market-based approaches that provide benefits to the environment and economy. The workshop attracted over 200 participants involved in water quality trading from across the nation.""Conservation practices that improve soil health and conserve nutrients also produce real water quality benefits. With support from USDA and our Federal partners, water quality markets can create incentives to increase these environmental benefits and boost investment in rural America. The actions we are announcing today will help us get there,"" said Ann Mills, USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment.Among the new water quality trading resources announced:EPA-USDA Water Quality Trading Roadmap The Water Quality Trading Roadmap is a decision support tool for those designing and participating in water quality trading programs. The Roadmap is a searchable database that consolidates policy guidance from EPA, information from State programs, and examples and supporting materials from across the U.S.EPA-USDA partnership on EnviroAtlas to support environmental markets USDA and EPA will incorporate environmental markets layers into the Federal ecosystem service decision support tool, EnviroAtlas. The layers will show where markets for water, carbon, wetlands, and habitats occur on the U.S. landscape, provide information about these markets, and allow this information to be displayed in the context of existing environmental from Federal agencies.Nutrient Tracking Tool (NTT) USDA will release this fall the next version of NTT, ready for use in the Pacific Northwest and Ohio River Basin. The new version of NTT is a USDA hosted, user-friendly, web-based tool that calculates edge of field nutrient and sediment loads for use in conservation planning and environmental market credit calculation. NTT will be made available in additional regions in .USDA Environmental Markets Website USDA released the Department-level environmental markets website. The site integrates information, tools and resources on environmental markets from across the Department, allowing users to easily gain a snapshot of environmental market activities at USDA.These new resources were announced days after the Natural Resources Conservation Service awarded over $2 million in Conservation Innovation Grants to support water quality trading markets. The Water Quality Trading Conservation Innovation Grant Awardees are:Conservation Marketplace Midwest ($243,933)-proposes to develop and pilot a Field Stewards program, an innovative conservation credit system designed to allow companies in the food industry to buy ""offsets"" for water quality and agricultural conservation. Through the purchase of certification credits, food companies can demonstrate sustainability to their customers without having to create a new chain-of-custody supply chain for agricultural commodities, keeping costs low for retailers and the consumer. (MN)Electric Power Research Institute ($300,000)-proposes to develop and execute, for the first time, trades of ""stacked"" ecosystem services-both water quality and greenhouse gas emissions reduction credits. EPRI administers the Ohio River Basin nutrient trading program, the only multi-state trading program in the country. (IN, KY, OH)Great Lakes Commission ($400,000)-substantial water quality issues plague the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB), leading to harmful algal blooms each summer in Lake Erie. The Great Lakes Commission proposes to develop a framework for water quality trading in the WLEB. (IN, MI, OH)Iowa League of Cities ($700,000)-proposes to develop a framework for water quality trading in Iowa to support the State's Nutrient Reduction Strategy. (IA)National Association of Conservation Districts($116,725)-proposes to develop guidance materials and engage in outreach and training to increase participation of soil and water conservation districts in nutrient trading programs. In many water quality trading programs, district employees are the conservation experts interacting with agricultural producers generating credits from the installation of conservation practices. (Nationwide)Virginia Tech University ($285,729)-proposes to develop the information and tools to incorporate agroforestry into Virginia's nutrient trading program, which currently largely depends on the retirement of marginal agricultural lands for credit generation. In December , USDA, EPA and the State of Virginia celebrated a first-of-its-kind transaction when the Virginia Dept. of Transportation purchased phosphorous credits generated by a Virginia farmer.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA APHIS in  Animals  Plants  Oct 28,  Visitors explore the APHIS booth at the National FFA Convention The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and several other U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agencies had staff at the National FFA Convention in Indianapolis last week to share agricultural information with 50,000 enthusiastic FFA members, aged 12-21, and their families. The energy and excitement generated by members of the nation’s largest youth organization were especially palpable at the convention’s Agricultural Career Show, where FFA members were barraged with agriculturally themed games, information and giveaways from companies and government agencies alike. (“Alpaca nation” t-shirts and free Wisconsin cheese were among my personal favorites). FFA members made time to stop by the USDA booths to learn about issues affecting their home states.  Maryland FFA members asked about the brown marmorated stink bug, while Iowa members gathered information about USDA renewable energy initiatives.  Information about invasive species went quickly and APHIS distributed more than 500 teacher information packets. APHIS' FFA participation helps us to reach key stakeholders and to inspire young people to careers in public service and agriculture. As a former FFA member and USDA intern, I can testify that the FFA instilled in me the intellectual curiosity, ambition and drive for a successful career. One of my favorite conversations at the APHIS booth was with Katie Eldred, former FFA member and first-year FFA advisor: “FFA membership exposed me to the people and organizations that affect the future of our nation’s food and agricultural resources,” Katie said, “including USDA. To me, the career show represents the future, both for my students and for agriculture.”  Category/Topic:  Animals  Plants  Tags:  Agricultural Career Show  APHIS  FFA  Indiana  Indianapolis  Katie Eldred  National FFA Convention",What is one of the ways that APHIS' participation in the National FFA Convention helps to inspire young people to careers in public service and agriculture?,"By reaching key stakeholders, such as the 50,000 FFA members and their families, through information sharing and interactive activities at the convention."
"Conservation Partnership Helps Family Farm Thrive  Allen and Becky Clark have been farming for 17 years. When they started their small business, they grew flowers, pumpkins and corn stalks. Four years ago, they began raising goats for milk and cheese and eventually started making soap as well. The Clarks had long wanted to expand their farm but couldn’t afford the high cost of land. But thanks in part to the Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program (FRPP) of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), they recently realized their dream.   Kip Kolesinskas, State Soil Scientist, Connecticut, Natural Resources Conservation Service  Posted in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Nov 22,   Respond to this story",What conservation programs can help small family farms like the Clark's expand their operations while preserving natural resources?,The Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program (FRPP) of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) can help small family farms like the Clark's expand their operations while preserving natural resources.
"Acting Deputy Under Secretary, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Aug 07,  Acting Deputy Under Secretary Vernita Dore (left) tours the wastewater facility under construction in Lower Kalskag, Alaska. Life is challenging in Lower Kalskag, Alaska. An isolated village only accessible by plane or boat, or an ice road in the winter, Lower Kalskag's 300 residents have no running water or toilets and pay four and five times the price for goods you and I take for granted. A third of the population lives below the poverty level and over half of the population lacks year-round employment. Located past the southwest end of the snow-capped Portage Mountains on an icy bend of the Kuskokwim River, I was fortunate enough to visit Lower Kalskag and see first-hand the critical role USDA Rural Development plays in our most remote communities. With assistance from our partner, the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, USDA Rural Development is providing investment through our Rural Alaska Village Grant program to construct water and wastewater treatment facilities, as well as connect the residents of Lower Kalskag to the system. By , this nearly century-old settlement will have indoor plumbing for the very first time. Prior to arriving in Lower Kalskag, I purchased fresh fruit to bring as a gift, since produce is a luxury that is prohibitively expensive for this community. We were welcomed with open arms to their community center where we were given a project update by the engineering staff, followed by a community meal. Opening with a beautifully sung Russian Orthodox prayer, we shared in a meal of sandwiches and fresh fruit, along with baked fish and beaver stew. It was delicious. I talked with Crim Evan, the Mayor of Lower Kalskag, who proudly proclaimed how much he was looking forward to banishing the 5-gallon buckets they'd been using for toilet facilities. The so-called 'honeybucket' will be a thing of the past once the facilities are finished, and Crim was genuinely grateful for our USDA Rural Development staff in Alaska who have worked so hard to finance this important project. Bridging the historical subsistence culture of this Yup'ik village with modern sanitation takes large steps toward providing the underpinnings of economic stability. This infrastructure improves the economic viability of the village and improves the health and sanitation for the villagers. Really, that's the gossamer thread that unifies Lower Kalskag with other rural communities we serve – in Alaska and across our great nation – the need for access to clean water, safe and sanitary housing, and economic stability that allows rural residents to remain in the communities of their birth if they so choose. Through USDA Rural Development, Lower Kalskag is providing for that need. Marcus Lake and his mother, Carrie, will have fresh running water and indoor plumbing for the first time once the project is complete.

"Taking the Summer On: AMS Interns Gain Valuable Experience  Without farmers and the agricultural businesses that support them, no one can eat. This is a simple concept, but it implies that people will continue to choose careers in agriculture. Here at USDA, one of the ways that we encourage younger generations to choose these careers is offering grants to institutions that offer agricultural curriculums.  Through the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), USDA enables students to expand their knowledge of the agricultural industry. NIFA provides grants to schools such as the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez (UPRM) through the Hispanic Serving Institutions Program.

"Timothy Conner, Parag Chitnis, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Feb 25,  Secretary Sonny Perdue launches the USDA Agriculture Innovation Agenda to align research and programs between the public and private sectors. National Innovation Day was February 16th this year. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) directly contributes to America’s agriculture research and innovation, ultimately benefiting our farmers, ranchers, and foresters. Through an integrated approach of research, education, and Cooperative Extension (extension) – and strong collaboration with our grantees, partners, stakeholders, other Federal agencies, and Congress – NIFA ensures that groundbreaking discoveries in agriculture-related sciences and technologies reach the people who can put them into practice. Most of NIFA’s programs contribute to America’s agricultural research and innovation, including NIFA’s flagship competitive grants program, the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI), and the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant program. AFRI was created by the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of , and subsequently funded by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. NIFA provides AFRI grants to support research, education, and extension activities in six priority areas, originally established by the Farm Bill: 1.) Plant Health and Production and Plant Products; 2.) Animal Health and Production and Animal Products; 3.) Food Safety, Nutrition, and Health; 4.) Bioenergy, Natural resources, and Environment; 5.) Agriculture Systems and Technology; and 6.) Agriculture Economics and Rural Communities. AFRI-funded science is vital to meeting food, fiber, and fuel demands as the world’s population races to nearly 10 billion people by in the face of diminishing natural resources and increasingly variable climatic conditions. A few AFRI-funded projects to highlight are the International Wheat Yield Partnership coordinated agricultural projects (CAP) and its predecessor Triticeae CAP (T-CAP) that focused on improving wheat and barley for climate adaptation. Like many of NIFA’s CAPs, the wheat CAPs bridge the gap across the academic research, industry, and the farming communities to produce higher yielding crops and support sustainable farming. More than 100 commercial varieties developed through the wheat CAPs have a $1.8 billion production value. This work resulted in the TCAP team, led by the University of California, Davis, which utilized markers to identify the gene variants that control the most desirable of the plant’s traits, and which subsequently created the Triticeae Toolbox that provides this information to plant breeders so they can develop improved wheat and barley lines. Learn more on this NIFA Funding Accelerates Wheat & Barley Plant Breeding infographic. Another AFRI funded innovation project led Iowa State University researchers to develop a sensor using nanotechnology that can detect organophosphates at levels 40 times smaller than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommendations. Organophosphates are certain classes of insecticides used on crops throughout the world to control insects. NIFA supports this research through a pair of AFRI grants totaling $573,000. More on this AFRI funded project explained by this New Nanosensor Detects Microscopic Contaminants in Water blog. The SBIR program, established by the Small Business Innovation Research Act of , offers competitively awarded grants to qualified small businesses to support high quality research related to important scientific problems and opportunities in agriculture that could lead to significant public benefits. Administered by NIFA for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the program stimulates technological innovations in the private sector and strengthens the role of federal research, development, and translation of research and development in support of small businesses. The program has awarded over 2,000 research and development projects since . Through SBIR funding, NECi Superior Enzymes (previously ""The Nitrate Elimination Company, Inc.) developed kits that allow farm managers to determine nitrate accumulation levels on their farms, which helps them manage nitrate concentration, reduce costly nitrogen fertilizer use, and reduce pollutants. This product is approved by the EPA as an alternative test method for nitrate testing under the Safe Water Drinking Act and the Clean Water Act, and is used as the standard test method within all U.S. Geological Survey soil labs. NECi Superior Enzymes is a woman-owned small business located in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

"Farmers Markets: Teaching Kids Where Food Comes From  “We become what we repeatedly do.” In his Seven Habits of Highly Effective Teens Sean Covey used these words to help young students preparing to attend college and join the workforce, but they also apply to how children learn to eat healthy. Through innovative programs like the Power of Produce (POP) Club, farmers markets across the country are teaching children how to make healthy eating choices. This program, started at the Oregon City Farmers Market, invites children to learn more about some of their favorite foods. Participating in events like planting sunflower seeds or making jam gives the youngsters a chance to better understand where their food comes from. By receiving $2 to spend on fresh produce every time they visit the market to keeping a log of what they buy, the children become immersed in a world of healthy eating.  Last year, 1,781 children aged 5 to 12 years old joined, resulting in 5,180 shopping trips.

"What is the Nine Agency Rule? The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights (OASCR) enforces the Nine Agency Rule under the authority delegated by the Secretary of Agriculture, pursuant to 7 C.F.R. § 2.25 (a). The Nine Agency Rule is designed to ensure that USDA programs of civil rights, including program delivery, compliance, and equal employment opportunity, adhere to all governing laws, rules, and regulations, including related Executive Orders and Congressional mandates. On February 14, , President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., signed Executive Order 5, establishing the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, emphasizing the importance of partnering with civil society, including faith-based and secular organizations, to serve people in need while adhering to all governing laws. This Executive Order revoked Executive Order 1 and reinstated key provisions to protect religious liberty. Key Provisions of the Nine Agency Rule  Equal Access for Faith-Based Organizations  Under 7 CFR § 16, faith-based organizations are eligible to access and participate in USDA assistance programs on the same basis as any other organization. USDA and its intermediaries must not discriminate against or for an organization based on its religious character, motives, affiliation, or lack thereof.  Non-Discrimination Against Beneficiaries  Organizations receiving direct or indirect Federal financial assistance from USDA must not discriminate against current or prospective beneficiaries based on religion, religious belief, refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice.  Separation of Religious Activities  Organizations that receive USDA direct assistance must separate any explicitly religious activities in time or location from the programs or services funded by USDA direct assistance, ensuring participation in such activities is voluntary. This restriction does not apply to indirect Federal financial assistance.  Notification Requirements  Recipients administering USDA social service programs must notify beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries of their right to be free from religious discrimination and how to report violations.  Alternative Providers  If a beneficiary objects to the religious character of a faith-based provider, the USDA awarding agency must make reasonable efforts to refer the beneficiary to an alternative provider.  Protections for Faith-Based Providers  Faith-based providers can compete equally with secular organizations for USDA awards while retaining their religious character, provided they comply with all applicable regulations. Examples of Nine Agency Rule Violations  Denied Service Based on Religious Beliefs  A food pantry volunteer denies service to an individual wearing a religious head covering and makes derogatory remarks about their faith.  Discriminatory Practices by Service Providers  A service provider receiving USDA funds denies services to a homeowner based on their perceived religion, using offensive language, and failing to address the discrimination. How to File a Complaint Any individual who believes they have been discriminated against based on religion, religious belief, refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice may file a complaint with OASCR.

"Hill Farm Buzzing with Pollinator Success  Since it’s National Pollinator Week, it seemed fitting to express my thanks to farmers Scott and Susan Hill - who run the Hill Farm outside Charlottesville, VA.  Earlier, I had the chance to visit their 10-acre property former tobacco farm to see firsthand how hard they are working to grow a variety of produce for the local customers. But there are more little workers helping on the Hill Farm too. Pollinators! In the United States, about one third of all agricultural output depends on pollinators. Insects and other animal pollinators are vital to the production of healthy crops for food, fibers, edible oils, medicines, and other products. It’s clear that pollinators are important to the Hill Farm for their production of their artisan and specialty varieties of several vegetables, including lettuce, asparagus, tomatoes and even golden beets.  And the first year, the addition of bees increased their tomato production by 25 percent.

"USDA One Health Joint Working Group Co-Chair and Deputy Administrator, Animal Production and Protection, USDA Agricultural Research Service in  Animals  Plants  Nov 18,  ARS scientists identifying bacterial pathogens in the lab. Photo by Peggy Greb. Antibiotics are lifesavers. We depend on them to treat bacterial infections and diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis and strep throat, as well as ear infections and infected wounds. In response to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance, veterinarians and producers are moving toward more judicious antibiotic use in food animals, while keeping them healthy and ensuring that our food supply remains safe. This is especially important because certain bacterial strains have become resistant to some of the current antibiotics used to treat infections in humans and animals, escalating the need worldwide to find and develop alternatives to antibiotics. The USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is developing new technologies to address antibiotic resistance and reduce the use of antibiotics through agricultural management, which includes food, animals, crops and the environment—water, soil and climate. This research falls into USDA’s One Health approach when mitigating the problems associated with antibiotic resistance.  One Health is the concept that the health of animals, the health of people, and the viability of ecosystems are intricately linked. A One Health approach embraces the idea that a disease problem impacting the health of humans, animals, and the environment can only be solved through improved communication, cooperation, and collaboration across disciplines and institutions. With its partners, USDA’s objective through this multidisciplinary approach is to preserve, maintain or reduce health risks to animals, humans, the environment and society. USDA has gained in-depth knowledge about antimicrobial resistance through its work on the agricultural environment, animal health and food safety. Over the years, scientists have developed and patented new technologies that could help reduce the use of antibiotics. Discoveries include using natural supplements like vitamin D to treat a condition of dairy cows called “mastitis,” which affects milk quality and production of cattle. Vitamin D, as well as yeast, also has the potential to treat turkey diseases. In addition, scientists have shown that non-antibiotic methods, such as essential oils in citrus, reduce foodborne pathogens found in the gut of animals; that phytochemicals—natural chemicals found in such plants as safflower, plums and peppers—enhance the immune system of chickens; and that certain natural compounds kill foodborne pathogens like Salmonella or Escherichia coli O157:H7. Other research breakthroughs include creating new, effective antimicrobials and vaccines to fight such pathogens as Salmonella and Campylobacter to lower their incidence in chickens and turkeys and help keep consumers healthy. Finding alternatives to antibiotics has become a global issue as the demand for animal food products increases to meet the nutritional needs of a growing population. ARS scientists continue to seek solutions by developing new methods to control and prevent animal diseases and reduce bacterial pathogens in our food supply. ARS scientists are studying a variety of techniques to ensure our food supply remains safe. Photo by Peggy Greb.

"National Press Club As prepared for Delivery. Embargoed until 1:00 p.m. Eastern  Release & Contact Info  News Transcript  Release No. .13  Contact:USDA Office of Communications  720-  Watch Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack's remarks live at 12:50 pm ET at: afternoon, everyone. I want to thank the National Press Club for the opportunity to discuss a complex environmental challenge American agriculture will face in the years and decades to come.In particular today, I want to focus on America's food supply. Specifically - how we've mitigated threats to it in the past and how today we face evolving environmental threats, requiring again that we mitigate and adapt.This is an important discussion because our food supply stands at the core of our strength as a nation. Today, American agriculture is tremendously productive, largely due to the innovation embraced by our farmers and ranchers.Productivity impacts more than the farmer's bottom line. Productivity empowers America to lead the way in feeding a growing world population - enables us to maintain an agricultural trade surplus that supports over a million jobs - and allows us to enjoy an affordable, diverse, homegrown food supply - all of which makes America more secure.We achieved this productivity because American agriculture has always adapted to threats. We're flexible and responsible when disaster strikes. But we've also taken the long view. We've always asked what we'll have to deal with next week, next month or next year.Risk management and adaptation starts on the farm. Farmers and ranchers are on the front lines of identifying threats and adapting to meet them. When a crop goes south or a herd gets sick, producers don't chalk that up to luck. They find out what's wrong and they fix it.For more than a century they have had our help in fixing problems. We are people that have invested and supported our agriculture sector. From USDA, to academics, to local extension agents, experts and advisors at all levels have been there to help our farmers get the job done.Keeping agriculture strong and productive is a joint undertaking and a shared responsibility.During and after the Dust Bowl, USDA helped farmers, ranchers and foresters reestablish the soil through new management efforts - planting marginal crop land with resource-conserving cover; taking new steps to protect water sheds; regenerating trees to break the devastating wind. These steps continue today.When America's forests were racked by historic fires, we came together to develop new methods to sustain, regenerate and protect forest lands.Last year, as producers faced the worst drought in generations, groundbreaking agricultural research and smart business planning saved crops that in the past would have been destroyed.The bottom line is that in the United States, we produce an amazing amount of food because we adapt to today's threats and prepare for tomorrow's threats.Today, we face a new challenge in the form of a changing and shifting climate.I'm the Secretary of Agriculture, and I am not here today to give a scientific lecture on climate change. I'm here to tell you what we're seeing on the ground.We're seeing more severe storms. We're facing more invasive species. More intense forest fire threatens communities each year. NOAA reported that was the second most intense year in our history for extreme weather events - droughts, flooding, hurricanes, severe storms and devastating wildfire. NOAA also advised that last year was the warmest on record for the continental United States.Right now, our farmers and forest landowners continue to adapt. New technologies and advanced practices have managed to keep production steady even in the face of these new and more extreme weather patterns.But the latest science tells us that the threat of a changing climate is new and different from anything we've ever tackled.Earlier this year USDA released two comprehensive studies - one focused on crops and one on our forests - detailing the projected effects of climate change on our agriculture and forestry production.These studies found that in the short term we have the means to manage threats, but over the next fifty years we will face new and different problems.We'll face the need to adapt crop production. As temperatures increase, crop production may need to shift based on water availability and other factors. Where you're growing water-intense fruits and vegetables today, you may be growing a drought-resistant row crop in a generation.Rising temperatures will also add to our invasive species issues, bringing with them increased costs for producers. Right now, weed control alone costs us more than $11 billion a year in the U.S. - and those costs are expected to rise with increasing temperatures. When winters aren't cold enough to kill off invasive insects, we'll face a new challenge to adapt to those threats. Landowners, dealing with bark beetles, are already starting to experience this phenomenon.We will face more severe weather patterns. We'll see more events that could harm crops and livestock, which demand new strategies.In our forests, the troubling pattern of intense and destructive wildfires threatens to become the norm. The fire season is now at least 60 days longer than it was just 30 years ago. The pine beetle epidemic, which many scientists attribute to climate change, covers some 40 million acres of land across the interior west. Fires impact more acres. A recent Forest Service study forecasts a doubling of annual acreage subject to wild land fire by .We are also beginning to grasp that climate challenges will have impacts unique to each region of the country.In the Northeast, extreme precipitation events have increased faster than anywhere else in the Nation, reducing yields.Across the Midwest and Great Plains the growing season has lengthened by almost two weeks over my lifetime.In the West and Southwest - home of more than half of our nation's high-value specialty crop production - increased drought poses a particular threat to irrigation-intensive nuts, fruits and vegetables.So the fact is, across America, farmers and ranchers and forest landowners are seeing the beginning chapter of what will be a long-term challenge posed by a changing climate. This problem is not going to go away on its own.That's why America must take steps now to adapt.We know that developing modern solutions to a changing climate requires a doubling down on collaboration - between farmers, governments, researchers and industry. We have got to think outside the box, work together, and pool our resources to begin developing the next generation of climate solutions for agriculture. This is not a single, one-size-fits-all problem. We need a targeted approach geared to the particular challenge faced by each region.We already have taken steps under President Obama to begin forging critical new approaches to mitigation and adaptation.Take the livestock and dairy industries, for example. In , USDA entered into an historic agreement with the U.S. dairy industry to mitigate the environmental impact of dairy production, by supporting new energy efficiency and waste-to-energy systems.Over four years this agreement led to the creation of 184 new anaerobic digesters. Last month, we renewed our MOU with a goal of helping the dairy industry reduce greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by .We've also provided support through university research to help the livestock industry reduce its environmental footprint.USDA recently announced $19.5 million in funding - led by the University of Wisconsin and Oklahoma State University - to look at the impacts of climate variability on dairy and beef production. Ultimately, these projects aim to deliver the best new tools for ranchers to sustain productivity.This effort was the latest in our focus on Coordinated Agriculture Projects, joint efforts to best leverage America's agricultural research capacity. USDA under the Obama Administration has invested nearly $120 million in Coordinated Agriculture Project research to sustain our productivity in the face of modern environmental challenges.We've worked with UC-Davis to explore how we might adapt conifer trees to changing climates - the University of Idaho to look at changes in soil carbon and nitrogen content - and Iowa State to look at several aspects of corn production.We have made unprecedented efforts to conserve and protect America's forests which play a critical role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in trees, other vegetation and soil. The Forest Service increased the pace and scale of forest restoration on our National Forests through landscape scale projects that bring together forest industry, environmentalists and communities.Given the threats our forests face, we moved away from the timber wars of the past towards a shared vision that recognizes we must work together towards a common goal of forest restoration.In this spirit, USDA has adopted a new forest planning rule that ensures our forests will be restored and managed in a way that protects all the benefits that forests provide to Americans, including clean water, jobs, recreation and wildlife. And importantly, the planning rule allows the Forest Service to use the best available science to ensure our forests can adapt to climate change over time.We have worked with more than 500,000 farmers and ranchers on private working land conservation efforts, and carried out thousands of projects to help them embrace renewable energy and energy efficiency projects on their property.We have taken a new and committed look at the impact of climate on the future of agriculture - and how we at USDA will also need to adapt.In addition to the two climate assessments I referenced earlier, we released USDA's first Climate Change Adaptation Plan this year. The Obama Administration has taken a comprehensive - and proactive - effort to ensure the Federal government is prepared for climate challenges that lay ahead.As part of this, USDA engaged employees and agencies to address our weak points with regard to a shifting climate and modern threats from the environment. We found areas where our program delivery might be impacted by these new challenges.Working with many different USDA agencies, we laid out 83 specific recommendations to be sure we can continue delivering top-notch service in the face of climate impacts. For example, we identified common needs to increase collaboration on climate planning within the Federal government and with our partners, such as land grant universities.We laid out a need to better prepare APHIS to measure invasive species - to ensure that our scientific research helps deliver modern climate solutions - to strengthen the resilience of our Forests - and to help create new ways for producers to access information that will help them mitigate threats.We'll be issuing a follow-up to this initial report in November of this year. But taken alongside the two climate impact assessments, these efforts reflect our understanding that proactive steps will pay big dividends in the decades to come. We know we need to be ahead of the game. We must continue to build on previous action in order to better support America's adaptation to climate challenges.Today I would like to announce some new measures that we will be taking.Regional Climate Hubs:First, USDA will establish seven new ""Regional Climate Hubs"" to work in partnership with producers and foresters on new adaptation strategies.This is the next step in USDA's decades of work alongside farmers, ranchers and forest landowners to keep up production in the face of challenges. If we are to be effective in managing the risks from a shifting climate, we'll need to ensure that our managers in the field and our stakeholders have the information they need to succeed.That's why we're bringing all of that information together on a regionally-appropriate basis.You can think of these new Hubs as service centers for science-based risk management - part of our broader effort to deliver extension for the 21st Century. They will enhance coordination of the science assets of USDA. They'll encourage folks to accelerate the development and delivery of forecasts and solutions to improve risk management in ways that matter for folks on the ground.The hubs will enable us to carry out regionally-appropriate climate change risk and vulnerability assessments, and get out to the field more quickly. Practically, the hubs will deal out advice to farmers and forest owners on ways to reduce risks and manage change.They will serve as a starting point to further implement new strategies for adaptation, soil health and water protection. One very promising example is the possibility of multi-cropping production that will add additional nutrient value to the soil, better protect cropland, store more carbon and allow producers to expand income.And as we further investigate possibilities for competitive markets in carbon sequestration and water protection, these regional Hubs will play a useful role.While some of the work of these new Hubs will take place in existing USDA service centers across the nation, there is a very important collaborative aspect as well. We intend to fully leverage our relationship with the Land Grant and Public Universities, Agricultural Experiment Stations, and extension to provide new platforms for collaboration.NRCS Tools for Producers:Second, I can announce new efforts by the Natural Resources Conservation Service to move into the next generation of research and technical assistance.In particular, both of these efforts relate to carbon. We know it's important to understand the role of carbon in contributing to global warming. It's equally important to recognize the tremendous potential of American agriculture to sequester carbon from the atmosphere - helping to mitigate climate change, while improving soil health to be more resilient in the face of modern challenges.NRCS is launching today an online resource assessment database - the results of a study known as the Rapid Carbon Assessment - that will be particularly useful for researchers and scientists.This tool will allow online access to the most extensive database on soil carbon in the world. While NRCS has collected soil samples for more than a century, this rapid assessment is an ambitious project. In fact, it is the largest concentrated soil sampling effort in history. NRCS scientists collected more than 144,000 soil samples at 6,000 locations across the country to provide baseline on regional carbon stocks.This will allow outside researchers and scientists to begin taking a fresh look at carbon in soil, which ultimately will have regional benefits to crop production.Additionally, USDA NRCS and our Climate Change Office are rolling out an online tool that's intended for farmers, and ranchers themselves. We call this ""COMET-Farm"" - the Carbon Management and Evaluation Tool.This online tool is the next generation of our ongoing efforts to develop user-friendly tools to help farmers understand the greenhouse gas footprints of their operations.Producers will input information about their land and current and past management practices to establish a baseline. The tool will let them select from a list of alternative conservation practices to see how each one changes their greenhouse gas emissions and carbon capture. For example, a producer planning to implement conservation tillage could estimate how that conservation practice will increase soil carbon, and decrease emissions for the operation overall.Used in this way, COMET-Farm can help producers reach decisions that reduce energy costs, while building carbon stocks in the soil. It would also serve as a gateway for future efforts to help producers participate in voluntary carbon markets.These new NRCS tools build on a campaign for soil health at USDA - because we know that healthy soil can absorb a significant amount of carbon, and help greatly in mitigating climate threats. By improving soil health we can simultaneously improve productivity, protect water resources, improve biodiversity, reduce erosion and help put carbon back into the ground where it belongs.We also know that healthy soils are more resilient soils. Each pound of soil organic matter in the soil can hold 18-20 pounds of water - helping make farms more resilient to periods of drought and other weather extremes.That's why USDA has focused on helping our nation's farmers and ranchers through our campaign - called ""Unlock the Secrets in the Soil."" We know that soil conservation practices help farmers - but they also help mitigate the impacts of a changing climate. Efforts like these will only be stronger as we ramp up new, regionally-focused information sharing efforts.Cover Crops:Third, USDA agencies have started working together to make new cover cropping methods available for producers, and to ensure that our agencies are working together to ensure these options are viable. For centuries, farmers have been using cover crops to prevent soil erosion, improve nutrient cycling, sustain soils and harness many other benefits.Cover crops also sequester a significant amount of carbon. However, some producers have encountered conflicting cover crop management issues when working with multiple USDA agencies.For example, there was a perception that crop insurance policies did not always allow cover crops - which conflicts with the NRCS incentives to plant cover crops. Some cover crop recommendations conflict with language in the Farm Bill for how the Farm Service Agency is to give commodity payments. That's a problem.Recently, USDA undertook an effort to ensure that farmers who plant cover crops have clarity from our Department. NRCS, RMA and FSA worked together this spring to establish a new common, science-based guidance on when cover crops should be terminated.The Administrators of these agencies engaged stakeholders, universities, and the crop insurance industry to figure out how to make cover crop straightforward and sensible.The result is new guidance - a new model that uses local climate , tillage management and soil to account for daily crop growth and use of soil moisture. With this information, experts determined the latest possible time to terminate a cover crop, to maximize carbon sequestration and at the same time minimize risk to the cash crop yield.For this new guidance, four cover crop termination zones have been established across the United States.These provide a regionally-appropriate approach to cover crops and the tools to identify the proper cover crop management in an area, taking into account local climate and cropping systems. We took the time needed to get this right - including truth-testing our recommendations with folks on the ground. Going forward - RMA, NRCS and FSA will all uniformly refer producers to these , and will use them to administer programs.With this consistent, science-based cover crop guidance, farmers will have more flexibility and a greater opportunity to utilize cover crops on their operations, while staying in compliance across all USDA agencies.They can reap the conservation and economic benefits that cover crops can provide - healthy soils and sustained food and fiber production. Producers will have a greater degree of certainty that they can use these practices, while still being eligible for crop insurance and other programs.I would note for folks that information on all of these new steps - our regional hubs, our new tools from NRCS, and these new steps with regard to cover crops - are available at our web site, www.usda.gov.These new tools and actions represent our comprehensive strategy for helping agriculture adapt to modern challenges.We'll continue to provide world-class research and tools for academic experts. Our plan reflects an understanding that farmers and ranchers have always been on the front lines of adaptation. We don't just want to tell folks there's a problem - we want to provide them with real information to create real solutions for specific threats.These efforts are also directly related to maintaining our abundant, productive agricultural sector, an effort that doesn't stop at the edge of the field.I want to share with you one more facet of this work that involves Americans from all walks of life. We spoke earlier about the tremendous productivity of American agriculture that keeps costs low for us at home, while helping us export around the world. Here's the bad news: estimates show that at least 30 percent of our food supply ends up wasted - and an estimated 133 billion pounds of food each year is not consumed.First, it's a major food security issue from the perspective that wasted food could be helping feed folks at food banks and shelters.Second, it's a natural resource issue. All of the resources that went into producing that wasted food - including the land, labor, water, pesticides, and fertilizers - could have been saved or gone to uses of higher value for society.And third, it's a climate change issue. EPA estimates that in the United States, food is the single largest component of municipal solid waste going to landfills - and that landfills are the third largest source of methane. You do the math. By reducing the amount of food we toss into the trash, we can help reduce methane emissions.Yesterday, I joined EPA Administrator Bob Perciasepe and leaders from across the U.S. food sector to announce the U.S. Food Waste Challenge. Together, we're calling on Americans across the nation to help us reduce the amount of food that ends up at the landfill, recover food that could be used to feed those in need, and recycle food waste wherever we can.Right now, we have a few founding partners onboard - and a predecessor effort by EPA has about 200 participant organizations. Our shared goal is to build momentum to fight food waste - by getting 400 partner organizations onboard the U.S. Food Waste Challenge by , and 1,000 by .At USDA, we're going to do our part. We've pledged to reduce waste in the school meals program, take new steps to educate consumers about food waste and food storage, and develop new technologies to reduce food waste. USDA will also work with industry leaders to streamline procedures for donating wholesome meat and poultry products that are misbranded. And at our food labs we will find better solutions for food waste by recycling food samples that have been inspected.By giving some extra thought to what we buy and how much we need, all of us can reduce our contributions to the nation's landfills. It's an adaptation strategy that everyone can help to create.All of this work represents the beginning stages and the first steps of an overarching focus on adaptation in the years ahead.Over the coming months and years, USDA intends to build partnerships with landowners - work with conservation groups, Tribes and local governments - and engage with ordinary Americans. We'll take more steps to mitigate and adapt to these challenges here in the United States, and around the world, and I look forward to sharing additional plans with you in the future.The bottom line today is that America's long history of innovation must continue.Our farmers and ranchers have proven over the course of generations that they're up to the task. And USDA has a strong history of support for their efforts.This will not be a short-term task, it won't be simple, but it's doable. That's why we need to prepare for the future today - to begin asking how we can work together to prepare agriculture for new challenges - and thereby put our food supply on a strong footing in the years to come.","The text discusses the importance of adaptation in agriculture due to modern challenges, such as climate change and waste management.

"Bozeman Ranger District, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 03,  Forests and wood products are powerful tools to help mitigate the impacts of climate change. (Click to view a larger version) Trees do plenty of work to sequester carbon on their own, but many forests are not as healthy as they should be due to fire suppression and climate change. This can leave trees vulnerable to large scale insect damage, fire or drought, and much of the carbon stored by forests is lost to the atmosphere as trees die. The U.S. Forest Service is committed to the storage of carbon using wood products through the green building and wood products strategy. This strategy involves putting people to work in rural communities, enhancing resiliency of our ecosystems, and sequestering carbon by promoting the use of wood products in large building construction. By using wood instead of, or along with, concrete and steel, large amounts of carbon can be stored in the walls of homes and offices, significantly reducing emissions associated with the production of other materials. Also, using sustainable timber harvests for emerging wood product technologies like cross-laminated timber, can stimulate local economies in timber country while sequestering carbon in long-term wood products. Cross laminated timber is a wood panel made of layers of dried lumber boards stacked in alternating directions, glued and pressed to form solid panels. These panels have extraordinary strength and are being used as walls, roofs, and floors. D.R. Johnson Mill in Riddle, Oregon announced recently that it will be the first U.S. mill certified to produce cross-laminated timber for high rise construction. Putting our own green building strategy to work, the Forest Service is working to increase the use of locally milled timber in all new agency buildings and facilities. Since , we have used wood to build the Angeles National Forest Supervisor’s Office, Camino Real Ranger Station, Corvallis Laboratory, Juneau Laboratory, and Enomee Ranger District Office. And in the private sector projects like the Bullitt Center in Seattle are showcasing the use of sustainable, Forest Stewardship Council certified wood products to efficiently create new buildings that will last and become testaments to sustainable forest management. The Bullitt Center sequesters 1,703 metric tons of carbon in its walls. The trees in our national forests can help mitigate the effects of climate change in so many ways, and the Forest Service is committed to helping neighboring communities by promoting sustainable development with trees and wood.

"USDA Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics in  Food and Nutrition  Research and Science  Oct 16,   On October 16, World Food Day, it is hard to not be struck by how lucky we are in the United States. We have abundant food that costs us less to produce, on a per unit basis, than almost any other country in the world. Our farmers and ranchers produce more than we need, allowing us to be a powerhouse in global exports. And our food supply is among the safest of all the world’s nations. All that abundance and security has been underpinned by science and know-how.  Between the s and the s, agriculture science blossomed in what has become known as the Green Revolution. Thanks to the research done by Norman Borlaug, the “Father of the Green Revolution,” working with researchers around the world, developed high-yielding varieties and modern production practices that helped save untold numbers of people from starvation. Today, agriculture scientists are once again facing the need to create the kind of success through science that Dr. Borlaug achieved – this time with an even greater challenge:  increasing production by 70% by during a time of natural resource limitations and climate variability. The United Nations has projected the world population to grow to over 9 billion people by .  Today, over 800,000 people are hungry around the globe, an improvement but still unacceptable.   To meet this challenge, in President Obama launched with other G-8 Leaders the “Agriculture and Food Security Initiative”, collectively committing $22 billion in new investments in agriculture and nutrition.  The Feed the Future Initiative is the United State’s effort to support this global effort; the first Feed the Future Progress Report will be released this Thursday at the World Food Prize Foundation’s Borlaug Symposium by USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah. In addition, the G-20 has played a critical role in increasing market transparency and supporting agricultural development.  I recently led the U.S. Government’s delegation to the first-ever Meeting of Agricultural Chief Scientists, convened from an initiative of the G20 and hosted by the Mexican government. For the first time, the people in charge of their countries’ food and natural resources science agencies sat together in a room and forged agreements on how to determine the most crucial priorities for our nations, working together, in the coming years so that we can meet this global food challenge. We discussed “blue sky” ideas – the wish list ag researchers think may have the greatest potential to transform our ability to meet food needs while conserving precious natural resources: finding ways for plants to fix nitrogen from the air into their tissues, thus decreasing harmful run-off of fertilizers into watersheds; discovering methods to turn annual crops into perennials that don’t need replanting, to reduce soil erosion, labor costs and  fossil fuel inputs; and determining solutions to preserve our precious water supply.  We agreed upon the urgency of this fundamental research as well as coordinating our research to make the best use of limited government funds. Perhaps the most important development from the meeting, though, was our agreement to break down the walls between our scientific communities, and use online global platforms to share genomic and genetic , improve agricultural innovation systems, and open access to scholarly publications and other technical documentation. We recognize the common goal we share and know that none of us will reach it on our own – and we don’t have time to waste. Science is most successful when it’s done in a collaborative, coordinated manner. New technologies and information sharing opportunities give us the tools we need to work together and use the multiplier effect of our expertise to speed progress on this urgently needed agenda.

(Photo by Julia Lewis) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research portfolio. On November 22, the United States and Israel came one step closer to renewing agricultural research and development activities that could produce new knowledge and innovations beneficial to both countries and increase the economic bottom line for farmers and ranchers. Dr. Sonny Ramaswamy, director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and Edo Chalutz, executive director of the U.S.–Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD), signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to promote collaboration via NIFA among U.S. and Israeli scientists and engineers. BARD and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), USDA’s intramural research agency, have cooperated on research together since BARD’s inception. While the MOU does not obligate either agency to specific funding, it offers the framework for facilitating collaborations through the partnership that BARD and the U.S. government have shared since . “The United States and Israel have a shared stake in dryland agriculture, high-value horticultural crops, and pest management. There should be ample opportunity for American and Israeli scientists to jointly continue to advance these and other important areas of science,” Ramaswamy said. One example of cooperation between the nations is water and soil management. Efficiency in water use is of particular interest since the Israelis have worked for years in to develop drip irrigation and have grappled with issues of soil salinity. Many U.S. scientists are conducting similar research, so this may be an area where the MOU could strengthen or begin new collaborative efforts. “This agreement will facilitate many mutual benefits, and we look forward to getting started,” Ramaswamy said. “In fact, we plan to use this MOU as a model for building other important global partnerships.” Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and Cooperative Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Posted by Written by Katie Yocum, USDA Rural Development in  Initiatives  USDA Results  Technology  Jun 11,  While the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma is rich in cultural pride, identity and history, its remote location in the rugged terrain of Southeast Oklahoma has severely limited the tribe’s economic development efforts.  But a Broadband Initiative Program grant, made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, will enable Pine Telephone Company (PTC) to use innovative wireless technology to deliver affordable broadband service to portions of this rural, remote and economically disadvantaged region in Southeast Oklahoma. During World War II, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma provided an invaluable service to the United States by pioneering the use of Code Talking, using the native Choctaw language, to prevent enemy forces from intercepting the transmission of army secrets. And in , the Choctaw Nation was awarded the Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award, the highest recognition of support of employees who serve in the National Guard and Reserve.  So while the Choctaw Nation has shown outstanding compassion for the nation and its tribal members, the local economies of Choctaw communities have suffered tremendously.  Of the five counties on tribal lands that will be served by PTC, all of them are plagued with unemployment rates that soar above the state average and a substantial proportion of residents living below the poverty line. PTC spent years testing broadband technologies that would offer reliable internet service to residents of this remote region, and they determined that advanced 3G technology presents the most viable solution. The system is designed to be scalable and to cost-effectively accommodate technology upgrades, so that it will remain viable for years to come. PTC’s system will offer service to nearly 5,000 households, 10 school districts, and 12 volunteer fire departments and ambulance services. With reliable, high speed wireless access, the region will be able to overcome their geographic isolation to stimulate the sustainable economic growth that it needs.  And offering quality internet access to key community institutions, like schools and public safety bodies, will mean better educational opportunities and enhanced health care and public safety for residents of this region. And in addition to the many benefits to be reaped by members of the Choctaw Nation, this Recovery Act project will also create more than 150 jobs over the multi-year construction period.

"New Study Offers Sage Advice  For many, one of the New Year’s first big chores is to remove a tree from inside their home. Trees, beautiful and useful as they are, do not belong everywhere. Such is the case with trees and other woody species that are expanding into the Western grasslands. Over the years, woody species like juniper, pinyon pine, redcedar and mesquite have encroached on grassland and sagebrush ecosystems, altering these landscapes and making them unsuitable for native wildlife like the lesser prairie-chicken and greater sage-grouse. Encroaching conifers also degrade rangelands for agricultural producers whose livestock rely on nutritious forage.

"What is a native plant? A native plant is a plant that is a part of the balance of nature that has developed over hundreds or thousands of years in a particular region or ecosystem. Note: The word native should always be used with a geographic qualifier (that is, native to New England [for example]). Only plants found in this country before European settlement are considered to be native to the United States. There are many benefits of landscaping and gardening with native plants including conserving water, protecting soil from erosion, and creating habitat and providing food for many different animals including birds, pollinators, and small mammals. Simply by growing native plants gardeners can bring enormous beauty to a community and joy to its residents. In addition, native plants are easy-to-grow and require minimal maintenance.

Unfortunately, about one out of six Americans gets sick from eating contaminated food at some point during the year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scientists from USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) work for one of the federal agencies that conducts research to help make the foods we eat safer. To help the public more easily access USDA food safety research information, the department’s National Agricultural Library’s Food Safety Research Information Office (FSRIO) has launched a new “Meet the Experts” online video collection available on the NAL website. FSRIO has collected videos from a variety of sources and organized them in one repository. Current videos highlight ARS food safety research. FSRIO will add other videos to the collection that highlights research and food safety efforts from across USDA agencies. Many foods must travel through different points between the farm and your plate.  Lettuce, for example, is harvested from the field, cooled, processed and packaged, then transported to your grocery store where it is displayed in a cooler waiting for someone to buy it, transport it home or to a restaurant where it finally gets prepared and eaten.  ARS scientists in the produce-safety videos discuss how their research is improving the safety of that lettuce all through its journey to the grocery display cooler.  Stay tuned as additional videos are added to the “Meet the Experts” website.

"South Carolina Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 27,  Swales, like this one, were created throughout the wetland to hold water after a rain event, which in turn helps aid in flood storage, enhances plant diversity and provides habitat for wildlife. NRCS photo. A 53-acre conservation easement is an ideal environmental learning lab for students at Francis Hugh Wardlaw Academy in Johnston, South Carolina.  The land was once pastures for cattle, but now it’s a vibrant wetland just across the street from the high school. The contractor hired to install the restoration work, Charles Kemp, was instrumental in involving the school’s students in creating and managing the wetland. “These students are exploring what a career in agriculture or environmental science would be like, and they love being outside and escaping the confines of the classroom,” Kemp said. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service provided technical and financial assistance to develop the restoration plan, and install the structures and earthwork to convert the wet pasture into a functioning wetland. Kemp coordinated with the school’s football coach and director of the agricultural education program, Mark Rodgers, who incorporated the wetland restoration activities into a hands-on learning experience for his students. Several of the students, like senior Jacob Baynham, hope to make farming a career. He will graduate from Wardlaw Academy in a few weeks and will attend an agricultural college in Georgia. “When you plant something and watch it grow, you feel a sense of accomplishment, and conservation is so important when it comes to farming,” Baynham said. Rodgers started the agricultural program two years ago and has been thrilled with the interest and enthusiasm from the students. The students spend 3 to 4 days a week working at the wetland easement.  “I want to inspire these students to care about the environment,” he said. The area was once pastures for livestock. The landowner worked with NRCS through the former Wetlands Reserve Program to create the wetland. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals. It’s estimated that 87 percent of the wetland losses from the mid-s to the mid-s were because of conversion to farms and ranches. This program aims to restore wetlands in places where they’re best suited. “We traditionally restore altered or degraded floodplains and forested depressions back to wetlands, so converting this pastureland back to its original hydrologic state was unique,” said Sudie Daves-Thomas, a wildlife biologist with NRCS. When wetlands are drained or altered, this can create very uniform topography through land leveling or other agricultural activities. This wetland restoration plan called for macrotopographic features, which are wetland “ridge and swale” areas. These are areas that will hold water after a rain event, and they create a diversity of water features, which aid in flood storage, enhance plant diversity and provide important wildlife habitat. The students helped create this wetland by planting almost all of the plants there. The area is now teeming with amphibians, birds, beneficial insects and native vegetation. Many migratory birds stop at wetland areas on the way to their winter or summer homes, and more than one-third of the United States’ threatened and endangered species live only in wetlands. This South Carolina wetland is now home to shorebirds, songbirds, waterfowl, egrets and herons. Thanks to the dedication and vision of Kemp and Rodgers, these students are getting a unique educational experience by witnessing what happens when a wetland comes back to life. This May, NRCS is celebrating American Wetlands Month by sharing the stories of wetland restoration, like this one in South Carolina.

"Conservation  Forestry  Jan 05,   Hunters, fishers and all wildlife enthusiasts – there’s a new USDA and Department of Interior council that is going to make the great outdoors even greater for you. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar have announced the new Wildlife and Hunting Heritage Conservation Council that will advise government on wildlife conservation and hunting issues. The Secretaries were joined by Governor Brian Schweitzer of Montana for the announcement at the Theodore Roosevelt Island national memorial in Washington, D.C. Sparked by the spirit Theodore Roosevelt, the new council focuses on the importance of hunting and fishing in American life and their connections to healthy lands and native species. The new council replaces the Sporting Conservation Council, bringing in members from the hunting and shooting sports industries and representatives of the nation’s major hunting organizations. The council will provide a forum for sports men and women to advise the Federal government on wildlife and habitat conservation. New opportunities partnerships will abound as the council brings together the public, the sporting conservation community, the shooting and hunting sports industry, wildlife conservation organizations, the States, Native American tribes, and the Federal government. USDA’s Natural Resource Conservation Service, Farm Service Agency and Forest Service and the Department of Interior’s U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land Management will provide support and guidance to the council.

"Better Adhesives Mean Stronger, Cheaper Wood Products  Although engineered wood — such as plywood or particle board — is great for a range of building and manufacturing uses, it has its limitations, especially in outdoor applications. One of the biggest limitations is not the wood, but the adhesive used to glue the wood veneers or particles together. These adhesives are one of the most significant costs in manufactured wood products.  Diane Banegas, Research and Development, Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Dec 30,   Respond to this story",What advancements have been made in adhesive technology to improve the strength and durability of engineered wood products such as plywood or particle board?,"Improved adhesive technology has enhanced the strength and durability of engineered wood products like plywood and particle board by using more effective adhesives, reducing costs, and increasing their suitability for outdoor applications."

"Deputy CIO, Policy and Planning in  Conservation  Technology  Jul 14,   Support for those affected by disasters is critical. By developing more comprehensive tools that prepare citizens and government before the next event helps.  Helping communities rebuild and become more resilient to extreme weather in the future is vital. Citizens need to be able to access accurate information in real time, before, during and after these devastating events. The growing open collaboration between producers and users can help with recovery efforts while being more transparent and local. Industry startups and others in the open- space have shown that they are an incredible resource when it comes to creating tools that citizens and government can use to be better prepared for a crisis. Open has made mobile apps possible that identify the location of hundreds of Automatic External Defibrillators (AEDs) when someone nearby is in need of a lifesaving procedure. Another app maps out all the fire hydrants in Boston, so volunteers can dig them out after a snowstorm. But, more can be done. According to Ann Mills, USDA Deputy Under Secretary of Natural Resources and Environment, “Open and the innovation it supports is essential to supporting 21st century disaster preparedness and planning in a climate changing world.” The USDA Open submission for this quarter concentrated on Disaster Relief . Seventy-four datasets were collected that related to disasters of all kinds.  It is USDA’s goal that the will be used to spur development of the tools necessary which would assist those needing help or those responding to help. We encourage you to use the USDA open sets to create solutions for communities. These datasets could give populations the ability to access the necessary resources in order to be better prepared for a disaster as well as promote economic recovery after one occurs.  Importantly, these resources also could help communities better prepare for future drought and other extreme weather events, and reduce their impact on livelihoods and their economy. We don’t know when the next disaster will strike, but we believe the open- movement is beginning to make government work better, save money and increase transparency. Both the private and public sectors need to step up and make comprehensive disaster preparedness technology a priority.

"Construction Begins on a Rural Kansas Fire Station with Financing from USDA and an Electric Cooperative  The City of Quinter, Kansas, had a groundbreaking ceremony for a new fire station earlier this month.  All of the city’s fire equipment will soon be under one roof, which will help improve the fire station’s efficiencies when crews respond to emergencies in its 400 square mile service area.  The new station is being built with funding support from USDA and a local electric cooperative. According to City of Quinter Administrator, Ericka Gillespie, the city of less than 1,000 needed a new fire station because the old facility was not meeting the needs of the community.  A larger space was needed for training, storage, and additional fire protection equipment and trucks.  The larger fire station will also improve the department's fire rating, resulting in lower insurance costs.

"Intermountain Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Dec 06,  The tranquility of winter camping is ideal at the Grizzly Ridge yurt on the Ashley National Forest in Utah. Numerous hiking, biking and off-road trails crisscross the area. (U.S. Forest Service) While some may close up tents and winterize recreational vehicles this time of year, there are others who look forward to a winter filled with adventures on forests and grasslands. The draw is yurts and historic cabins available to rent that offer a bit of solitude for camping, a dose of adventure on skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles, and a lifetime of memories. A yurt is a circular tent with canvas walls. There are many different styles and sizes of yurts, but generally each yurt is different in what it offers. Typically, you can expect to provide your own bedding, food, and cooking supplies. Some include beds, tables and chairs. Others have camp stoves and wood burning stoves. Check information on Recreation.gov before making your reservation and committing to a stay. Last year, Johanne Tuttle and her friends chose the Grizzly Ridge yurt on the Ashley National Forest in Utah. After skiing three miles to reach the yurt, they found it had a wood-burning stove to keep warm when they finished cross-country skiing or sledding down a small hill. Inside, they could relax, play cards and cook their meals. “We were actually really surprised to get up here and see how spacious the yurt is. It’s really spacious, big huge bunk beds, double sized, so you can easily fit two people on one bed,” Tuttle said. “It’s bigger than any yurt I've ever been in and plenty of room to move around and stretch out.” Tuttle’s group stayed for several days, packing in everything they needed and adhering to outdoor ethics and packing out their trash and leaving the yurt ready for the next campers. Jamie Tyson, Johanne Tuttle, Charity Parks and Chris Berry dine on a meal they cooked in the Grizzly Ridge yurt on the Ashley National Forest in Utah. The yurt comes with bare-bones cooking utensils. (U.S. Forest Service) Staying in a yurt or cabin is easy to do depending on the location of the cabin and whether use is seasonal or year-round. All reservations are made through Recreation.gov. However, most facilities are locked and can be accessed only after contacting the forest or grassland office. And as with any outdoor recreation adventure, preparation is key no matter which season you choose. Be sure you have the appropriate clothing, supplies and a local area map before you head out. The Forest Service offers paper maps for sale and digital maps for iOS and Android smart devices. Still not sure you want to stay in a yurt? To learn more about unique camping experiences on the Ashley National Forest, watch videos on the Grizzly Ridge yurt; Trout Creek Guard Station; and the Carter Military Yurt. Johanne Tuttle, Jamie Tyson, Charity Parks and Chris Berry head out for cross-country skiing after checking into the Grizzly Ridge Yurt on the Ashley National Forest in Utah. The primitive camping site is open year-round but many people are drawn to it for its feeling of isolation and for the cross-country and snowshoeing trails.

"Census and Survey Division Director, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Farming  Mar 22,  Keep celebrating National Ag Day by getting ready for the Census of Agriculture and make your voice heard! In just a few months, America’s farmers and ranchers will have the opportunity to strongly represent agriculture in their communities and industry by taking part in the Census of Ag. This National Ag Day, we are sharing the three things you can do now to help us in this tremendous endeavor. Only conducted every five years by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), the census captures a complete count of all U.S. farms, ranches, and those who operate them.  Even small plots of land – whether rural or urban – growing fruit, vegetables or some food animals count if $1,000 or more of such products were raised and sold, or normally would have been sold, during the census year. The census helps tell the whole story of U.S. agriculture. The last Census of Agriculture counted more than 2 million farms and ranches in the U.S. spanning over 914 million acres. Without the Census of Agriculture, we would not know that 3.ates – only one percent of our total population – provide food, fuel, and fiber to the nation and others around the world. The Census of Agriculture remains the only source of uniform, comprehensive, and impartial agriculture for every county in the nation. Census results are valuable to those who serve farmers and rural communities, including federal, state and local governments, agribusinesses, trade associations, extension educators, researchers, and farmers and ranchers themselves. Answers to the census can help grow a farm’s future, shape farm programs, and boost services for communities and the industry. Today, National Ag Day, and in the months to follow, we ask you to do three things: 1. Find out more about the Census of Agriculture by visiting www.agcensus.usda.gov; 2. Sign up to be counted in the Census of Agriculture, if you are involved with agriculture and have never participated in the Census before, and 3. Help spread the word so we can get a complete picture of U.S. agriculture. Become a Census of Agriculture Partner! Producers will receive their Census of Agriculture questionnaires this December. They will have the option to complete their form and return it by mail or use the Online Response to Census of Agriculture. Improved this year, the online census form is convenient, dynamic and user-friendly. It is accessible on any electronic device, calculates totals automatically, and skips questions that do not pertain to the operation. Remember, the Census of Agriculture is Your Voice, Your Future, Your Opportunity.

"Sniffing Out Disease: Dogs Trained for Wildlife Disease Surveillance  Odin is a Labrador retriever/border collie mix. By watching his wagging tail and alert expression, Colorado State University researcher Dr. Glen Golden can sense he is eager to begin his training. Odin is one of five dogs recently adopted from shelters and animal rescue centers to become detector dogs for wildlife disease surveillance. The dogs are housed and trained at the USDA-APHIS National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) in Fort Collins, Colorado. They are part of a collaborative 12-month program to evaluate the effectiveness of training and using dogs to detect and identify waterfowl feces or carcasses infected with avian influenza (AI). If successful, this collaboration may be extended an additional 12 months.

"NRCS National Agricultural Engineer and USDA People’s Garden Apiary Co-Beekeeper in  Conservation  Initiatives  Sep 03,   This story has three parts. Read Part 1 here. Read Part 2 here. For an hour or so, that’s how it went: on one side of the roof, I smoked the bees and removed capped frames, volunteers ran the capped frames over to the extractor on the other side of the roof, and the extractor team spun the honey out of the trays with the hand-cranked extractor. The centrifuged honey slid down the sides of the extractor into a sweet puddle at the bottom of the metal barrel. Everyone had a turn spinning the extractor (and maybe sneaking a taste of the fresh honey; but I can’t say for sure—I was on the other side of the roof).  Then the extractor broke! A couple of the teeth in the gear snapped off, making it impossible to turn the hand crank. Andy and Nathan decided to carry the extractor and the remaining full frames back to their office in Beltsville, Maryland, where they had another extractor and could finish the job. But first, we wanted to pour the first two jars of honey. At the bottom of the exterior of the extractor barrel was a small tap. Leslie handed me two jars and I tapped the beautiful, clear honey into the jars. It was a proud moment for all of us.  This is me with the first two bottles from the extractor. From now on we’ll be able to monitor the hive for when the frames are full—and thus determine a good time to harvest the honey—without disturbing the bees. That’s because, while we were in the middle of the honey harvest, we lifted the hive and placed a scale under it. The scale has a logger that will take readings of the hive every 10 minutes to evaluate weight gain and loss. So we’ll now know how much honey is in the hive without even cracking the lid.  This is the bottom of the hive resting on the scale, which has been set on top of cinderblocks.  In case you’re curious, we didn’t take all of the hive’s honey that day. We left the bees several partially full frames to build on. They feed the young that honey, and we didn’t want to make more work for them than we had to. After all, it’s hot out, and gathering nectar to make honey is hard work. And after Nathan and Andy finished putting all the honey in jars, they put the extractor, with its streaks of honey, back on the roof for the bees to harvest. Now that’s what I call recycling!  For the latest updates, follow the People's Garden, NRCS and ARS on Twitter.

Deidra McGee of the U.S. Forest Service began the program by outlining the key provisions of the Act: Title I—Voting Rights Barred unequal application of voter registration requirements. Title II—Public Accommodations Outlawed discrimination in hotels, motels, restaurants, theaters, and all other public accommodations engaged in interstate commerce. Title III—Desegregation of Public Facilities Permitted Justice Department suits to secure desegregation of certain public facilities. Title IV—Desegregation of Public Education Encouraged the desegregation of public schools and authorized the U. S. Attorney General to file suits to force desegregation. Title V—Civil Rights Commission Addressed procedures for the Commission, broadened its duties. Title VI—Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs Authorized but did not require withdrawal of federal funds from programs which practiced discrimination. Title VII—Equal Employment Opportunity Outlawed discrimination in employment in any business exceeding twenty five people and creates an Equal Employment Opportunities Commission to review complaints. Title VIII—Registration and Voting Statistics Directed the Census Bureau to collect registration and voting statistics based on race, color and national origin. Title IX—Intervention and Removal of Cases Made reviewable in high federal courts the action of federal district courts in remanding a civil rights case to state court and authorized the Attorney General to intervene in certain private suits. Title X—Community Relations Service Created the Service to aid communities in resolving disputes relating to discriminatory practices based on race, color, or national origin. Title XI—Miscellaneous* Born in rural Alabama, General Williams spoke of the long road to passage of the Act, and how he lived “through quite a bit of the struggle”.  He discussed the segregated Alabama school system, reading ‘handed down’ school books, riding in the back of a public bus from his town to attend college, and how, after joining the military, he was pulled over by vigilantes while driving. “These are memories you can never forget, but it made me stronger; a better person and things changed with time.” He said life in America is like a cafeteria: you can pick what you want, but at the end you have to pay a price.  “We are still coming together.” In conclusion, Deputy Assistant Secretary Shorter said that the Act “Gave me a chance for an education and is the beginning of the now-modern America.  It set the stage and we must celebrate what happened, but it is also a call for us to keep pushing forward and treating others as we would want to be treated.  Now go out and BE better.” *SOURCE: Congress and the Nation, -64 (Congressional Service, ): -41.

"FSA Public Affairs Specialist in  Forestry  Conservation  Oct 03,  Fires blaze from the Blacktail Fire, located in the Blacktail Creek area, east of Loco Mountain in the Crazy Mountains, in Montana. The Blacktail Fire engulfed a little over 5,000 acres, with over 1 million acres impacted across Montana through various wildfires. Dry conditions plagued Montana this summer, with multiple wildfires torching over 1 million acres throughout the state. The largest fire, the Lodgepole Complex fire, impacted over 270,000 acres. Recent rain and snow, and the forecast for continued precipitation, help to suppress the fires and provide welcome relief for Montana residents. Fires aren’t too uncommon in Montana, but this year’s fire season has been different. Spring brought plenty of moisture from an abundant snow-pack and provided adequate moisture for grass growth. The moisture quickly depleting leaving most of the state in drought condition. “Ranchers saw this as great grass and feed. Firefighters saw it as fuel,” said Dennis Garcia, Farm Service Agency (FSA) county executive director for Glacier County, Montana. Garcia was activated to serve in the National Guard during the wildfire suppression efforts near Lolo, Montana. FSA provides assistance to farmers and ranchers who have been impacted by natural disasters, including wildfires, by administering a suite of safety-net programs to help producers recover from eligible losses, such as the Livestock Indemnity Program, the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program, and the Tree Assistance Program. The programs can assist farmers and ranchers who lost livestock, grazing land, fences or eligible trees, bushes and vines as a result of the qualifying natural disaster. In addition, the FSA Emergency Conservation Program provides funding and technical assistance for farmers and ranchers to rehabilitate farmland damaged by natural disasters. Low-interest emergency loans are available to help producers recover from production and physical losses. Compensation is also available to producers who purchased coverage through the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, which protects non-insurable crops (including native grass for grazing) against natural disasters that result in lower yields, crop losses or prevented planting. As a result of the ongoing drought conditions, all Montana counties were approved for emergency haying and grazing of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres. Due to drought and fire conditions, 53 of the state’s 56 counties have been declared either primary or contiguous disaster areas. “The short term impact is FSA can do a lot of good for producers. Producers can get some relief, fix fences and get feed purchased,” Garcia said. Garcia said hay donations came into the state from other areas to help out ranchers in need. Additionally, FSA employees from other states, including Missouri and Oklahoma, have spent time helping Montana producers enroll in FSA disaster programs. “It is proof that the agriculture community is one big small town where you have a lot of folks that have camaraderie,” he said. Detailed information on all of these disaster assistance programs can be found online at: www.fsa.usda.gov/disaster. Or at the USDA Disaster Resource Center. The Lolo Peak Fire, southwest of Lolo, Montana, has impacted over 53,000 acres. The National Guard was activated to help with evacuation efforts near the wildfire.

"New Study Offers Sage Advice  For many, one of the New Year’s first big chores is to remove a tree from inside their home. Trees, beautiful and useful as they are, do not belong everywhere. Such is the case with trees and other woody species that are expanding into the Western grasslands. Over the years, woody species like juniper, pinyon pine, redcedar and mesquite have encroached on grassland and sagebrush ecosystems, altering these landscapes and making them unsuitable for native wildlife like the lesser prairie-chicken and greater sage-grouse. Encroaching conifers also degrade rangelands for agricultural producers whose livestock rely on nutritious forage.
