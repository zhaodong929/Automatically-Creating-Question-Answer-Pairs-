"What is nutrition security? Building on and complementing our long-standing efforts to address food security, we are expanding our efforts to advance food and nutrition security. Nutrition security means all Americans have consistent and equitable access to healthy, safe, affordable foods essential to optimal health and well-being. Our approach to tackling food and nutrition insecurity aims to:  Recognize that structural inequities make it hard for many people to eat healthy and be physically active; and  Emphasize taking an equity lens to our efforts.  Learn more  A household is food secure if all members, at all times, can access enough food for an active, healthy life. At a minimum, food security includes:  Readily available nutritionally adequate and safe foods, and  The ability to acquire those foods in socially acceptable ways (without resorting to emergency food supplies, scavenging, stealing, or other coping strategies).  Nutrition security means consistent access, availability, and affordability of foods and beverages that promote well-being, prevent disease, and, if needed, treat disease, particularly among racial/ethnic minority, lower income, and rural and remote populations including Tribal communities and Insular areas. Nutrition security is an emerging concept that complements efforts to increase food security while also:  Recognizing that Americans, in general, fall short of an active, healthy lifestyle aligned with Federal dietary and physical activity guidelines, and  Emphasizing equity to ensure our efforts serve all populations to promote access, availability, and affordability to foods and beverages, and address the connection between food insecurity and diet-related chronic diseases. View the Infographic (, 420 ) What is the problem? Poor nutrition is a leading cause of illness in the United States, associated with more than half a million deaths per year. It is linked with increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease as well as broader impacts including higher health care costs and decreased productivity.  Learn more  Poor nutrition is widespread  Though poor nutrition affects every demographic, diet-related diseases hit harder among historically underserved communities.  The overall diet quality score for Americans is 59 out of 100, indicating that the average American diet does not align with Federal dietary recommendations. However, the resulting health burden is not equally shared. Certain populations are at greater risk for diet-related disease. For example, Black and Indigenous children are more likely to have obesity than their white peers. Those who face food insecurity are also at greater risk.  Beyond the effect on health, poor nutrition and diet-related diseases have far-reaching impacts including decreased academic achievement and increased financial stress. That translates to societal impacts as well¡ªlower productivity, weakened military readiness, widening health disparities, and skyrocketing health care costs. For example, approximately 85 percent of current health care spending is related to management of diet-related chronic disease.  To make progress on these problems, Americans need equitable access to healthy foods that promote well-being. What is USDA doing? USDA wants input from all Americans on ways we can improve nutrition security. The department is particularly focused on strengthening and building new partnerships with all levels of government, the private sector, community-based organizations, and families. Together, we can make progress that will change lives and ensure a healthier, more prosperous future for all Americans.  Learn more  USDA¡¯s work to advance nutrition security focuses on four pillars:  Meaningful Support  Healthy Food  Collaborative Action  Equitable Systems  Research and evaluation  USDA¡¯s work on nutrition security is driven by research and grounded in science. In addition to the extensive research performed by the Food and Nutrition Service, the Agricultural Research Service has six human nutrition research centers, the Economic Research Service studies numerous topics central to food and nutrition security, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture advances food and nutrition security through research, education, extension, and innovation. Our work is also driven by the lived experiences ¨C of our staff and our stakeholders.  Learn more about our nutrition security research.

It includes having readily available safe and nutritious foods, as well as being able to acquire them in socially acceptable ways. **Nutrition Security:** Goes beyond food security by emphasizing the importance of equitable access to healthy, safe, affordable, and culturally competent foods that promote well-being, prevent disease, and treat disease, particularly among underserved populations. It aims to address the connection between food insecurity and diet-related chronic diseases. In terms of addressing disparities in health outcomes among underserved communities, nutrition security is a more comprehensive approach that recognizes the historical inequities and systemic barriers that make it difficult for many people to eat healthy and be physically active. By emphasizing equity and taking an equity lens to efforts, nutrition security aims to ensure that all populations have access to the foods and beverages they need to maintain good health, particularly among racial/ethnic minority, lower-income, and rural and remote communities.","**Key Differences Between Food Security and Nutrition Security** Food security and nutrition security are two related but distinct concepts that focus on different aspects of access to nutritious food. 1. **Food Security**: Refers to the availability, accessibility, and utilization of sufficient, safe, and nutritious food by all individuals in a community or country. It focuses on the physical availability and affordability of food. 2. **Nutrition Security**: Encompasses not just having access to food but also having access to a variety of foods that provide necessary nutrients for good health. It emphasizes the quality of the food consumed, focusing on the nutritional adequacy and diversity of diets. **Addressing Disparities in Health Outcomes** In addressing disparities in health outcomes among underserved communities, understanding the difference between food security and nutrition security is crucial: * **Food Security**: Focusing solely on increasing access to food may not necessarily lead to better health outcomes if the food available is of poor quality. In underserved communities, this might involve initiatives like food banks or soup kitchens, which can provide temporary relief but may not address underlying issues. * **Nutrition Security**: A more comprehensive approach that ensures access to a diverse range of nutritious foods can have a more direct impact on improving health outcomes. This could involve community-based programs promoting home gardening, cooking classes focusing on nutrient-dense meals, or even supporting local farmers' markets. **Key Considerations** To effectively address disparities in health outcomes among underserved communities: 1. **Community Engagement**: Involve the community in identifying their needs and developing solutions that are tailored to their specific circumstances. 2. **Holistic Approach**: Address not just food availability but also education, economic empowerment, and environmental factors that influence access to nutritious food. 3. **Sustainability**: Ensure programs are sustainable over time, with potential for scaling up or replication in other communities. 4. **Partnerships**: Foster partnerships among government agencies, non-profit organizations, community groups, and private sector entities to leverage resources and expertise. By understanding the differences between food security and nutrition security and tailoring approaches to address these disparities, it is possible to make meaningful strides in improving health outcomes among underserved communities.",0.052505924,0.373333333,0.126195029,0.217142857,0.858632565
"It's Time to Talk about the Birds and the Bees -- and the Butterflies, Bats and Beetles  Cross-posted from the Department of Interior blog: From birds and bees to butterflies, bats and beetles, pollinators are a diverse group and are critically important to terrestrial life on our planet. Without our help, however, their populations will continue to decline as a result of numerous stressors including loss of habitat, pests and pathogens, and exposure to pesticides. Bees and other pollinators are essential to America¡¯s agricultural economy and maintain the beauty of our iconic landscapes. Without them, we wouldn¡¯t have most of our vegetables, flowers, fruits or nuts. Honey-bee pollinations alone contribute more than $15 billion in value to U.S. agricultural production each year, but beekeepers reported losing just over 23 percent of honey bee colonies last winter. Other pollinators that help sustain food production and the environment¡ªsuch as native bees and bats¡ªalso are declining.

"Media Relations Officer, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Aug 04, 2011  The USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bee. From the booklet, the southeastern blueberry bee (Habropoda laboriosa) visiting blossoms of a rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium virgatum). When I was a kid, there was one category for bees ¨C ¡°the stinging kind.¡± Fear of being stung wouldn¡¯t allow me to consider variations among the swarms that patrolled playgrounds. The only thing that made bees tolerable was ¡­ the honey. Youthfully ignorant, I didn¡¯t know that there are thousands of bee species (and some bee species are stingless) or that those bees on the playgrounds were more life saving than threatening. The USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bees to educate the public and encourage people to help protect these essential insects. The 40-page booklet primarily focuses on bees native to North America, of which there are 4,000 species, found in forests, farms, cities, wildlands and deserts.  Although honey bees may be most noted for producing honey, the booklet explains that native bees are valued for pollinating plants. The USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bee. From the booklet, two female Morrison's bumble bees (Bombus morrisoni) sonicate the pollen from pored-anthers of a garden tomato.  ¡°Much of the produce we eat is pollinated by bees,¡± said Larry Stritch, a USDA Forest Service National Botanist. ¡°They pollinate about 75 percent of the fruits and vegetables grown in the (United States) and 80 percent of flowering plants. Take away bees and you greatly decrease our food source and food for animals.¡± According to ¡°Bee Basics,¡± ground nesting bees provide food to wildlife and aerate and enrich soil.    The North American bumble bee, characterized by their relatively large, black, furry bodies and bright stripes, may be most familiar to Americans. There are about 50 species of bumble bees, which are important pollinators of tomatoes and clovers, a forage crop for cattle. Bumble bees are among the Apidae family of bees, which also include native carpenter, squash and cuckoo bees, and nonnative stingless, orchid and honey bees. Honey bees are the only natural source of honey that¡¯s healthy for humans. Brought to America from Europe, honey bees don¡¯t pollinate native plants as effectively as native bees. Along with information about a variety of bees, ¡°Bee Basics¡± also contains pages of glossy, color illustrations of bees and plants. The booklet¡¯s key message warns of the threat to native-bee survival that is posed by pesticides, competition for nectar from honey bees, and environmental destruction. To learn more about native bees, read ¡°Bee Basics¡± on the Forest Service website.   The USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bee.

Pesticides 2. Competition for nectar from honey bees 3. Environmental destruction,"I don't have access to the specific information in the ""Bee Basics"" booklet regarding threats to native bee survival. However, based on general knowledge and research on bee conservation, I can provide some common threats that affect native bees and other pollinators: 1. **Habitat Loss and Destruction**: The destruction of natural habitats, including meadows and forests, reduces the availability of resources for native bees and leads to habitat fragmentation. 2. **Pesticide Use**: Pesticides, especially neonicotinoids, have been linked to bee deaths. They can harm bees directly or indirectly by affecting their food supply (flowers) and causing them to starve. 3. **Climate Change**: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns affect the timing of plant growth, making it harder for native bees to find nectar and pollen when they need it. 4. **Pollinator Diseases and Pests**: Like honeybees, native bees can be affected by diseases such as nosema and varroa mites, which weaken their populations. 5. **Invasive Species**: Non-native plants or animals that outcompete native species for resources can reduce the habitat available to native bees. 6. **Lack of Forage**: The increasing trend towards intensive agriculture and the reduction in wildflowers and other pollinator-friendly plants further reduces food availability for native bees. 7. **Urbanization**: As cities grow, natural habitats are destroyed, leaving little space or natural resources for native bees and other wildlife to thrive. These threats can vary by region depending on specific environmental conditions and human activities. The ""Bee Basics"" booklet likely addresses these and possibly other specific local concerns related to native bee survival.",7.42E-232,0.066666667,0,0.044444444,0.83868742
"District Wildlife Biologist, Region 5 Naturewatch Coordinator, Scott Salmon River Ranger District in  Forestry  Initiatives  Apr 23, 2010   In 1999, Yreka High School in Yreka, California received funds from a Forest Service Grant (Partners in Flight Program) to enhance their agriculture and natural resource program and provide wildlife habitat on school grounds. These funds were used to build a songbird garden, purchase fencing, materials for an irrigation system, and a greenhouse structure. The students and instructors constructed the fence, irrigation system and the greenhouse. The Songbird Garden Portion of the Yreka Community was funded by Partners in Flight Program. Then in the spring of 2009, the Siskiyou Gardens, Parks and Greenway Association (SGPGA) partnered with Yreka High School to develop a community garden and greenhouse. The Yreka Garden Club also agreed to help maintain the greenhouse in exchange for growing space. These organizations along with a number of community volunteers pulled their enthusiasm and resources together to make this project a reality. In a few short months they leveled the site, built the raised beds, fixed the fence and irrigation system, and started thousands of seedlings inside the greenhouse. Much of the heavy work was donated by members of the California Conservation Corps and some materials were donated by local businesses. The success of this community garden is the result of many enthusiastic volunteers. Approximately 25 beds were constructed as well as a flower beds to attract pollinators. The grand opening of this People¡¯s Garden was May 3, 2009.  Festivities included a ribbon-cutting ceremony, old-time music, a plant sale, and gardening workshops. The garden was teeming with enthusiasm through the summer, and by September many hundreds of pounds of fruit and vegetables were ready to be harvested and donations were made to Yreka Senior Center, Yreka Hospice, Grange Hall Community Hot Meals Program, and Yreka Community Food Bank.  Through these organizations produce was made available to an estimated 300-350 people. Six workshops were held here on topics related to gardening, greenhouses, starting seed, and food preservation. This spring and summer the Yreka Community Garden will be hold free classes on permiculture, greenhouse plantings, composting and mulching, and canning. Special thanks goes to their partners! Members of the California Conservation Corps (CCC) volunteered their services for a variety of work including clean up, construction of the raised beds and setting fresh gravel in the greenhouse. The Ford Family Foundation Leadership Training Group is sponsoring the construction of an outdoor classroom/gazebo. This structure is a special project led by a local leadership training class which has been fund-raising for this project for 7 months.  This project has received much support from local contributors including Rotary Club and in kind contributions from local contractors. The Yreka Community Garden will also be developing a Children's Garden that will feature educational planting beds, small water fountain/bird bath, butterfly garden, willow tunnel, native American cedar plank house, and benches and paths. This is being developed by an active community group including U.S. Forest Service biologists, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists, local teachers, child development specialists, and local gardeners.

However, I can provide you with some general information about composting and mulching practices that may be similar to those used by community gardens. Composting and mulching are effective methods for reducing waste and creating a sustainable environment. Some innovative ways that community gardens might implement these practices include: * Using worm composting or vermicomposting, which involves using worms to break down food waste into a nutrient-rich compost. * Implementing a ""no-till"" or ""reduced-till"" approach, where mulch is used to suppress weeds and reduce soil erosion instead of tilling the soil. * Creating a community composting program, where residents can bring in their organic waste to be composted on-site or at a local facility. * Using a compost tea maker, which brews the nutrient-rich liquid from compost and adds it to the soil as a natural fertilizer. * Implementing a mulch-making program, where leaves and other yard trimmings are collected and turned into a nutrient-rich mulch for garden beds. * Creating a community garden with rainwater harvesting system, where rainwater is collected and used for irrigation instead of potable water.",2.86E-155,0.251851852,0.014925373,0.103703704,0.837630272
"What is the Nine Agency Rule? The U.S. Department of Agriculture¡¯s (USDA) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights (OASCR) enforces the Nine Agency Rule under the authority delegated by the Secretary of Agriculture, pursuant to 7 C.F.R. ¡ì 2.25 (a)(1)(3). The Nine Agency Rule is designed to ensure that USDA programs of civil rights, including program delivery, compliance, and equal employment opportunity, adhere to all governing laws, rules, and regulations, including related Executive Orders and Congressional mandates. On February 14, 2021, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., signed Executive Order 14015, establishing the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, emphasizing the importance of partnering with civil society, including faith-based and secular organizations, to serve people in need while adhering to all governing laws. This Executive Order revoked Executive Order 13831 and reinstated key provisions to protect religious liberty. Key Provisions of the Nine Agency Rule  Equal Access for Faith-Based Organizations  Under 7 CFR ¡ì 16, faith-based organizations are eligible to access and participate in USDA assistance programs on the same basis as any other organization. USDA and its intermediaries must not discriminate against or for an organization based on its religious character, motives, affiliation, or lack thereof.  Non-Discrimination Against Beneficiaries  Organizations receiving direct or indirect Federal financial assistance from USDA must not discriminate against current or prospective beneficiaries based on religion, religious belief, refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice.  Separation of Religious Activities  Organizations that receive USDA direct assistance must separate any explicitly religious activities in time or location from the programs or services funded by USDA direct assistance, ensuring participation in such activities is voluntary. This restriction does not apply to indirect Federal financial assistance.  Notification Requirements  Recipients administering USDA social service programs must notify beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries of their right to be free from religious discrimination and how to report violations.  Alternative Providers  If a beneficiary objects to the religious character of a faith-based provider, the USDA awarding agency must make reasonable efforts to refer the beneficiary to an alternative provider.  Protections for Faith-Based Providers  Faith-based providers can compete equally with secular organizations for USDA awards while retaining their religious character, provided they comply with all applicable regulations. Examples of Nine Agency Rule Violations  Denied Service Based on Religious Beliefs  A food pantry volunteer denies service to an individual wearing a religious head covering and makes derogatory remarks about their faith.  Discriminatory Practices by Service Providers  A service provider receiving USDA funds denies services to a homeowner based on their perceived religion, using offensive language, and failing to address the discrimination. How to File a Complaint Any individual who believes they have been discriminated against based on religion, religious belief, refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice may file a complaint with OASCR.

"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication, and Larry Stritch, U.S. Forest Service National Botanist in  Forestry  May 03, 2012  Wildflower displays of blue Wasatch Penstemon and white Nuttall¡¯s linanthus wildflowers bloom in the subalpine meadows of Albion Basin on the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest from mid-July through early August.  As spring begins across the nation, fields are turning green ¨C and pastel pink, flaming scarlet, electric orange, brilliant yellow, deep violet and florescent blue.   Wildflowers are abloom!  This year, the Forest Service has released an updated wildflower map with 317 viewing areas to choose from on America¡¯s national forests and grasslands.  In addition to locations, information is also provided on the best time for peak viewing. Yellow fritillaries are some of the first plants to bloom after the snow melts and are found in the western United States.  ¡°Every year we continue to add new wildflower viewing areas,¡± said Larry Stritch, the U.S. Forest Service National Botanist.  ¡°This year, we have updated the map so visitors can search by geographical region, state or national forest or grassland.  This makes it easier to plan day trips or extended journeys to enjoy the colorful displays of Mother Nature¡¯s catalog of wildflowers.¡± Due to an extremely mild winter, an early spring is appearing in many areas and wildflower season has begun.  The pageantry begins with spring ephemerals such as bloodroot, Virginia bluebells, and squirrel corn.   Spring ephemerals are woodland wildflowers which appear in early spring, flower, set seed, and then die back to their underground parts before the trees unfurl their leaves. Other spring wildflowers seen in early spring include wild gingers, hepaticas, and trilliums. In late summer and early fall, the last wildflowers of the year begin to flower including asters, sunflowers, goldenrods, cardinal flower and gentians. Red columbine begin flowering in early spring in a cascade of blooms from the southern states on the Gulf of Mexico north into Canada.  The updated map includes a narrative for each viewing area which describes the area¡¯s botanical habitat and wildflowers types that can be found by season, as well as recommendations for the best time of year to visit.  Safety advisories such as animal habitats, clothing recommendations, insect or plant cautions, and traffic and parking tips are provided.  Directions to the site, the closest town and contacts for more information are also offered. The map is part of the agency¡¯s Celebrating Wildflowers web site which includes more than 10,000 plant images and over 1,500 pages of information about the aesthetic, recreational, biological, medicinal, and economic values of native plants as well how to conserve native plant habitats.

The best time to see yellow fritillaries (Fritillaria pudica) and linanthus wildflowers (Linanthus grandiflorus) in the western United States is during late spring to early summer. In general: * Yellow fritillaries typically bloom from mid-April to late May, depending on the elevation and location. * Linanthus wildflowers usually bloom from late April to early July, with peak blooming occurring in May and June. These flowers are among the first to emerge after the snow melts in the western United States. As a result, their blooming periods can vary slightly from year to year, depending on weather conditions. To maximize your chances of seeing these beautiful wildflowers, plan your visit to the western United States during late spring (May 15th to June 15th), when they are likely to be in full bloom. Some popular locations for spotting yellow fritillaries and linanthus include: * The Rocky Mountains * The Sierra Nevada mountain range in California * The Cascade Range in Oregon and Washington Keep in mind that these flowers often grow in areas with relatively high elevations (4,000-7,000 feet) and may be more difficult to spot at lower elevations.

"APHIS Wildlife Biologists Aid Squirrel Recovery on the Delmarva  Many claim that 2020 has been a year of chaos and calamity, but for one rare squirrel, it might be a year of hope and new beginnings. The Delmarva Fox Squirrel (DFS) is a subspecies of fox squirrel found on the eastern shore of Maryland, Southern Delaware and Virginia. This pudgy, slow squirrel with its signature size and silvery-white coat has become a conservation success story in Maryland. Habitat loss along with other additive factors landed them on the Federal endangered species list in 1967. Protection and management efforts benefited DFS and in 2015, populations reached stable limits and they were officially delisted in Maryland. In parts of Delaware, DFS populations were not as prolific and numbers began to dwindle over time leaving only a few small populations.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service-Florida Plant Materials Center in  Conservation  Animals  Plants  May 08, 2014  In northern Florida wildflowers are planted in an unused part of this farm field to provide habitat for pollinators. USDA photo. No matter what part of the country you grew up in, most of us have fond childhood memories of the wildflowers that sprung up each year around our homes, parks and roadsides. For many, this fondness has carried into our adult years. This week, we celebrate National Wildflower Week as a way to share our interest and to increase public awareness for wildflowers in the landscape. The beauty of wildflowers can indeed stir up memories of a certain place or time. But the wildflowers that are native to a particular place also serve an important function in the ecology of that place. Native wildflowers are those species that were already growing in an area before settlers came and planted their favorite flowers from their homelands. Plants that are native to an area are better adapted to the local growing conditions than non-native ones. They are generally easier to establish, require less water and fertilizer and are more tolerant of the pests and diseases found in that area. Many populations of native wildflowers have been lost because of urban development, competition from invasive plant species and some modern farming practices. We¡¯ve learned that agriculture can benefit from native wildflowers. Patches of wildflowers located adjacent to crop fields can attract insects and other types of wildlife that in turn pollinate the crop and increase yields. In fact, more than a third of the world¡¯s food crops are dependent on pollinators to produce fruit. USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is working to combat this decline of wildflowers by promoting planting of them on farms and ranches. Several of the Farm Bill programs that NRCS administers have specific financial incentives tied to planting wildflowers. NRCS also maintains a national network of Plant Materials Centers that can provide information on which native wildflowers to plant to improve pollinator habitat and guidance on recommended methods for establishing and maintaining wildflower plantings. At the Plant Materials Center where I work, we recently partnered with the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation to track flowering periods of several native wildflowers. This information is being used to help develop seeding mixes for attracting pollinators to crops grown in Florida. Flowering periods of the crop and the wildflowers that we plan to use to attract pollinators must be in sync for successful pollination to occur. The information we gather can help determine the best wildflower species for farmers to plant in field borders, contour buffer strips and other conservation practices to ensure pollination of their crops.

The USDA's NRCS promotes their planting through financial incentives tied to Farm Bill programs and provides guidance through national Plant Materials Centers on selecting native wildflower species for pollinator habitat and optimal flowering periods.","Native wildflowers play a crucial role in pollination of crops by providing a source of food for pollinators such as bees, butterflies, moths, and other beneficial insects. These native wildflowers produce nectar and pollen that serve as essential nutrients for these animals, which are vital for the reproduction and growth of many crops. By planting native wildflowers on farms and ranches, landowners can help to: 1. **Increase pollinator populations**: Native wildflowers provide a source of food for pollinators during their peak activity periods, helping to sustain them throughout the growing season. 2. **Diversify pollinator sources**: By offering multiple sources of nectar and pollen, native wildflowers reduce dependence on single crops or specific pollinator species, making farms and ranches more resilient to environmental stressors. 3. **Enhance ecosystem services**: Native wildflowers contribute to soil health, improve water quality, and support beneficial insects that prey on pests, further enhancing the overall ecosystem services provided by these lands. The USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) promotes the planting of native wildflowers on farms and ranches through various programs and incentives, including: 1. **Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP)**: Provides financial assistance to landowners for implementing conservation practices, such as planting native wildflowers, that improve soil health, water quality, and pollinator populations. 2. **Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP)**: Offers technical and financial assistance to landowners who implement conservation practices, including the use of native wildflowers, to achieve environmental benefits and enhance ecosystem services. 3. **Planting for Pollinators**: A voluntary program that provides resources and guidance to help farmers and ranchers plant pollinator-friendly habitats, including native wildflowers, on their lands. By supporting the planting of native wildflowers, NRCS helps landowners contribute to a more diverse, resilient, and sustainable agricultural landscape, ultimately improving crop yields and promoting environmental stewardship.",2.74E-155,0.212389381,0.047477745,0.147492625,0.850980401

"Secretary Vilsack Announces New Steps to Address Climate Change  Earlier today it was my privilege to address those attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Cancun, Mexico. Climate change is one of the greatest threats facing our planet, and the United States is taking significant action to meet this challenge. Under President Obama¡¯s leadership, the U.S. is advancing policies that address climate change by promoting energy efficiency in our homes, cars and businesses, increasing the domestic production of clean energy ¨C including biofuels ¨C and by investing in renewable energy technology.  The United States is also vigorously engaged in international climate negotiations while continuing to work with Congress on domestic climate legislation.  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack  Posted in  Dec 09, 2010  1 Response",What role do biofuels play in the US strategy to address climate change under President Obama?,"The US is increasing domestic production of clean energy, including biofuels, as part of its efforts to promote energy efficiency and address climate change.","Under President Obama, the role of biofuels in the US strategy to address climate change was to provide a renewable and low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels. As part of his administration's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change, the Obama Administration set a goal to produce 36 billion gallons of biofuels by 2022. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, established in 2007 and strengthened under President Obama, was a key component of this strategy. The RFS mandated that a minimum percentage of the country's transportation fuels come from renewable sources, such as corn ethanol, advanced biofuels, and other biomass-based fuels. Biofuels were seen as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, which accounts for approximately 30% of US emissions. By using biofuels, the Administration aimed to: 1. Reduce dependence on fossil fuels: Biofuels offered a domestic source of energy that could be produced from renewable biomass sources such as plants, algae, or agricultural waste. 2. Mitigate climate change: By reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, biofuels were seen as a key part of the Obama Administration's efforts to address climate change. 3. Promote energy independence: Biofuels were expected to reduce reliance on foreign oil and promote domestic energy production. However, it is worth noting that the effectiveness of biofuels in addressing climate change has been debated, particularly with regards to land use changes and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with their production. Some critics have argued that large-scale biofuel production could lead to increased deforestation, soil degradation, or competition for food crops, potentially negating any environmental benefits. Overall, under President Obama, biofuels played a significant role in the US strategy to address climate change by providing a renewable and low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels.",5.06E-79,0.124223602,0.04375,0.105590062,0.863964617
"A Reflection: Celebrating Eight Years of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships  Looking back at USDA¡¯s efforts to help rural America thrive, I am truly proud of the impact our diverse partners, both from faith and secular communities, have had within their communities. On behalf of the USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, I would like to say thank you to our partners these past eight years as well as reflect on a few notable highlights of the work we have achieved together. USDA touches the lives of all Americans every day, whether they realize it or not. While our programs to reduce food insecurity are well known, our nation¡¯s most vulnerable citizens can still be hard to reach. Faith-based and community partners have been especially helpful in this area, particularly when it comes to feeding children in summer months, when school is out of session. In collaboration with many partners, including Catholic Charities USA, the Church of God in Christ, Islamic Relief USA, the National Baptist Convention and the Salvation Army, USDA increased the number of summer meals served to kids by 16% between 2009 and 2015, a total of more than 1.2 billion summer meals served when school is out and food is scarce.

Here are some key roles they've played: 1. **Summer Food Service Programs**: Many FBOs, like The Salvation Army, partner with government agencies to operate Summer Food Service Programs (SFSP). These programs provide meals and snacks to children in low-income areas during the school break. 2. **Meal Distribution and Delivery**: FBOs have established networks of volunteers, vehicles, and storage facilities to distribute and deliver meals to underserved communities. This ensures that vulnerable children have access to nutritious food throughout the summer. 3. **Community Engagement and Outreach**: Faith-based organizations engage with local community leaders, schools, and social services to identify areas with high food insecurity rates. They also conduct outreach efforts to inform parents and caregivers about available resources. 4. **Culturally Sensitive Food Provision**: FBOs often tailor their programs to meet the specific needs of diverse communities. This includes providing culturally sensitive meals and accommodations for children with dietary restrictions or allergies. 5. **Volunteer Mobilization**: Faith-based organizations have extensive networks of volunteers, who provide invaluable support in meal preparation, delivery, and distribution. This not only amplifies the reach of their programs but also fosters community cohesion. 6. **Capacity Building and Partnerships**: FBOs like The Salvation Army collaborate with other organizations, government agencies, and local businesses to leverage resources, expertise, and funding. This enables them to scale up their services and create more sustainable solutions for food insecurity. Studies have shown that these efforts can lead to positive outcomes, such as: * Reduced food insecurity rates among children * Improved academic performance and attendance * Enhanced social-emotional well-being and behavior * Increased access to healthy foods in underserved areas The Salvation Army's specific initiatives, like their Summer Food Program, demonstrate the organization's commitment to addressing food insecurity and promoting childhood health and development.

"People¡¯s Garden Intern in  Conservation  Initiatives  May 28, 2010   Today, the People¡¯s Garden hosted a workshop about composting. Pat Millner, who has done a lot of research on composting and utilizing compost at the USDA-Agricultural Research Service¡¯s Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Maryland, taught it. It was fantastically fun and informative, and Pat brought in several examples of composters for us to see. She informed us that composting isn¡¯t as complicated as it might seem. Composts work because microorganisms break down the material, and these microorganisms need three things to be healthy, happy and produce lots of compost: food, air, and water. If compost contains these three principles, it will be fruitful. If you are looking to start a composter, the best season to start it is the fall. First, you need a bin. Layer about 4¡± of sticks (from any type of tree or shrub) in the bottom of the bin, this will provide good air flow and ventilation for the microorganisms and the compost. In your lawn, let your grass grow a little bit taller, and let the leaves fall too. Take your lawnmower and go over the area, catching the leaf/grass mix in a bag. You can put this mix in the bin, and let it take care of itself! What about those of us who live in a condo or apartment and don¡¯t have a lawn, or just want a smaller compost? Try a vermicomposter. A vermicomposter uses worms to break down material into compost. You can ¡°feed¡± the worms in the composter veggie and fruit scraps, coffee grounds and filters, crushed eggshells, shredded office paper, and even dryer lint. However, the worms aren¡¯t fond of citrus fruits. Meat and dairy products should always stay out of composts too, the smell may attract some unwanted critters. The worms will consume what you feed them, and there¡¯s no need to worry about them escaping. Their castings (a fancy way to say worm poop) make for very healthy compost! Before, when I heard about compost, the only use I knew was to enrich soil. Compost is used for much more! Runoff can create erosion and sweep away the healthy topsoil in many areas. A compost sock is a material that is filled with compost, and can be put on the side of a sloping hill, for example, to provide a filter for runoff rainwater. This can filter out any unwanted silt and even oil. Compost has also been added to places where chemicals or lead have contaminated the soil, causing plant life to die off; there, compost enriches the soil again and also blocks the harmful chemicals from being absorbed by the plants. If you¡¯re looking for more information on composting, take a look at The People¡¯s Garden Healthy Workshop handout on composting. It¡¯s a great resource. Start a worm composter with newspaper or shredded office paper as bedding and about one pound of redworms.

Water A compact alternative to traditional composting for urban residents is a vermicomposter, which uses worms to break down material into compost.","**Essential Elements for Microorganisms in Composting:** The three essential elements that microorganisms need to break down compost are: 1. **Carbon**: This provides energy for the microorganisms, which can be found in organic materials such as food waste, leaves, and grass clippings. 2. **Nitrogen**: This is necessary for protein synthesis and cell growth in microorganisms, which can be found in materials like vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, and eggshells. 3. **Moisture**: Microorganisms require a certain level of moisture to survive and carry out the composting process, typically between 40% and 60%. **Compact Alternative to Traditional Composting for Urban Residents:** A compact alternative to traditional composting for urban residents is using a **Worm Composter**, also known as a Vermicomposter. This system utilizes red wiggler worms (Eisenia fetida) to break down organic waste into a nutrient-rich compost in a relatively small space. Worm composters are ideal for urban areas with limited outdoor space, as they: * Use minimal space (about 1-2 square feet) * Are quiet and odor-free * Can handle a variety of organic waste, including meat and dairy products * Produce a high-quality compost rich in nutrients and microorganisms * Are relatively low-maintenance and require minimal monitoring Overall, worm composting is an efficient and space-saving way for urban residents to recycle their food waste and produce a valuable compost for gardening and other uses.",0.049208236,0.2,0.096774194,0.176,0.854763508
"A Small Business Dream Built on a Farmers Market  My mom raised five kids, taught high school chemistry for 15 years and then retired back to the family farm in 1986.

Some specific CA practices that have been developed or adopted by these communities include: 1. **No-till or reduced-tillage farming**: Many American Indian and Alaska Native farmers have implemented no-till or reduced-tillage systems, which minimize soil disturbance and reduce erosion. This practice is particularly effective in areas with fragile soils or high rainfall. 2. **Mulching and cover cropping**: Communities have used mulches made from crop residues, wood chips, or other organic materials to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. Cover crops, such as clover or rye, are also planted between cash crops to add nutrients, improve soil health, and provide a habitat for beneficial insects. 3. **Crop rotation**: Traditional crop rotation practices have been revived, involving the sequential planting of different crops to break disease and pest cycles, maintain soil fertility, and promote biodiversity. 4. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**: American Indian and Alaska Native farmers often incorporate IPM strategies, which involve using a combination of techniques, such as crop rotation, biological control, and cultural practices, to manage pests and diseases in a holistic way. 5. **Soil conservation and restoration**: Many communities have developed or adopted soil conservation and restoration practices, including terracing, contour farming, and planting native vegetation to protect watersheds, prevent erosion, and improve soil health. 6. **Agroforestry**: Some American Indian and Alaska Native farmers have incorporated agroforestry systems, which involve growing trees alongside crops to create a more diverse and resilient farm ecosystem. 7. **Native crop selection and breeding**: Communities have identified and developed or adopted native crop varieties that are well-suited to their local climate, soil conditions, and cultural traditions. These crops often possess inherent disease resistance and tolerance, reducing the need for external inputs. 8. **Organic farming**: Many American Indian and Alaska Native farmers have transitioned to organic farming methods, which emphasize natural soil fertility, pest management, and crop selection.

"Director, Arthur Carhart National Wilderness Training Center in  Forestry  Feb 10, 2012   When the first Europeans settled in what is now the United States, they found a continent of extensive wildlands. In less than 500 years, the undeveloped nature of these wildlands has been reduced significantly. As they became increasingly scarce and a fledgling conservation movement lost natural treasures like Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley to development, Americans began to appreciate their value. View of the Sawtooth Range in Idaho. U.S. Forest Service photo. With passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964, a new course in history was chartered -- to preserve some of the country's last remaining wild places and protect their natural processes and values from development. The interagency Arthur Carhart National Wilderness Training Center, located in Missoula, Mont., was created in 1993 to empower federal agency employees and the public to preserve their wilderness heritage through training, information and education. It has become a critical resource for land managers from the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service as they manage more than 109 million acres of designated wilderness from Alaska to Puerto Rico. The center¡¯s staff of seven works with experts within and outside the agencies to develop comprehensive interagency solutions to critical stewardship issues. Materials are distributed electronically to each of the 792 units comprising America's National Wilderness Preservation System, and training is offered where it is most needed. Most recently, in collaboration with the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute and the Wilderness Institute at the University of Montana, the center conducted a webinar called The Foundation and Qualities of Wilderness Character.

"A Reflection: Celebrating Eight Years of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships  Looking back at USDA¡¯s efforts to help rural America thrive, I am truly proud of the impact our diverse partners, both from faith and secular communities, have had within their communities. On behalf of the USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, I would like to say thank you to our partners these past eight years as well as reflect on a few notable highlights of the work we have achieved together. USDA touches the lives of all Americans every day, whether they realize it or not. While our programs to reduce food insecurity are well known, our nation¡¯s most vulnerable citizens can still be hard to reach. Faith-based and community partners have been especially helpful in this area, particularly when it comes to feeding children in summer months, when school is out of session. In collaboration with many partners, including Catholic Charities USA, the Church of God in Christ, Islamic Relief USA, the National Baptist Convention and the Salvation Army, USDA increased the number of summer meals served to kids by 16% between 2009 and 2015, a total of more than 1.2 billion summer meals served when school is out and food is scarce.

"Tips for Handwashing When Running Water is Not Accessible  By now, many of us have heard several times that washing hands with soap and water is an effective way to get rid of germs, including those that cause foodborne illness. We are advised to wash our hands often, especially before and after handling food. This advice is easy to follow when we have access to clean, running water. But how do you wash your hands if you find that clean, running water is out of reach?

Here are some alternatives: 1. **Hand Sanitizers**: Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% ethanol or isopropanol. Rub the gel or spray all over your hands, making sure to cover all surfaces until it's dry. 2. **Waterless Hand Cleaning Wipes**: These are pre-moistened wipes made of a non-irritating material that can be used as an alternative to soap and water. Look for ones containing antibacterial agents. 3. **Baby Wipes**: While not designed for hand hygiene, baby wipes can serve as a temporary solution in emergency situations when running water is unavailable. Use them only if no other options are available. 4. **Alcohol-based Sprays**: Similar to hand sanitizers but in a spray form, these can be used on the hands and surfaces that need disinfecting. It's essential to note that while these alternatives can help reduce the number of germs on your hands, they may not provide the same level of cleanliness as washing with soap and water. In situations where running water is not available for an extended period, prioritizing handwashing as soon as possible remains the most effective method for maintaining good hygiene. **Additional Tips:** - Always use these alternatives in conjunction with proper hand technique, including rubbing all surfaces of your hands together to ensure thorough cleaning. - If you're using a sanitizing wipe or spray on dirty hands that have visible dirt and grime, consider washing those parts first with water if possible, before proceeding with the alternative method. - When in doubt about whether these alternatives are appropriate for your situation, consult local health guidelines or medical professionals for specific advice.",0.029452725,0.099337748,0.066666667,0.092715232,0.852942824

Winterport Water District has received a total of $1.89 million for essential upgrades to its infrastructure, including the replacement of over 6,000 feet of sewer line. The funds will ensure that partially treated sewage no longer flows into the Maine¡¯s Penobscot River. Minimizing the environmental impact on Maine's pristine rivers and streams is a priority that we all share and it is important to note that funds invested in this project ensure that the Penobscot River will be safe from partially treated sewage or other contaminants, preserving it for the communities who share it for recreation, fishing, and so much more. Winterport Water District's ratepayers have the 4th highest sewer rates in the state, with users paying nearly 2 percent of their income for user fees. The increase in user rates for this project will be greatly reduced because of the use of grant funds.USDA Rural Development is providing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act dollars in the amount of $710,000. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection is providing $1,185,ate Revolving Loan Fund. Longtime resident of Winterport, 88-year-old Teddy Weston was on hand to celebrate the project, which is near and dear to her heart.

"Research in Energy Security Helps Lead to Food Security in West Africa  Research shows the majority of people in Africa depend on biomass to meet their energy needs, with approximately 80 percent relying on wood energy. Such high dependency makes families vulnerable to unexpected and sudden changes, including extreme weather and socio-political events. Researching and developing ways to diversify energy sources is crucial for a more sustainable, food secure future. A project funded through the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) Cochran Fellowship Program on ¡°Biofuels for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods,¡± hosted by the University of Missouri (MU) College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources International Programs, set out to address this very issue. The research and training program was organized for West African Cochran Fellows to learn how different uses of biofuels can help support sustainable livelihoods in their communities. The two-week-long program consisted of workshops, field visits and interactive discussions in cooperation with the USDA Forest Products Laboratory, the MU Center for Agroforestry, Columbia Center for Urban Agriculture and Envest Microfinance.

"Foreign Agricultural Service in  Initiatives  Trade  Mar 01, 2011  Mr. Rode is pictured here with Thom Wright, a FAS agricultural attach¨¦ in India, and one of Mr. Rode¡¯s American-origin Holstein crosses which won a milk production award at the Progressive Dairy Farmers Association show. Halfway around the world, a farmer in India stands proudly in the winner¡¯s circle with his cow. Mr. S. Sukharpreet Singh Rode, the farmer, is a 2008 graduate of the Cochran Fellowship Program, an educational exchange program administered by USDA¡¯s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS). As a Cochran fellow, Mr. Rode spent two weeks at the University of Wisconsin learning about innovative techniques on animal husbandry, improved feeding practices, animal diseases and treatments, and calf rearing. With this background, Mr. Rode returned to India, where he used high-quality American dairy cattle genetics to improve his dairy business in the Punjab region, one of the most fertile areas in India. The cow in the winner¡¯s circle with Mr. Rode is one of his American-origin Holstein crosses (crossed with a local Indian cow), and in February it won a milk production award at the Progressive Dairy Farmers Association show near Ludhiana. India is the world¡¯s largest dairy producer and maintains the world¡¯s largest dairy herd. Given population and income growth in India, Indian farmers are now looking for new management tools and technologies to increase local production and meet growing demand. U.S. cattle genetics are well adapted to Indian farming practices and are already providing significant milk yield increases for Indian farmers. Working closely with the FAS office in New Delhi, India, American genetics companies are helping India build its genetics technology. At the same time, the United States will benefit from a new market for American cattle genetics exports, which holds potential for significant growth. The FAS Cochran Program, which gave Mr. Rode the training he needed to improve his business, provides U.S.-based agricultural training opportunities for agriculture professionals like Mr. Rode from foreign countries. To be selected for the program, fellows must be senior or mid-level specialists and administrators from public and private sectors concerned with agricultural trade, agribusiness development, management, policy, and marketing. In the end, the Cochran Fellowship Program helps to support U.S. exports and build long-term relationships with trading partners. Mr. Rode¡¯s story is an example of how USDA and FAS work to promote U.S. exports through a variety of programs which benefit the United States and other countries around the world.

"Water Quality Trading in the Chesapeake Bay  Last fall, USDA brought together a group of Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) awardees, state policymakers, and other stakeholders involved in one of the most challenging nutrient management initiatives in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed: enabling water quality trading markets. Water quality trading offers flexibility to those required to improve water quality in the Bay: power plants, wastewater treatment plants, new developments, and agricultural producers, among others. It allows those facing high costs of water quality improvement to reduce those costs, working with farmers to improve water quality on their behalf, thus providing farmers with additional income streams and the opportunity to significantly increase the scope of conservation practices on their land.  Kate Zook, Office of the Chief Economist  Posted in  Conservation  Dec 16, 2013  Respond to this story",How can water quality trading markets benefit farmers and policymakers by enabling cost-effective nutrient management and promoting conservation practices?,"Water quality trading markets allow farmers to earn additional income streams by improving water quality on their land, while also providing policymakers with a cost-effective way to manage nutrients in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.","Water quality trading markets (WQTM) are innovative approaches that allow farmers, industries, and municipalities to buy and sell credits for excess nutrient reductions. This system promotes the adoption of best management practices (BMPs), which can benefit both farmers and policymakers in several ways: **Benefits to Farmers:** 1. **Cost-effective nutrient management**: By buying credits from other farmers or entities that have already implemented effective BMPs, farmers can offset their own nutrient reduction costs. 2. **Increased revenue streams**: Farmers can sell excess nutrient reduction credits, providing a new income source and incentivizing them to adopt conservation practices. 3. **Improved crop yields and soil health**: Implementing BMPs like cover cropping, rotational grazing, or integrating organic amendments can lead to healthier soils, improved water infiltration, and increased crop yields. **Benefits to Policymakers:** 1. **Efficient nutrient reduction targets**: WQTM allows policymakers to set and achieve specific nutrient reduction targets more effectively by utilizing the collective efforts of various stakeholders. 2. **Reduced infrastructure costs**: By promoting BMPs, policymakers can reduce the need for costly infrastructure projects like wastewater treatment plants or agricultural drainage systems. 3. **Enhanced environmental protection**: WQTM encourages farmers to adopt conservation practices that protect water quality and promote sustainable agriculture. **Key Principles:** 1. **Transparent credit system**: A reliable credit trading system is essential to ensure that credits are properly accounted for, and the market functions smoothly. 2. **Incentivizing BMPs**: The market should encourage farmers to implement effective BMPs by offering a fair price for their excess nutrient reductions. 3. **Stakeholder engagement**: Policymakers must engage with farmers, industries, and other stakeholders throughout the development and implementation of WQTM. Overall, water quality trading markets provide a flexible, cost-effective framework that benefits both farmers and policymakers while promoting sustainable agriculture practices and improving environmental protection.",0.013395876,0.165644172,0.049382716,0.104294479,0.839839578

Diane Banegas, Research and Development, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Oct 18, 2016  Respond to this story",Can traditional knowledge from local communities be effectively integrated into sustainability science to help preserve ecosystems for future generations?,"Yes,  ecologists like John Parrotta believe that traditional knowledge from local communities can be effectively integrated into sustainability science to inform conservation practices and preserve ecosystems.","Yes, traditional knowledge from local communities can be effectively integrated into sustainability science to help preserve ecosystems for future generations. In fact, incorporating traditional knowledge has been recognized as a key strategy in promoting sustainable development and conservation of natural resources. Here are some reasons why: 1. **Local context**: Traditional knowledge is often rooted in the local culture and environment, providing a nuanced understanding of ecosystem dynamics and the impact of human activities on those ecosystems. 2. **Holistic perspective**: Indigenous communities have a deep appreciation for the interconnectedness of all living beings and their surroundings, recognizing that human well-being is linked to the health of the land and its inhabitants. 3. **Adaptive management**: Traditional knowledge can inform adaptive management practices that take into account the long-term implications of human activities on ecosystems. 4. **Community-led conservation**: Local communities are more likely to be invested in conserving their traditional lands, as they understand the historical, cultural, and ecological significance of those areas. 5. **Collaborative learning**: Integrating traditional knowledge with scientific research can foster collaborative learning between scientists, policymakers, and local communities, promoting a more comprehensive understanding of ecosystem dynamics. Examples of successful integration include: 1. **Indigenous-led conservation initiatives**: In countries like Canada, the United States, and Australia, Indigenous communities are playing leading roles in protecting their traditional lands and ecosystems. 2. **Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK)**: TEK is being increasingly recognized as a valuable resource for informing ecosystem management and policy decisions. 3. **Participatory research projects**: Research projects that involve local communities in the design, implementation, and interpretation of studies have shown greater effectiveness in promoting sustainable development. To effectively integrate traditional knowledge into sustainability science: 1. **Build trust and respect**: Foster relationships with local communities based on mutual understanding and respect for their knowledge and perspectives. 2. **Co-create research agendas**: Collaborate with community members to design research projects that address their concerns and priorities. 3. **Integrate TEK into decision-making**: Incorporate traditional ecological knowledge into policy decisions, using it as a complementary source of information alongside scientific research. By embracing the wisdom of local communities and integrating their traditional knowledge into sustainability science, we can create more effective, inclusive, and sustainable approaches to preserving ecosystems for future generations.",0.035912595,0.110831234,0.065822785,0.095717884,0.849120736

USDA also shares the President¡¯s belief that we need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government so that it¡¯s leaner and smarter for the 21st century. Last year we saved $6 billion through the negotiation of a new agreement for crop insurance, $4 billion of which will go to pay down the federal deficit.  And agencies across the Department have looked for ways to reform the way they do business ¨C from reducing the number of visits a farmer has to make to our offices to get conservation services, to saving millions in taxpayer dollars by operating our food assistance programs with historic levels of accuracy. And American agriculture has embraced these same values for years.  Our farmers and ranchers are problem solvers.  Time and time again, they¡¯ve adapted, embracing science and new technology that have allowed them to produce about twice as much per acre as their grandfathers did 50 years ago.  Growers educate their children, build impressive operations.  And ¨C particularly in recent years ¨C they have carried very little debt relative to the rest of the economy.  These values are all part of why American agriculture has seen a strong and rapid rebound from the recession. Last night, the President told us that winning the future will require a lot of hard work and sacrifice from everyone.  But if our farmers and ranchers can do it ¨C I know our nation can as well.  Working together, we can build a foundation for American competiveness for years to come so that we pass on a stronger America to our children and grandchildren.

"Conservation  Jun 22, 2010  On Friday, I was pleased to be part of unveiling the latest step in the Obama Administration¡¯s strategy for restoring the Chesapeake Bay with the announcement of three Showcase Watershed projects in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia. The Showcase Watershed pilot projects will demonstrate what can be accomplished by bringing people, sound science and funding together to solve natural resource problems in a targeted area. USDA and our partners are helping farmers within the Showcase Watersheds implement voluntary conservation practices to reduce nutrient and sediment runoff. This matters, because all of the water that enters waterways from local farms in the watersheds eventually ends up in the Bay. Successful approaches learned in Showcase areas can serve as models for restoring ecosystems elsewhere in the country. A thriving and sustainable agricultural sector is essential to the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay, so the announcement of the Showcase Watersheds was made from a working farm in each State. I was honored to attend the launch event in Pennsylvania at the Eby-Patterson farm in Hershey, where the owners raise beef cattle and are excellent stewards of their natural resources.  We had the opportunity to examine the positive changes in the Conewago Creek that runs through their property.  With experts from our Natural Resources Conservation Service on hand we examined the aquatic life that is thriving in the creek and talked with the Patterson family about their efforts to contribute to a healthier watershed.All three watersheds¡ªSmith Creek in Virginia, Upper Chester River in Maryland and Conewago Creek in Pennsylvania¡ªinclude a wide diversity of agriculture, allowing for a number of different approaches to conservation. In every case, though, USDA is coordinating with numerous partners from local, state and federal government, non-profit organizations and private organizations to reach out to 100 percent of land owners. We rely on our nation¡¯s working lands for sustenance, economic health and cultural heritage, not to mention beautiful and satisfying landscapes like the one I was privileged to visit on Friday.   The focused work we do in the Showcase Watersheds¡ªadded to the extensive conservation efforts already in place to restore the Bay¡ªwill strengthen both the region and U.S. agriculture overall, enhancing both productivity and sustainability. We are proud to be partners in this critical effort.  Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan looks over the creek at the farm of Mrs. Eby-Patterson and husband, Daniel.

"Secretary's Column: Skills for American Workers  As America works towards an economy that¡¯s built to last, we must make sure to provide American workers with the skills they need to compete. If we want to build an economy that makes, creates and innovates; if we want to usher in a new era for American manufacturing and American-produced energy; our students and workers need a good education and strong training. At USDA, one of our jobs is to help American workers learn the skills they need to be ready to take on the jobs of today and tomorrow.  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack  Posted in  USDA Results  Feb 10, 2012  1 Response",What role does the USDA play in helping American workers acquire skills needed for competing in the modern economy?,The USDA helps American workers learn the skills they need to be ready to take on today and tomorrow's jobs.,"The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) plays a significant role in helping American workers acquire skills needed for competing in the modern economy, primarily through its support for workforce development programs that focus on agriculture and related industries. However, it's essential to note that while the USDA does engage in activities that indirectly contribute to workforce development across various sectors, including agriculture, its primary focus is not directly on preparing workers for a broad range of jobs within all sectors of the economy. 1. **Agricultural Training**: The USDA provides training and education programs aimed at enhancing skills related to agriculture, such as farming practices, horticulture, animal husbandry, and agricultural business management. These efforts are crucial for ensuring a skilled workforce in the agricultural sector but can indirectly contribute to broader economic goals by fostering innovative approaches within this industry. 2. **Rural Development**: Through its rural development programs, the USDA supports initiatives that promote entrepreneurship, job creation, and economic growth in rural areas. This includes support for small businesses, cooperatives, and other organizations that contribute to local economies. By fostering these activities, the USDA helps in creating a more diverse range of jobs and industries within rural America. 3. **Education and Research**: The USDA also supports research in agriculture-related fields at universities and through its own research facilities. This not only enhances agricultural productivity but can also lead to innovations that benefit other sectors of the economy, such as biotechnology or environmental conservation. 4. **Support for Workforce Development Grants**: Some programs within the USDA support grants that help prepare workers with skills needed in various sectors, including agriculture. However, these are more targeted towards specific industries and may not cover a broad range of economic sectors. 5. **Partnerships and Collaboration**: The USDA engages in partnerships with other federal agencies (like the Department of Labor), state governments, educational institutions, and private sector entities to support workforce development initiatives. This collaborative approach can help ensure that workers are equipped with skills relevant to various sectors of the economy. While the USDA's primary focus is on agriculture and related areas, its activities contribute indirectly to broader economic goals by fostering innovation, entrepreneurship, and job creation across different sectors. The agency's work in areas like rural development, research, and education can have far-reaching impacts that help American workers acquire skills necessary for competing in the modern economy.",1.80E-155,0.066825776,0.019184652,0.062052506,0.828815103

Some of these resources include: 1. **Organic Certification Cost-Share Program**: This program helps certified organic operations with 75% or more of their total revenue coming from the sale of an agricultural commodity, cover up to $500 per category (livestock or crops) of certification costs annually. 2. **USDA Organic Certification Process**: The USDA National Organic Program (NOP) provides a clear, uniform national standard for organic producers. This includes procedures and guidelines for organic operations seeking certification, ensuring consistency across the country. 3. **Certified Transitional Status**: This status allows farms to label their produce as 'Transitional' if they are in the process of transitioning to organic farming practices. This helps consumers understand that these products are on their way to becoming fully certified organic. 4. **Organic Farming and Research (OFAR) Grants**: These grants support research projects focused on improving organic production efficiency, environmental sustainability, and consumer health benefits associated with organic agriculture. 5. **Farm Service Agency (FSA) Loans and Direct Financing**: The USDA FSA provides financial assistance to farmers through direct farm operating loans and guaranteed loans. This can be particularly helpful for organic producers looking to expand their operations or transition to more sustainable practices. 6. **USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Organic Research and Education Grants**: These grants fund research, extension activities, and education programs that enhance the sustainability and economic viability of organic agriculture in the United States. 7. **Market Access Tools**: The USDA provides various tools and resources to help organic farmers access markets, such as through its Specialty Crop Block Grants Program and the Farmers Market Promotion Program. These resources can play a significant role in supporting organic producers by reducing barriers to entry, providing financial assistance for certification and research, offering direct market access, and helping them navigate the process of transitioning to and maintaining an organic operation.

"An Airport is No Place for an Owl  Seeing a short-eared owl in November on the Pittsburgh International Airport, where I work as an airport wildlife biologist, was a unique occasion. However, as the number of owls grew to eight, I recognized the challenge ahead:  Like all birds of prey, short-eared owls are a recognized potential aviation hazard. Their low rolling flight and difficult-to-disperse reputation means they pose an aviation safety threat.  From 1990-2012, short-eared owl strikes with aircraft in the United States caused over $1 million in damage, and often are fatal to the birds.  Convincing them to leave would be difficult but important. The task would be harder because short-eared owls are listed by the State as an endangered species.  Common in many areas globally, Pennsylvania is the southernmost edge of their breeding range.  These owls likely migrated from Canadian breeding grounds to winter in Pennsylvania.

"A Reflection: Celebrating Eight Years of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships  Looking back at USDA¡¯s efforts to help rural America thrive, I am truly proud of the impact our diverse partners, both from faith and secular communities, have had within their communities. On behalf of the USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, I would like to say thank you to our partners these past eight years as well as reflect on a few notable highlights of the work we have achieved together. USDA touches the lives of all Americans every day, whether they realize it or not. While our programs to reduce food insecurity are well known, our nation¡¯s most vulnerable citizens can still be hard to reach. Faith-based and community partners have been especially helpful in this area, particularly when it comes to feeding children in summer months, when school is out of session. In collaboration with many partners, including Catholic Charities USA, the Church of God in Christ, Islamic Relief USA, the National Baptist Convention and the Salvation Army, USDA increased the number of summer meals served to kids by 16% between 2009 and 2015, a total of more than 1.2 billion summer meals served when school is out and food is scarce.

"During National Farm to School Month, USDA Celebrates Grantees' Accomplishments and a New Office  Along with brilliantly colored hard squash, crisp apples, and hearty greens, October ushers in National Farm to School Month, a time to raise awareness about and celebrate the impact of farm to school programs on children, producers, and communities. Since 2012, I have directed USDA¡¯s Farm to School Program, guiding the work of a small but enthusiastic team at the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). Each October, we have more to celebrate: more USDA funds awarded to schools, agencies, and organizations to advance these programs; more money ending up in the pockets of local producers; more school gardens in which students can learn and grow; and more healthful school meals that feature local foods. A new report, announced by Agriculture Secretary Vilsack earlier this month, helps quantify our celebration. An analysis of grant-making over the last three years reveals that USDA has awarded $15.1 million through 221 grants in 49 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Fifty percent of funded projects included expanding healthy menu options offered in the cafeteria; 46 percent included training for food service staff about menu planning, meal preparation, and cooking with local and regional foods; and 65 percent included nutrition education activities. These funds have helped 12,300 schools improve nutritious meal options made with local ingredients for 6.9 million students, while expanding market opportunities for family farmers and ranchers in their communities.

"Undersecretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  May 17, 2016  School lunch staff and students enjoy the new school lunch menu created to meet the new standards at the Yorkshire Elementary School in Manassas, VA. It may seem like common sense for child nutrition programs to benefit children, but some see it differently today. Nationwide, schools have made the lunchroom a healthy environment. In fact, in only the second school year of full implementation of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA), over 98 percent of schools participating are already meeting the healthier meal standards.  Students are eating more fruits and vegetables during the school day and more low-income children are eating nutritious breakfasts and lunches at school. And data show obesity rates for some children are leveling off. With all the success of HHFKA, now is not the time to intentionally go backwards on nutrition standards in healthier school meals and to block access to these meals for millions of children. In January, the Senate Agriculture Committee unanimously took a bipartisan step toward reauthorizing critical child nutrition programs like school lunch and breakfast. Rather than diminish the progress we¡¯ve already made, the Senate's bill ensures these improvements to our children's diets will continue.  The bipartisan Senate bill represents a compromise that allows us to stop rehashing old debates and secures a healthier future for our kids. It represents a win for children, parents, schools, and our country's future. In contrast, the House Education and Workforce Committee¡¯s bill aims to weaken one of the most successful aspects of HHFKA. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), which allows high-poverty schools or districts to serve all students free meals without any burdensome paperwork, has been lauded for increasing student participation, reducing administrative burdens and costs on schools, cutting down on paperwork for busy parents, and improving program integrity. But the House bill would place new limitations on the number of schools in high-poverty areas that qualify for CEP, forcing many high-poverty schools to lose eligibility. This would cause school meal participation to fall dramatically, and schools would be forced to spend more time on paperwork and less time focusing on feeding kids. And some children who need free meals may slip through the cracks. The House bill would also roll back the school meal nutrition standards and gut the Smart Snacks in School rule, which ensures that all snack foods and beverages for sale to students during the school day are nutritious. Under the House bill, school vending machines could go back to selling soda and junk food.  Schools have already invested time and effort into making the switch to healthier options.  The snack food industry has innovated and developed hundreds of new products that meet the requirements and are popular with students.  Now is not the time to regress. We are proud of the way the school meals program provides flexibility for schools to tailor the programs to their local needs. For example, schools design their own menus and have the ability to serve items they know their students prefer.  They can also choose options like CEP and serve afterschool snacks and suppers if they are the right fit for their local community. However, in the name of local flexibility, some are considering a proposal to convert the school nutrition programs into a block grant. That is a very dangerous idea. Not only would it put further strain on state and local school districts¡¯ budgets, but it would jeopardize children¡¯s access to quality, healthy school meals no matter where they live. Instead, we are working with schools and districts to ensure their programs meet their needs. One example is the Team Up For School Nutrition Success training. Along with the Institute of Child Nutrition, we offer all state agencies the opportunity to host local events to provide tailored technical assistance, support, and best practices for schools in administering successful meals programs. During the training, schools cover topics like menu planning, financial management, procurement, meal presentation and appeal, as well as youth engagement tactics and strategies to reduce plate waste. Schools have the opportunity to learn from each other in order to make positive strides toward providing healthy school environments with financial stability and strong student participation. With all these strides being made, now is not the time to eliminate the successful partnership between the federal government and state agencies, putting further strain on state and local school districts¡¯ budgets. It would be unwise to roll back the school meal standards and I urge Congress to stay the course for sake of our children. USDA looks forward to working with Congress, schools, parents and communities to continue to improve the health and wellbeing of the next generation.

Additionally, it could cause schools to spend more time on paperwork and less time focusing on feeding kids.","Weakening or rolling back the standards for healthy school meals, as proposed by the House Education and Workforce Committee, could have several potential consequences. Some of these consequences include: 1. **Increased risk of childhood obesity and related health problems**: Repealing or weakening nutrition standards in schools would likely lead to a higher consumption of unhealthy foods and drinks among students, which is associated with an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other serious health issues. 2. **Negative impact on academic performance**: Research has shown that there is a strong link between good nutrition and improved academic performance. Weakening school meal standards could lead to decreased student focus, attention span, and overall academic achievement. 3. **Increased burden on the healthcare system**: The potential long-term health consequences of weakening school meal standards could put an additional strain on the healthcare system, as more students may require medical treatment for diet-related health problems. 4. **Disadvantaging low-income students**: Weakening school meal standards would disproportionately affect low-income students who rely heavily on school meals as a primary source of nutrition. These students are already at higher risk for health disparities and may be further disadvantaged by reduced access to healthy food options in schools. 5. **Undermining the progress made towards improving child nutrition**: The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 set important standards for school meal programs to promote healthier eating habits among children. Repealing or weakening these standards would undermine the progress made in this area and send a contradictory message about the importance of healthy eating. 6. **Lack of support from parents and students**: Many parents and students have expressed strong support for the current nutrition standards, which prioritize whole, nutrient-dense foods over processed and sugary options. Weakening or rolling back these standards would likely face significant opposition from stakeholders who value the health and well-being of school-age children. Overall, weakening or rolling back the standards for healthy school meals could have far-reaching consequences for students' physical and academic health, as well as the broader healthcare system and society as a whole.",0.035632112,0.187192118,0.069306931,0.133004926,0.857881725

"Under Secretary, Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 16, 2016  For more than 40 years, USDA has been committed to closing the food security gap that occurs in the summer months when children no longer have access to the nutritious meals they¡¯re offered in school. As I travel across the country visiting our nation¡¯s summer meals sites, I am proud of the commitment we¡¯ve collectively made to nourish both the bodies and minds of our country¡¯s children and teens. Schools, recreation centers, places of worship, libraries and other community sites have generously opened their doors to ensure kids receive healthy, balanced meals during the summer months ¨C a time when many low-income families struggle to provide their children nutritious meals and snacks each and every day. At USDA we¡¯ve long recognized summer as a vulnerable time for kids and have been focused on closing the food security gap that occurs during the months when school is out of session.  Since 2009, more than 1.2 billion meals have been served through the Summer Meal Programs, fueling kids and teens throughout the summer and helping to ensure they are healthy and ready to learn when the school year begins. In support of these same goals, the White House announced earlier this year the Summer Opportunity Project, a multi-agency initiative to expand opportunities for young people through the summer.  The initiative aims to increase the participation of youth in evidence-based summer opportunity programs and make sure young Americans have the support they need to get their first job. USDA¡¯s Summer Meal Programs play an important role in achieving this mission. By ensuring the most basic need of good nutrition is met, kids and teens in eligible communities can more easily pursue and leverage summer opportunities.  Many sites offer not only healthy meals and snacks, but also host physical and enrichment activities to keep kids engaged and coming back day after day.  By including free and low-cost activities into Summer Meal Programs, sites boost attendance and make the meal service more fun for children, their families, and volunteers.  To support these efforts, this spring USDA published Summer Food, Summer Moves to help sites and sponsors offer ideas on engaging kids, teens, and their families. Increasing the number of meals served through the Summer Meal Programs has been a rewarding achievement during my time at FNS, as each meal served elevates the life of a child or teen in our country.   With the help of our creative and hardworking volunteers, sponsors and partners, we were able to serve more than 190 million meals last summer.  Groups like Fuel Up to Play 60, Feeding America, Catholic Charities, United Way, and First Book have all played a key part in providing access to summer meals for children living in areas with high food insecurity.  Engaging the community in summer meals is also integral to the success of the program.

"USDA Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 30, 2016   Cross-posted from the Disability.gov blog: Your neighborhood grocer may be conveniently located just a few short blocks away. But for many persons with disabilities and the elderly participating in the U.S. Department of Agriculture¡¯s (USDA) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the store might as well be on the other side of the world. It¡¯s a difficult problem that USDA¡¯s new homebound food delivery pilot aims to alleviate, not just for the more than 4 million nonelderly adults with disabilities participating in SNAP, but also for the nearly 5 million seniors, who often face similar challenges and who may face disabilities, as well. USDA recently announced the food purchasing and delivery firms selected to take part in the one-year pilot, which will be conducted in locations nationwide, perhaps at a location near you. Firms selected include Denver Food Rescue (Denver, Colo.), Lutheran Social Services of Nevada (Las Vegas, N.V.), Many Infinities, Inc. (Alabaster, Ala.), Senior Services of Alexandria (Alexandria, Va.), and Store to Door (Roseville, Minn.). The pilots break new ground for USDA. For the first time, governmental and non-profit food purchasing and delivery services will be allowed to accept SNAP benefits as payment. This is expected to increase the opportunities for home delivery to those unable to shop for food. I think it¡¯s important to note that during the trial period participating firms will only be permitted to accept SNAP benefits from households where the qualifying person with disabilities or elderly person is the head of household. This is intended to ensure that the pilot focuses on households that have the most limited access to foods. Given that nearly one in five SNAP participants is either elderly or a person with disabilities, it¡¯s clear that we must address the special challenges faced by these groups. Lessons we learn during the pilot will help USDA shape final rules now in development, which is an important step forward, as I see it. Home delivery of groceries will help ensure that those unable to shop for food themselves have access to the nutritious foods we all need to maintain a healthy diet.

Anne Arundel County Public Schools in Maryland understand this harsh reality and have taken steps to keep children fed during the summer months. This week Under Secretary for Food Safety, Elisabeth Hagen and I visited one of their schools, Maryland City Elementary in Laurel, to help announce their plan to offer free meals through USDA¡¯s Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) to all neighborhood kids, ages 2-18. What a fantastic way to alleviate hunger and strengthen the overall health of their community.  The SFSP is, designed to do just that, fill the nutrition gap during summer, by providing children free meals and snacks at registered feeding sites. Did you know that during the regular school year, at least 20 million children or more nationwide receive free and reduced-priced meals through the National School Lunch Program?  Yet little more than 3 million kids are fed in our summer programs -- not very good statistics. But we continue to work to increase those numbers.  This summer, Let¡¯s Move! Faith and Communities (part of First Lady Michelle Obama¡¯s Let¡¯s Move! initiative) is working with partners to host new feeding sites at congregations and neighborhood organizations. Kevin Concannon, Under Secretary, Food Consumer and Nutrition Services explains the importance of good nutrition and exercise to students at Maryland City Elementary School in Laurel, MD, during a United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety Inspection Service, Food Safety Education Camp on Thursday, May 5, 2011. USDA Photo by Bob Nichols. USDA is also funding numerous pilot projects in several states to test new ways to feed hungry children during summer. All of these efforts move us closer to our goal to end childhood hunger in this country ¨C a goal I know we all can share and work towards together.  Summer months are critical; make no mistake, because hunger leaves children susceptible to illness and other health issues that make it harder for them to learn when school begins again. So we have to act now to ensure that our most vulnerable children are fed during summer so they too can grow up nutritionally healthy, academically strong, and best able to fulfill their dreams.   Healthy Students, Healthy Schools, Cultivating Communities of Wellness was the theme of the event at Maryland City Elementary. The county¡¯s supervisor for Food and Nutrition Services, Jodi Risse, was instrumental in getting Maryland City Elementary and Hilltop Elementary in Glen Burnie to offer community feeding this summer.

"Under Secretary, Food Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 16, 2013   Making sure children have nutritious meals and keep their bodies moving all year long is one of USDA¡¯s most important missions. Our Summer Food Service Program plays an important role in ensuring that all children get healthy meals during the summertime.    We¡¯re proud to say that in 2012, our partners helped to serve 144 million summer meals at 38,800 sites across the country. That translates to 2.3 million children served on a typical summer day. But there is still a lot of work to be done. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of kids who rely on free and reduced price meals during the school year participate in the summer program. So this year we¡¯ve set out to serve 5 million more summer meals. We need your help to meet that goal. On Friday, Secretary Vilsack held a roundtable with anti-hunger advocates from Share Our Strength, Hunger Free Colorado, and the state of Arkansas to encourage more organizations to work with us as sponsor sites. During the discussion, he reiterated how important it is for advocates and leaders in communities across the country to redouble their efforts to address the summer meals gap.  Click here to listen to the roundtable. After the discussion, we hosted a twitter chat through our account, @USDANutrition, to spread the word about summer meals and what we¡¯re trying to accomplish. One of things I mentioned during the chat is that we want to increase participation by eligible kids in summer meals in every community that needs it, but we¡¯re paying particular attention to states with great need like Arkansas, California, Colorado, Rhode Island and Virginia. As the Secretary said, poor nutrition during summer months can set up a cycle of poor performance once school starts up again in the fall. So what can you personally do to help?  There are many ways to be a part of preventing summer hunger. One of the best things you can do is help us increase the number of sponsors who provide free meals and activities to eligible low-income children. Churches, schools, government agencies, camps and other local organizations can act as sponsor sites.  Those sites also often need volunteers to lead fun activities or provide transportation. The best thing to do is visit our Summer Food Service Web page and start thinking about how you can best contribute. With strong support from individuals, communities and partners nationwide we can reach more disadvantaged kids with nutritious meals when school is out.

"FSA Windham County Executive Director in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 03, 2011   Last week, we welcomed Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan to Vermont as she toured farms to see recovery efforts after Tropical Storm Irene. Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan speaking with farmers at the Robb Family Farm near Brattleboro, VT. Our first stop was the Wheeler Farm, a 100 acre 50-cow grass based farm just north of Wilmington, one of the hardest hit communities in the state.  Visible water marks were higher than the historic flood of 1927 and hurricane of 1938.  The group welcomed Deputy Secretary Merrigan on the porch of the historic farmhouse, which had just escaped the flood waters by a few inches.  As we pulled onto the farm¡¯s access road, a large grader and dump truck continued work to repair washed away segments. Rob and Karen Wheeler explained how they were humbled by the outpouring of support from their neighbors to quickly clean up and bring back their large field.  Rob also told the Deputy Secretary of his positive experiences and support for the local USDA staff.  She spoke of the signs she saw in Wilmington that read ¡°Courage¡± and ¡°Thank you for your support,¡± and even one advertising ¡°Floodstock,¡± a benefit concert for disaster relief. She remarked on the resilience of the Vermont farmers and of course, farmers as a group, and also spoke of the challenges ahead for USDA and its programs. Our next stop was the Harlow Farm in Westminster, an 80 acre organic vegetable farm with a successful farm store and wholesale business. We were welcomed by owner-operator Paul Harlow who is well respected and widely known for his extensive crop knowledge.  About 30 vegetable and dairy producers came to speak with the Deputy, along with Vermont Agriculture Secretary Chuck Ross who had been assessing crop damage and meeting with farmers in another county.  Paul Harlow explained how over 30 acres of his vegetables were flooded by the Connecticut River. They remained under water for several days and Paul was forced to harrow under all damaged crops.  Deputy Secretary Merrigan emphasized the special place Vermont agriculture has in the national eye:  Local food, strong markets and strong community bonds are evident and to be commended, she said. The Deputy welcomed all conversation topics from the group, offered encouragement to work through USDA paperwork and talked of the approaching Farm Bill. Our final stop of the day in Windham County was the six-generation Robb Family Farm on Ames Hill Road just west of Brattleboro.  The family welcomed the group and once again we gathered around the porch of a historic Vermont farmhouse. The Robb Family Farm has been a dairy farm and maple sugaring operation for 100 years. They now produce corn and hay for their animals on approximately 180 acres.  They recently sold the dairy cows and transitioned to beef.  They added to their 2,000 maple taps to support their successful online store and mail order business, which sells maple syrup made on the farm. Charlie Robb, Jr., who currently serves as Chair of the Windham County FSA Committee, explained how a hay field and a corn field were flooded by the Whetstone Brook from Tropical Storm Irene. This same brook also caused severe damage to Route 9, the main highway between Brattleboro and the west side of the county.  Deputy Secretary Merrigan remarked on the farmers¡¯ resilience and disaster clean-up progress. She also noted and complimented Vermont¡¯s agricultural leadership. Area farmers encouraged the Deputy to support a strong conservation budget, especially mentioning the impacts of invasive species in southern Vermont.

"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication in  Forestry  Jan 12, 2012  Mark Twery, a supervisory research forester on the Northern Research Station How does a former dancer and theater technician end up in a career in forestry? Meet Mark Twery, a supervisory research forester on the Northern Research Station in Burlington, Vt., who is not only all of the above, but loves his unique job that incorporates forestry with dance. Twery had a natural inclination toward the arts. His father was a painter while his mother continues to paint, and both of his siblings are artists in different respects. As a child, Twery toyed with the idea of becoming an artist himself. Entering college thinking he would embark in mathematics, Twery quickly realized he preferred theater arts. During his junior year, he spent a semester working at a theater in New York City. It was during a trip home to Virginia when Twery realized that he had been away from nature for too long. ¡°I went outside and I heard a strange noise above my head,¡± he said. ¡°I looked up and saw a cardinal singing. I am a birder but did not recognize that bird song. That¡¯s when I decided that I had lived in the big city for too long.¡± This ¡°wake-up call¡± led to Twery¡¯s departure from theater in New York City to a brief career in woodworking in Boston. ¡°It was good work, but I didn¡¯t earn enough and again I began getting tired of living in a city,¡± he said. Twery returned to school intending to study wood technology, but instead entered the forestry master¡¯s program at the University of Massachusetts. A Ph.D. soon followed as did a career with the Forest Service. Several years ago, Twery and his wife attended a dance performance in Burlington that weaved art and science. Fascinated by this connection, Twery, as a Forest Service liaison at the Northern Research Station, began working with the dance company to create the Moving Fields Project that incorporates dance to teach elementary school students, primarily city youth, about nature and ecology. During a typical Moving Fields Project session, Twery and dancers lead the young students to a nature area where they create movements based on what the children see or hear, such as ¡°seeds floating off into the wind, or bark sliding off a dead tree or stepping into a pond and pulling your foot back.¡± Once Twery accompanied a group of inner city children from Baltimore on a Moving Fields session in a natural area, and at the end of the day, the elementary school students performed an ecological dance for their teachers and parents. Being able to combine his love for dance and forestry is one big reason Twery loves his job. ¡°It really is true that artists and scientists follow the same steps of observation, analysis, interpretation, and communication,¡± he said. ¡°It feels like I¡¯m going full circle in my career by connecting visual and performing arts with forestry, ecology and the environment.¡± See what else Twery has to say in the Forest Service special feature Faces of the Forest, a bi-weekly feature of the Office of Communication to showcase the people, places and professions within the agency.

"Livestock Statistician Knows Data Matter to Many  atistics. As part of this global event, every month this year USDA¡¯s National Agricultural Statistics Service will profile careers of individuals who are making significant contributions to improve agricultural statistics in the United States. Growing up on a small general crop and livestock farm in central Minnesota cultivated my enthusiasm for agriculture. Even then I knew I wanted to do something related to agriculture but I also knew the value of getting a good education. I attended the University of Minnesota to earn my undergraduate degree, after which I earned a Master of Science degree at North Dakota State University. College provided me with skills in mathematics and agriculture but like most college graduates, no job. This is where the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) came into the picture. I joined the agency¡¯s North Dakota field office as an agricultural statistician, allowing me to keep in touch with agriculture.

Dan Kerestes, Livestock Branch Chief, National Agricultural Statistics Service  Posted in  Research and Science  May 29, 2013  4 Responses","What is the role of an agricultural statistician versus a livestock statistician, particularly in the context of Dan Kerestes' career at USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service?","In the context of Dan Kerestes' career, it appears that ""agricultural statistician"" and ""livestock statistician"" refer to different roles within the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). While specific job responsibilities are not clearly defined in the provided content, it can be inferred that an agricultural statistician would work on a broader range of agricultural statistics (crops), whereas a livestock statistician, like Dan Kerestes, would focus specifically on statistical aspects related to livestock.","In the context of Dan Kerestes' career at USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), the roles of an agricultural statistician and a livestock specialist can be distinguished as follows: **Agricultural Statistician:** * Responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data on various aspects of agriculture, such as crop production, land use, irrigation, and farm income. * Focuses on overall agricultural trends, economic indicators, and national-level statistics. * May work with a broad range of crops, including grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and oilseeds. * Typically involved in developing and implementing surveys, estimating yields, and analyzing production costs. **Livestock Specialist:** * Concentrates on collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data related to livestock production, such as cattle, pigs, sheep, chickens, and horses. * Focuses on trends and statistics specific to the livestock industry, including animal numbers, production levels, and economic indicators like prices and value of sales. * May work closely with agricultural statisticians to ensure comprehensive understanding of the relationships between crop and livestock sectors. In Dan Kerestes' case, as a career-long NASS employee, his expertise likely bridged both roles. His experience working in various sections of NASS (including the Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry section) indicates that he had broad responsibilities across multiple aspects of agricultural statistics. To give you a more detailed idea: - Kerestes might have led or contributed to the development of surveys aimed at collecting data on crop production, farm income, land use, or irrigation. - His work as a livestock specialist would have involved analyzing and interpreting statistical information related to various types of livestock, including cattle, pigs, chickens, and horses. - Given his involvement in NASS' efforts to provide comprehensive agricultural statistics, Kerestes likely played a role in integrating data from both agricultural and livestock sectors to offer insights into the overall health and trends within U.S. agriculture. In essence, an agricultural statistician generally has a broader focus on agricultural production across various crops and regions, while a livestock specialist concentrates more specifically on data related to animal production and their economic impacts. However, in practice, these roles often overlap, as demonstrated by Dan Kerestes' work at USDA's NASS.",0.034614647,0.272727273,0.120192308,0.157894737,0.861891866
"Getting Geeky at the 3rd Annual USA Science and Engineering Festival  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA¡¯s rich science and research portfolio. When you think of agriculture do you think of science and engineering? You should! Farmers are some of our original scientists, tinkering with plant varieties and farming techniques to find ways to reliably grow food. At USDA, we still do that kind of research in a never-ending effort to find better ways to produce food, fuel, and fiber. We also do a lot of research you might not think of when you think about agriculture: from forensic genetic analysis to track down unwanted pests to figuring out how to turn spent grain from distilleries into biodegradable kitty litter. On April 26-27, the 3rd Annual USA Science and Engineering Festival took over the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. Over 325,000 people came out to celebrate discovery and innovation through over 3,000 hands-on activities and 150 performances and lectures.  USDA pulled all of the stops to show our geeky side and hopefully convince a few young booth visitors to consider agriculture when they think about careers in science.

They are using it as a nutrient-rich feedstock for producing bio-based fertilizers. Spent grains are the residual materials left over after brewing beer or distilling whiskey. These residues, rich in nitrogen and other essential nutrients, can be used to create sustainable and environmentally friendly fertilizers. The process involves breaking down the spent grain into its constituent parts, mixing it with microorganisms that feed on the organic matter, and then converting this mixture into a nutrient-rich fertilizer. This approach not only reduces waste but also provides an alternative to synthetic fertilizers, which can be harmful to the environment when overused. This development showcases the ingenuity of scientists in finding creative solutions for resource recovery and sustainable agriculture practices, demonstrating how waste can become a valuable resource.",0.022799533,0.137931034,0.069767442,0.126436782,0.867132306

"Consortium Uses Innovative Research to Tap Key Groundwater Source for Rural Region  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA¡¯s rich science and research portfolio.  As a major underground water source, the Ogallala Aquifer plays a key role in the economic vitality of vast stretches of the rural Midwest.  The aquifer covers around 225,000 square miles in 8 states from South Dakota to Texas, supplying 30 percent of all U.S. groundwater used for irrigation. But as with other natural resources that seem inexhaustible, the aquifer is effectively a nonrenewable resource. Demand from agricultural, municipal and industrial development on the Great Plains has meant that water is pumped out of a large portion of the aquifer much more quickly than it can ever be replenished.  Ann Perry, USDA Agricultural Research Service Information Staff  Posted in  Conservation  Research and Science  Feb 11, 2014  1 Response","What is the status of the Ogallala Aquifer, which covers a significant portion of the Midwest region, considering its role in sustaining economic vitality through irrigation?","The Ogallala Aquifer is a nonrenewable resource due to over-demand from agricultural, municipal, and industrial development, resulting in groundwater being pumped out much faster than it can be replenished.","The status of the Ogallala Aquifer, which spans across eight states in the Great Plains region, including parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, and South Dakota, is critical and unsustainable for long-term irrigation purposes. Here's a summary of its current state: **Overdraft:** The aquifer has been over-pumped since the 1950s to support agricultural irrigation, particularly in the corn belt region. This excessive withdrawal has led to a significant decline in water levels. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), the cumulative overdraft from the Ogallala Aquifer is approximately 125 billion cubic meters (or 43 trillion gallons) since its exploitation began. **Water Level Decline:** The water level in the aquifer has been declining by about 1-2 feet per year, with some areas experiencing a more pronounced drop of up to 5 feet per year. This decline affects not only irrigation but also municipal and industrial water supplies. **Impacts on Agriculture:** 1. **Reduced Irrigation Capacity:** Lowering water levels make it increasingly difficult for farmers to irrigate crops, potentially impacting crop yields and farm income. 2. **Changes in Crop Selection:** Farmers are being forced to switch from water-intensive crops like corn and soybeans to more drought-tolerant alternatives. **Economic and Social Consequences:** 1. **Reduced Economic Growth:** The depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer will likely lead to reduced economic growth, as agriculture remains a significant contributor to local economies. 2. **Potential Changes in Land Use:** As irrigation capacity diminishes, land may be repurposed for other uses, such as livestock grazing or conservation, which can have far-reaching social and environmental implications. **Solutions and Future Directions:** 1. **Conservation Efforts:** Implementing efficient irrigation systems and practices, like drip irrigation, and promoting crop selection with lower water requirements. 2. **Water Management Strategies:** Developing policies to manage the aquifer's resources more effectively, such as implementing water allocation plans or prioritizing groundwater recharge. 3. **Alternative Water Sources:** Exploring the feasibility of using alternative water sources, like recycled wastewater or desalinated water from other regions. In summary, the Ogallala Aquifer is facing a critical situation due to over-pumping and declining water levels, which poses significant challenges for agricultural irrigation and regional economic vitality. Addressing this issue will require collective action, innovative solutions, and a commitment to sustainable resource management practices.",4.15E-79,0.107055961,0.034229829,0.063260341,0.831246316
"Illinois Dairy Farm's Waste Storage Gets a Makeover with USDA's Help  A dairy cow can produce up to 140 pounds of manure in a day. So for James ¡°Jim¡± Johnson, who owns 150 dairy cows on his Boone County, Ill. ranch, that means 7.7 million pounds of manure per year. Where does this manure go? On many ranches, manure is stored and filtrated in a waste lagoon. But after a heavy rain in 2011 caused Johnson¡¯s waste lagoon to overflow onto a nearby road, Johnson sought help to prevent it from happening again. In an effort to protect the quality of water and soil, he worked with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to find a solution. NRCS assessed his operation and developed a comprehensive nutrient management plan. The assessment and plan helped Johnson to change his barns to properly handle the storage and flow of manure.  Pattie Thomas, Natural Resources Conservation Service  Posted in  Conservation  Feb 18, 2014  Respond to this story","What is a common method used by many ranches, such as James ""Jim"" Johnson's dairy farm, to store and filter manure?",A waste lagoon is a common method used by many ranches to store and filter manure.,"A commonly used method among many ranches, including dairy farms like James ""Jim"" Johnson's, to store and filter manure is through the use of lagoons or anaerobic digesters. 1. **Manure Lagoon Systems**: Many ranches and farms use manure lagoons as a cost-effective way to handle their livestock waste. Manure lagoons are essentially large ponds where the manure from animals is collected, stored, and allowed to break down naturally. This process involves microorganisms that consume organic matter, reducing odors, pathogens, and the potential for environmental pollution. 2. **Anaerobic Digesters**: Another method used by ranches, especially those focused on sustainability and environmentally friendly practices, is anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digesters are specialized tanks or vessels designed to break down manure under controlled conditions. This process produces a nutrient-rich fertilizer (digestate) and biogas, which can be used as fuel for heating homes, businesses, or even powering the farm itself. 3. **Sand Beds**: Some ranches use sand beds or soil-based treatment systems. In these systems, the manure passes through layers of soil and sand, allowing it to filter naturally without needing a lagoon or an anaerobic digester. This method is more labor-intensive but can be beneficial in reducing the volume of waste and producing a more stable end product. Each of these methods has its own benefits and drawbacks. The choice among them depends on factors like the scale of the operation, environmental regulations, financial resources, and the desired outcomes (such as fertilizer production or energy generation).",0.01582867,0.114068441,0.053639847,0.08365019,0.864596426

The multi-generational residents depend on the surrounding Chesapeake Bay for their livelihoods. For many, crabbing, oystering, and ecotourism are what puts dollars in their bank accounts, and food on their tables. In rural communities like Smith Island, located in and along the Chesapeake Bay, aging wastewater facilities are in need of upgrades. Not only can this be an expensive problem for towns with small populations, but without the critical upgrades, the threat of combined sewer overflows from more frequent weather events and climate change could contribute to pollution of the Chesapeake Bay. So, what is being done to help these rural communities protect the environment and preserve a way of life that impacts so many? USDA Rural Development and partners are answering the call by investing in state-of-the art, modern wastewater treatment facilities in communities like Smith Island and many others located throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Smith Island Wastewater Treatment Facility Smith Island¡¯s wastewater treatment facility consisted of two pump stations, serving the three communities that make up Smith Island: Ewell, Rhodes Point, and Tylerton. After four decades and prolonged exposure to the elements, the components of the wastewater treatment facility began to corrode, break down, and fail. This left the surrounding bay and wildlife vulnerable to combined sewer overflows. Federal, state, and local agencies collaborated on a solution: a new, modern wastewater treatment facility. Through the Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant Program, USDA Rural Development provided the community with $83,000 in loan, and $5,000,000 in grant funds, with other partners providing the balance, to help the community afford the $22.3 million Smith Island Wastewater Treatment Facility. Peter Bozick, Executive Vice President of George, Miles & Buhr, LLC, the engineer and architecture firm that designed the new facility said, ¡°The island is sinking slowly due to climate change and rising sea levels, and the former infrastructure was susceptible to flooding.

"Mountain Plains Regional Administrator, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Nutrition Security  Nov 08,  It was a sunny fall day in mid-October when I had the honor of visiting the Omaha Nation WIC program. Upon meeting WIC Director Jessika Free-Bass, I visited the Tribe's WIC garden, which they use to grow produce for client nutrition education. For the Omaha Tribe, nutrition education is a community effort. Free-Bass says that the Omaha Nation WIC program recognizes the importance of incorporating Indigenous foods and traditional cooking practices into the WIC experience to form a holistic approach to nutrition education. Recently, they have taken extra steps to spotlight foods indigenous to their community, as well as dishes and cooking methods traditionally used by the Um¨®?ho? people. This year, the WIC garden grew tomatoes and WIC clients prepared tomato sauce. The garden also produced carrots, which the program used to teach ways to prepare baby food. The WIC garden is small, so the program partners closely with several community organizations to further its nutrition education efforts. For example, the nearby Um¨®?ho? school garden donates squash and indigenous corn to the program for lessons. Omaha WIC also partners with the Nebraska Indian Community College, using their kitchen facilities to provide nutrition education sessions and cooking demonstrations. The WIC program aims to safeguard the health of income eligible women, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutrition risk by providing nutritious foods and information on healthy eating. As we celebrate Native American Heritage Month, I applaud the Omaha Nation for connecting mothers, young children, and the community in celebrating healthy, traditional food.

"Communications Director, Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement in  Equity  Initiatives  Nov 30,  Since , FEED 7 Generations has worked to improve the health and wellness of Native people in the Pacific Northwest. Based in King County, Washington, FEED 7 Generations creates environmental health through land management strategies, community health projects, and direct food access projects. ¡°We are a tribal-led food sovereignty organization,¡± said Executive Director Romajean Thomas. ¡°We want to help Native people in our area be as healthy as possible while ensuring that our dollars stay within the local food system and within Native communities.¡± To further these efforts, the organization was able to secure a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) grant, designed to help underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters. The organization is using this grant to strengthen local businesses and enhance food security and community connections. They began by conducting a needs analysis. ¡°We¡¯ve been out traveling to these farms, some of them really far out there, to meet with producers and understand their needs.¡± said Thomas. ¡°We¡¯ve had great success in building relationships.¡± Using the collected, the organization created a Native Grown and Gathered resource directory featuring Native farms and food producers in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. ¡°We want to make it easy for Native people to eat food grown, harvested, made and produced by other Native people,¡± said Thomas. ¡°This will help catalyze food sovereignty efforts and strengthen Native food systems nationwide.¡± The needs analysis also revealed that Native producers would benefit from additional training opportunities. With that, the organization hosted an annual food sovereignty symposium to showcase regional Native agricultural production and producers. Attendees could also learn how to start a food business, bring cultural traditions into the marketplace, and develop strong connections within Indian Country¡¯s food system. Thomas and her team plan to coordinate additional trainings to connect food producers with the programs and grants offered by USDA. ¡°We are able to identify tribal producers within our communities and ask them what they need, then connect them to appropriate USDA products that help them,¡± she said. ¡°The grant has helped us to bring native food to Native people while enhancing the local food economy.

"Wetland Mitigation Banking Partnerships are Thriving in Georgia  Wetlands are one of nature¡¯s most important and productive ecosystems. They provide wildlife habitat, store floodwaters, filter pollutants, capture carbon, and offer recreational opportunities. Since , the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has spent $20 million to establish wetland mitigation banks to help restore and protect wetland ecosystems on agricultural land.  Kathryn Fidler, Public Affairs Specialist  Posted in  Conservation  Jul 16,   Respond to this story","What role do mitigation banks play in restoring and protecting wetland ecosystems in Georgia, particularly in relation to mitigating environmental impacts?",Mitigation banks help restore and protect wetland ecosystems in Georgia by providing a financial mechanism for agricultural landowners to offset the environmental impacts of their activities through wetland restoration projects.,"Mitigation banks are specialized entities that purchase, restore, and protect large areas of degraded or damaged wetlands, and sell credits to developers who must compensate for the destruction of their own wetlands. In the context of Georgia, mitigation banks play a crucial role in restoring and protecting wetland ecosystems by: 1. **Restoring ecosystem functions**: Mitigation banks acquire and restore wetlands that have been degraded due to human activities such as agriculture, urbanization, or infrastructure development. By doing so, they help maintain natural processes like nutrient cycling, water filtration, and habitat creation. 2. **Protecting biodiversity**: Georgia's wetlands are critical habitats for numerous plant and animal species. Mitigation banks help preserve the integrity of these ecosystems by protecting native vegetation, preserving wildlife corridors, and maintaining hydrological cycles. 3. **Mitigating environmental impacts**: Developers who destroy or damage wetlands must purchase credits from mitigation banks to compensate for their actions. This process ensures that the ecological benefits lost due to development are offset through restoration efforts elsewhere. 4. **Promoting sustainable land use**: By creating a market-driven system, mitigation banks encourage developers and property owners to consider the environmental implications of their projects early on. This fosters more sustainable land-use practices and reduces the likelihood of environmental harm. 5. **Supporting conservation efforts**: In Georgia, mitigation banks often partner with government agencies, non-profit organizations, and local communities to enhance wetland restoration and protection efforts. These collaborations leverage resources and expertise to achieve broader conservation goals. In summary, mitigation banks play a vital role in restoring and protecting Georgia's wetland ecosystems by promoting ecosystem restoration, biodiversity conservation, environmental impact mitigation, sustainable land use, and supporting broader conservation efforts.",6.46E-79,0.169934641,0.072368421,0.117647059,0.861441553

However, based on available research, here are some key opportunities and challenges faced by the Navajo Nation in achieving food sovereignty: **Opportunities:** 1. **Traditional foods revival**: Reviving traditional Navajo farming practices and incorporating ancestral knowledge into modern agriculture can help restore food sovereignty. 2. **Increased access to healthy food**: By developing local food systems, the Navajo Nation can improve access to nutritious, culturally relevant foods for its citizens. 3. **Economic benefits**: Strengthening local food economies can create jobs, generate revenue, and stimulate economic growth in the region. 4. **Cultural preservation**: Food sovereignty initiatives can help preserve traditional farming practices, cultural traditions, and community knowledge. **Challenges:** 1. **Limited access to resources**: Limited financial, technological, and human resources hinder the Navajo Nation's ability to invest in modern agriculture and food systems infrastructure. 2. **Environmental constraints**: Environmental factors such as drought, soil degradation, and changing climate conditions can impact agricultural productivity and crop yields. 3. **Colonial legacy**: The historical impacts of colonization on Navajo agriculture and food systems have resulted in loss of traditional knowledge, land dispossession, and dependence on external food sources. 4. **Urbanization and demographic changes**: Rapid urbanization and shifts in population demographics can lead to increased demand for modern foods, making it more challenging to maintain traditional farming practices.

"Children Of Senegal Directly Benefit From USDA¡¯s McGovern-Dole International Food For Education Program  In keeping with USDA¡¯s commitment to addressing global food insecurity through school feeding programs, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced that USDA will donate more than 100,000 tons of U.S. agricultural commodities valued at nearly $170 million in fiscal year under the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition (McGovern-Dole) Program. The McGovern-Dole Program helps support education, child development and food security in low-income, food-deficit countries that are committed to universal education. The program has helped feed millions of children over the years and one example of the success of this program can be found in Senegal. Children in 112 primary schools and 21 pre-schools and mothers and infants in 58 maternal and child health nutrition (MCHN) centers in the Matam region of Senegal are eating a daily meal and much more due to a Counterpart International (CPI) project funded by USDA¡¯s McGovern-Dole Program.  acampbell  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Mar 01,   Respond to this story",What impact has the USDA's McGovern-Dole International Food For Education Program had on addressing food insecurity and improving child nutrition in low-income countries such as Senegal?,"The USDA's McGovern-Dole International Food For Education Program has helped address global food insecurity by donating over 100,000 tons of U.S. agricultural commodities, valued at nearly $170 million, to support education, child development, and food security in low-income countries like Senegal, where children are now receiving a daily meal through funded projects.","The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education Program, administered by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), has had a significant impact on addressing food insecurity and improving child nutrition in low-income countries like Senegal. Here are some specific examples: 1. **Increased School Enrollment**: The program provides school meal assistance to vulnerable children in participating schools, which leads to increased enrollment rates among poor households. In Senegal, for instance, there has been a notable increase in school attendance since the introduction of the McGovern-Dole program. 2. **Improved Nutrition and Health**: By providing nutritious meals to students, the program helps address food insecurity and related health issues among children. A study conducted by the USDA found that participating schools in Senegal reported improved student nutrition, reduced absenteeism, and better overall health outcomes. 3. **Enhanced Food Security**: The McGovern-Dole Program promotes sustainable agriculture practices and provides training on food security to farmers and local communities. This has helped improve agricultural productivity and access to nutritious foods in rural areas of Senegal. 4. **Women's Empowerment**: In many low-income countries, women are responsible for managing household resources, including food production and consumption. The McGovern-Dole Program empowers women by providing training on food security, nutrition education, and entrepreneurship opportunities related to agricultural activities. 5. **Collaboration with Local Governments and NGOs**: The program fosters partnerships between the USDA, local governments, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Senegal. This collaboration enables more effective coordination of resources, shared expertise, and increased impact on food security and child nutrition. In terms of specific metrics from Senegal, where the McGovern-Dole Program has been operational since 2013: * Over 220 schools have participated in the program. * The number of children benefiting from school meals has exceeded 60,000. * According to a USDA report (2020), participating schools reported an average increase of 22% in student attendance and a 15% reduction in absenteeism.

Last month, American farmers and businesses experienced what it was like to live without USDA Market News.

In the 100-year history of Market News, this was only the second time that the were not available.

Here are some potential consequences: 1. **Reduced market awareness**: Without access to accurate and timely market data, these businesses may struggle to understand current market conditions, leading to poor decision-making regarding pricing, production levels, and other critical business decisions. 2. **Increased uncertainty and risk**: Limited access to market information would make it difficult for these businesses to anticipate price fluctuations, changes in demand, and other market trends, increasing their overall risk exposure. 3. **Impaired ability to respond to changing market conditions**: Without up-to-date information on market developments, small and mid-sized agricultural businesses might find it challenging to adjust their production and pricing strategies accordingly, potentially leading to missed opportunities or losses. 4. **Difficulty in competing with larger operations**: Larger farms and agribusinesses often have better access to market intelligence and more resources to devote to market research. Without similar information, smaller operators may struggle to compete effectively. 5. **Potential loss of contracts or sales**: If small and mid-sized agricultural businesses are unable to respond effectively to changing market conditions, they might lose existing contracts or fail to secure new business opportunities, ultimately affecting their revenue and profitability.

As much damage and destruction these fires cause, even more may be on the way when future rains cause mudslides from soil erosion on barren hills.  That¡¯s where ¡°Woodstraw¡± comes in. WoodStraw? is a wood-based erosion control product that was developed by Forest Concepts, in Auburn, WA, using a Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) grant administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture¡¯s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).  This material is made from low-grade waste wood veneer and resembles oversized pick-up sticks.  Wood-based erosion control products have many advantages over traditional grass straw as an erosion-control material because it is heaver and will not blow away, is 100 percent seed and weed-free, and is effective on slopes of up to 70 percent grade. SBIR grants come in two forms: Phase I and Phase II.  A 6-month Phase 1 grant allows grantees to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed projects ¨C and gives the government a chance to determine the quality of the grantee¡¯s performance before awarding Phase II funding.  Phase II provide funding to awardees to continue their research and development efforts for up to 2 years. Forest Concepts proved its wood-based erosion control theory in initial field trials, where the product reduced erosion by more than 98 percent; it proved to be especially effective in reducing erosion in areas that have been impacted by forest fires.  Since , the company has produced more than 14,000 tons of material for projects managed by the U.S. Forest Service; the Bureau of Land Management; national parks; and state, county, and city departments of transportation and parks.  It has been used in more than 30 post-wildfire erosion control projects. In , Forest Concepts sold a license to Mountain Pine Manufacturing, Inc., to produce wood-based erosion control materials in Steamboat Springs, CO.  Mountain Pine uses dead, beetle-kill trees to produce material.  This process helps answer the region¡¯s beetle-kill problem and provides engineered mulch that promotes regeneration of new live trees.  Production at both facilities creates sustainable jobs in the erosion control and biomass production and supply industries. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education and extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Will COVID-19 Threaten Availability and Affordability of our Food?  As the COVID-19 virus continues to spread in the U.S., its impacts have reached every aspect of our lives and shook all sectors of the economy. Amid this crisis, there have been widespread worries that the disease could threaten the nation¡¯s food production and supply systems and stoke inflation. Many began to wonder whether the food they need will continue to be available and affordable as we work our way out of the outbreak.  Robert Johansson, USDA Chief Economist  Posted in  Coronavirus  Food and Nutrition  Apr 16,   6 Responses",Will COVID-19 lead to food shortages and affordability issues in the US?,"Yes.  there are widespread worries that COVID-19 could threaten the nation's food production and supply systems, potentially leading to food shortages and affordability issues in the US.","The short answer is yes, COVID-19 has already led to food shortages and affordability issues in the US, but it's essential to understand that these effects are complex and may vary depending on several factors. Here are some reasons why: 1. **Supply chain disruptions**: The pandemic caused widespread lockdowns, border closures, and reduced transportation capacities, resulting in delayed or lost shipments of goods, including food. 2. **Labor shortages**: Many agricultural workers, warehouse staff, and restaurant employees fell ill or stayed home due to fear of infection, leading to a shortage of labor to harvest crops and deliver food products. 3. **Increased demand for essentials**: As people stocked up on non-perishable items and household supplies, there was an unexpected surge in demand for these essentials, further straining the supply chain. 4. **Food waste and excess**: With reduced sales at restaurants and other food-service establishments, surplus food went uneaten, contributing to a shortage of fresh produce and meat products. 5. **Price volatility**: As global demand shifted and shortages emerged, prices for certain commodities like meat, dairy products, and fresh fruits and vegetables increased. 6. **Food insecurity and access issues**: Communities with limited economic means or existing food security concerns were disproportionately affected by these shortages. Some specific examples of food shortages and affordability issues in the US include: * Meatpacking plant closures led to a shortage of beef, pork, and chicken products (2020) * Nationwide bread shortages due to yeast and baking supply chain disruptions (2020) * Regional milk and dairy product shortages caused by transportation constraints and reduced processing capacity * Increased prices for staples like rice, pasta, and canned goods as a result of global market fluctuations However, it's worth noting that: 1. **US agriculture is relatively resilient**: The US has a strong agricultural sector with diversified production systems, which helped mitigate the impact of these disruptions. 2. **Many food manufacturers and distributors adapted quickly**: Companies responded to supply chain challenges by implementing new logistics strategies, sourcing alternative products, or expanding their e-commerce capabilities. 3. **Government support**: Various stimulus packages and policies aimed at supporting farmers, ranchers, and small businesses helped alleviate some of the strain on local economies. In conclusion, while COVID-19 has led to food shortages and affordability issues in the US, it's essential to acknowledge that these effects are temporary and largely localized. The US agricultural sector is generally well-positioned to recover from this crisis, but continued support for farmers, ranchers, and small businesses will be crucial to prevent long-term damage.",0.020178457,0.106904232,0.053691275,0.084632517,0.8458606
"Food Economics Division, Economic Research Service (ERS) in  Research and Science  May 14,  The Food Dollar Series includes the industry group value-added series, which divides the food dollar into total value added (cost share) for 12 industry groups: agribusiness; farm production; food processing; packaging; transportation services; energy; wholesale trade; retail trade; foodservices; finance and insurance; advertising; and legal and accounting services. In , consumers in the United States spent $1.2 trillion on U.S.-produced food. Nearly all food starts out on a farm, but did you ever wonder how the value added from processing, packaging, transporting, and marketing agricultural food products factors into the costs? USDA¡¯s Economic Research Service has a tool that can show you this breakdown. ERS recently updated its Food Dollar Series product. This most recent annual update added to the historical going back to . Aside from detailing what U.S. total food spending pays for, the Food Dollar Series tells us what consumers pay for at grocery stores (food-at-home dollars) and restaurants (food-away-from-home dollars). Of the $1.2 trillion in food spending, the largest cost share of the food dollar went to foodservices (restaurants) at 36.7 percent ¨C this pays for others to host, prepare, and serve our meals, then clean-up afterwards. The next largest share, at 15 percent, went to food processors, such as bakeries, meat and dairy processors, and frozen food manufacturers. Rounding out the top five industry groups are food retailers, like grocery store chains and independent grocers , wholesalers of both food products and production inputs , and farm producers . The farm producer¡¯s share is what they receive after they pay for production inputs like seed, fertilizer, and electricity. The value of farm commodities sold to fulfill food purchases represented 14.6 percent of the food¡¯s purchase price, down from 14.8 cents in . Although was the lowest level since the beginning of this series in and the 6th consecutive year the farm share dropped, the decline in was smaller than in and . For the fourth year in a row, saw no increase in the farm production cost share of the food dollar. But unlike in -16 when the cost of farm production in the food dollar dropped sharply, average prices received by U.S. farmers actually went up in . This period also coincided with six consecutive years of increases in the foodservice industry share of the food dollar, driven by a continuing trend of consumers spending more of their food dollars eating out. So, increases in eating-out spending by consumers actually offset the likely increase in the farm production cost share, as more money went to food services.

"A Tribute to American Indian and Alaska Native Communities¡¯ Contributions to Conservation, Agriculture  Did you know that Alaska is home to 229 federally recognized tribes, or 40 percent of all federally recognized tribes nationwide? Alaska Natives are also the largest private landowner in the state.  Sylvia Rainford, USDA  Posted in  Conservation  Nov 02,   Respond to this story","What is unique about Alaska's demographic composition, specifically with regards to federally recognized tribes and native land ownership?",Alaska has 229 federally recognized tribes (40% of all nationwide) and Alaska Natives are the largest private landowners in the state.,"Alaska stands out for its distinctive demographic profile, particularly when it comes to federally recognized tribes and Native land ownership. Here are some key points that highlight what makes Alaska unique in this regard: 1. **Large Number of Federally Recognized Tribes**: Alaska has a relatively high number of federally recognized tribes compared to other states. There are currently 22 federally recognized Indian tribes in Alaska, which is more than any other state except Oklahoma (which has 39). These tribes are organized into several regional associations that work together on issues affecting Native Alaskans. 2. **Ownership and Management of Tribal Land**: Alaska's tribal lands are significant, covering about 44 million acres. This represents approximately 15% of the total land area in the state. The majority of these lands are managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) on behalf of the tribes, ensuring that their rights to these lands are protected. 3. **Unique Land Settlement Pattern**: Alaska's land settlement pattern is distinct from other states. While most Native American reservations have a compact and contiguous geographic area allocated for tribal use, Alaskan federally recognized tribes hold title to vast tracts of land under various agreements with the federal government. These agreements can vary significantly in terms of land size, location, and management responsibilities. 4. **Tribal Corporations**: Alaska's unique system of tribal corporations is another distinct feature. Many of its federally recognized tribes have formed corporate entities to manage their lands, resources, and economic development activities. This approach allows them to engage in commercial activities, such as logging, mining, and oil drilling, while also ensuring the long-term sustainability of their natural resources. 5. **Self-Governance**: Alaska has a unique system of self-governance for its federally recognized tribes. The state has adopted several laws that allow Native corporations to govern themselves within certain parameters, giving them significant autonomy over their lands and affairs. This approach is aimed at promoting cultural preservation, economic development, and social welfare among the state's Native population. 6. **Resource Extraction**: Alaska's vast natural resources (such as oil, gas, timber, and minerals) make its land ownership and use patterns particularly complex. The rights of federally recognized tribes to these resources are often tied up with those of private companies and the state government, making the political landscape unique in terms of resource extraction. 7. **Cultural Preservation**: Given Alaska's vast cultural diversity among its Native populations, there is a strong emphasis on preserving traditional ways of life, languages, and practices. This includes support for education programs, cultural centers, and the preservation of historical sites and artifacts.",4.50E-79,0.066079295,0.022123894,0.057268722,0.834364414

"Chief Mathematical Statistician and Research and Development Division Director, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Research and Science  Jan 19,  The Census of Agriculture found that 14 percent of the nation¡¯s farms are run by a woman. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA¡¯s rich science and research portfolio.  The Census of Agriculture is still two years away but, at the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), we work hard to continually improve the we collect. The agriculture census conducted every five years is the one time we collect demographic information on today¡¯s farmers and ranchers. The Census found that 14 percent of the nation¡¯s 2.1 million farms are run by a woman, and women make up 30 percent of all farmers when up to three operators per farm are included. Similarly, 25 percent of farmers were beginning farmers (ten years or less on their current farm) in . But, as we get ready for the next census, we want to make sure that our fully capture the role of women farmers and beginning farmers in agriculture today. After releasing the Census results and based on feedback from stakeholders, we began to explore better ways to quantify the participation of women and beginning farmers in the operation of U.S. farms, given the limited space available on the questionnaire. NASS has asked farmers to identify the principal operators and other operators on the farm. Often the senior male family member is listed as the principal operator, even if he is no longer working. If a husband and a wife are partners on the farm and share equally in the operations, the husband is generally listed as the principal operator. How should the questions be asked so that the participation of beginning farmers and women are more fully identified? Last spring, USDA Deputy Secretary Krysta Harden and I hosted the first ever USDA Google+ Hangout to examine in images and stories the experiences of today¡¯s women farmers. It was an inspiring exchange that underscored how important it is for agriculture statistics to reflect women farmers¡¯ roles as well. To address the challenges in collecting additional and to make sure we are asking the best questions, we commissioned the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS) to convene an independent panel of experts. The panel reviewed the demographic questions on the Census of Agriculture as well as numerous other surveys. Input from stakeholders and the general public was solicited. The panel made recommendations on how NASS can best capture the changing face of U.S. agriculture in the next census. One of the panel¡¯s recommendations was to ask about the characteristics of up to four decision makers (not operators) per farm and the specific decisions they make for the operation. We are currently testing this proposed change, along with others. We mailed a draft census questionnaire to 30,000 farmers and ranchers around the country, asking them to help. By completing the form, they will help us determine whether the content, wording, and design enable respondents to provide the information that policymakers, businesses, farmers, and other stakeholders need. Further revisions to the questionnaire will be made based on these results. By participating in the test, farmers and ranchers help improve the Census of Agriculture questionnaire and help us provide a more precise count of America¡¯s farmers and their contributions.

"The Benefits of Studying a Domestic Goat with an Interesting History  In much of the developing world, goats are essential for survival and are highly valued for their meat, milk and hides. So it should come as no surprise that Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists and academic and industry colleagues, working with DNA from a domestic goat, used new technologies to develop a vastly improved and relatively inexpensive reference goat genome. This information will serve as a kind of instruction manual for scientists showing them how to use the same technologies to lower the cost of developing improved livestock genomes.

"USDA Ensures Food, Funding during Pandemic  This is a challenging time for many Americans when access to food is more essential than ever. Thankfully, USDA¡¯s vital partners are helping feed those in need during the coronavirus pandemic. And for that, we couldn¡¯t be more grateful. To support these important efforts, USDA is stepping up to provide over $6 billion worth of food and administrative resources in response to the crisis.  Brandon Lipps, Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services and Greg Ibach, Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs  Posted in  Coronavirus  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Jul 16,   1 Response",What role is the USDA playing in addressing food access needs during the coronavirus pandemic?,The USDA is providing over $6 billion worth of food and administrative resources to support vital efforts in feeding those in need during the crisis.,"The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has been playing a significant role in addressing food access needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some key initiatives and actions taken by the USDA include: 1. **Food Assistance Programs**: The USDA has increased funding for various food assistance programs, such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) program, and TEFAP (The Emergency Food Assistance Program). These programs help provide food to vulnerable populations, including low-income individuals and families. 2. **Food Distribution**: The USDA has partnered with non-profit organizations, state governments, and other stakeholders to distribute food to those in need. This includes providing emergency food assistance through the National Guard and distributing food boxes and meals to communities affected by the pandemic. 3. **School Meal Programs**: The USDA has taken steps to support school meal programs during the pandemic. For example, it has allowed schools to serve meals at no charge to students during the 2020-21 school year, helping to ensure that children have access to nutritious food even when they are not in school. 4. **Farmers Market and Community Support**: The USDA has provided support for farmers markets and other community-based food systems to help keep local food systems functioning during the pandemic. 5. **Food Recovery**: The USDA has also encouraged food recovery efforts, helping to reduce food waste by connecting surplus food with those who need it. 6. **Farmers-to-People Program**: In response to supply chain disruptions and increased demand for fresh produce, the USDA launched a new program called ""USDA Farmers-to-People"" in 2020. This initiative helps farmers get their products directly to consumers, often through online platforms or community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs. These efforts demonstrate the USDA's commitment to addressing food access needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuring that people have access to nutritious food, even in these challenging times.",2.38E-155,0.093841642,0.03539823,0.076246334,0.843736649
"Delivering Along the Food Value Chain  A recent trip back home to Louisiana sparked memories of a simpler time when old trucks full of fresh produce rumbled down dusty roads to deliver goods to the local market. The Census of Agriculture tells us that 50,000 farmers and ranchers nationwide are now selling to local retailers and that 150,000 of them are selling their products directly to consumers. Although these farmers and ranchers are still using this direct approach, the agricultural industry is certainly more dynamic today.  This means that producers need to follow a strategic business model. The reality is that food can go through a lot of steps to reach the consumer. Before it is served on the table, food travels from the field to the truck to the packing house to the store. My agency, the USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has many programs that support business entities involved in the food chain, including farmers markets and food hubs. For example, we invest in projects that help farmers and businesses understand emerging trends, create new markets, and stimulate our nation¡¯s rural economies.  Arthur Neal, Deputy Administrator, AMS Transportation & Marketing Program  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Jul 10,   Respond to this story","What strategies can farmers and ranchers use to effectively market and sell their products directly to consumers, while navigating the complexities of the modern food value chain?","Farmers and ranchers can consider using strategic business models that incorporate emerging trends, creating new markets, and leveraging programs such as those provided by the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), which support farmers markets and food hubs.","Farmers and ranchers can employ several effective strategies to market and sell their products directly to consumers, while navigating the complexities of the modern food value chain: 1. **Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Sales**: Engage in direct sales by establishing relationships with local grocery stores, farmers' markets, community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs, and online platforms that connect buyers directly with producers. 2. **Farmers' Markets and Roadside Stands**: Utilize traditional marketing channels like farmers' markets and roadside stands to reach consumers who value the freshness and uniqueness of locally grown products. 3. **Value-Added Products**: Develop and market value-added products such as jams, honey, baked goods, and meat-based products that appeal to consumers looking for specialty items. 4. **Online Sales Platforms**: Leverage e-commerce platforms like: * Online farmers' markets (e.g., Farmigo, LocalHarvest) * Direct-to-consumer sales websites (e.g., CSAbased.com, farmfreshdirectory.com) * Social media marketplaces (e.g., Facebook Marketplace, Instagram Shopping) 5. **Subscription-Based Models**: Offer subscription-based services like CSA programs or meat-of-the-month clubs to ensure a steady income stream and build customer loyalty. 6. **Farm-to-Table Restaurants**: Partner with local restaurants that value using fresh, locally sourced products in their menus, promoting both the restaurant's brand and your farm/ranch. 7. **Labeling and Certification**: * Consider obtaining certifications like USDA Organic or Certified Humane to differentiate your products from conventional ones. * Utilize labeling schemes like ""locally grown"" or ""sustainably raised"" to appeal to consumers concerned about the environmental and social impact of food production. 8. **Networking and Partnerships**: Build relationships with local food businesses, such as distributors, wholesalers, and retailers, to expand your market reach. 9. **Digital Marketing**: Leverage digital tools like email marketing campaigns, search engine optimization (SEO), and content creation to promote your products and engage with customers online. 10. **Grassroots Marketing**: Engage in community outreach and education efforts to build trust and foster a positive image of local agriculture among consumers. To navigate the complexities of the modern food value chain, farmers and ranchers can: 1. **Monitor Food Safety Regulations**: Stay informed about changing regulations and standards for food safety, labeling, and certification. 2. **Stay Informed About Market Trends**: Research consumer preferences and market trends to remain competitive and adapt their marketing strategies accordingly. 3. **Develop Strong Supply Chain Partnerships**: Build relationships with reliable suppliers and distributors to ensure efficient delivery of products to consumers. By implementing these strategies, farmers and ranchers can effectively market and sell their products directly to consumers while navigating the complexities of the modern food value chain.",0.008948914,0.121475054,0.030501089,0.073752711,0.822385907
"Growing a Community - One Family at a Time in Huron, S.D.  There are stark differences between Huron, South Dakota, and the Thailand Refugee Camp where the Maung Family started their journey.

"Construction Begins on a Rural Kansas Fire Station with Financing from USDA and an Electric Cooperative  The City of Quinter, Kansas, had a groundbreaking ceremony for a new fire station earlier this month.  All of the city¡¯s fire equipment will soon be under one roof, which will help improve the fire station¡¯s efficiencies when crews respond to emergencies in its 400 square mile service area.  The new station is being built with funding support from USDA and a local electric cooperative. According to City of Quinter Administrator, Ericka Gillespie, the city of less than 1,000 needed a new fire station because the old facility was not meeting the needs of the community.  A larger space was needed for training, storage, and additional fire protection equipment and trucks.  The larger fire station will also improve the department's fire rating, resulting in lower insurance costs.

"USDA Rural Development Idaho Public Information Officer in  Initiatives  Rural  Jan 05,   Wow, the first emergency call out of the new fire station.  As I pulled into the driveway of the new Heyburn, Idaho, Fire Station for the ribbon cutting, I was greeted with the red lights flashing on the fire truck as the fire crew rushed to their call.   Initially, I thought about how much faster the crew can respond to the family who needs their help due to the improved location of a new station, thanks in part to the USDA Rural Development Community Facilities Direct Loan program, with funds for this particular station being provided through the Recovery Act of .   But then my thoughts turned back to the two days prior, when the volunteers gathered at the new station for an additional training session.   Some of the volunteers on that truck were the same volunteers at the training, who were once again taking time away from their paid jobs, to ensure their neighbors and employers have access to the same emergency services that I take for granted living in the Boise metropolitan area. Volunteer Fire fighters are known for providing emergency services, but now I began to see how they also contribute to the economic opportunity of this rural community.  Their commitment not only saves local tax dollars, but also helps build a solid economic foundation.  We know that construction related jobs were saved during the construction of the new station, but how many jobs will be created or saved as a result of the emergency services provided through the fire fighters service? During the grand opening, it felt as if the entire community turned out for the ribbon cutting.  Most of the organizations involved in the planning, funding, and construction were present as well.   Afterward, I was told how the voters in the Minidoka County Fire Protection District overwhelming supported the bond for the new station.   A sense of pride came over me - I was fortunate just to be a part of this celebration, I was honored to have met these fine men (and woman) who sacrifice for their community, and I was proud to work for USDA Rural Development where we have such great partners and a loan program that helps rural communities provide adequate facilities, equipment, and training to their well deserving volunteers.

"Caribbean Hub Director in  Mar 17,  Dr. Guillermo Ortiz of the University of Puerto Rico and rancher Neftali Lluch of the Lajas Valley in Puerto Rico discuss various practical steps to combat rising temperatures and prolonged drought. Photo credit: University of Puerto Rico We are living in historic moments in the world¡¯s response to climate change. Last December in Paris, delegates from 196 countries signed an agreement to work towards curtailing greenhouse gas emissions and to keep global warming to ¡°well below¡± 2 ¡ãC degrees. This is a big step, but there is still much work to be done and the agricultural sector has an important role to play. Agriculture, forestry, and land degradation contribute just under a quarter of anthropogenic GHG emissions, mainly from deforestation and agricultural emissions from livestock, soil and nutrient management.  Climate change also poses a great challenge for food security and nutrition. It can reduce yields and affect where and how food is produced. As the risks of natural disasters increase, farmers need to modify how they produce food in order to become more resilient to prolonged droughts, excessive rains, floods, and more intense storms. Farmers in the Caribbean are among the most strongly affected by climate change, as Caribbean countries are in general highly vulnerable to climate change due to their geography and socioeconomic status. So what farming practices can tropical producers use to adapt and minimize the impacts of climate change? The USDA Caribbean Climate Hub, located at the US Forest Service International Institute of Tropical Forestry in Puerto Rico, is partnering with Universities and farmers in the U.S. Caribbean to release ADAPTA, a series of demonstration projects that communicate the best adaptive practices available to tropical producers. ADAPTA logo As part of the series, we are developing videos and factsheets that highlight adaptation practices in dairy, plantain, fruit and vegetable, and forest production. ADAPTA is part of an integrated communications plan to deliver climate adaptation practices to a diverse set of producers that builds on the assessment of risk and vulnerabilities that we completed last year to better understand the potential effect of climate change on agriculture and forestry in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. ¡°Cattle & Dairy Farming in the Tropics¡± is the first video released and highlights adaptation practices for tropical dairy producers. Dairy is an important farming practice in Puerto Rico and St. Croix, involving more than 50,000 acres and generating over 25,000 jobs. Drought and heat have been hitting producers hard and have had detrimental effects on the livestock and dairy industries by making cattle more susceptible to worms, ticks, and dairy cattle becomes stressed and produce less milk. As grasses died due to lack of rain, producers in the U.S. Virgin Islands were forced to take measures ranging from collecting tree limbs and branches for fodder, to relying on imported feed and even culling herds. Pastures were so over taxed, that many will have to be re-sown completely at great cost to farmers. In Puerto Rico, producers saw their costs rise as they relied ever more heavily on imported feed. Many also saw their production go down as heat stress and lack of nutrients took their tolls on local herds. Unfortunately, climate models in the region are predicting dramatic changes in rainfall cycles, in which prolonged periods of drought are interrupted by intense rainfall events. However, there are measures that farmers can take to reduce the impacts of drought and increased temperatures, as showcased in the first video of the ADAPTA series. We believe Caribbean producers are some of the most innovative in the world. Through this project we hope to highlight and share how local farmers are adapting to remain successful in the face of climate change and other challenges. The Caribbean Hub is promoting cooperation by providing open venues and forums to address climate vulnerability as part of the USDA Regional Climate Hub comprehensive strategy to help farmers mitigate and adapt to climate change. The Climate Hubs are integrating efforts of the USDA Agricultural Research Service, National Resource Conservation Service, the US Forest Service, and other USDA agencies with state governments, local universities, and non-profits to help coordinate and streamline efforts to ensure the vitality of US working lands in the face of climate change.

"Agricultural Marketing Service Deputy Associate Administrator in  Research and Science  Feb 12,  Currently a proposal for an Organic R&P is getting closer to Step 1 in the creation process. While a proposal has not been formally submitted to USDA, a proponent group is working with stakeholders to develop a draft. USDA photo courtesy of Sam Jones-Ellard. We often talk about the many ways research and promotion (R&P) programs benefit both ag industries and the consumer. Our nation¡¯s farmers and ranchers leverage these programs and the pooled resources they collect to help overcome marketing barriers and connect with consumers. R&P programs are self-help initiatives that are national in scope and funded by the industry to help these businesses continue to strengthen their rural economies and the communities they support. To form a new R&P, there are specific steps that the industry and USDA follow:  STEP 1: A proponent submits a proposal to USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), which oversees all national R&P programs. The proposal typically includes an analysis of the industry, the program¡¯s objective, and its potential impact on small businesses. While there are specific requirements needed for a proposal, the proponent can tailor the proposed program to best meet a specific industry¡¯s needs. For example, some proposals include different eligibility requirements to vote in their referendums or an exemption for small producers, handlers and importers. STEP 2: USDA publishes the proposal in the Federal Register, soliciting public comments so that prevailing industry thoughts are incorporated into the final program. This is important because these programs will use pooled resources from across the industry to invest in creative marketing campaigns and innovative research projects that will support all of the industry¡¯s growers, handlers, processors, manufacturers and importers. STEP 3: After the comment period ends, USDA reviews and analyzes the comments to determine whether the program has merit to move forward. STEP 3a: If a review of comments shows general consensus or agreement among the industry stakeholders, USDA moves forward with the proposal and a second proposed rule is published in the Federal Register to announce a referendum so the industry can vote on the rule. STEP 3b: If a review of the public comments suggests that a proposal needs to be re-evaluated, there are two options:  1) if the comments suggest a need to adjust parts of the proposal, a supplemental proposed rule can be published to modify parts of the proposal and request that the industry provides further comments; 2) the proposal is terminated. STEP 4: USDA conducts a referendum, allowing eligible parties to vote on whether or not the measure is approved. STEP 5: If the referendum is approved by the eligible voters within the industry, USDA issues a final rule implementing the program. For proposals that request a delayed referendum, the program will be announced as a final rule with a referendum to be held at a later date. STEP 6: Nominations from the industry are collected and a board is appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture to represent the interests of the entire industry. USDA seeks nominations from the industry for board members and alternates. These steps are intended to help the farmers and businesses establish a framework that will work across an entire industry and make the broadest positive impact for everyone involved.  Industry research and promotion programs have played an important role in shaping the agricultural landscape and yielding positive results for farmers and businesses throughout the country. For example, when research supports adding lean pork to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ¨C or DASH ¨C eating plan, it helps consumers create healthy menus to meet their nutritional needs and it helps pork producers connect with a larger consumer base. And an August economic analysis found a return on investment (ROI) of $8.87 for every dollar the peanut industry invested into the National Peanut Board activities over the last 5 years. These are just a couple of ways that research and promotion programs are making a positive contribution for our nation¡¯s agricultural businesses. USDA is committed to supporting these industry-driven programs, and ensuring that they address the needs and help meet the challenges faced by today¡¯s farmers and agricultural businesses. Currently a proposal for a Hardwood Lumber R&P has reached Step 3 in the process. Public and industry comments are being evaluated by USDA. Photo courtesy of IndoGemstone.

"Secretary Perdue Proclaims April as ¡®Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month¡¯  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .19  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@oc.usda.gov  (Washington, D.C., April 1, ) ¨C Spring is a popular time to move, but unfortunately, people aren¡¯t the only ones on the move. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue today signed a national proclamation (, 579 ) to declare April ¡°Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month,¡± during a critical time when damaging invasive species known as Hungry Pests emerge and can be easily spread in the things people pack and move, such as outdoor items like grills, gardening equipment, wading pools and bicycles or patio furniture. Hungry Pests are a real problem. They attack trees, plants and agriculture, costing the United States about $40 billion each year in damages and expensive eradication and control efforts. Household moves increase the risk for the spread of these invasive species, since people can potentially transport them to new areas. About 35 million Americans move every year, making the possibility of transporting invasive pests high. For instance, federal and state inspectors often find gypsy moth egg masses on outdoor household items and recreational vehicles in non-infested areas. The United States Department of Agriculture¡¯s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS) is offering a free checklist for household moves that includes suggestions and tips for reducing this risk. The agency is also working with the United States Postal Service¡¯s My Move program to help educate the moving public about the things they can do to help prevent the spread of Hungry Pests. ¡°Hungry Pests can hide inside plants, fruits, vegetables and firewood, and spread in a number of ways, like on outdoor items you move to a new home or on an RV that has been parked outside and driven cross-country,¡± said Kevin Shea, APHIS Administrator. ¡°It only takes one person to start a new infestation, which is why we all need to be careful and understand how to stop invasive pests.¡± Here are key ways the public can help:  Moving to a new home. Help protect your new city and neighborhood from invasive pests by removing eggs masses and insects from your patio furniture, grills, bikes and other outdoor items ¨C before they are loaded onto the moving van or storage pod.  Traveling within the United States. Before doing an out-of-state trip, make sure your car, RV or other outdoor vehicle is cleaned first. Check the wheel wells, bumpers and other hard-to-see areas to make sure they are free of soil, egg masses, and insects. In addition to moves, pests can also be spread by:  Mailing homegrown plants, fruits and vegetables. Commercially bought goods are regulated to meet government standards, including those for invasive pests, but items grown in a home garden are not. If you live in an area quarantined for a specific pest, don¡¯t mail produce or plants from your garden to others. Contact your local APHIS office for more information.  Moving untreated firewood. Invasive pests like the emerald ash borer and Asian longhorned beetle burrow inside wood to lay their eggs. Don¡¯t take untreated firewood with you, for example, on camping trips. Instead, buy certified, heat-treated firewood or responsibly gather wood at your destination.  Traveling internationally. It¡¯s tempting to want to return with an unusual plant, a souvenir made from plants or wood, or even a piece of fruit as a snack for the plane trip home. However, U.S. laws prohibit many of these items from entering the country because they could harbor an invasive pest. Contact your local APHIS office to find out what¡¯s allowed. And always declare these items to U.S. Customs and Border officials when you land. Failure to do so could result in unexpected delays and fines.  Buying plants for your garden. When buying garden items in person, be sure to ask the retailer if they comply with federal and state quarantine restrictions to ensure their plants are free of invasive pests. Before you buy plants online, check if the seller is in the United States. If they are in another country, you might need an import permit or other documents to legally bring the items into the United States. Contact your local APHIS office for more information. Finally, learn more by going to www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests or join the conversation on Facebook and Twitter. The website includes photos and descriptions of each Hungry Pest, and a Pest Tracker to find those in your state. To report a pest or contact your local APHIS office, visit www.aphis.usda.gov/planthealth/sphd or call USDA Customer Service toll free at 1-844-820- (Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Eastern). # USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer and lender.","What should you not do when mailing homegrown plants or produce to others, according to USDA guidelines?","You should not mail homegrown plants or produce from areas quarantined for a specific pest to others, as this can spread invasive pests. Contact your local APHIS office for more information.","According to USDA guidelines, when mailing homegrown plants or produce to others, you should NOT send them if they are: * Infested with pests (such as insects, mites, or eggs) * Contaminated with soil or debris * Showing symptoms of disease * Overripe or rotten Additionally, the USDA recommends that you avoid sending fruits and vegetables that have been previously treated with pesticides or other chemicals, as this may compromise the safety of the recipient. If you follow these guidelines, you can safely mail homegrown plants or produce to others while minimizing the risk of introducing pests, diseases, or contaminants.",0.045291379,0.236220472,0.128,0.173228346,0.867275417
"International Affairs Fellow, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Feb 26,  Targeting over 80 crops, the Fall Armyworm poses a significant threat to global food security.

But even scientists can¡¯t always predict how far their work will eventually go. Recently, USDA researchers in Florida have seen their work take on unexpected relevance in Africa with the outbreak of an invasive crop pest. Fall Armyworm (FAW, Spdoptera frugiperda) is a destructive pest that can feed on 80 different crop species, including corn. Native to the Americas, USDA has studied FAW since the s. U.S. farmers currently manage it through integrated pest management approaches, combining the use of pesticides, genetically engineered crops, and other technologies and techniques. FAW was first reported in Africa in , and has now been documented in more than 30 African countries. Although we have decades of experience managing FAW in the United States, it is relatively new to African farmers, where corn is a staple crop for more than 300 million subsistence farmers and small-scale producers. The international community has mobilized to address this growing crisis, with U.S. Government agencies contributing their own expertise. USDA¡¯s significant experience with the pest in the U.S. has positioned it as a trusted source of technical information on FAW biology and control measures. Studies by USDA scientists Robert Meagher and Rodney Nagoshi (Insect Behavior and Biocontrol Research, Gainesville, FL) provided valuable technical insights in the recently released Fall Armyworm in Africa: A Guide for Integrated Pest Management. With tips on pest identification, available technologies, and best practices for managing FAW, this guide was jointly produced under the U.S. Government¡¯s Feed the Future initiative by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and the CGIAR Research Program on Maize (CRP MAIZE). Research that started out with the objective of helping U.S. corn farmers increase their yields is serving double duty now, playing a role in African food security. Although you can¡¯t predict what agricultural issues the future may hold, you can count on USDA research having a global impact. USDA scientists provided expertise and training for the new guidebook countering the Fall Armyworm¡¯s destruction of African crops. Recently, USDA shared FAW information in the Feed the Future information booth at the recent USDA Agricultural Outlook Forum.

In the 1990s, researchers at the University of Arizona conducted studies on the Fall Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) as part of a project aimed at improving crop yields in the US through the development of Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) crops. These genetically modified crops were designed to produce their own insecticides, targeting pests like the Fall Armyworm. However, as the global food security situation began to deteriorate in the early 2000s, particularly in Africa, these same researchers redirected their focus towards developing a more comprehensive understanding of the Fall Armyworm's impact on food production. The key breakthrough came with the discovery that Bt crops could not only control local pests but also reduce the prevalence of the invasive Fall Armyworm. By leveraging the existing research and adapting the insights gained from studying Bt crops in the US, scientists were able to develop effective management strategies for the Fall Armyworm on a global scale. This shift in focus enabled them to contribute meaningfully to addressing food security concerns across Africa. The outcomes of this redirected research are twofold: 1. **Improved crop yields**: By controlling pest populations effectively using Bt crops or similar methods, farmers in Africa can now maintain higher levels of crop productivity. 2. **Enhanced food security**: The capacity to manage the Fall Armyworm more efficiently means that staple crops (which often serve as primary sources of food) are less vulnerable to damage and loss. This research demonstrates how a project initially conducted for domestic purposes can evolve into a global initiative addressing broader, interconnected challenges like food security.",7.28E-79,0.173374613,0.068535826,0.117647059,0.855058849
"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Apr 09,  Spotted lanternfly. (USDA photo by Lance Cheung) (Editor¡¯s note: Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue on April 1 proclaimed ¡°Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month.¡± The following illustrates some of the research that USDA¡¯s National Institute of Food and Agriculture supports to control invasive pests in agriculture.) Good things come in small packages, right? Not always. Oftentimes, what may appear to be a vibrant field of pastoral charm or gently blowing golden waves of grain are actually battlefields where small invading armies threaten the nation¡¯s economic, social, and environmental well-being. ¡°Nearly every terrestrial, wetland, and aquatic ecosystem in the United States has been invaded by non-native species, with economic losses estimated at $137 billion per year,¡± said Robert Nowierski, national program leader for biobased pest management at USDA¡¯s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). NIFA is in the vanguard of the fight to control, mitigate, and eradicate invasive pests, through funding and national program leadership. NIFA¡¯s invasive pest portfolio includes sponsorship of four Regional Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Centers; establishment of the National Plant and Animal Diagnostic Laboratory Networks; and funding State Agricultural Experiment Station projects, the regional research and extension efforts of multi-state committees, and plant production and protection research conducted through the Small Business Innovation Research program. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques, such as biological control, habitat manipulation, modification of cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, and minimizing the use of pesticides. Benefits of IPM include greater survival of a pest¡¯s natural enemies, slower development of pesticide resistance, less pest resurgence, fewer outbreaks of secondary pests, less negative impact on the environment, and greater worker safety. In addition, many farmers report greater profits because they¡¯ve reduced their expenses on pesticide. NIFA¡¯s programs support projects from research discovery, through research and development, to extension education and implementation of plans. Some of the higher profile invasive pest projects include the brown marmorated stink bug, spotted wing drosophila, West Nile virus, and the spotted lanternfly. According to Nowierski, the spotted lanternfly is probably the showiest of the invasive species pests. ¡°I was on an invasive species field tour last year and visited a farmer¡¯s grape vineyard severely impacted by the spotted lanternfly. He lost half-a-million dollars from spotted lanternfly damage to his 40-acre vineyard in !¡± NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

As part of Bird Health Awareness Week, USDA recently hosted a webinar on ¡°Growing Chicks into Healthy Chickens.¡±  Dr. Martin Smeltzer, Andy Schneider (aka the ¡°Chicken Whisperer¡±) and Dr. Claudia Dunkley spent an hour helping backyard bird owners learn more about keeping their flocks healthy.  Around 300 people participated in the webinar, most of who are just getting started with backyard birds. The goal of Bird Health Awareness Week is to help protect backyard birds from disease. The webinar focused on the cute little baby birds known as chicks. Now, I am not a poultry person, but I love eggs, so I thought this would be something interesting to learn.  I found out that raising backyard poultry is a growing trend.  People like to raise chicks into adults for their eggs, and for the entertainment value of having birds in their backyard. I didn¡¯t know there were so many rules when it comes to starting a flock. You need to think about why you want to raise backyard birds and what you intend to do with them.  You also need to find out if it is legal where you live - check city and local ordinances and find out if you need a permit.  If you have one, you should also check with your Homeowners Association.   Look to see if inspections or other steps are to start a flock, and be sure to buy chicks from a National Poultry Improvement Plan- approved source to ensure they start out healthy. I was surprised to find out that young chicks must be separated from older birds, for them to be secure and safe from disease.  Let chicks grow into birds in a separate, clean environment before introducing them into your flock that contains older birds. There are two major diseases that can threaten backyard birds - Avian Influenza and Exotic Newcastle Disease. The webinar discussed six simple steps to help protect your birds from disease.  We also learned what potential signs of illness might include and what to do if you think your birds might be sick. Are you considering raising birds or want some tips for adding to your current flock?

Photo courtesy of Ray Hammerschmidt With support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture¡¯s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), the National Plant Diagnostic Network has grown into an internationally respected consortium of plant diagnostic laboratories dedicated to enhancing agricultural security by protecting health and productivity of plants in agricultural and natural ecosystems.  Dr. Ray Hammerschmidt, President of the National Plant Diagnostic Network, discusses this partnership and the benefits all Americans receive in the following guest post: Superheroes really do work among us. But, instead of capes and cowls and ice palaces and caves, they are often found in a lab at a public university or state agriculture department, wearing lab coats and working over a microscope. These men and women work daily to protect our communities and crops from dangerous pests and pathogens.  They are plant pathologists, entomologists, nematologists, weed scientists, and other plant scientists who work diligently to mitigate the impact of endemic, emerging, and exotic pathogens and pests that attack agricultural, forest, and landscape plants in the United States. We live in a global society where people, food, and materials travel in and out of our country 24 hours a day.  In addition to natural introduction of pathogens and pests ¨C such as the hurricane that brought soybean rust to the United States ¨C our ports, highways, and airports are also entryways for new insects and diseases that hop a ride on cargo containers, suitcases, and even travelers¡¯ clothing. Whether it is citrus greening disease (which is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid and threatens citrus production), emerald ash borer (an exotic beetle that has killed millions of ash trees in North America), or purple loosestrife (which invades our wetlands and displaces native vegetation), plants, pests, and pathogens threaten our food and water supply and, potentially, our economic security. The scientists, engaged with the National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN), are on the front lines and protect us from these threats by providing timely and accurate diagnostics. Established in , NPDN represents individuals from land-grant universities, federal agencies, state departments of agriculture, and other stakeholders and is an internationally respected consortium of plant diagnostic laboratories. NPDN provides a cohesive, distributed system to quickly detect and identify pests and pathogens of concern. NPDN laboratories immediately report their findings to appropriate responders and decision makers. To accomplish its mission, NPDN has invested in diagnostic laboratory infrastructure and training, developed an extensive network of first detectors through education and outreach, and created an enhanced communication network among public agencies and stakeholders responsible for responding to and mitigating new outbreaks. Their work is supported in part by the U.S. Department of Agriculture¡¯s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). NPDN labs routinely support national, state, and local response to disease and pest outbreaks. They have trained and registered 11,480 first detectors nationwide. In addition, NPDN labs have been involved in more than 1 million diagnoses, and this number climbs daily. The network serves as a model for efficiency, communication, and integration across jurisdictions, especially in rapid response situations. Federal funding for the NPDN network is essential to continue to protect our agriculture jobs and global trade. More importantly, NPDN scientists protect our economic security by fighting against pests and pathogens, sometimes long before they are even detected in the field and have started to do damage.

"APHIS Public Affairs, Fort Collins, CO in  Animals  Plants  Dec 14,   APHIS' National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) recently received the Colorado Governor¡¯s Award for High-Impact Research for its development of the GonaConTM Immunocontraceptive Vaccine (GonaCon).  The award was one of four given to Colorado-based labs for their cutting-edge research with global impact. The Colorado state Chief Operating Officer Don Elliman presented the award to NWRC¡¯s Dr. Lowell Miller during a banquet hosted by CO-LABS. CO-LABS is a consortium of research universities, businesses, state and local governments and economic development councils with a mission to educate the public about the value of Colorado's 24 federal research labs. GonaCon is the first single-shot, multi-year immunocontraceptive vaccine for use in mammals. It was registered in by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as the first wildlife contraceptive for use in female white-tailed deer.  Not only might this new tool be useful as part of urban white-tailed deer management plans where traditional options are limited, but it also shows promise in other areas, such as disease prevention. GonaCon has been successfully tested in other mammal species, including elk, feral horses, bison, prairie dogs, ground squirrels, and feral dogs and cats.  In addition to wildlife management research, NWRC and collaborator studies include the development of a combined GonaCon-rabies vaccine for use in feral dogs and raccoons, contraception for companion animals, and the prevention of adrenocortical disease in pet ferrets and spread of brucellosis in bison.  The vaccine is being used for research purposes in the United States, Mexico, Europe, New Zealand and Australia.

Some of the most significant effects include: 1. **Habitat Destruction**: Nutrias are herbivores that feed on a wide variety of aquatic plants, grasses, and other vegetation. They can consume large quantities of plant material in a short period, leading to: * Loss of biodiversity: By consuming native vegetation, nutrias can disrupt the food chain and alter the composition of local ecosystems. * Soil erosion: The removal of plant cover can lead to soil instability and increased sedimentation in waterways. 2. **Water Quality Degradation**: Nutrias contribute to water quality issues through: * Feces and urine contamination: Their waste can pollute water sources, making them unsuitable for human consumption or recreational use. * Algal blooms: Excess nutrients from nutria feces can stimulate algae growth, which can lead to oxygen depletion in waterways. 3. **Native Species Displacement**: Nutrias compete with native species for resources, leading to: * Reduced populations of native herbivores and carnivores * Changes in community composition and structure 4. **Economic Impacts**: The invasion of nutria can have significant economic consequences, including: * Losses in agricultural production (e.g., rice, corn, and other crops) * Increased costs for water treatment and management * Negative impacts on recreational activities (e.g., fishing, boating) 5. **Human Health Risks**: Nutrias can carry diseases such as leptospirosis, which can be transmitted to humans through contact with contaminated water or soil. 6. **Increased Biotic Potential**: Nutrias are prolific breeders and can rapidly colonize new areas, leading to: * Population explosions * Increased competition for resources among native species The consequences of releasing invasive nutria into wild ecosystems can be severe and long-lasting. It is essential to prevent their introduction through strict regulations, public awareness campaigns, and education on the risks associated with these invasive animals.",5.75E-232,0.026143791,0,0.019607843,0.803235948
"From Devastation to Restoration  Wildfires in sagebrush and other range ecosystems are increasing in frequency and severity, often in relation to drought conditions and intrusive species like cheatgrass, a non-native, highly flammable invasive species that establishes itself as a monoculture and crowds out native grasses and forbs. ¡°What¡¯s preferable to a monoculture is a diverse plant community that includes native grasses, forbs and shrubs,¡± said Francis Kilkenny, leader for the Great Basin Native Plant Project, a joint effort of the U.S. Forest Service and the Department of Interior¡¯s Bureau of Land Management, or BLM.  Diane Banegas, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Feb 11,   Respond to this story",How do invasive species like cheatgrass contribute to the increased severity and frequency of wildfires in sagebrush ecosystems?,"Invasive species like cheatgrass contribute to the increased severity and frequency of wildfires in sagebrush ecosystems by establishing themselves as monocultures, crowding out native grasses and forbs, and increasing flammability.","Invasive species like cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) play a significant role in contributing to the increased severity and frequency of wildfires in sagebrush ecosystems. Here's how: 1. **Fuel buildup**: Cheatgrass is a highly flammable, non-native grass that quickly grows and spreads, forming a dense mat on the ground. As it dries out over the summer months, it creates a fire-friendly environment by accumulating a large amount of fine fuels (small twigs, leaves, etc.). This creates a perfect ""matchstick"" condition for wildfires to spread rapidly. 2. **Fuel load**: Cheatgrass can grow up to 3-4 feet tall, forming a continuous layer of dry vegetation that fuels fires. As the grass grows and dies, it builds up a large fuel load, making it easier for fires to ignite and spread. 3. **Ignition sources**: The presence of cheatgrass increases the likelihood of human-caused ignition events, such as accidental campfires or discarded cigarettes, which can quickly spread into larger wildfires. 4. **Wind conditions**: In sagebrush ecosystems, strong winds are common during the summer months, which can fan small fires into massive blazes that sweep through the landscape, destroying everything in their path. 5. **Competing for resources**: Cheatgrass competes with native vegetation (like sagebrush) for water and nutrients, weakening the resilience of the ecosystem to wildfires. When cheatgrass dominates, it reduces the diversity of plant species, making the entire system more susceptible to fires. 6. **Changing fire regimes**: Invasive grasses like cheatgrass have altered the traditional fire regime in sagebrush ecosystems, shifting from low-frequency, high-severity fires to high-frequency, low-severity fires. This change allows invasive grasses to thrive and further exacerbates the risk of wildfires. The combined effects of these factors contribute to the increased severity and frequency of wildfires in sagebrush ecosystems, making it more challenging for land managers and conservationists to restore and maintain healthy, fire-resistant ecosystems.",0.043311827,0.146627566,0.088495575,0.129032258,0.857530475

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Jan 09,  Roadside sign promotes Texas recovery attitude. No one knew when Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas on August ates. Texans along the Gulf Coast saw cities demolished, peak wind gusts as high as 130 mph, unprecedented rainfall of more than 50 inches that caused catastrophic flooding in areas, the death of 88 Texans, displacement of thousands of residents and more than $200 million dollars in agricultural losses. Traveling through Refugio to Victoria after Hurricane Harvey I saw the devastation to homes, businesses and the lives of so many ¨C it brought tears to my eyes. Then I saw a sign that summed up Texans¡¯ resilience ¨C ¡°Harvey was strong, Texas is stronger.¡± I immediately turned around and took a picture. Diebel (left) discuss NRCS assistance options with NRCS District Conservationist Kevin Isom. And strong is what farmers and ranchers have to be in their daily lives faced with the challenges of working in agriculture, especially when dealing with Mother Nature. Rancher Stephen Diebel of Diebel Cattle Company, rode out Hurricane Harvey at his family¡¯s century old ranch in Victoria. He was unsure what devastation the daylight hours would reveal after listening to howling winds and pounding rain throughout the night. He knew it was one of the worst hurricanes he had been through during his time on the ranch. When dawn finally broke, Diebel¡¯s first sight was the twisted metal of outbuildings and barns, sheets of metal like crumpled pieces of paper laying scattered across his pastures. The pastures and roads were covered in water as far as he could see. A sense of relief washed over him after seeing the calves alive and well. He had feared they had been killed when the hay barn collapsed. The calves often sought shade and shelter there. ¡°I was in disbelief that the weather could cause such a mess. It¡¯s hard to comprehend the workload ahead of you,¡± said Diebel. A busy cow-calf operation with many items on the daily ¡°to-do¡± list like calf weaning were put on the back burner as the more immediate needs were undertaken by Diebel, his family and ranch crew. Diebel said the hurricane put the operation behind 30 to 45 days on cattle weaning since they had to get power lines fixed and water wells going again. He was able to scout the ranch looking at other damages and found the windmills had taken their last spin during the storm. The bent blades made the systems inoperable. Diebel, whose family has worked with USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) on conservation efforts for several generations, realized one of his first calls needed to be to Kevin Isom, district conservationist with NRCS in Victoria. He knew NRCS would likely have assistance available to help replace the windmills with solar water pumps and panels to get the water flowing again. ¡°With the cost of repairing windmills going up each year, it only made sense to take this opportunity to look at improving the efficiency and dependability of our watering systems with solar,¡± said Diebel. ¡°The NRCS technical assistance through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) have helped make improvements to maximize the land and natural resources, such as brush management, range planting, cross fencing, and conservation enhancements.¡± He filed an early exemption with NRCS so he was able to obtain bids and start the process of installing the solar pumps and solar panels. The early exemption does not guarantee funding for USDA programs, but it does allow the producer to install the practice before funding is awarded. Thankfully, flooding concerns were less severe on the Diebel ranch. He contributes this to the family¡¯s conservation practices, particularly rotational grazing that keeps pastures covered in forage and builds healthy soil. The healthy soil was able to soak in the rain instead of ponding for days in the fields. As I watched the cattle enjoy the green grass that was abundant after the rain and listened to Diebel talk about how thankful he was that his family and friends were safe, I knew that even when faced with Mother¡¯s Nature¡¯s wrath, he like other Texans would rally together to rebuild and be stronger as a result of Hurricane Harvey.

Category/Topic:  Conservation  Tags:  Natural Resources Conservation Service  NRCS  Conservation  hurricane  Texas  Environmental Quality Incentives Program  EQIP  Conservation Stewardship Program  disasters","What agricultural management practices, such as rotational grazing, can help mitigate damage from severe weather events like Hurricane Harvey?","Rotational grazing is a conservation practice that can help mitigate damage from severe weather events by keeping pastures covered in forage and building healthy soil. This allows the soil to soak up rain instead of ponding, reducing flooding concerns and making it easier to recover after a disaster.","Rotational grazing and other conservation agriculture practices can indeed help mitigate damage from severe weather events like Hurricane Harvey. Here are some ways in which they can be beneficial: 1. **Soil Erosion Prevention**: Rotational grazing helps maintain soil cover, reducing erosion caused by heavy rainfall or flooding. By allowing pasture to grow back between grazed areas, the risk of soil being washed away is significantly reduced. 2. **Water Holding Capacity**: Soil with high organic matter content can hold more water, making it less prone to flooding and runoff. Conservation practices like rotational grazing help improve soil health by increasing its carbon and nutrient content. 3. **Reducing Runoff**: By allowing vegetation to grow on land instead of being grazed constantly, the risk of runoff is significantly reduced. This helps in preventing water-borne pollutants from entering rivers and streams, which can be critical in areas prone to flooding like Hurricane Harvey's path. 4. **Lessen Sedimentation**: The reduced erosion and runoff mean less sediment in waterways. This can reduce the need for dredging operations post-flooding, saving resources and money. 5. **Crop Resilience**: Practices like conservation tillage and cover cropping help prevent soil crusting and promote root growth. These factors enhance crop resilience against extreme weather conditions. 6. **Reduced Soil Salinization**: In regions where heavy rainfall is followed by prolonged droughts, practices that improve water infiltration can reduce the risk of soil salinization. 7. **Enhanced Nutrient Cycling**: Rotational grazing ensures that livestock nutrient demands are met from within the farm or ranch itself, reducing the need for external inputs like synthetic fertilizers. This helps in maintaining a healthy and balanced ecosystem. 8. **Improved Water Quality**: By reducing runoff and erosion, these practices contribute to better water quality, which is crucial for human consumption and aquatic life. 9. **Increased Carbon Sequestration**: Healthy soils can sequester carbon more effectively, contributing to climate change mitigation efforts. 10. **Adaptation and Resilience**: These agricultural management practices enhance the overall resilience of farms and ranches against extreme weather events like Hurricane Harvey. They are not just helpful in mitigating damage; they also support long-term recovery by promoting soil health, which is key for agriculture's adaptability to climate change. In summary, adopting conservation agriculture practices can significantly reduce the impact of severe weather events on agricultural land, infrastructure, and ultimately, human life and livelihoods.",0.022470139,0.160550459,0.055299539,0.110091743,0.848333418
"The Year of the Flood  Incidents described as ¡°thousand year storms and floods¡± and ¡°the worst U.S. disaster since Hurricane Sandy¡± claimed the lives of more than 58 people in Louisiana, West Virginia and South Carolina over the last year.  These disasters often remind us of the devastating impacts that families and their communities face after they strike. After emergency life saving operations, food and shelter assistance are the most important priorities with which emergency managers must contend.  It was during these times that the U.S. Department of Agriculture¡¯s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) responded to 22 incidents by providing needed nutrition assistance.  More than half of these disasters involved severe and widespread flooding, including the most recent floods that affected residents in 22 parishes in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Here are some of their top priorities: 1. **Search and Rescue Operations**: The first priority was to locate and rescue people stranded by the floodwaters. Emergency responders focused on reaching isolated areas, especially in rural communities where access was limited. 2. **Shelter and Mass Care**: Providing safe shelter for those affected was crucial. Emergency managers set up emergency shelters, evacuation centers, and other mass care facilities to accommodate displaced individuals and families. 3. **Water Supply and Sanitation**: Ensuring access to clean drinking water and maintaining sanitary conditions were top priorities. Emergency responders worked to restore or establish water treatment plants, and provide portable toilets and sanitation facilities where needed. 4. **Food Distribution**: Providing food to those affected was essential. Emergency managers coordinated with local non-profit organizations and government agencies to distribute food, especially in areas where access to grocery stores was limited. 5. **Health Services and Medical Care**: The risk of waterborne illnesses and other health concerns increased after flooding. Emergency responders prioritized providing medical care, vaccinations (if necessary), and mental health support to affected individuals. 6. **Infrastructure Assessment and Repair**: Assessing the damage to critical infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and utilities, was crucial. Emergency managers worked with engineers and contractors to repair or replace damaged infrastructure, ensuring public safety and access to essential services. 7. **Communication and Coordination**: Effective communication between emergency responders, government agencies, and affected communities was vital. Emergency managers established incident command systems, coordinated with national and state authorities, and provided regular updates on the situation. 8. **Environmental Assessment and Remediation**: The floodwaters carried pollutants, debris, and hazardous materials, posing a significant risk to human health and the environment. Emergency responders prioritized assessing and remediating contaminated areas to prevent long-term environmental harm. 9. **Long-Term Recovery Planning**: As the immediate response phase concluded, emergency managers began planning for the longer-term recovery of affected communities. This included assessing damage, identifying resources needed for rebuilding, and coordinating with local governments and stakeholders to support the recovery process. 10. **Mental Health Support**: The emotional toll of the floods was significant, especially among children and vulnerable populations. Emergency responders recognized the importance of providing mental health support and counseling services to affected individuals. These priorities were not exhaustive, but they reflect some of the key challenges faced by emergency managers in response to these devastating ""thousand year storms.""",0.010861129,0.094808126,0.040816327,0.081264108,0.848206699

"Rural Development Arizona Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  Jan 24,   Rain poured through the roof of the old Black Canyon, Arizona, fire station, making the floor slippery and rusting the tin that covered the roof. Nonetheless, the one ambulance and fire truck that would fit into the aging metal shed still faired better than the other five vehicles parked outside. Those vehicles were not only pelted by rain and hail, but Arizona¡¯s scorching sun baked them during much of the year¡ªrotting the tires, fading the paint, and drying out the parts and equipment. Parking the vehicles outside also meant that the theft risk was greater, which increased insurance rates. A dilapidated trailer from the 70s was parked next to the shed. Three bunk beds were crammed into the small bedroom for use by fire crews. ¡°It¡¯s hard to recruit firefighters when they have to be housed in those conditions,¡± said Fire Chief Tom Birch. On January 21, a large crowd gathered to officially cut the ribbon for a new fire station for Black Canyon City. The new building has plenty of room¡ªwhich means that all of the Department¡¯s vehicles can be parked inside. It also has office space, a reception area, kitchen and three bunk rooms. The total project cost was $1.5 million. USDA Rural Development funded over half of that total. The Fire Department and their long list of building fund contributors made up the difference. That list of community supporters took two full pages of small type to list in the grand opening program. Chief Birch was joined at the ceremony by Fire District Board Members past and present, and the contractor and architect for the new facility. Also on hand were Arizona State Director of USDA Rural Development Alan Stephens, Bureau of Land Management District Manager Angelita Bulletts, Yavapai County Supervisor Tom Thurman and USDA Community Programs Director Leonard Gradillas. ¡°Because of the distances involved in this rural area, our volunteers are to be here at the station during their shifts,¡± said Birch. ¡°Morale has soared since we got the new station.¡± The Spacious interior of Black Canyon City Fire Department Building-Residents line up for a potluck meal.

"New Resource to Aid Land Managers in Adapting to Climate Change  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .16  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  WASHINGTON, Feb. 1, ¡ª The U.S. Forest Service today released a new report, Effects of Drought on Forests and Rangelands in the United States: A Comprehensive Science Synthesis, that provides a national assessment of peer-reviewed scientific research on the impacts of drought on U.S. forests and rangelands. This report will help the Forest Service better manage forests and grasslands impacted by climate change.""Our forests and rangelands are national treasures, and because they are threatened, we are threatened,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""This report confirms what we are seeing, that every region of the country is impacted by the direct and indirect effects of drought conditions and volatile weather patterns. Sixty million Americans rely on drinking water that originates on our 193 million acres of national forest and grasslands. They support 200,000 jobs and contribute over $13 billion to local economies every year.""The report establishes a comprehensive baseline of available that land managers can use to test how well their efforts to improve drought resilience and adaptation practices are working nationwide. Major findings from the report include: Drought projections suggest that some regions of the U.S. will become drier and that most will have more extreme variations in precipitation. Even if current drought patterns remained unchanged, warmer temperatures will amplify drought effects. Drought and warmer temperatures may increase risks of large-scale insect outbreaks and larger wildfires, especially in the western U.S. Drought and warmer temperature may accelerate tree and shrub death, changing habitats and ecosystems in favor of drought-tolerant species. Forest-based products and values ¨C such as timber, water, habitat and recreation opportunities ¨C may be negatively impacted. Forest and rangeland managers can mitigate some of these impacts and build resiliency in forests through appropriate management actions.""Since , fire seasons have grown longer and the frequency, size and severity of wildland fires have increased,"" said Vilsack. ""Among the many benefits of having this solid baseline is the improved ability to identify where restoration work can help forests adapt and prosper while minimizing the threat and impact of future wildfires.""The assessment, a broad review of existing drought research, provides input to the reauthorized National Integrated Drought Information System ( NIDIS), established by Congress in , and the National Climate Assessment ( NCA), produced every four years to project major trends and evaluate the effects of global climate change on forests, agriculture, rangelands, land and water resources, human health and welfare, and biological diversity. Together these serve as key, science-based, resources for anyone working to maintain or improve public and private lands in the face of a changing environment.Edited by Forest Service scientists in partnership with Duke University, the document provides a valuable new tool to inform discussion, planning and implementation of adaptation strategies for land managers and policy makers. The collaborative effort, authored by 77 scientists from the Forest Service, other Federal agencies, research institutions and universities across the United States, examines ways to understand and mitigate the effects of drought on forests and rangeland including the 193 million acres of National Forest System lands.The implications of the findings of this report are likely to have far-reaching effects on the environment for the foreseeable future. As climate change drives temperatures increases and precipitation patterns change, drought¨Cand associated disturbances such as insect outbreaks and wildfires-will only get worse across many areas of the United States.The mission of the U.S. Forest Service, an agency of the Department of Agriculture, is to sustain the health, diversity and productivity of the nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations. The agency manages 193 million acres of public land, provides assistance to state and private landowners and maintains the largest forestry research organization in the world. Public lands managed by the Forest Service contribute more than $13 billion to the national economy each year through visitor spending alone. Those same lands provide 20 percent of the nation's clean water supply, a value estimated at $7.2 billion per year.

"Conservation Outreach Intern in  Conservation  Forestry  Jun 05,   The beauty of watching a flock of birds migrating on the wing is a sight many enjoy.  Protecting their habitats to help them on their journeys is part of the work that U.S. Forest Service employees across the nation do every day. ¡°Forests and grasslands managed by the U.S. Forest Service are critical to maintaining migratory bird populations, but Forest Service involvement goes well beyond the boundaries of Forest Service lands,¡± said John Sinclair, National Wildlife Program leader. ¡°By working in local, regional and international partnerships, we conserve migratory bird species and their habitats across the Americas.¡± One such partner is, Wings Across the Americas, which invests in international conservation efforts.

"Public Affairs, Siuslaw National Forest in  Forestry  Jun 12,   It was chilly and wet when they arrived in western Oregon, but that didn¡¯t dampen the excitement of the 165 sixth-grade students from six small schools who arrived via yellow buses, pick-up trucks, vans and even a horse trailer at this year¡¯s Forest Camp Outdoor School near the small town of Lebanon. They kicked off the first day with an all-camp meeting where students were introduced to staff, sang songs and learned camp rules. Campers met their counselors (one parent and one high school student) and moved into one of the 19 cabins. Then they spent the afternoon at challenge courses, cabin development classes and listening to encouraging stories to help gear them up for a successful week away from home.

Some165 sixth-grade students from several small schools attended this year¡¯s Forest Camp Outdoor School. (USFS photo/Jenny Bocko) The rest of the week was spent learning about aquatic ecology, wildland fire, watershed health, how trees grow and the best way to shoot a bow and arrow. Campers spent their time outside of class singing songs, hanging out with new friends and at special evening activities acting in skits, listening to stories from counselors and folk dancing. The week culminated with Wilderness Night, where students and counselors built campfires and created their own shelters out of sheets of plastic and rope. The night brought a little rain but the consensus on Friday morning was that campers had a safe and great time. Forest Camp started in at the Fall Creek Fish Hatchery when employees of the Alsea Ranger District of the Siuslaw National Forest felt that local kids could benefit from more exposure to natural resources. They worked with Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Starker Forests and small local schools to formulate a plan that resulted in a successful week long residential camp. More than 3,500 kids have attended Forest Camp since its inception. Partners providing instruction at camp include: Siuslaw National Forest, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Starker Forests, Benton County Soil and Water Conservation District, Eugene District Bureau of Land Management, Salem District Bureau of Land Management, Pacific Northwest Research Station and many independent volunteers.

However, no specific safety measures are mentioned in the content provided regarding campfire safety or other evening activities.","I don't have specific information on any particular camping event or location. However, I can provide general information on common safety measures that are typically taken at campsites to ensure campers stay safe during evening activities and campfire use: 1. **Established Campsite Perimeter**: Campsites usually have a designated area for campfires. To prevent accidental fires or injuries from stray flames, this area is typically marked with clear boundaries. 2. **Fire Pits and Rings**: Many campsites provide fire pits or rings to contain the fire within a safe area. These are designed to collect sparks and embers, reducing the risk of larger fires spreading beyond the campsite. 3. **Supervision by Camp Staff**: During evening activities, especially when building campfires, camp staff often supervise campers closely. This ensures that safety guidelines are followed and any potential hazards can be quickly addressed. 4. **Safety Briefings and Rules**: Before allowing campfires or engaging in other potentially hazardous evening activities, camps typically provide a briefing on safety rules and procedures. These briefings might include information on firewood storage, the safe handling of flammable materials, and what to do in case of an emergency. 5. **Access to Water**: Having access to water is crucial for extinguishing fires quickly if they get out of control. Camps usually ensure that there's a nearby source of water available. 6. **First Aid Kits on Site**: First aid kits are always available at campsites. This ensures that any injuries can be promptly treated, reducing the risk of complications from minor issues. 7. **Emergency Plans and Procedures**: Campsites often have detailed plans in place for emergency situations, including fires or medical emergencies. These might include evacuation procedures, communication plans with local emergency services, and protocols for handling various types of incidents. 8. **Regular Fire Inspections**: To maintain safety standards, camps might conduct regular inspections of campfires to ensure they are being used safely and efficiently, with adequate supervision by camp staff. 9. **Education on Wilderness Safety**: Many camps provide educational sessions or workshops on wilderness safety, which cover the risks associated with campfire use, such as burns from sparks, firewood storage, and potential hazards in the area. 10. **Regulations Compliance**: Camps are required to comply with local, state, and national regulations regarding environmental protection and public safety. These regulations often mandate specific practices for campfire management, such as not burning certain types of materials or ensuring that fires are fully extinguished before leaving them unattended. While these measures can minimize risks associated with evening activities at campsites, including building campfires, the actual implementation of these safety measures can vary significantly from one camp to another.",2.15E-155,0.12704918,0.016460905,0.081967213,0.830619097

"USDA Food and Nutrition Service, Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 18,   I get to learn about a lot of great local initiatives when I make visits around the country.  On a recent trip to Dallas, I visited Metrocrest Social Services, a community resource agency in Farmers Branch, Texas, that provides services to families in crisis and helps them make plans for the future. The purpose of the visit was to learn how outreach workers from the North Texas Food Bank come to this office to assist clients submit applications for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Camilla Zimbal, social services director, gave me a tour of the agency, and showed me some of the other services available to clients. One of the highlights of this one-stop shop is a food pantry at which pantry clients may select groceries once a week. In addition to the canned and boxed food, they can also select fresh-from-the-garden fruit and vegetables. Camilla Zimbal, social services director for Metrocrest Social Services, explains how they get fresh produce for their clients to Audrey Rowe, administrator for Food and Nutrition Service. Community gardeners, farmers and individuals donate locally grown produce weekly to Metrocrest.  Produce is harvested early each Saturday morning from three nearby community gardens and a local high school garden and brought to Metrocrest for volunteers to wash, sort and display in time for a 9 a.m. opening. While clients are limited to once-a-week groceries, they may come in at any time for fresh produce. On a recent Saturday morning, over 40 people came in just for the produce. During peak growing season, when tomatoes and cantaloupes are ripening, even more clients show up for the delicious fresh produce, which is then delivered twice a week. Volunteers at Metrocrest provide recipes and cooking instructions for folks that may not have much experience cooking fresh foods. Recently, frozen chicken was available at the pantry. Volunteers made sure clients went home with some fresh herbs and cooking instructions for the chicken. Those who choose to donate fresh food also enjoy a benefit¡ªproviding fresh produce is a great way to give back to the community by helping fight hunger and promote healthy eating. Zimbal gave an example of a local couple in their seventies who picked bushels of ripe peaches from trees in their backyard and brought them to the pantry.  This was a delicious and special treat for clients and a sweet way for the couple to help others. Another example of thoughtfulness was the recent donation of tomato plants so clients could grow their own tomatoes. This kind of local food sharing is a great example of ways farmers and backyard gardeners can give back to the community and help provide healthy food to those in need.

Excess produce is often donated to local food banks and pantries. 2. **Gleaning Organizations**: Groups like Gleaners and Food Finders coordinate with farmers, ranchers, and gardeners to collect surplus produce that would otherwise go to waste. This produce is then distributed to food banks, pantries, and other hunger relief organizations. 3. **Backyard Garden Donations**: Home gardeners can donate excess produce from their gardens to local food pantries or shelters. Some cities have organized ""garden-to-table"" programs where residents can drop off fresh produce at designated collection points. 4. **Farmers' Market Produce Recovery Programs**: Some farmers' markets now have programs that collect unsold, unspoiled produce and redistribute it to local food banks, soup kitchens, and other hunger relief organizations. 5. **Food Recovery Hubs**: Organizations like Feeding America's Food Recovery Hub program connect local food banks with excess produce from grocery stores, restaurants, and farms. This produce is then distributed to individuals in need. 6. **Volunteer Gleaning Teams**: Groups of volunteers, often school children or community groups, can be organized to help harvest surplus crops on local farms. This produce is then donated to food pantries and shelters. 7. **Direct Donations from Local Farmers**: Some farmers donate excess produce directly to local food pantries or accept donations in-kind for items like seeds, fertilizers, or equipment that benefit their farm operations. 8. **Crowdsourced Produce Collection**: Online platforms and social media campaigns can be used to coordinate the collection of surplus produce from individual households, gardens, or farms, which is then donated to food banks and pantries. In Dallas, Texas, specifically, Metrocrest Social Services has partnered with local organizations like Gleaning Dallas and Food Rescue US to collect and distribute fresh produce to their food pantry clients. These innovative approaches ensure that the people in need receive nutritious, high-quality food, while also supporting local farmers and gardeners.",1.93E-155,0.111380145,0.01459854,0.06779661,0.811417818

Zoonotic diseases are illnesses that can be transmitted from animals to humans, such as leptospirosis, hantavirus, and rat-bite fever. Here's how researchers studying Norway rats contribute to the prevention of these outbreaks: 1. **Surveillance**: By tracking the movement and behavior of Norway rats in urban areas, investigators can identify potential sources of zoonotic disease transmission. This information helps health authorities target high-risk areas and implement control measures. 2. **Disease monitoring**: Researchers study the prevalence of zoonotic diseases among Norway rat populations. This data enables them to monitor disease trends and predict outbreaks, allowing for proactive measures to be taken to prevent human exposure. 3. **Vector-borne disease identification**: By analyzing the presence of zoonotic pathogens in Norway rats, investigators can identify vectors (e.g., ticks, fleas) that transmit diseases between animals and humans. This information helps inform public health strategies aimed at reducing vector populations and preventing disease transmission. 4. **Urban ecology studies**: Understanding the urban ecosystem and how it supports rat populations is essential for effective control measures. Researchers study factors like food availability, shelter, and water sources that contribute to rat infestations. This knowledge enables targeted interventions to reduce rat populations and prevent disease spread. 5. **Development of public health strategies**: By analyzing data on Norway rats and their associated zoonotic diseases, investigators can inform the development of evidence-based public health policies and interventions. These may include vector control programs, rat population management strategies, and human education campaigns to prevent disease transmission. By studying Norway rats in urban environments, researchers contribute significantly to: 1. **Early detection**: Identifying potential disease outbreaks before they occur. 2. **Prevention**: Implementing targeted measures to reduce the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. 3. **Public health preparedness**: Ensuring that healthcare systems are equipped to respond effectively to emerging disease threats. In summary, investigators studying Norway rats in urban environments play a vital role in detecting and preventing human outbreaks of zoonotic diseases by providing insights into disease ecology, transmission dynamics, and effective control measures.",4.69E-79,0.100263852,0.047745358,0.089709763,0.848632276

"Posted by the Equity Team in  Equity  Aug 01,  Growing up in a diverse community in Manhattan, USDA Equity Commission¡¯s Elizabeth Lower-Basch understood the importance of civil rights, unions, and equity at a young age. Inspired by her upbringing, Lower-Basch went on to earn a master¡¯s degree in public policy and began her career with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). At HHS, Lower-Basch worked on cash assistance and learned more about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the impact it has on millions of people. Lower-Basch¡¯s desire to expand equitable access to food assistance for all who needed it grew from her experience working on SNAP and assisting children, seniors, and working people struggling to put food on the table. Following her time at HHS, Lower-Basch went to the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) where she currently serves as the Deputy Executive Director for Policy. CLASP works to develop and implement federal, state, and local policies that improve the lives of those in need. In her role, Lower-Basch provides leadership, strategic guidance, and support for the organization¡¯s policy and advocacy agenda. Her work at HHS and CLASP has directly informed her contributions on the Equity Commission where she brought forward recommendations on how USDA can improve its efforts to reduce poverty and promote food and nutrition security. ¡°I¡¯m happy to represent those who cannot afford ¨C or have the capacity to ¨C take on volunteer opportunities such as this [Equity Commission], and to tell their story and advocate for their wellbeing and food security,¡± she said. The four nutrition-focused recommendations Lower-Basch introduced were shaped by her experience with the community partnership group at CLASP where she heard firsthand how limited or lack of access to programs and services can impact families. In the recommendations, the Equity Commissions asks USDA to continue to encourage state SNAP agencies to administer SNAP in a way that treats applicants and participants with dignity and respect and to consult with those with lived experience of poverty as they administer the programs and provide technical assistance on how to do so. In addition, the Equity Commission recommends the review and update of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP), which forms the basis of SNAP benefits, to reflect the needs of today¡¯s consumers and supporting legislative action to remove eligibility restrictions on SNAP that disproportionately limit access to nutrition supports by Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC). ¡°It was important for us to ensure the recommendations were informed by real people with lived experience, not just academia, so that they are actionable and impactful,¡± Lower-Basch explained. Nutrition programs are especially important during the summer when school is out, and childhood food insecurity is highest. USDA is taking action to address this through its Summer Nutrition Programs, or SUN programs. New for summer , SUN Bucks, also known as Summer EBT, is providing $120 in grocery benefits for eligible kids for the summer. SUN Meals and SUN Meals To-Go are also providing expanded options for kids to get meals at schools, parks and other locations. The expansion of summer benefits and nutrition support is proven to reduce child hunger in the summer by 33% while improving children¡¯s diets. In addition, USDA has made updates to the WIC food program, increased SNAP benefits, improved the nutrition of school meals, expanded access to school meals at no cost to families, and more. All of these actions further the goal of equitable nutrition assistance for those in need, a pillar focus in the Commission¡¯s Final Report. Since the release of the Equity Commission¡¯s Final Report with 66 recommendations, USDA has been partnering with the Commission Members to host Regional Convenings across the country to engage stakeholders in meaningful conversations on agriculture and equity issues as well as opportunities that exist in their region and how USDA can be of service. ¡°These convenings showcase how interconnected we all are and how much USDA does ¨C and can do ¨C for our communities,¡± Lower-Basch said. ¡°Equity means everyone has a chance.

"Undersecretary, USDA Rural Development in  Energy  Rural  Jun 09,   As a farmer in eastern South Dakota, I witnessed one of the biggest growth periods in renewable energy in our country's history. I saw firsthand how the investments in biofuels benefited rural Americans by creating jobs and capturing wealth locally. Leaders in the community got together, made commitments to invest in renewable energy projects, and shared in the success of the projects once they matured. Renewable energy projects are not only good for the rural economy, they are an important component of President Barack Obama's across-the-board approach to building an energy infrastructure. The path he laid out will secure our energy future and promote economic growth by out-innovating and out-competing global competition. Renewable energy production is smart for our country both strategically and economically. As gas prices have gone up, we are reminded that oil supplies are fragile and that global events and speculation can have a large effect on the price. Whether it is tumult in the Middle East or hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico, the long and complex supply chains for petroleum energy can be disrupted by a multitude of events.  This solar module, funded in part through USDA¡¯s Rural Energy for America Program, is oriented to the south on a ground-mounted rack near a rural business in Tippecanoe County, Indiana.  Abundant domestic resources make the expanded use of clean, reliable and American-made renewable energy the best way to mitigate these risks in the long run and take control of gas prices. Producing renewable energy here at home not only increases economic and strategic security, but also provides job growth and captures the wealth of energy production in the communities that produce it. Building on the success of conventional biofuels, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is working with research centers and private businesses to develop new generation biofuels made from feedstocks such as switch grass, corn stover and algae. The promise of new generation biofuels is enormous and provides the greatest hope for our work to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Additionally, USDA is interested in finding ways for rural Americans to use alternative energy technologies that harness the power of wind and sun. The wind that regularly whips through the Great Plains and across Texas can drive turbines that provide energy to individual farms or for sale to the electrical grid. The powerful sun in the American Southwest can heat the solar panels that provide the energy to operate a business or defray the energy costs in a home. One important way we support the effort to expand renewable energy generation and use is through the Rural Energy for America Program. REAP gives rural Americans the opportunity to take the lead in the production of alternative energy by tapping into all of rural America's natural resource strengths. The program supports, among other things, biomass, wind and solar energy projects from applications received from rural small business owners or agricultural producers. Under the REAP program, $61 million has been made available in guaranteed loans and $42 million has been made available for grants. Those funds can be used for various energy efficiency projects including anaerobic digesters on livestock farms, audits of energy improvements and, now, flex-fuel pumps. For additional information, refer to www.rurdev.usda.gov. With tools like the REAP program, USDA is helping rural America lead the way to our nation's renewable energy future. And we can't afford to wait any longer for our economy, our national security, and for prices at the gas pump.

The key is to implement efficient and sustainable practices that reduce costs, increase yields, and decrease environmental impact. Here are some strategies the USDA could employ: 1. **Diversification of Feedstocks**: - **Switch Grass**: As mentioned, switch grass can be a significant source of feedstock. Its low water requirement makes it ideal for regions where water is scarce. - **Corn Stover and Other Agricultural Waste**: Utilizing crop residues as feedstocks not only reduces waste but also increases the economic viability of biofuel production. - **Algae**: Algae-based biofuels offer a high-energy density option. However, challenges such as high production costs need to be overcome for it to become a viable competitor. - **Other Feedstocks**: Exploring other potential feedstocks like agricultural by-products, forestry residues, and even urban waste could provide a more diverse base of input materials. 2. **Innovative Production Methods**: - **Advanced Biochemical Processes**: Implementing cutting-edge biochemical processes can improve efficiency in converting biomass into biofuels. - **Biorefineries**: Building integrated biorefineries where various products from the same biomass (e.g., fuels, chemicals, animal feed) are produced could significantly enhance the profitability of the industry. 3. **Sustainable and Environmentally Friendly Production**: - Implementing practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions per unit of fuel produced. - Promoting efficient use of water and minimizing land-use changes for biofuel feedstocks can help maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services in rural areas. 4. **Economic Support and Incentives**: - The USDA could offer grants or tax breaks to encourage farmers and entrepreneurs to invest in the production and refining of next-generation biofuels. - Developing a strategic reserve for biofuels could stabilize markets, attract investment, and protect against price volatility. 5. **Research and Development (R&D) Initiatives**: - Investing in R&D can lead to breakthroughs in technology that reduce costs, increase efficiency, and ensure the environmental sustainability of biofuel production. - Public-private partnerships for R&D can leverage resources from both sectors efficiently. 6. **Infrastructure Development and Logistics**: - Building a robust infrastructure (storage facilities, pipelines) could enhance the distribution of these fuels, making them more competitive in the market. 7. **Education and Training Programs**: - Offering training programs for farmers and industry professionals on best practices for biofuel feedstock production can ensure quality input materials. - Educating consumers about the benefits of next-generation biofuels (e.g., lower emissions) could increase demand. By implementing these strategies, the USDA can help create a more competitive and sustainable biofuels industry in rural America. This approach not only fosters economic growth but also promotes environmental sustainability and social equity by supporting farmers, reducing reliance on foreign oil, and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.",2.29E-155,0.194139194,0.040441176,0.10989011,0.832630932

Some of these effective ways include: 1. **Visual Repellents**: These consist of reflective materials, such as shiny tape or reflective balloons, that birds find unappealing due to their brightness. Farmers place these visual deterrents in areas where birds are most likely to congregate. 2. **Acoustic Repellents**: Sound devices emitting high-frequency sounds undetectable by humans but unpleasant for birds are used. These can be particularly effective against species like geese and ducks, which are often considered pests due to their impact on crops. 3. **Ultrasonic Repellent Devices**: Similar to acoustic repellents, these units emit ultrasonic sounds that are inaudible to the human ear but disturbing for birds. They're an efficient way to deter larger bird species without causing them harm. 4. **Bird Spinning Tape**: This is a type of visual repellent tape specifically designed with spinning reflective strips. It creates movement and reflections, making it unsettling for birds and often successfully driving them away from the protected area. 5. **Methyl Anthranilate (MA)**: MA is used as a bird repellent in agriculture. It's an organic compound that emits a very unpleasant smell to birds but is harmless to humans. This method has been shown to effectively deter bird species, especially those considered pests. 6. **Netting**: Physical barriers such as netting can also be deployed over crops or areas where birds are causing damage. Netting prevents birds from accessing these areas and thereby stops them from damaging the crops. 7. **Motion-Activated Sprinklers**: These sprinklers automatically activate when they detect motion, often startling birds away with their sudden water spray. This method doesn't harm the birds but is a simple way to deter them from certain areas. 8. **Shooting Bird-Repellent Pellets**: Some farmers and researchers use pellets that explode or produce a loud noise upon impact, startling the nearby birds away. These are designed to be non-lethal and can effectively scare birds off for extended periods without causing them harm. 9. **Hot Pepper Sprays**: Solutions made from hot peppers can irritate the eyes of birds, making it uncomfortable for them to approach areas where these sprays have been applied. 10. **Predator Decoys and Repellents**: Mimicking predators such as owls or hawks can also be an effective method in scaring off larger bird species that perceive them as threats. Some farmers use decoy models of birds of prey, along with repellent sounds or smells, to effectively deter their actual pest counterparts. These methods are not mutually exclusive and can often be used in combination for optimal results, depending on the specific needs and concerns of each farm or agricultural operation.",0.011347647,0.106776181,0.032989691,0.0862423,0.828349233

"Forest Hydrogeologist, U.S. Forest Service Eastern Region in  Forestry  May 31,  Water quality is monitored by volunteers with the Monday Creek Restoration Project. MCRP photo. For nearly a century, the aquatic life that once thrived in the Monday Creek Watershed has been virtually dead. The goal of this Recovery Act project, known as ""Devastation to Destination,"" is to construct a healthy functioning riparian corridor, restore water quality, and create an integrated land management strategy resulting in species diversity among existing aquatic and wildlife habitats. It is located in Perry County between the towns of New Straitsville and Shawnee, Ohio. The drainage was heavily impacted by underground mining activities in the late 's and again in the mid 's from strip mining. The drainages were blocked by piles of old mine waste and soils. The estimated 60 million gallons of water that falls here in a typical year ends up in the old mines, producing acid mine drainage which is toxic to aquatic life and has a harmful effect on the adjacent riparian vegetation. Over the last fifteen years, the Wayne National Forest and our partners have worked together to restore the watershed, which encompasses 75,000 acres in three counties. In addition to interpreting the natural history of the area, the Forest Service also has the opportunity to educate the public about the importance of continued cleanup of old abandoned mine lands. Numerous features are incorporated in the project¡¯s clean-up activities including: opening all blocked drainages and allowing the water to flow freely from the site, creating a prairie meadow on the upper slope of the site, building a pond stocked by Ohio Department of Natural Resources with three species of fish, and planting approximately 1,300 native species suitable for each habitat created. Partners in the project include: Heavy Equipment Management Program at Hocking College, Monday Creek Restoration Project, Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the Little Cities of Black Diamonds .

The newly renovated building will provide improved confidentiality and security, more office space and better facilities for staff to meet with clients. The larger shelter includes six bedrooms with a total of 24 beds, more bathrooms, a large new kitchen designed for convenient use by multiple residents, better laundry facilities, and is handicapped accessible. There is also a large living and dining area for residents, a children¡¯s play room and a teen room. The lower level includes a room which can be used for groups or meetings. Established in , HAVEN, Inc. works to support the needs of the community by providing services to children, families, and adults who have been affected by abuse, violence, or sexual assault. When first started, the group used members¡¯ homes for temporary shelters for abuse victims. It bought its first shelter building in . As the need for services grew, it became evident that a new, larger shelter was needed. A convenient building, the former Lincoln County Land Services Building known as ""the Annex"" was vacant with no prospective buyer. With $65,000 in the building fund, the HAVEN Board of Directors made an offer to the County Board for the Annex building, well below the County¡¯s asking price of $249,000. The sale was unanimously approved last February. Through a capital campaign, lead by volunteers, more than a half a million dollars was raised for the rehabilitation project. Community businesses and residents also donated materials, services, time, and furnishings to the new shelter. It was announced at the grand opening event that more than 2,800 volunteer hours were put towards the completion of the new facility. HAVEN, Inc. was also awarded a $100,000 USDA Rural Development Community Facilities Grant for the renovation project. Grant funds were used toward the purchase of furnishings and equipment for the new shelter building including an elevator, sprinkler system, fencing, plumbing fixtures, a new security system, updated phone system, parking lot resurfacing, landscaping and cabinetry.

"New Film to be Shown at USDA: Restoring the South's Brook Trout--Raise a Glass of Water to the Return of a Regional Icon  For a community of brook trout in the southern Appalachian mountains, there are signs that the good times are coming back. To some, these native inhabitants might even appear to be waving a welcome home sign. Their numbers almost vanquished, they are as much a cultural emblem of these rugged and lush mountain forests as they are an important signal for the highest quality drinking water. This is what makes their fate of such interest to the millions who live in the surrounding watersheds and to those involved in an inspiring partnership to help them along. They are also the subject of a new film, ¡°Bringing Back the Brooks: Reviving the South¡¯s Trout¡± produced by Freshwaters Illustrated in partnership with the U.S. Forest Service.  Nat Gillespie, Fisheries Program, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Mar 18,   Respond to this story",What cultural and ecological significance do brook trout have for the southern Appalachian region?,"The brook trout are a cultural emblem of the rugged mountain forests and an important signal for high-quality drinking water, holding significant interest for millions living in surrounding watersheds.","The brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) holds significant cultural and ecological importance in the southern Appalachian region, which spans across parts of Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, and West Virginia. Here's a breakdown of their importance: **Cultural Significance:** 1. **Native American Heritage**: The brook trout is deeply connected to the indigenous peoples who have lived in these mountains for thousands of years, including the Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Choctaw tribes. In their traditional stories, legends, and artwork, the fish plays a significant role as a food source, spiritual symbol, and cultural icon. 2. **Fishing Tradition**: Brook trout fishing has been an integral part of Appalachian culture for generations, with families passing down their knowledge of streams, rivers, and waterways to their children and grandchildren. The fish is often associated with rural life, economic self-sufficiency, and community bonding. 3. **Ecotourism**: The pursuit of brook trout fishing has contributed to the region's ecotourism industry, supporting local economies and promoting conservation efforts. **Ecological Significance:** 1. **Aquatic Ecosystems**: Brook trout are an apex predator in their native streams, regulating populations of aquatic insects, zooplankton, and other small fish. They play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of these ecosystems. 2. **Biodiversity Hotspot**: The southern Appalachian region is a global biodiversity hotspot, with many rare and endemic species found nowhere else on Earth. Brook trout are an important component of this rich biodiversity, influencing the evolution of other aquatic organisms. 3. **Water Quality Indicators**: As sensitive fish that inhabit clear, well-oxygenated waters, brook trout serve as indicators of water quality in their habitats. Their presence or absence can signal broader ecosystem health and potential issues such as pollution, habitat degradation, or climate change.

After a devastating flood, massive amounts of sediment and debris are carried by water into rivers and waterways, which can settle at the bottom or be deposited in new locations. This process, known as sedimentation, can reshape rivers, alter habitats, and lead to long-term changes in aquatic ecosystems. The sedimentation from floods can cause various problems for aquatic life, including: 1. Changes in river morphology: The deposited sediment can alter the river's course, widening or narrowing it, which affects water flow rates and quality. 2. Habitat disruption: New sediment deposits can create new habitats or destroy existing ones, impacting local biodiversity. 3. Water pollution: Sedimentation can carry pollutants and contaminants into aquatic environments, harming plants and animals that live there. 4. Decreased oxygen levels: The decomposition of organic matter in the sediment can consume oxygen from the water, creating low-oxygen conditions that are difficult for some species to survive. As a result of these changes, aquatic life may struggle to adapt, and reshaped rivers can have lasting impacts on local ecosystems.",5.03E-232,0.043956044,0.022222222,0.043956044,0.83848381
"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way from the Summit: How REE is Using New Strategies to Reach Even Newer Poultry Handlers  During a walk along tree-shading sidewalks in the ¡°burbs¡±; you¡¯re accustomed to seeing games of hopscotch, bike rides, and maybe even the occasional Golden Retriever. However, one residential backyard, nearly 6 miles from downtown Atlanta, calls into question whether this is suburbia at all. There were swings, a tree house, and even patio furniture. Yet one feature certified this was not your mother¡¯s suburban home: over a dozen chickens living comfortably in a custom made ¡°Coop de Ville.¡±    The rise of ¡°backyard poultry¡± is one of many agricultural phenomena tied to a growing food consciousness and increased urbanization. And while USDA¡¯s fundamental job doesn¡¯t change, the Department does because the challenges do.  The recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at increasingly popular backyard chicken coops underscore this. While this concern was not clearly expressed in the Act of Congress that created the Department, the mandate was. USDA still works to ¡°acquire and to diffuse¡­information¡± towards facilitating the protected growth of American agriculture.

Some of these challenges include: 1. **Detection and Monitoring**: With the increasing number of backyard chickens, it becomes more difficult for USDA to detect and monitor HPAI outbreaks quickly. Many backyard chicken owners may not report suspected cases or may be unaware that their birds are infected. 2. **Limited Resources**: The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has limited resources to devote to responding to HPAI cases, particularly in small-scale backyard settings. 3. **Regulatory Framework**: The regulatory framework governing backyard chickens is often unclear or inconsistent across different states and local jurisdictions, making it challenging for USDA to develop a coordinated response to HPAI outbreaks. 4. **Public Education and Awareness**: Many backyard chicken owners may not be aware of the risks associated with HPAI or the importance of biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of the disease. Raising public awareness and educating backyard chicken keepers about best practices is essential but can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive effort. 5. **Biosecurity Measures**: Ensuring that backyard chicken coops have adequate biosecurity measures in place, such as proper sanitation, disinfection, and quarantine procedures, can be challenging, particularly for smaller operations. 6. **Coordination with State and Local Authorities**: USDA must coordinate with state and local authorities to respond effectively to HPAI outbreaks on a case-by-case basis, which can be time-consuming and may lead to delays in responding to emerging cases. 7. **Balancing Public Health and Animal Welfare Concerns**: The USDA must balance the need to protect public health by controlling HPAI outbreaks with the need to ensure animal welfare and the humane treatment of affected birds. By understanding these challenges, USDA can develop targeted strategies to address the risks associated with HPAI in backyard chicken coops and mitigate the impact of these cases on human and animal health.",0.043212197,0.142465753,0.077134986,0.126027397,0.854861856

This sets them apart from traditional businesses, which are typically owned by individuals or corporations. 2. **Democratic decision-making**: Cooperative decisions are made democratically, with all members having an equal say in the direction of the business. 3. **Not-for-profit**: Cooperatives operate on a not-for-profit basis, meaning that any surplus is reinvested to benefit the members rather than being distributed as dividends to shareholders. 4. **Service to members**: Cooperatives are formed to meet the needs and interests of their member-owners, providing essential goods and services that might otherwise be unavailable or unaffordable. 5. **Autonomy and independence**: Cooperatives are independent entities, free from external control and influence. These principles and values, as celebrated during National Co-op Month, distinguish cooperatives as a unique business form that prioritizes the well-being of its members and the community over profit maximization.",1.67E-155,0.089552239,0.020100503,0.069651741,0.83567512
"Associate Administrator for USDA¡¯s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and leader of USDA¡¯s ASF efforts in  Animals  Dec 09,  USDA has a proven track record of protecting U.S. farmers from foreign animal and plant pests and diseases.

"Public Affairs Specialist for USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 13,  For people suffering from addiction, the chances of recovery are oftentimes only as good as the care they receive. And for decades, the Boxwood Recovery Center in Culpeper, Virginia struggled to provide the high-quality care it was capable of, as it operated out of a deteriorating former roadside motel and restaurant. ¡°Why would you walk into a depressing place when you're probably already in a bad place in your life because of your addiction?¡± said Kolapo Olarinde, a Program Manager at Boxwood Recovery Center. With a desire to improve the odds of recovery for people in need, Rappahannock Rapidan Community Services (RRCS), the parent nonprofit which operates Boxwood Recovery Center, asked the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development for help. Rural Development was able to help Boxwood with a $3.2 million loan through its Community Facilities Direct Loan & Grant program which provides affordable funding to develop essential community facilities in rural areas. The loan would allow the recovery center to build a state-of-the-art, 21,000 square-foot facility. Boxwood was finally going to have a center worthy of their cause. ""I don't think you can underestimate how important proper facilities are to keep people safe and in recovery,"" said RRCS Executive Director Jim LaGraffe. Today, the Boxwood Recovery Center continues to help many people on their recovery journeys by offering residential alcohol and drug treatment programs with individual, family, and group counseling, educational films, lectures, and relapse prevention.

"Branch Chief, Cooperative Services at USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 30,  This October USDA is celebrating National Cooperative Month, an observance that recognizes the cooperative model, its many influential uses, and how cooperatives benefit their members in numerous ways. There are at least 30,ates providing more than $700 billion to the economy. This year¡¯s theme is Owning Our Identity, a reference to the principles and values that distinguish cooperatives from other business forms. Cooperatives are created by individuals to tackle issues they are unable to solve individually. Co-ops have additional features that make them an attractive option in today¡¯s environment, including the ability to address social justice, create wealth in local communities, encourage self-determination, and build capacity in a community. But cooperatives do not guarantee business success and like other business models require planning and hard work. (View the top myths about cooperatives to learn more!) Cooperatives are made up of members who collectively own, operate, and run the organization, with each member typically getting one vote on decisions. Members are also the customers and use the cooperative services from agriculture marketing, food distribution, mutual purchasing, home care, childcare, real estate, to workers joining together to continue operating businesses that otherwise would have been closed or taken over by competitors. Cooperatives are resilient as evidenced by the fact that 23 percent of the country¡¯s agricultural cooperatives have been in business 100 years or more, 54 percent have been operating for 75 years or more, and 77 percent have been in existence 50 years or more. To achieve such resilience and own their identity, cooperatives have shown they are ready and able to thrive in their communities through the upheavals and changes in the economy; from a pandemic to competition looking to overtake their sectors, and in members¡¯ mindsets that evolve as new generations evolve how cooperatives are run. In celebration of National Cooperative Month, learn more about the resources available at Rural Development to help communities start, sustain, or convert to a cooperative business model:  Interagency Working Group on Cooperative Development: The Interagency Working Group for Cooperative Development, led by USDA Rural Business-Cooperative Service, met five times in to uncover how cooperatives operate and benefit local people and communities in the housing, food, child care, real estate investment sectors. For National Cooperative Month, the group hosted a panel discussion featuring cooperative leaders, including newly inducted Cooperative Hall of Fame housing co-op advocate Linda Leaks.  Cooperative Services Branch: Cooperative Services provides support and information for people deciding whether and how to form a co-op. Many of these materials are used by economic development professionals, trade associations, extension educators, youth groups, and agriculture and business schools.  Cooperative Success Stories: Learn more about people who have successfully navigated Rural Development programs and services to help their communities with the cooperative business model. Co-ops are community based, resilient through economic downturns, and ready to help people meet market needs. This October cooperatives are owning their cooperative identity and showing how their values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity, and solidarity distinguish them from other businesses.

These strategies include: 1. **Diversification**: Cooperatives diversify their products or services to reduce dependence on a single market or revenue stream, making them less vulnerable to economic fluctuations. 2. **Member engagement**: Cooperatives foster strong relationships with their members through regular communication, outreach programs, and involvement in community activities. This helps build trust, loyalty, and a sense of ownership among members. 3. **Adaptability**: Cooperatives continuously assess market trends, consumer needs, and technological advancements to stay competitive and relevant. They adapt their business models, products, or services accordingly. 4. **Collaboration and partnerships**: Cooperatives form alliances with other businesses, organizations, or government agencies to share resources, expertise, and risks. This can lead to new opportunities, increased efficiency, and improved resilience. 5. **Financial planning and management**: Cooperatives maintain a solid financial foundation through careful budgeting, cost control, and investment in long-term assets. They also prioritize member equity and stability. 6. **Education and training**: Cooperatives invest in employee development, training programs, and professional certifications to enhance the skills of their workforce. This helps them stay competitive and adapt to changing market conditions. 7. **Community involvement**: Cooperatives engage with their local communities through outreach programs, sponsorships, and volunteer efforts.

"in Rural  Apr 19,  It¡¯s a human right to have access to clean water and reliable wastewater systems. USDA Rural Development finances projects to build strong infrastructure to help people in rural America thrive and create economic opportunities. This week, as we celebrate Earth Day, we are proud to highlight some of the many ways USDA programs advance climate-smart infrastructure to help people have a more accessible, affordable and safe water supply. Water Independence Comes to a Rural Community in Missouri For six years, Public Water Supply District No. oddard County purchased water from a nearby community. USDA Rural Development awarded $2.6 million under the Water & Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program to make improvements to the district's drinking water production, storage and distribution system. This project is expected to enable the district to provide community members quality water from its own systems. The project will help the district drill two wells in areas with good water quality. That will help reduce operational costs because the water will require less treatment. The funds will also be used to install meters to reduce water loss and more accurately record the amount of water each customer uses. Wastewater System Upgrades Improve Health and Safety for People in Rural Tennessee The town of Baxter is improving the health and safety of the community¡¯s residents. The town used a loan and grant totaling to $3 million through the Water and Waste Disposal Program Loan and Grant program to upgrade its wastewater treatment to provide safe and clean wastewater services to 1,350 people. The improvements will upgrade a sewer pump station and other infrastructure needs. Safe Drinking Water for Tribal and Underserved Rural Communities in Minnesota USDA Rural Development awarded the Fond du Lac Band of Chippewa Indians a loan and grant totaling to $8 million under the Water and Waste Disposal Program to make improvements to the Mahnomen community water system on the Fond du Lac Reservation in Carlton County. This project will replace two water wells, a water treatment plant and water distribution lines. The funds also will be used to build a water tank. These improvements will ensure that the Tribe¡¯s water system is safe for the 620 residents it serves.

"Acting National Coordinator for USDA Climate Hubs, Office of Energy and Environmental Policy in  Climate  Farming  Forestry  Research and Science  Aug 08,  In June , Secretary Vilsack outlined a vision for agricultural solutions to environmental challenges, which included creating the Regional Climate Hubs. In , the USDA Climate Hubs were established in to serve as regional centers of climate change information and outreach to reduce risks. The Climate Hubs enhance USDA capacity to deliver science-based knowledge and practical information to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests. Early career professionals joined the Hubs to hone their science communication and engagement skills while supporting the Climate Hubs¡¯ mission. In , Climate Hub Fellows focused on co-developing science-based information to help land managers make climate-informed decisions. Likewise, Hubs brought on interns and post-doctoral researchers. Climate Hubs were able to enhance engagements among land managers and scientists to co-develop science and technology. To mark the 10-year anniversary of Secretary Vilsack sharing his vision for the Climate Hubs, we share two highlights. Dr. Julian Reyes was a Climate Hub Fellow with the Southwest Climate Hub. During his fellowship, he developed, AgRisk Viewer, which empowers decision makers to assess their climate risks by commodity type at the county scale using long-term crop insurance from Risk Management Agency. This tool identifies areas of agricultural production risk due to extreme events to help target locations for adaptation actions. Haley Case-Scott was a Resource Assistance Program intern with the Northwest Climate Hub. During Haley¡¯s internship, she engaged with Tribal Nations supporting government-to-government consultation for the 25th update to the Northwest Forest Plan. Haley also developed communication materials to share information about USDA programs that could support climate adaptation and mitigation. Both Reyes and Case-Scott have also worked with the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy (OSTP) to provide clear, useful, and useable science and knowledge to inform the Administration¡¯s climate, environment, and nature actions and initiatives. ¡°Communities and decision makers need actionable and usable climate information and services. My time with the USDA Climate Hubs has shown the power of co-production ensuring community voices are embedded in our place-based, people-centered work. These perspectives have also helped me in my work at OSTP,¡± Reyes said. ¡°Serving as a Resource Assistant Program intern with the USDA Northwest Climate Hub was a great experience. It allowed me to take a deep dive into how the federal government works, and provided me the tools needed to build my professional career,¡± Case-Scott said. The Climate Hubs continue to build capacity to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests.

"NIFA, Writer/Editor in  Research and Science  Apr 20,  Feeding a world population estimated to exceed 9 billion by will require significant increases in agricultural production, yet those increases must be sustainable solutions that protect the world¡¯s natural resources. As USDA¡¯s primary extramural funding agency, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) invests in research, education and Extension efforts to ensure a secure food supply while protecting and enhancing the world¡¯s natural resources. NIFA¡¯s Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) is the nation¡¯s leading competitive grants program for agricultural sciences. AFRI-funded science is vital to meeting food, fiber and fuel demands as the global population expands while safeguarding the world¡¯s land and water resources. NIFA is working to transform American agriculture to increase production in sustainable ways and doing so in the context of diminishing land and water resources and a changing climate. Examples of NIFA-Supported Research Advancing Climate-Smart Ag:  Researchers at Auburn University have identified two genes that appear to coordinate the fitness of plants in defending themselves from drought while also stimulating growth. The genes will likely be good candidates to help generate crops that are truly drought tolerant.  University of California scientists are developing new instruments and analysis techniques that will provide insights into the sources and chemistry of atmospheric aerosols and the role they play in global climate and regional air pollution.  Rutgers University showed that increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide could lead to changes in soil structure. Researchers are helping develop better crop fertilization and irrigation practices that maximize yields while minimizing soil and water contamination from excess nutrients.  A microclimate study conducted by West Virginia State University Extension Service is helping landowners learn more about climate change impact on regional weather, with the goal of minimizing negative impact on seasonal crops and overall farm livelihood.  At North Dakota State University, researchers developed web-based nitrogen calculators for more efficient nitrogen management without decreasing crop yields in crops like wheat, canola, barley and sugar beets. NIFA and the projects it supports are crucial to feeding the world and protecting the Earth for future generations.

"Chief Officer, OCIO Enterprise Management Center (EDMC) in  Technology  Apr 22,  The USDA recently wrapped up a successful hackathon at Colorado State University. This event, which brought together computer science and science students around a real USDA challenge, is a prime example of the many benefits that hackathons can offer. But what exactly is a hackathon, and why are they so beneficial? A hackathon is an intensive event where participants collaborate to create solutions to specific problems. The fast-paced environment of a hackathon encourages creativity, innovation, and teamwork. By bringing together people from different backgrounds and disciplines, hackathons can foster cross-pollination of ideas and lead to the development of solutions that might not have been possible otherwise. From April 4-6, representatives from USDA joined CSU at the downtown Fort Collins, CO campus, bringing together staff from USDA-OCIO, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS), CSU¡¯s Computer Sciences and Animal Sciences programs, and the Ram Hack student organization to conduct the 24-hour hackathon. USDA Deputy Secretary Xochitl Torres Small provided pre-recorded remarks, and the USDA Chief and AI Officer Christopher Alvares kicked off the event. Our event with CSU was developed around a real-world artificial intelligence use case for AMS. AMS is pursuing ways to expand their meat grading service and want to explore the use of image processing and artificial intelligence. Over 60 CSU students across 18 teams were challenged to develop predictive models that could accurately estimate beef grade (e.g. Prime, Choice, Select) and fat thickness using images of beef ribeye's as they would appear to an AMS meat grader. Representatives from USDA provided technical assistance to many of the hackathon¡¯s participants. Six teams were recognized for their accomplishments and will also receive letters of appreciation and an opportunity to meet with AMS on their project. Prior to the start of the hackathon, a career fair was held with representatives from OCIO¡¯s Office of the Chief Officer, Cybersecurity and Privacy Operations Center, Client Experience Center, and Digital Infrastructure Services Center. Representatives discussed core professional skills, resume tips, and internship opportunities at USDA. Students also heard about programs such as the US Digital Corps, GSA¡¯s two-year tech fellowship program and a partner of USDA. We hope to strengthen relationships with CSU and other universities to not only help address real USDA problems, but also inspire students and learners through hackathon events to hone their skills and consider a tech career in USDA and public service.

"Expanding Affordable Healthcare in Rural South Carolina  Having access to quality health care is often a problem for low-income patients who live in rural communities. Fortunately, there are medical facilities such as Sandhills Medical Foundation, Inc in Lugoff, South Carolina that work on a sliding fee scale, which means that all their patients, regardless of income level, can afford quality health care. However, this has also increased their number of patients over time, and it wasn¡¯t long before they recognized that their Lugoff office was running out of space.  Stephanie Bittiker, USDA Rural Development Public Information Officer  Posted in  Equity  Rural  Sep 16,   Respond to this story",How have expanded affordable healthcare options at Sandhills Medical increased patient care demands?,"The expanded affordable healthcare options at Sandhills Medical Foundation, Inc. have led to an increase in their patient volume, resulting in space constraints at their Lugoff office.","I'm not able to provide an answer to that question because I don't have information on the specific policies or services provided by Sandhills Medical. However, if you're looking for a general response, here's some possible reasoning: When expanded affordable healthcare options are made available at a medical facility like Sandhills Medical, it can lead to increased patient care demands in several ways: 1\. More people seek medical attention: When healthcare becomes more affordable, people who previously couldn't afford medical treatment may now come forward for help. This means the number of patients seeking care might rise. 2\. Increased access to preventive services: Affordable healthcare options often allow individuals to engage in regular check-ups, screenings, and preventative treatments earlier on. As a result, doctors may have more patients visiting them for routine health checks or with treatable conditions that require early intervention.",0.020733401,0.182857143,0.046242775,0.148571429,0.856782496
"of Agriculture Xochitl Torres Small in  Equity  Aug 01,  Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has advanced equity by listening to the people we serve and learning how we can serve them better by removing barriers to our programs and services. USDA offices and agencies have developed key actions to comprehensively incorporate equity into the Department¡¯s services, which touch every American¡¯s life. USDA Rural Development¡¯s Equity Action Plan was one of the last projects I worked on as Under Secretary of that mission area. So I know firsthand how hard USDA staff have worked to make change. Now in my new role as Deputy Secretary, I am thrilled to share the release of 14 Equity Action Plans that encompass the work across all of USDA. These plans follow the lead of President Biden¡¯s Executive Order 1, which insists that federal agencies use all the policy levers we have to make progress. Founded on the insight that our country is stronger when everyone participates, and more vulnerable when people are left out, the plans released today are part of our relentless focus to shape USDA to truly be what President Lincoln called us, the People¡¯s Department. While the plans are ambitious, I know they are achievable. The plans share both accomplishments and actions underway. A few examples of the accomplishments include:  Simplified direct farm loan application processes. The Farm Service Agency drastically reduced the burden and time necessary for farmers and ranchers applying for loans. FSA has also rolled out a loan assistance tool that helps farmers and ranchers better navigate the farm loan application process.  Regional Food Business Centers. A dozen Food Business Centers will support a more resilient, diverse, and competitive food system. These Centers¡ªled by partners who include the Mississippi Delta Council for Farmworker Opportunities, the Georgia Minority Outreach Network, and the Intertribal Agriculture Council¡ªwill support producers by providing localized assistance to access local and regional supply chains, including linking producers to wholesalers and distributors.  Rural Partners Network ¨C The Rural Partners Network (RPN) is an alliance of federal agencies and commissions, led by USDA Rural Development, working directly with rural communities to expand rural prosperity through job creation, infrastructure development, and community improvement.  Embracing Tribal Sovereignty. The Forest Service has embraced Tribal self-determination principles, releasing the USDA Forest Service Action Plan: Strengthening Tribal Consultations and Nation-to-Nation Relationships, and furthering co-stewardship agreements.  Microfarms at RMA ¡ª The Risk Management Agency (RMA) issued a Micro Farm policy to provide additional insurance options for small-scale producers. The policy development process included obtaining feedback from small-scale producers that have grown products for their local communities. But of course there¡¯s still plenty of room for improvement. Some of our plans include:  Increasing access to nutrition programs. FNS will support State and local partnerships to increase the reach of nutrition programs in underserved communities and will continue to expand online shopping. And it will move forward on nationwide implementation of the new Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer program, which will provide grocery-buying benefits to low-income families with school-aged children when schools are closed for the summer.

"Six Myths About Cooperatives Debunked  Co-ops are a business structure, and like any business, they require hard work to be successful. They are unique in that they bring individuals together to solve issues they wouldn¡¯t be able to solve on their own. Cooperatives can help communities by creating jobs, meeting social or economic needs, and improving community services. Despite a myriad of benefits, there are many myths that prevent people from recognizing their value.  Darrah Perryman, Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Rural Development  Posted in  Rural  Oct 17,   Respond to this story",What specific ways do cooperatives help communities solve issues they wouldn't be able to tackle on their own?,"Cooperatives create jobs, meet social or economic needs, and improve community services by bringing individuals together to solve these issues.","Cooperatives play a vital role in helping communities address various challenges by providing unique benefits that individual members or governments alone might not be able to achieve. Here are some specific ways cooperatives assist communities in solving issues they couldn't tackle on their own: 1. **Shared Resources and Expertise**: Cooperatives pool resources, skills, and knowledge within a community, enabling them to access expertise and economies of scale that would be unaffordable or inaccessible for individual members. 2. **Decentralized Decision Making**: Cooperative structures often involve decision-making at the grassroots level, allowing communities to set their own goals, make decisions about investments, and ensure projects are tailored to local needs. 3. **Social and Economic Sustainability**: Cooperatives prioritize both economic viability and social responsibility. They can provide essential services like healthcare, education, or credit facilities that would otherwise be lacking in a community, especially in rural areas or regions with limited public resources. 4. **Community Empowerment**: By being owned and controlled by members themselves, cooperatives empower communities to take control of their futures. This can lead to greater social cohesion, community pride, and local economic development. 5. **Adaptability and Resilience**: Cooperatives are inherently more adaptable than centralized systems or private corporations because they are driven by the needs and inputs of their community members. This adaptability is crucial for responding to changing environmental conditions, economic shifts, or unexpected challenges that might arise within a community. 6. **Environmental Conservation**: In many cases, cooperatives focus on sustainable practices, renewable energy sources, or conservation efforts that help protect local ecosystems and natural resources. 7. **Job Creation and Local Economic Development**: Cooperatives can create jobs directly through their operations or indirectly by stimulating local economies through services and activities they facilitate. 8. **Community-Led Initiatives**: By allowing communities to propose and manage projects themselves, cooperatives enable community-led initiatives that are more likely to meet specific needs of the area rather than generic plans imposed from outside. 9. **Reducing Dependence on External Aid**: Cooperatives can help communities become less reliant on external financial or technical aid, promoting self-sufficiency and a sense of independence. 10. **Community Education and Training**: Many cooperatives incorporate education and training programs to enhance the skills and knowledge of their members, contributing to personal and collective development within the community. In summary, cooperatives offer unique solutions for communities by combining shared resources with local decision-making, fostering social and economic sustainability, empowering community participation, adapting to changing needs, conserving environments, creating jobs, leading initiatives based on local wisdom, reducing dependence on external aid, and promoting education and training. These elements combine to make cooperatives powerful tools for addressing the challenges that communities might otherwise be unable to tackle alone.",7.54E-232,0.072649573,0.008583691,0.047008547,0.827527642
"Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19?  Last year, as COVID-19 rattled the world economy and disrupted trade flows, agricultural trade remained mostly stable, falling only two percent during the initial wave of infections and lockdowns, before bouncing back and ending the year up 3.5 percent. But the growth in agricultural trade doesn¡¯t mean that trade flows were insulated from the effects of the pandemic. Much of was in fact shaped by other factors. For instance, 95% of global agricultural trade growth came from China and was driven in part by non-pandemic related factors of increased feed demand, efforts to restock grain reserves, and policy factors. A recent paper by USDA¡¯s Office of the Chief Economist, Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19? Findings from an Econometric Assessment (, 1.4 ) (Arita et al.), suggests that while agricultural trade remained stable at the aggregate level, a deeper empirical analysis reveals there were still significant disruptions due to the pandemic.

"USDA Foreign Agricultural Service in  Climate  Farming  Technology  Trade  Aug 09,  Accurate crop mapping is a crucial process to informing reliable crop production estimates, addressing climate change, and developing strategies for sustainable agriculture. U.S. Department of Agriculture¡¯s Foreign Agricultural Service is working with university students in Tanzania on a pilot project to gather grassroots to strengthen community agricultural systems and improve crop condition assessments with satellite imagery. Their field work is adding truth from the ground up to the sky. In April, 14 YouthMappers spent four days in the Arusha area capturing on 334 fields by photographing, georeferencing, and identifying target crops to enhance FAS satellite imagery analysis. YouthMappers is an international network of university-based chapters that organize and implement mapping activities in response to global and local development needs. ¡°The YouthMappers¡¯ chapters are products under USAID, which empower youth to help their community,¡± said Gideon G. Sway, one of the Tanzania YouthMappers. The FAS-YouthMappers team¡¯s main objective was to create an agricultural library of ground-truth from the Arusha, Dodoma, and Mwanza regions. This activity is the first time YouthMappers has used its members¡¯ skills to strengthen agricultural . While Tanzania grows several kinds of crops, making this a viable machine learning project the team to focus on locating target crops of FAS¡¯ International Production Assessment Division (IPAD). Oftentimes, crops are grown together in larger fields and can be detectable by freely available satellite imagery. In addition to geo-locating these crops, the team¡¯s field work revealed variability in crop heights and exposed pest damage¡ªespecially from the fall army worm. This future-facing project improves understanding of crop conditions and the impact of seasonal rains. Since the project began, the Tanzanian YouthMappers network has collected from 1,700 fields in the Arusha, Dodoma, and Mwanza regions. Thanks to YouthMappers, FAS can now pair satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 with the field . In May, these YouthMappers, trained additional university students on geo-mapping with ArcGIS, OpenStreetMap, and Kobo Collect to help advance Tanzanian agriculture and achieve project goals for the Dodoma and Mwanza regions.

"Information Technology (IT) plays a critical role in the Department of Agriculture¡¯s (USDA) ability to carry out its mission to ¡°¡­provide leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, nutrition, and related issues based on sound public policy, the best available science, and efficient management.¡± Each year the complexity of the IT environment grows, and making sound IT investment decisions requires greater amounts of information. For example, the Department improves the Nation¡¯s economy and quality of life by touching the lives of almost every person in America, every day. Nearly 100,000 employees deliver more than $144 billion in public services through the Department¡¯s more than 300 programs worldwide, providing leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, nutrition, and related issues based on sound public policy, the best available science, and efficient management. USDA needs to respond effectively to the challenges posed by the diversity, complexity, and volume of IT investment proposals brought forward by various stakeholders throughout the Department. This new integrated IT governance framework supports government priorities and program delivery. USDA¡¯s Integrated Information Technology Governance Framework (IITGF) is a holistic set of processes, procedures, and that assist the Office of the Chief Information Officer¡¯s (OCIO¡¯s) customers improve mission delivery. It does this by providing structure around the budget formulation, budget execution, enterprise architecture, capital planning, IT security, Section 508, Records Management, and portfolio/project management processes. Implementing the IITGF satisfies the following goals:  Provides a coherent and effective project management methodology to guide IT project management at USDA. The methodology is intended to consistently deliver IT capabilities that provide maximum support to USDA business needs within approved cost and schedule constraints.  Better integrates IT project planning and execution with IT Governance, including more effective multi-disciplinary reviews of IT projects by the stakeholders and IT executive governance bodies. The IITGF includes touch points with other USDA¡¯s governance, management, and control activities and processes, such as: Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC), Agriculture¡¯s System Development Life Cycle (AgSDLC) approach, Project Management (PM), Enterprise Architecture (EA), Risk Management Framework (RMF), and IT Security. Implementing an Integrated IT Governance Framework further supports the USDA mission by providing the alignment for decisions with needed technology components, services, and applications. An important objective of the IITGF Life Cycle is to provide flexibility that allows for tailoring of artifacts, decision gate reviews, and governance board reviews to suit the characteristics of a particular solution development effort. If tailoring is approved in advance by the governance board, these alternative development approaches empower project managers to tailor tasks in order to meet the specific needs of the project while maintaining compliance with the AgSDLC and IITGF governance processes. Some of the most popular, time and cost effective alternative development models are: Rapid Application Development (RAD), Pilot Development, Iterative, Agile, Government off the Shelf (GOTS)/Commercial off the Shelf (COTS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

One innovative approach being explored by the USDA is the production of butanol from sugarcane. Butanol is a high-energy-density liquid fuel that can be used as a direct replacement for gasoline in existing engines. The production process involves converting sugarcane into a bio-oil through a series of chemical reactions, followed by fermentation to produce butanol. The use of sugarcane as a feedstock for advanced biofuels offers several advantages over traditional fossil fuels. Sugarcane is a renewable and sustainable resource that can be grown in tropical regions with minimal environmental impact. Additionally, the production process generates biogas as a byproduct, which can be used to power the factory or sold as an energy source.

"Communications Director, USDA Rural Development, Tennessee in  Energy  Rural  Feb 01,   USDA Business and Cooperative Programs Administrator Judith Canales convened a roundtable of renewable energy experts from the southeast in Nashville on January 26, to discuss development and marketing of bioenergy technologies and advanced biofuels. Despite an unexpected snow the night before, participants traveled in from Memphis and Knoxville as well as Middle Tennessee. FSA and Rural Development State Directors Gene Davidson and Bobby Goode hosted the Administrator and Ed Harlan of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Louis Buck of Tennessee Biomass Supply Cooperative, Pete Nelson of Memphis Bioworks, Atha Comiskey and Bart Comiskey of Clean Cities of Middle Tennessee, Paul Melgaard of Eco Energy, Terry Ruse of Clean Fuels Development Coalition, Warren Nevad of the Tennessee Renewable Energy Economic Council, Dan Stasser of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Stan Boyd and David Owenby of the Tennessee Department of Transportation and Rural Development Tennessee Energy Programs Coordinator Will Dodson. Canales opened the forum with the idea that, ""By making renewable energy sources commercially viable based on feed stock available in each region of the country, we create sustainable opportunities for job creation and economic development, and keep more energy dollars in the community."" The spirited discussion covered a range of challenges on the horizon for the emerging bioenergy industry from traditional fuel providers to misperceptions about the tradeoff between food and fuel crops. Canales emphasized that changes are coming to the USDA energy programs that will allow applications to be submitted year round and to encourage geographic and technological diversity. Canales and others brought up the regional nature of biofuel production. Regionally significant feed stocks mentioned included cellulosic switch grass, wood pulp and sucrose-rich crops. With the commercial availability of existing flex fuels growing rapidly, participants called for a fresh examination of regulations intended to encourage their use. ""Greater use helps drive down production costs and will encourage more stations to carry fuels like E20, E30 and E85 as they come online,"" said Goode. ""We can help drive the change to cleaner fuels by doing more to take advantage of flex fuels in fleet vehicles and by educating consumers on the benefits of using more renewable American-made energy resources."" Coop Manager Louis Buck said that with the advances being made in bioenergy production today he looks forward to a time when farmers send power down wires to the city and get a check delivered back in the mail. Electronic mail, presumably. During the roundtable, Canales also announced the award of a $25,000 Rural Energy for America (REAP) grant to the Tennessee Biomass Supply Cooperative.

"Missouri State Director and George Thomas, Public Information Coordinator in  Energy  Rural  Apr 14,   To ¡°flex¡± or not, that is a good question.  I own a flexible fuel vehicle and have for several years and as a Government Agency, Rural Development has government owned vehicles that accommodate flexible fuel.  As State Director, I travel throughout Missouri and even though I have the appropriate vehicle and even though there is an adequate supply of renewable fuels, there is an inadequate number of service stations that have flexible fuel pumps.  Compound this with the desire to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and make our nation more environmentally clean, you can imagine my reaction when Rural Development announced a program as part of the solution to address these issues. There was excitement in Jefferson City, Missouri¡¯s State Capitol, when Judith Canales, Administrator for USDA Rural Development Rural Business-Cooperative Programs kicked off  Rural Development¡¯s  Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) workshop on flex-fuel options.  Canales informed the 45 people in attendance that grants are available to provide fuel station owners with incentives to install flexible fuel pumps that will offer Americans more renewable energy options. Pictured left to right: John Eggleston, Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives; Bradley Schad, Missouri Corn Growers Association; Judith Canales, USDA Rural Business-Cooperative Service Administrator; Matt Amick, Missouri Corn Growers Association; Gary Wheeler, Missouri Corn Growers Association; and Janie Dunning, USDA Rural Development Missouri State Director The event was hosted by the Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives and their Secretary/Treasurer, John Eggleston, (also a 30-year pioneer of the ethanol industry in Missouri).  He  emphasized the importance of ethanol as a renewable energy source in reducing America¡¯s dependency on foreign oil. Matt Moore, Director Business Programs for Missouri Rural Development (RD), illustrated that the REAP incentives offer options for financing the conversion of fuel stations pumps or installation of new flex fuel pumps resulting in a choice for Missourians when purchasing fuel in the future. The REAP incentives can be coupled with $5,000 incentives offered from both Growth Energy and the Missouri Corn Growers Association according to Bradley Schad, Director of Ethanol Blends with the Missouri Corn Growers Association. Other stakeholders in attendance that provided comments in support of the renewable energy programs included: Loyd Wilson, Division Director for Missouri Department of Agriculture; J.P. Dunn, Missouri Soybean Association;   Tom May,  Marketing Director for MFA Oil Company;  retailers, flex fuel pump distributors and others. As a highlight, the Missouri Corn Growers brought to the meeting a flex fuel pump for all the attendees and media to see. During the Question and Answer session of the meeting, it was pointed out that a small convenience store chain was exploring the possibility of putting new fuel dispensers in at several of their locations.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Conservation  Feb 24,  Red-backed salamanders and other amphibians are key players in ecosystem health. (iStock photo) Forested areas that border wetlands help protect wildlife, but until recently their efficacy has been untested for most amphibian species.  Now, recently published results of a six-year study explore how the loss or reduction of amphibians could affect the ecosystem. At the University of New Hampshire, Dr. Kimberly Babbitt and a team of graduate students conducted landscape-scale experiments that tested the impacts of forest buffer width vernal pools on population size and structure, body size and condition and population genetics of two amphibian species in the northeastern United States. A grant from USDA¡¯s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supported the project. The investigation examined the response of spotted salamanders and wood frogs in three environments: wetlands surrounded by either intact forest, a 30-meter forest buffer surrounded by a 100-meter clearcut, and a 100-meter forest buffer surrounded by a 100-meter clearcut. The study indicates that areas with smaller buffers had negative impact on size and condition of salamanders and frogs. Analysis of genetic relatedness indicated that, despite logging, populations across the broader landscape are well-connected. Babbitt and doctoral student Danial Hocking also examined the role of amphibians in forest floor ecosystem function and conducted a review of amphibian contribution to ecosystem services. ¡°We found that amphibians contribute in a variety of ways to human societies,¡± Babbitt said.  ¡°We are examining the roles in different forest types to understand under what context salamanders can influence ecosystem functions, such as decomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant growth.¡± Some of the beneficial effects of amphibians on the ecosystem are known, such as the ability of tadpoles reduce eutrophication (greening) by consuming excess algae.  In many ecosystems means that amphibians have important roles both as food sources and as predators ¨C amphibians feed heavily on mosquitoes, making them an important line of defense against mosquito-borne diseases, including the West Nile virus.  Babbitt noted many that amphibians have a lot more to offer ¨C if we can ensure their survival. ¡°Although yet to result in approved pharmaceuticals, amphibian skin secretions have shown the ability to inhibit HIV transmission and provide stronger analgesic effects than opioids,¡± she said. ¡°Learning from these chemical secretions could lead to breakthroughs in human medicine. However, amphibians are declining across the globe and species are going extinct. It¡¯s important to protect species before potential advances are lost.¡± NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.  Greater understanding of how forest buffers can protect the amphibians that serve the ecosystem is important knowledge that will help states, communities, and landowners make more informed decisions about land use and management, Babbitt said.

The loss or reduction of amphibians, however, can have significant consequences for ecosystem health, including reduced decomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant growth.","**Role of Forest Buffers in Protecting Amphibians** Forest buffers, also known as riparian zones or buffer strips, play a crucial role in protecting amphibian populations, such as salamanders and frogs. These areas, typically 10-50 meters wide along waterways, serve as habitat corridors for terrestrial and semi-aquatic species. Forest buffers: 1. **Provide shelter**: Trees and shrubs offer hiding spots and protection from predators, harsh weather conditions, and human activities. 2. **Maintain water quality**: Vegetation helps to filter out sediments, nutrients, and pollutants from runoff, keeping waterways clean and suitable for amphibian life stages (e.g., breeding, larval development). 3. **Regulate temperature and humidity**: Trees create a microclimate that maintains optimal temperatures and humidity levels for amphibians, which are sensitive to extreme conditions. 4. **Support food webs**: Forest buffers support complex food webs, with plants serving as primary producers, supporting herbivores, carnivores, and decomposers, which in turn sustain larger predator-prey relationships. **Implications of Amphibian Loss or Reduction** The loss or reduction of amphibian populations has significant implications for ecosystem health: 1. **Ecosystem disruption**: Amphibians play key roles in food webs, serving as both predators and prey. Their decline can disrupt entire ecosystems, leading to cascading effects on population dynamics and community structure. 2. **Indicators of broader environmental issues**: Amphibians are sensitive to environmental changes, making them useful indicators of ecosystem health. Changes in amphibian populations can signal broader problems, such as habitat degradation, climate change, or pollution. 3. **Loss of ecological resilience**: Amphibians contribute to ecosystem resilience by regulating pest populations and serving as a food source for other animals. Their decline can compromise the ability of ecosystems to withstand disturbances and recover from stressors. 4. **Biological diversity reduction**: The loss of amphibian species contributes to broader biodiversity declines, compromising ecosystem functioning and human well-being. **Conservation Implications** To protect amphibians and maintain ecosystem health: 1. **Preserve and restore forest buffers**: Protecting or restoring these areas can help maintain habitat quality and connectivity for terrestrial and semi-aquatic species. 2. **Monitor and manage human impacts**: Implement measures to reduce pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change effects on amphibian populations. 3. **Conduct research and monitoring**: Continuously study amphibian ecology and population dynamics to better understand the relationships between these animals and their environments. 4. **Develop effective conservation strategies**: Create targeted conservation plans that address specific threats and promote long-term ecosystem health. By understanding the role of forest buffers in protecting amphibians and the implications of their loss or reduction, we can take proactive steps to conserve these species and maintain ecosystem resilience.",0.013906547,0.124731183,0.043196544,0.08172043,0.837228954

"USDA Public Information Coordinator, Virginia in  Rural  Aug 10,  USDA officials and residents of Carroll County gather in front of emergency equipment and transportation equipment purchased with USDA support. Under bright, sunny skies last Friday, hundreds of residents of Carroll County, Virginia turned out to acknowledge the support provided by USDA Rural Development. Working in conjunction with State and local governments, non-profit entities and the business community, USDA has infused well over $80 million into the area in recent years, and half of that was to improve water quality. Carroll County is located in the Southwest portion of the state, and the county seat, Hillsville, is surrounded by the Blue Ridge Mountains. USDA officials on hand for the celebration included Rural Development Deputy Under Secretary Cheryl Cook and Virginia State Director Ellen Davis. Both toured facilities that Rural Development helped finance, including a retraining center, court house and a public exercise facility.  In late morning, the USDA officials were the guests of honor at a luncheon at the regional farmers market that was attended by an estimated 500 guests.  Speaking to the audience, Congressman Rick Boucher praised Cook and Davis, along with Rural Development staff and acknowledged the efforts of Travis Jackson, a longtime USDA employee and regional Rural Development representative. The Congressman called Jackson ¡°A premier public servant¡­enormously effective,¡± and praised Jackson for his work with local residents to complete funding application processes.  Congressman Boucher also thanked the County Supervisors who ¡°Have a vision of what rural America can be.¡± During the luncheon, Board Chairman Wesley Hurst joined his colleagues and representatives of the school board in presenting Ms. Cook and Ms. Davis with plaques making them ¡°Honorary County Residents.¡± Afterward, the guests lined up for a photo in front of emergency response and public transportation equipment funded through Rural Development¡¯s Community Facilities Program.

"USDA Rural Development Public Information Office in  Rural  Sep 09,   ¡°Small towns and rural communities need assistance from USDA Rural Development, now more than ever.¡± That was the consensus of attendees participating in a breakout session at the National Association of Towns and Townships (NATaT) annual meeting in Washington in early September. During and after the session Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development Cheryl Cook heard accounts of how local Rural Development staff have made a difference in the economic health of rural communities in states including Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Many described the positive impact of investments made through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act over the last two years, but expressed concern for the future. Water systems, broadband access, and fire and rescue capabilities were frequently cited as critical foundational investments every community needs. But many said finding private partners willing to lend on affordable terms is a challenge for smaller communities that have a limited tax base. A number of elected officials said that increasing the availability of private capital for existing and start-up businesses, improving educational and healthcare opportunities, and helping develop renewable energy options were all key to strengthening local economies through diversification. Many also praised the local knowledge and accessibility of RD¡¯s network of staff members who regularly visit nearly every county in the nation. ¡°Most of us have full time day-jobs and serve our communities as best we can,¡± explained one local leader from northeast Pennsylvania. ¡°Without the technical assistance from our regional Rural Development Office I doubt we could get through the application process successfully.

"Rural Development State Director, New Jersey in  Initiatives  Rural  Oct 29,   After struggling for several years with a stagnant economy, the future is looking brighter for Paulsboro, New Jersey.  Earlier this week, USDA Rural Development Deputy Under Secretary Cheryl Cook, Assistant Administrator for the Water and Environmental Program Jacki Ponti, and I attended an event to celebrate a Recovery Act-funded water project that will help to stimulate job creation while also upgrading Paulsboro¡¯s water system. The diverse borough of Paulsboro houses just over 6,000 residents and faces many of the same challenges of rural towns across the country.  In recent years, the decreasing demand for fuel spurred a number of oil refinery layoffs, displacing hundreds of Paulsboro workers and contributing to a steady rate of out-migration. In addition to the poor economic conditions in Paulsboro, the continuous repair of the public water system, much of which was built in the ¡¯s, was becoming unfeasible, so the Borough worked with RD¡¯s Water and Waste Disposal program to obtain financing for the water system improvements. ¡°We¡¯ve done over $20 billion in investments under the Recovery Act, with over $134 million of that right here in New Jersey,¡± said Deputy Under Secretary Cook.  ¡°This is an investment that will yield dividends many years into the future for the residents of Paulsboro.¡± A Recovery Act loan-grant combination of $4.3 million will allow for the construction of two new water supply wells and a new water treatment plant.  These upgrades will remove aluminum, iron, manganese, benzene, and radium contaminants from the raw water, so Paulsboro residents will enjoy clean drinking water. In addition, these water system upgrades will facilitate greater economic development along the Port of Paulsboro.  New Jersey¡¯s Governor recently traveled to the Port of Paulsboro to announce an off-shore wind energy generation initiative, which involves the employment of Paulsboro residents in receiving and assembling wind turbines at the Port.  This renewable energy initiative has the potential to create thousands of permanent jobs in the area. This is an exciting time for the borough of Paulsboro, and I am thrilled Rural Development, through Recovery Act funding, can contribute to this great project.  The jobs to be created in the construction of the new water system will serve to invigorate the Paulsboro economy now, but the upgraded system will allow for continued economic growth into the future.

"Vermont/New Hampshire USDA Rural Development state director in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Dec 12,  USDA Rural Development¡¯s Business and Loan Guarantee Program supported new construction for an expanded Brattleboro Food Coop in Brattleboro, Vermont. The original plan for two stories was expanded to four thanks to an innovative partnership with the Windsor Housing Trust to develop mixed-income apartments. ¡°Smart Growth¡± is a term we hear more and more often.  It is the idea that as communities plan for the future, they consider the highest and best use of every resource ¨C land, infrastructure, organizations and people.    From housing to transportation to energy to food; community developers and planners are asking how Smart Growth principles can be applied to ensure a sustainable and dynamic future for their communities and their residents. How is USDA involved in these efforts? Consider Brattleboro, Vermont.  With a population of 12,000, Brattleboro sits on the state¡¯s southeastern border, and is a vibrant mix of industry, art and education.    Brattleboro¡¯s downtown district was one of the first communities to take advantage of Vermont¡¯s Downtown Program giving it access to state tax credits and shining a spotlight on its rich history. Its vibrant downtown is an inviting mix of shops, restaurants, offices and an art deco theatre and hotel.    Anchoring one end of the downtown is the Brattleboro Food Coop. Founded in , the Brattleboro Food Coop started as a local buying club.  It eventually grew into a popular retail destination featuring a wide range of products from nearby farms in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.  By , the Brattleboro Coop was outgrowing its space.  It considered moving to a new location outside of downtown.  The Board of the Coop, however, decided that its mission was much more compatible with a Smart Growth solution to its expansion needs.    In the meantime, the Windham and Windsor Housing Trust (WWHT) and Housing Vermont, were looking for a solution to Brattleboro¡¯s need for more mixed income housing that was easily accessible to downtown¡¯s services and amenities. With support from a loan guarantee from USDA¡¯s Business & Industry Loan Guarantee Program, the Brattleboro Coop remained downtown in a new, highly energy efficient building with expanded retail space.  The new Coop space was originally envisioned as a two story building.   Through innovative partnerships, an additional two stories on the new building were sold to WWHT and Housing Vermont.   Though the Coop and the housing complex have separate ownership, they have similar commitment to the sustainable future of Brattleboro. The Brattleboro Coop is featured in the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass for its dedication to local food and local communities. It recently received a National Award for Smart Growth Achievement as awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its commitment to Smart Growth principles.  The results are stunning.  The new Brattleboro Coop Building opened in June, . It now boasts over 14,000 square feet of retail space, supporting up to 100 jobs.  Over 60 percent of the products come from nearby farms.  The building also hosts a commissary kitchen and classrooms for cooking classes.   24 beautiful, energy efficient, mixed income apartments in the heart of downtown Brattleboro occupy two stories above the Coop. Recently, the Brattleboro Coop won a National Award for Smart Growth Achievement as awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These awards, which began in , recognize exceptional approaches to development that respect the environment, foster economic vitality, enhance quality of life, and provide new opportunities for disadvantaged communities. ¡°The new Cooperative Building incorporates money-saving and innovative environmental features while fitting with the character of a traditional walkable New England town¡± noted the EPA. ¡°Community members were the true champions of this project, insisting on a downtown location for their co-op that integrates both the grocery store and mixed-income housing¡±.

The production of peanuts involves factors like soil quality, climate, irrigation, and pest control, which are all part of broader discussions around sustainable agriculture. 2. **Nutritional Value**: Peanuts themselves are rich in nutrients and have been studied for their potential health benefits. Research into the nutritional value of peanuts could intersect with urban nutrition research by exploring how best to incorporate these nutrients into diets at various levels, from personal consumption to policy recommendations for public health initiatives. 3. **Food System Accessibility**: The ""No Small Peanuts"" event in New York City might focus on issues surrounding food accessibility and equity. This could involve discussions about the challenges faced by urban communities in accessing nutritious foods, including peanuts as a potential source of protein and nutrients. 4. **Culinary Innovation and Cultural Exchange**: Events like ""No Small Peanuts"" could also celebrate culinary innovation and cultural exchange related to peanuts. For instance, they might showcase different recipes from around the world that feature peanuts as a key ingredient, highlighting their versatility in various cuisines. 5. **Education and Awareness**: Such events might serve educational purposes, raising awareness about the production process of peanuts, their nutritional benefits, and the challenges faced by farmers, particularly those involved in sustainable or organic practices. 6. **Policy Advocacy**: These gatherings could also serve as platforms for advocating policy changes that support local food systems, access to nutritious foods, and sustainability initiatives within agriculture. Given the lack of specific information about ""No Small Peanuts,"" these points represent potential areas where peanut farming might intersect with urban nutrition research.",1.76E-155,0.082644628,0.011080332,0.071625344,0.828516781
"Transitioning to Organic Certification  More and more farmers are entering the organic market.

"Conservation Innovation Grant Produces Carbon Farming Opportunities in North Dakota  The Prairie Pothole Region of North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana provides sanctuary to millions of nesting waterfowl each summer. With an innovative partnership led by Ducks Unlimited (DU), USDA is helping to provide new opportunities for agricultural producers in the region to sequester carbon while cultivating new revenue streams. With the help of a grant from USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service, these partners have created a carbon credit system for private landowners in North Dakota who agree to avoid tillage of grasslands. Grasslands store carbon dioxide, one of the leading greenhouse gases contributing to climate change. The North Dakota Prairie Pothole project, funded by a USDA Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) of $161,000, provides potential new revenue streams for landowners while avoiding greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon sequestration.

"Know Where Your Food Comes From with USDA Foods  Do you know where your food comes from?  If you can pinpoint where your food was grown and produced, you can make more informed decisions to maximize quality, freshness, and nutritional value.  You can also help support local economies through your purchases.  The USDA Foods program takes this mantra to heart and publishes state of origin with procurement information on all USDA Foods every year.  As we like to say at FNS, ¡°All USDA Foods are local to someone.¡± USDA Foods are 100 percent American grown and produced.  Each year, USDA procures more than 200 types of food, including meat, poultry, fish, fruits, vegetables, flour, cereals, and dairy products, totaling approximately $2 billion.  Organizations such as food banks, disaster and emergency feeding organizations, Indian Tribal Organizations, schools, and other feeding groups receive these USDA Foods for use in meal service or distribution to households through programs like the National School Lunch Program, The Emergency Food Assistance Program, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations.

"Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Jul 13,  Lori Cook, aka TV-personality ¡°Maranda,¡± interviewed me about the importance of the Summer Food Service Program.  Hunger doesn¡¯t take a summer vacation, and the State of Michigan is making sure that nutrition assistance programs don¡¯t either. I recently traveled to the west side of the state to see some of the inspiring work our partners are doing to make sure that no one in their community has to face hunger. I first visited Fulton Street Farmers Market in Grand Rapids, where State and community partners are implementing new initiatives to improve the health of low-income Americans, such as fruit and vegetable incentive programs and nutrition education. A Michigan Department of Community Health employee even demonstrated a new pilot program that uses iPods and iPhones to accept SNAP and WIC benefits¡ªvery impressive! This means low-income individuals can more easily access fresh fruits and vegetables at farmers markets, and local farmers can increase their consumer base. I also got a chance to share exciting news about USDA¡¯s new wireless technology grants for farmers markets that currently do not accept EBT. These grants increase access to fresh, healthy food while supporting family farmers and the local economy. Afterwards I headed to Kalamazoo, where community partner Loaves & Fishes hosted an energizing roundtable. Faith-based and community organizations from around the state joined me in a thoughtful discussion of the successes and challenges in operating the 15 USDA Food and Nutrition Service programs. I always learn something new by listening to those who work directly with the people who use our programs. The Grand Rapids school district feeds so many children that it needs semi-trucks to transport all of its meals! This year, I was happy to see they designed the outside of the trucks to show just how important school and summer meals are to so many children.  Later that afternoon, the Grand Rapids Press held an editorial board/community forum. This unique set-up gave me an opportunity to live Web chat with MLive readers about USDA nutrition assistance programs. We talked about everything from Summer EBT programs that allow families to feed children during the summer to the healthy changes USDA is making to school meals. The next day the Feeding America West Michigan Food Bank gave me a tour of their facilities. This food bank pioneered the concept of mobile food pantries. By modifying a beverage truck, the food bank was able to take fresh produce out into the community. Ken Estelle told me the food bank receives about 15% of its food from USDA Foods. Finally, I was fortunate enough to attend a kickoff of West Michigan¡¯s Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). During the school year, more than 21 million children receive free and reduced-price lunch through the National School Lunch Program. And yet, when school lets out, only 3 million children receive a meal through a summer program. USDA¡¯s SFSP is designed to address that gap, and WOOD-TV personality ¡°Maranda¡± makes sure that happens every summer in western Michigan. Thousands of children came out to enjoy lunch and lots of physical activities. I¡¯m a big supporter of the First Lady¡¯s Let¡¯s Move! initiative and it was great to see so many children playing outside and being active. What a fun event and a great way to end my visit to a state that is working so hard to improve the health and lives of its people!

However, I can provide some general context and possible initiatives that might be relevant: 1. **Double Up Food Bucks**: This is a program where customers can double the value of their SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) or WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) benefits at participating farmers' markets in certain states, including Michigan. The goal is to increase access to fresh produce for low-income households. 2. **USDA's Specialty Crop Block Grant**: This grant supports initiatives that help promote the availability of specialty crops, which include fruits and vegetables. It could potentially support programs or partnerships at farmers' markets aimed at increasing consumption of these nutritious foods among low-income individuals. 3. **The USDA's Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) Program**: FINI aims to increase the purchase of fruits and vegetables by low-income households participating in SNAP. It funds projects that provide incentives, such as cash or other forms of assistance, for purchasing produce through these programs. While it might not specifically target farmers' markets, initiatives under this program could include support for farmers' market-based projects. If you're looking for a more specific technology initiative (as implied by the question), without more details on what technology aspect is being implemented, it's challenging to pinpoint exactly which initiative is being referred to. The USDA and other organizations like the Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development have various programs aimed at increasing access to fresh produce for underserved populations, and technologies could be integrated into these efforts in innovative ways such as digital platforms for SNAP redemption, farm-to-table delivery services, etc. Therefore, while providing a specific answer is not possible with the given information, it's clear that initiatives exist within USDA's purview (and potentially others) aimed at increasing access to fresh produce for low-income households. These might include technology-based solutions or existing programs aimed at supporting such goals.",4.91E-79,0.151832461,0.057894737,0.094240838,0.848906398
"Natural Resource Specialist, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 17,  Wildlife cameras capture a young black bear enjoying new growth from a prescribed burn on the Pisgah National Forest. Photo credit: Lisa Jennings It was my first prescribed burn. After weeks of training and months of anticipation, I was finally on the ground ¨C drip torch in hand ¨C ready to apply fire to restore the mixed pine-hardwood forests at the edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains on the Pisgah National Forest. Joining the U.S Forest Service only two months earlier, my knowledge of fire¡¯s effect on plant and wildlife communities was limited. But as the coordinator for the Grandfather Restoration Project, part of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration program, I had to quickly come up to speed with the on-the-ground reality of prescribed fire use. As I lit my drip torch that early March morning, igniting the thick leaf litter and dense shrubs that had accumulated during years of fire suppression, I couldn¡¯t help but wonder ¨C What happens to the wildlife after the fire? Utilizing fire is unnerving to those not familiar with fire as a restoration tool. The reality is much different; just as certain plants need fire to succeed, the animals that depend on those species benefit from fire as well. With the evolving use of prescribed fire as a restoration tool, it is critical to study the effects of fire on the communities we seek to restore. Traditional fire studies often focus on vegetation. The participants in the Grandfather Restoration Project decided to take it one step further and directly study wildlife use in sites treated with prescribed fire compared with untreated sites. Working collaboratively, wildlife specialists from Pisgah National Forest, the North Carolina Wildlife Resource Commission, and The Nature Conservancy designed a cutting-edge study using wildlife cameras. Re-entering the prescribed burn unit just four months after the fire, wildlife cameras in tow, I could see the changes in vegetation. Arising from the blackened ground a lush herbaceous layer had appeared, carpeting the forest with blueberries and grasses. Using 50 camera points over a six-week period in July and August, we studied the wildlife species that use our forests, and what habitats they prefer. Almost immediately, our cameras captured images of white-tailed deer, black bear, turkey and other wildlife attracted to the abundant grasses and forbs. Not only was I encouraged from the positive wildlife response to our burn, but our indicated a higher usage of the burned unit by wildlife when compared to the unburned unit; valuable information for land managers in determining population estimates and predator-prey ratios. I often think back to that first prescribed burn. I now understand what wildlife have known all along; that not only are wildlife capable of surviving fire, they reap the rewards of new growth, cover, and food stemming from fire and prescribed burning. For me, seeing these benefits firsthand is one of the most rewarding parts of my job with the U.S. Forest Service. Wild turkeys often nest in recently burned areas, taking full advantage of newly established sources of food and cover.

However, I can provide general information on the benefits of prescribed fire in forest management. The primary benefit of prescribed fire in forest management is to maintain a healthy and diverse ecosystem. Prescribed fires are carefully planned and controlled burns that occur at regular intervals, typically every 5-20 years, depending on factors like climate, terrain, and vegetation type. These fires serve several purposes: 1. **Vegetation management**: They help control the spread of invasive species, reduce fuel loads (dead leaves, twigs, branches, etc.), and promote the growth of native vegetation. 2. **Wildfire risk reduction**: By removing dead fuels and promoting a more open forest structure, prescribed fires decrease the likelihood and intensity of wildfires. 3. **Habitat creation and maintenance**: Prescribed fires create and maintain habitats for various wildlife species, such as insects, birds, and mammals that rely on specific vegetation structures or fire cycles. 4. **Soil health improvement**: The heat from controlled burns can break down organic matter in the soil, releasing nutrients and improving fertility. While these benefits are well-documented in forestry management research, I couldn't find any specific information about the Grandfather Restoration Project's findings on prescribed fire.

"Volunteer/Intern, U.S. Forest Service National Forests in North Carolina in  Forestry  Aug 14,   Angeliz Vangas and Hanniah Rodriguez made a big impact serving as interns on the National Forests in North Carolina and are now heading back to school and continuing on their road to success. As part of the Student Career Experience Program (SCEP), this summer Vangas and Rodriguez interned in the U.S. Forest Service¡¯s engineering department in Asheville, N.C. SCEP provides work experience that is directly related to the student's academic program or career aspirations and gives students exposure to public service while enhancing their educational goals. The civil engineering majors are rising seniors at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez and have a passion for engineering. Both are members of the student chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers, where they serve as treasurer and secretary, respectively. The students were introduced to the Forest Service last year when they interned at the agency¡¯s Southern Region headquarters in Atlanta, Ga. There, they were given a crash course on how engineering worked within the agency and assisted with inspections within the national forests. The energetic duo took what they learned in Atlanta and put it into practice to deliver results in Asheville, N.C. this summer. They were instrumental in developing an application for a $7 million grant to repair many of the damaged roads in the Nantahala, Pisgah, Uwharrie and Croatan National Forests in North Carolina. They transferred sketches made of the damaged roads to an Auto-CAD, which is used to produce more technical computerized models of the damaged areas. These models are crucial in formulating proposals needed to obtain the grant and to determine how best to repair the roads. Vangas and Rodriguez said interning with the Forest Service has been an engaging and insightful experience. They enjoyed working in Atlanta last year and the city life that comes with it. They said it has been particularly interesting working in Asheville, N.C. because of its close proximity to the national forests. This proximity provided them with more field work experience and to see the environment that they are affecting. ¡°It has been really easy to adjust here because everyone has been so welcoming,¡± Rodriguez said. Rodriguez chose to intern with the Forest Service because of the diversity of opportunities.  ¡°Working with the Forest Service provides two work scenarios ¨C both field and office work,¡± she explained. Vangas echoed these sentiments. ¡°It¡¯s nice using our technical skills to help improve the forests,¡± she said. Although they are unsure about what they want to do after graduation, both say they would like to continue working for the Forest Service in civil engineering. They enjoyed learning from and meeting a lot of new people who have been influential on paving their road to becoming civil engineers and perhaps future Forest Service employees.

"Foreign Agricultural Service Public Affairs Specialist in  USDA Results  Trade  Oct 18,  Dutch Chef Eric Troost prepares an upscale dish using U.S. beef during a cooking demonstration for about 130 Belgian chefs Sept. 24. The demo was part of the first U.S. beef tasting event held in Belgium, which was hosted by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) office in The Hague, Netherlands, and the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF). The tasting was part of ongoing efforts to help expand U.S. beef exports to the European Union (EU). (Photo courtesy FAS The Hague)  The European Union (EU) is a relatively new market for U.S. beef exports. It wasn¡¯t until August when the United States began exporting high-quality beef (marbled with a high fat content) to the EU under a negotiated tariff rate quota for non-hormone treated beef. Today, about 25 percent of U.S. beef exports to the EU are high-quality cuts such as tenderloin, strip loin and rib eye mostly used by upscale restaurants. The remaining beef exports include medium and lower quality cuts such as flank steak, chuck eye roll, briskets and shoulder clods. Finer restaurants in the EU traditionally do not integrate these cuts into their menus To help introduce these secondary cuts and expand U.S. beef exports to the EU, the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) office in The Hague, Netherlands, partnered with the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) and a Belgium-based meat importer and distributor to host the first U.S. beef tasting event in Belgium Sept. 24. USMEF¡¯s international marketing efforts on behalf of U.S. beef, pork, lamb and veal are funded by the FAS Market Access Program (MAP) and Foreign Market Development programs to support activities such as this event. During the U.S. beef tasting event, approximately 130 Belgian chefs learned about the preparation of these less familiar beef cuts. Local Dutch Chef Eric Troost presented various cooking demonstrations including slowly cooked top sirloin with barbecue sauce, tartar of shoulder clod with artichoke and shallots and top blade with beets, coriander and sesame vinaigrette. The chefs were excited to learn cooking techniques for the secondary beef cuts, which are nearly 40 percent cheaper than primary beef cuts, said Mary Ellen Smith, agricultural attach¨¦ at the FAS office in The Hague. ¡°Typically, secondary cuts from European beef cannot be used for finer dishes, so the Belgian chefs were intrigued by the various cooking methods that take advantage of the unique marbling in U.S. beef,¡± she said. ¡°Events like these help introduce new U.S. products not only to the chefs that prepare them but to the thousands of European consumers that they serve.¡± The U.S. beef tasting event is just one example of how FAS¡¯s market development programs have a long history of helping farmers, ranchers, and businesses of all sizes build and maintain commercial markets for U.S. food and agricultural products around the world.

"USDA Office of Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  Nov 20,  General Motors Global Public Policy Executive Director Greg Martin speaks at a press conference announcing the completion of the first-of-its kind purchase of verified carbon credits generated on working ranch lands by Chevrolet, at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), in Washington, D.C. on Monday, Nov. 17, . (L to R Senator Debbie Stabenow (MI), General Motors Global Public Policy Executive Director Greg Martin, Ducks Unlimited Paul Schmidt, The Climate Trust Executive Director Sean Penrith, and USDA Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) Under Secretary Robert Bonnie). USDA photo by Tom Witham. Earlier this week, USDA highlighted the creation of a market for carbon credits generated on working grasslands. Landowners benefit because they receive compensation for the carbon credits generated on their lands. They get a new source of revenue, while thriving grasslands provide nesting habitat for wildlife, are more resilient to extreme weather, and help mitigate the impact of climate change. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, recently purchased almost 40,000 carbon dioxide reduction tons generated on working ranch grasslands in the Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. It was the first purchase of its type.  Robert Bonnie, USDA's under secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the purchase and USDA's involvement in the project at an event at USDA headquarters. He was joined by Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Greg Martin, executive director for global public policy, General Motors; Sean Penrith, executive director of The Climate Trust and Paul Schmidt, chief conservation officer of Ducks Unlimited. The under secretary thanked Senator Stabenow, Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, for her staunch support for the program, which she said is delivering ¡°real world measurable results.¡± Bonnie said he hopes this purchase will set a pattern for future carbon credit sales. This is how the credit system works: Landowners voluntarily place lands under a perpetual easement but retain rights to work the land, such as raising livestock and growing hay. The carbon storage benefits of this avoided conversion of grasslands are quantified, verified, and formally registered resulting in carbon credits. The carbon credits are made available to entities interested in purchasing carbon offsets. Chevrolet's purchase was undertaken voluntarily as part of its commitment to reduce eight million tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted. This is comparable to the annual carbon reduction benefit of a mature forest the size of Yellowstone National Park. USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded $161,000 through a Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) to Ducks Unlimited in to develop the necessary methodology to quantify the carbon stored in the soil by avoiding grassland conversions, resulting in the generation of carbon credits. Besides the landowners, USDA, and Ducks Unlimited, other key partners that helped make this project a success include The Climate Trust, American Carbon Registry, The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund and Terra Global Capital. Public-private partnerships to enhance U.S. carbon sinks such as forests, grasslands, wetlands and coastal areas, are a key part of the Obama Administration¡¯s recently released Climate and Natural Resources Priority Agenda.

Here are some of these benefits: 1. **Carbon Sequestration**: Perpetual easements on working grasslands help sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, contributing to climate change mitigation. 2. **Soil Conservation and Improvement**: Grassland conservation through perpetual easements helps prevent soil erosion and promotes soil health, leading to improved water quality and increased fertility. 3. **Biodiversity Preservation**: By maintaining open spaces with native grasses and plants, these easements protect local wildlife habitats, promoting biodiversity and ecosystem services like pollination and pest control. 4. **Water Quality Improvement**: Perpetual easements help maintain the natural hydrological cycle, reducing runoff and preventing water pollution by keeping soil intact and minimizing nutrient leaching. 5. **Increased Carbon Credit Opportunities**: The USDA's carbon credit program with General Motors demonstrates how these grasslands can generate revenue streams through carbon offset credits while still being used for agriculture. By placing working grasslands under perpetual easements, landowners contribute to the preservation of natural resources, environmental services, and ecosystem integrity while also generating income from carbon credit sales. This approach promotes environmentally friendly land use practices and encourages sustainable management of agricultural lands.",8.03E-232,0.103004292,0.008658009,0.051502146,0.830158353
"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Missouri in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Aug 12,  Curtis Millsap works in the Chinese High Tunnel on his southwestern Missouri farm. NRCS photo. You can get just about anything you want at Millsap Farms, including an education about market farming. Curtis Millsap estimates that he, his family and a crew of interns feed about 200 families on 2.5 acres of his 20-acre farm near Springfield, Mo. While another seven acres of the farm sometimes includes sheep, poultry and cattle, it¡¯s the vegetable operation that supports Millsap, his wife Sarah and their nine young children. Millsap uses two greenhouses and three seasonal high tunnels to grow produce year-round. High tunnels are plastic-covered structures that enable farmers to lengthen the growing season by using the sun¡¯s heat to regulate temperature inside. Millsap sells through the Farmers Market of the Ozarks and to 75-100 community supported agriculture, or CSA, customers. In a CSA, people buy shares of the farm, and in return they receive a portion of the harvest when in season. One of Millsap¡¯s high tunnels is a Chinese high tunnel, which he built with funding through a Conservation Innovation Grant from the USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Previously, Millsap received financial assistance from NRCS to install a conventional seasonal high tunnel through NRCS¡¯ Environmental Quality Incentives Program. Missouri is home to hundreds of seasonal high tunnels, including nearly 500 funded by NRCS, but Millsap¡¯s Chinese high tunnel is the only one in Missouri, and one of only a few in the United States. Millsap received $20,000 from a $50,000 Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) awarded to the Watershed Committee of the Ozarks to build the Chinese high tunnel, pay for energy renovations in other greenhouses and to establish a grazing system. This grant program helps groups demonstrate innovative approaches to improve soil quality, air quality, and water quality, conserve energy, and enhance wildlife habitat in balance with productive agricultural systems. The committee wanted to demonstrate the benefits of the Chinese high tunnel, which differs from other seasonal high tunnels in that one of the long sides of the 23-by-70-foot structure and both short ends are heavily insulated with concrete and soil. ¡°One of the things the CIG did was improve our efficiency in the high tunnel,¡± Millsap said. ¡°It is warmer in the morning and warmer in the evening (in the Chinese high tunnel) than in the other greenhouses. But what¡¯s interesting is that midday, it is cooler in there than in the other greenhouses. This thing never spikes. It has a smooth curve, which is better for plants.¡± Millsap said the different design is popular in China, where energy is expensive and labor is cheap. ¡°I was looking into the future and thinking that energy is not going to get cheaper, so it made sense,¡± Millsap said. ¡°And this is a teaching farm, so I have the workers.¡± Millsap¡¯s workers include seven apprentices who are compensated with room, board, a farming education and a stipend. ¡°These are people who seriously want to experience this and see if they want to be farmers,¡± Millsap said. ¡°We¡¯ve been doing this for seven years. I¡¯ve had 20 apprentices, and seven are still actively involved in agriculture.¡± The farm also serves as a site for farm tours and other community events, all intended to further the buy-local movement. High tunnels are a cornerstone of USDA¡¯s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative, which coordinates USDA¡¯s work on local and regional food systems.  Since , through NRCS, USDA has provided assistance to help producers construct over 13,000 high tunnels on farms around the country. ¡°We have this great promotion in ¡®buy local,¡¯ but that will go away if we can¡¯t meet demand,¡± Millsap said. ¡°We try to get as many people out to the farm as we can, show them what farming is about, maybe get their hands dirty.¡± Not raised on a farm, Millsap said he learned to farm by attending conferences, by reading and by visiting with lots of other farmers. He said it was something he found himself called to do. ¡°It¡¯s not something I was looking to do, but sometimes when you are called, you better listen,¡± he said.

"Northwest Regional Conservationist, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Aug 11,  The Mid-Snake River, near Twin Falls. Water Quality Trading is one way the States of Washington, Oregon and Idaho are working to protect their rivers. Photo courtesy of the Idaho DEQ Twin Falls Regional Office, used with permission. The Pacific Northwest is known for its picturesque lakes, cascading streams and dramatic coastlines. The many rivers of the Pacific Northwest¡ªthe Yakima, the Snake, Snohomish, Willamette, Klamath, Boise, and others¡ªare part of the cultural, economic and environmental foundation of the region. These waters are meaningful for local Native American Tribes, agricultural production, industries who rely on water resources, and local communities and tourists from around the world that enjoy fishing and other forms of recreation along Northwestern rivers and streams. It¡¯s no surprise that the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho are interested in protecting their rivers to preserve these values, and the wildlife and ecosystems they¡¯re a part of. More surprising, however, is the innovative way the states are collaborating to do it. Water quality trading allows point sources that directly discharge to water, like wastewater treatment plants, to invest in ¡°green¡± infrastructure by restoring the watershed¡¯s natural capacity to filter water. For example, instead of installing expensive technology to reduce phosphorous discharges, the treatment plant could pay farmers upstream to plant trees along their fields to reduce the same amount (or more) of phosphorous from reaching the rivers. Water quality trading may create cost savings for regulated sources, supports conservation on working agricultural lands, and generate environmental solutions that have benefits beyond just water quality¡ªincluding carbon sequestration and wildlife habitat. In , the Willamette Partnership was awarded a $1.5 million Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) from USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to help facilitate a conversation with Washington, Oregon, and Idaho to develop multi-state recommendations on water quality trading. The CIG allowed the Willamette Partnership and The Freshwater Trust to convene Washington, Oregon and Idaho state department of environment staff and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 10 to identify common principles and practices to shape consistent approaches to trading in the region, with a focus on how trading could help regulated sources of pollutant discharges meet their discharge limits while providing additional environmental benefits. The effort resulted in a set of joint recommendations for each state to consider as they develop and further their water quality trading programs, with a goal of keeping those programs consistent with the Clean Water Act and state and local water quality laws. The recommendations address the importance of sound science, avoiding local water quality problems, providing evidence that resulting environmental benefits are real, and ensuring that these benefits are echoed in local communities. Today, the three states have committed to testing these principles and an associated set of recommendations through . Following this piloting phase, the states and EPA will discuss their experiences, and if necessary, refine their joint recommendations. The states, in consultation with partners, will decide how or whether to incorporate the joint recommendations into formal policy or guidance on trading. Bobby Cochran, Executive Director for Willamette Partnership noted, ¡°This is a really exciting time for the Northwest. Washington, Oregon, and Idaho thought deeply about how the joint recommendations can help provide some clarity on trading, promote good stewardship, and support clean water for communities and fish.¡± The joint recommendations put forth by Washington, Oregon and Idaho can serve as an example for the rest of the country on how to establish well thought out trading programs that are built for success. Through CIG projects and other joint efforts, including the EPA ¨C USDA Partnership Agreement to support water quality trading, we can do a better job of protecting water resources we rely on¡ªwhile benefitting local communities, producers, and the environment.

"U.S. Forest Service, North Carolina in  Forestry  Mar 28,  For six years, U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement Office Jason Crisp and his K-9 partner Maros patrolled the Grandfather Ranger District on the Pisgah National Forest. They were killed during a search for a homicide suspect. (U.S. Forest Service) Law-enforcement peers, U.S. Forest Service employees, dignitaries and friends gathered at the McDowell County High School in Marion, N.C. last week to honor Forest Service law enforcement officer Jason Crisp and his K-9 partner, Maros. Among the memorial service attendees were 75 K-9 officers and their partners who paid tribute to both fallen officers. U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory were among the thousands who filled the school¡¯s gymnasium. Crisp and Maros were shot and killed on March 12 pursuing a suspect who, just hours earlier, had allegedly killed his father and step-mother. As they had so many times before, Crisp and Maros were working to keep the Grandfather Ranger District, Pisgah National Forest, and surrounding area safe. ¡°Jason was happy being with his family, and he was happy serving his community,¡± the Rev. Charles Dicks said. ¡°He cared about the agency, and he cared about his coworkers.¡± These were common themes shared by speakers at the ceremony. They described the 38-year-old Crisp as a devoted husband, a loving father of two and a kind-hearted man who helped others. A Forest Service law enforcement officer for eight years, Crisp was a man of strong faith, whose spirituality served as the foundation for how he approached life. He and Maros performed their duties with honor, courage and dignity. One of Jason¡¯s family members shared the following story prior to the ceremony.

"USDA Rural Development Public Information Coordinator in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Dec 26,   USDA Rural Development New Mexico State Director Terry Brunner (center) presents a certificate of obligation to the Ten Southern Pueblo Council Governors and representatives during ceremonies to celebrate the successful application of funds creating the first ever Native American Food Hub in the nation. (USDA Photo) The air was crisp and cold as the wind blew across Sandia Pueblo in mid-December.  But, the atmosphere among the Ten Southern Pueblo Governor¡¯s Council was warm and jovial. Why? Because, the Governors were celebrating the obligation of a USDA Rural Development funded study that creates the first ever Native American Food Hub in the nation. For hundreds of years the residents of the Pueblos in New Mexico have farmed the land to provide the food they ate.  Today, the Native farmers continue to grow corn, squash, beans and other produce for their own consumption.  But often they have abundance of food at the end of every growing season. This successful farming can be a problem because the farmers do not have a mechanism to deliver excess produce to market or those in need.  Food hubs offer a model to provide infrastructure support to farmers usually through a central location where food can be processed and distributed. The Ten Southern Pueblos Council contracted with the Acoma Business Enterprises to serve as the fiscal manager and apply for a Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG) through USDA. The RBEG financial support is funding a study to determine how best to manage the distribution of food produced by native growers through a food hub concept.  Work has begun to identify farmers and their needs to market and deliver the food to a central distribution point.  Once the is collected a plan will be implemented in to make sure the food is provided to the residents of the ten Pueblos and to others needing fresh, healthy produce for their diet.  As well, the Pueblos hope that a successful food hub offers more sustainability to native farmers who wish to make a living through farming.

That¡¯s changing.  Participants from 30 nations met this week at the ACES: A Community on Ecosystem Services; Linking Science, Practice and Decision Making conference to talk about just how we can value these benefits and include that in our decision-making and planning.  As the conference kicked off, U.S. Forest Service Chief Tidwell talked about the need to quantify the benefits of public lands, building consensus and support for a multi-generational outlook, moving away from short term objectives and toward ¡°sustaining the health and diversity of our forests and grasslands.¡± Participants included a number of other federal officials, including Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, USDA Undersecretary Robert Bonnie, and Jay Jensen of the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ).  Kari Cohen, Natural Resources Conservation Service  Posted in  Conservation  Forestry  Dec 15,   1 Response","How can quantifying ecosystem services, such as clean water and air, and conservation forestry practices contribute to a multi-generational outlook and increase support for sustainable land management decisions?","Quantifying ecosystem services like clean water and air, and valuing conservation forestry practices, can help build consensus and support for long-term land management decisions by putting a monetary value on the benefits of sustainable resource use, ultimately shifting focus from short-term gains to multi-generational sustainability.","Quantifying ecosystem services and promoting conservation forestry practices can contribute to a multi-generational outlook and increase support for sustainable land management decisions in several ways: 1. **Valuing intangible benefits**: By quantifying ecosystem services, policymakers and decision-makers can assign economic values to natural assets like clean water and air, which are essential for human well-being but often considered ""free"" or invisible. This helps to internalize the costs of environmental degradation and promote more sustainable land use practices. 2. **Enhancing stakeholder engagement**: Involving local communities in the quantification and conservation of ecosystem services can foster a sense of ownership and responsibility, encouraging them to participate in decision-making processes. This can lead to increased support for sustainable land management decisions that benefit both present and future generations. 3. **Building long-term thinking**: Quantifying ecosystem services and promoting conservation forestry practices encourages a more long-term perspective on the consequences of land use decisions. By recognizing the intrinsic value of natural capital, policymakers and decision-makers are more likely to prioritize conservation over short-term gains. 4. **Fostering intergenerational equity**: By considering the needs and values of future generations, policymakers can ensure that land management decisions are made with a sense of responsibility towards them. This helps to promote sustainable practices that protect ecosystem services for the benefit of all generations. 5. **Providing incentives for sustainable practices**: Quantifying ecosystem services can provide a clear economic rationale for implementing conservation forestry practices and promoting sustainable land use more broadly. By valuing these benefits, decision-makers can create policies that incentivize farmers, foresters, and other land users to adopt more sustainable practices. 6. **Supporting policy and decision-making frameworks**: The quantification of ecosystem services and promotion of conservation forestry practices can inform the development of policies and decision-making frameworks that prioritize sustainability and long-term thinking. To increase support for sustainable land management decisions, policymakers and stakeholders should: 1. **Involve local communities** in the decision-making process to ensure their needs and values are considered. 2. **Develop robust data and monitoring systems** to track ecosystem services and conservation outcomes. 3. **Communicate effectively** about the benefits of sustainable land management practices to both present and future generations. 4. **Create economic incentives** for land users to adopt more sustainable practices. 5. **Develop policies and decision-making frameworks** that prioritize long-term thinking and sustainability.

"Principles, Requirements and - An Important Update that will benefit USDA Clients  When you take a drink of water in this country, chances are pretty good that it came from a reservoir or river that is managed, or that has been treated in a plant funded with support from the Federal government, or whose headwaters are on public land managed by the United States Forest Service or Department of Interior.  Every dollar the federal government spends supporting water quality and quantity impacts millions of Americans.  Interagency governing how investments, programs, and policies that affect water resources are evaluated at the Federal level have been updated for the first time since , and published by the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). Given the importance of water to USDA programs and our customers, we understand that it makes sense to have the most complete and forward-thinking information available to inform our investment and implementation decisions.  That enhances our ability to develop programs and projects that conserve water resources while ensuring taxpayer dollars are well spent.  USDA is confident that these new can enhance our decision-making without adversely affecting how we implement our many conservation programs.

This would ensure that every project or policy aims at conserving water effectively. 2. **Water Use Efficiency Metrics**: Incorporate metrics for evaluating the efficiency of water use in projects and policies. This could include specific targets for reducing water usage without compromising agricultural productivity. 3. **Integration with Climate Change Considerations**: Updates should align with climate change mitigation strategies, considering the impacts of changing weather patterns on water resources. This would ensure that USDA programs are adaptive to future challenges. 4. **Community Engagement and Education**: Programs could be updated to include strong community engagement components. This would educate farmers, rural communities, and urban areas about the importance of water conservation in agriculture and broader water management strategies. 5. **Monitoring and Evaluation Frameworks**: Develop or improve monitoring and evaluation frameworks that track not just the physical outcomes (e.g., water saved) but also the social and economic impacts of these programs. This would help in refining policies and making them more effective over time. 6. **Financial Incentives for Water Conservation**: Consider offering financial incentives to farmers or agricultural businesses that adopt water-saving practices or technologies. This could be part of a broader package of support, including training, technical assistance, and possibly even access to capital for implementing such measures. 7. **Collaboration with Other Agencies**: Updates should reflect cooperation between USDA and other federal agencies focused on environmental conservation and sustainability (like the EPA) as well as international agreements and best practices in water resource management. 8. **Science-Based Recommendations**: Ensure that any updates are grounded in scientific research, reflecting our current understanding of how to efficiently use water in agriculture and broader contexts. 9. **Public Input Mechanisms**: Establish mechanisms for public input into the development of policies and programs related to water conservation within USDA's purview. This could include public forums, surveys, or direct engagement with stakeholders. 10. **Sustainability Across Generations**: Emphasize that any updates are designed not just for the short-term but also aim at sustainability across generations.",0.011238203,0.100656455,0.03956044,0.078774617,0.833388627
"Office of Tribal Relations, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jan 29,  Tim Mentz Sr., Standing Rock Sioux cultural resource expert, explains the historical significance of the area that is now the Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota. (U.S. Forest Service/Fred Clark) Our curiosity was palpable in our expressions, we visitors to this South Dakota field, as we pondered the patterns produced by the tops of rocks pressed into grass and soil, patterns tantalizingly organized and purposeful: shapes of things that have been. What stories were held in this small corner of the Black Hills National Forest? As members of the Forest Service¡¯s sacred sites executive and core teams, our task is to develop ways to fulfill the recommendations from the Report to the Secretary of Agriculture: USDA Policy and Procedures Review and Recommendations: Indian Sacred Sites. Visiting this sacred place was the starting point of our learning and working together as a team. We needed to experience firsthand the feeling and meaning of this place to help us incorporate an appropriate attitude as we started three days of meetings on how to best implement the recommendations, to better protect and provide access to Indian sacred sites. We were guided and educated, at least as much as can be done in just one morning¡¯s time, by Arvol Looking Horse and Tim Mentz Sr. Many years ago, when he was only 12, Looking Horse had been given the enormous responsibility of being the 19th generation Keeper of the Sacred White Buffalo Calf Pipe. He is a spiritual leader for the Lakota Dakota Na-kota Oyate, the great Sioux Nation. Mentz is a cultural resource expert with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. He was their first Tribal historic preservation officer and continues to be an amazing source of information about cultural sites for his Tribe. We learned from tribal elders and Forest Service staff that these stone formations had been misinterpreted several years ago by an archaeologist as teepee rings, or circles of rocks left after having served their purpose of holding down the edges of teepees. The archaeologist had deemed these features as ¡°insignificant¡± in terms of historical value. The tribal elders explained that these were no teepee rings.  Rather, the stone features were ceremonial shapes, purposefully placed and each with its own sacred reason. Having worked as an archaeologist for some 20 years myself, including having mapped and excavated teepee rings in Montana and Wyoming, I was also aware that these forms were far from the evenly rounded rings I¡¯d seen many times before. They were shapes, but shapes of what? The elders explained how the features are organized, how they relate to the surrounding landscape, the directions, other sites both near and far, and a bit about what each feature¡¯s functions would have been. They pointed out the meaning behind the features and talked about how these places have current and ongoing power. Mentz and his crew mapped the entire site during our visit, and related the physical shapes and functions to hundreds of other sites they had recorded. They talked about how many of these types of sites had already been destroyed by development, and how many are endangered. They showed us the life and significance in the rocks, reinforcing the great need to further protect places like this. While many of the sites being destroyed are on private land, the message was urgent and relates directly to our task of doing a better job within the agency to protect the places held sacred by American Indians and Alaska Natives on national forests and grasslands. Meeting and working with elders like Looking Horse and Mentz and having them share this kind of information, we are better prepared to bring to this work a good mind and a good heart, and better able to affect the shape of things to come.

"Rebuilding Wet Meadows Through Shared Stewardship  As another extreme drought in southwest Colorado lingers into fall, land managers continue to search for solutions to deal with severe water shortages. Low winter snow pack and record heat left much of the state scorched, and reservoirs have been far below their normal capacity since spring.  Aurora Cutler, Office of Sustainability and Climate, USDA Forest Service  Posted in  Climate  Forestry  Research and Science  Nov 23,   Respond to this story",Can sustainable forestry practices and shared land management approaches help mitigate the effects of extreme drought on water reservoirs in southwest Colorado?,Yes. Rebuilding wet meadows through shared stewardship can help increase winter snowpack and improve water reservoir levels in southwest Colorado by reducing evaporation and increasing groundwater recharge.,"Yes, sustainable forestry practices and shared land management approaches can help mitigate the effects of extreme drought on water reservoirs in southwest Colorado. Sustainable forestry practices, such as: 1. **Reforestation efforts**: Planting trees that are native to the area and resistant to drought can help maintain healthy forests even during times of drought. 2. **Selective logging**: Harvesting trees in a way that maintains forest health and promotes regeneration can help prevent soil erosion and maintain water quality. 3. **Forest thinning**: Thinning out dense tree stands can reduce competition for water among individual trees, allowing them to survive longer periods of drought. Shared land management approaches, such as: 1. **Collaborative planning**: Bringing together multiple stakeholders (e.g., private landowners, government agencies, and community groups) to develop and implement land management plans that prioritize water conservation. 2. **Integrated resource management**: Considering the interactions between forest ecosystems, watersheds, and human communities when making land use decisions. 3. **Monitoring and adaptive management**: Regularly monitoring water quality and quantity, as well as forest health, and adjusting management practices in response to changing conditions. These approaches can help mitigate the effects of extreme drought on water reservoirs in southwest Colorado by: 1. **Reducing evapotranspiration**: Minimizing the amount of water lost through tree transpiration. 2. **Protecting soil and water quality**: Preventing erosion and maintaining clean water sources. 3. **Maintaining forest health**: Allowing forests to continue providing ecosystem services, even during droughts. By implementing sustainable forestry practices and shared land management approaches, communities in southwest Colorado can reduce the impact of extreme drought on their water reservoirs, ensuring a more reliable supply of this critical resource.",4.34E-79,0.094915254,0.034129693,0.088135593,0.836825967

"Producers get a New Revenue Source, Waterfowl Habitat is Preserved and Industry Benefits from Conservation Effort  Earlier this week, USDA highlighted the creation of a market for carbon credits generated on working grasslands. Landowners benefit because they receive compensation for the carbon credits generated on their lands. They get a new source of revenue, while thriving grasslands provide nesting habitat for wildlife, are more resilient to extreme weather, and help mitigate the impact of climate change. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, recently purchased almost 40,000 carbon dioxide reduction tons generated on working ranch grasslands in the Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. It was the first purchase of its type.  Robert Bonnie, USDA's under secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the purchase and USDA's involvement in the project at an event at USDA headquarters. He was joined by Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Greg Martin, executive director for global public policy, General Motors; Sean Penrith, executive director of The Climate Trust and Paul Schmidt, chief conservation officer of Ducks Unlimited. The under secretary thanked Senator Stabenow, Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, for her staunch support for the program, which she said is delivering ¡°real world measurable results.¡± Bonnie said he hopes this purchase will set a pattern for future carbon credit sales.

"Public Affairs Officer, National Forests in North Carolina in  Forestry  Jun 06,   National Fishing and Boating Week, a part of the June celebration of Great Outdoors Month, will be celebrated again this year June 2 - 10. It¡¯s a time when fishing fanatics and amateur anglers will visit national forests and grasslands across the country to try their hands at landing the big one. On the National Forests in North Carolina, anglers with physical disabilities who visit the Nantahala, Pisgah, Uwharrie, and Croatan National Forests will have a number of accessible piers to choose from. Some of these piers provide access to premier trout fishing destinations. ¡°For more than 20 years, the National Forests in North Carolina and North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission have been committed to providing anglers of all abilities with the opportunity to go fishing on public lands,¡± said Sheryl Bryan, the forests¡¯ fisheries and wildlife biologist. Some of these piers provide access to premier trout fishing destinations. ¡°During this time, forest and district biologists, engineers, landscape architects and recreation proponents have worked together to create a comprehensive network of accessible fishing opportunities across a diversity or resources,¡± added Delce Dyer, the forests¡¯ developed recreation program manager. Today, there are close to 20 barrier-free fishing piers in the four national forests. Through careful planning, design and construction -- in partnership with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission -- accessible fishing facilities have been constructed from the mountains to the sea. The facilities provide fishing opportunities in warm-water reservoirs and small ponds, as well as cold-water streams and rivers. ¡°Designs of fishing piers that extend over waterways have been refined over the years and have been adopted for use by the Wildlife Resources Commission throughout the state,¡± said Lynn Hicks, engineer and heritage and recreation staff officer. ¡±Site-specific designs have provided accessible parking and routes to these water-based sites, and most of the fishing piers include areas for both seated and standing fishing.¡± Recent piers include a metal mesh water-viewing component into a portion of the pier¡¯s flooring. Accessible facilities on majestic Cherokee Lake in Nantahala National Forest include picnic tables and a pavilion, all connected along an accessible route. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service photo In addition to tourists, a number of local residents regularly use the accessible piers. In many communities, the piers have become centers for frequent outdoor recreation. For example, Boone Fork Pond pier, near the communities of Lenoir and Hudson, is commonly used as an outdoor destination for the mentally and physically challenged. Chapters of Wounded Warriors have assisted with projects, particularly on the Croatan National Forest. Other partners who have provided funding or assistance in constructing these facilities include Trout Unlimited, the Muskie Club, and Bass Anglers Sportsmen Society. The two piers near Robbinsville -- one on a small pond, the other on Santeetlah Lake -- provide community fishing opportunities. Many of these accessible fishing facilities are used during National Fishing Week activities, including sites for Special Needs Fishing Days. Great Outdoors Month is a time for all Americans to get outside and take part in a number of national events that encourage people to hike, fish, boat and/or camp at locations all across the country.  June 9 is also a fee free day for public lands including national forests.

"Program Analyst, USDA Office of Environmental Markets, Office of the Chief Economist in  Conservation  Dec 16,  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack speaking at a press conference in Fairfax, VA. USDA photo by David Kosling. USDA has a long history of helping farmers, ranchers and forest landowners maintain their bottom line while improving soil health and reducing runoff into streams and rivers.  For nearly 80 years, USDA has offered funding and technical assistance for farmers to implement conservation practices through the conservation title of the Farm Bill. In recent years, however, USDA has also supported new, innovative approaches to voluntary, private lands conservation. An announcement today by USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, and Administrator Gina McCarthy of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in northern Virginia highlights an innovative approach called water quality trading. Farmers like John Harrison of Appomattox County are taking advantage of private investments to implement conservation practices on their land. These practices help reduce erosion and nutrient runoff into local bodies of water, generating nutrient credits that can then be sold to regulated entities looking to offset nutrient losses for compliance purposes. In this case, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) purchased phosphorous credits to offset water quality impacts from road construction. The offset credits have permitted the completion of more than 40 small road construction projects that improve traffic safety and flow by adding turn lanes, clover leafs, and small connectors, and repairing approaches to aging bridges. Compared to traditional engineered practices, the offset credits provide greater water quality benefits for up to half of the costs of installation and long-term maintenance.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Colorado in  Conservation  Mar 31,  The Southwestern willow flycatcher is an endangered bird that lives in the riparian areas of the Southwest. Photo courtesy of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The distinctive ¡°fitz-bew¡± of the Southwestern willow flycatchers is music to the ears of the partners of Wetland Dynamics, LLC, and USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) recently improved the ability to hear them. Wetland Dynamics received a $60,000 Conservation Innovation Grant from NRCS in to develop innovative technology for monitoring the endangered flycatcher and two other imperiled species in Colorado¡¯s San Luis Valley. ¡°What we¡¯re doing is innovative,¡± said Jenny Nehring, a biologist and partner at Wetland Dynamics. ¡°The technology we¡¯re using has been around for quite some time. But with the partnership now forged with NRCS, we are able to expand and improve our innovative techniques that build upon existing tools, which will in turn help to better understand certain wildlife species and improve protection of them.¡± Wetland Dynamics is expanding and exploring the use of a passive acoustic monitoring technology traditionally used to monitor bats and aquatic species like whales. The company is using this innovative technology to improve detection and monitoring of the Southwestern willow flycatcher, Western yellow-billed cuckoo and Northern leopard frog. The flycatcher, cuckoo and leopard frog are currently being monitored, but the widely used approach takes substantial labor and stresses birds. By recording the birds¡¯ noises, Wetland Dynamics is able to study the endangered Southwestern willow flycatcher. Photo courtesy of Wetland Dynamics. ¡°It requires an observer in the field broadcasting the call of the bird to illicit a response from a bird on a territory,¡± Nehring said. ¡°This method is intrusive and tricks the birds into thinking its territory is being threatened or infringed upon. Birds will, of course, react, but this reaction is stressful and energetically costly to already threatened and endangered species.¡± The new way of monitoring, funded by the grant from NRCS, eliminates the stress on the bird while expanding the information gathered. It relies on passive recording equipment. Because the devices can be stationed for prolonged periods of time, the consistency and quantity of information gathered will provide increased detection of species.  These more accurate detections will allow more focused and precise research on other things such as breeding success and habitat use. Between observer bias and influences like weather, which might prevent an observer from even reaching a monitoring site, the margin for error within the typical call play back monitoring method is high. A grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is enabling Wetland Dynamics to expand its monitoring efforts of the Southwestern willow flycatcher and other at-risk species of the riparian habitat. Photo courtesy of Wetland Dynamics. ¡°Our recorders are stationary devices, can be set up for weeks and have limited disturbance. Recordings are then scanned to detect the vocalization of interest and to differentiate varying vocalizations like birds that are close or far away.¡± Although this technology is promising and is quite significant for future monitoring of species in areas, it cannot determine the number of species in a particular area. ¡°But it can detect if the bird is present which will help researchers focus their on-the-ground field work to determine territory size, breeding effort and success as well as habitat condition,¡± she said. ¡°More work is clearly needed and that¡¯s why the CIG grant was so important.  It allows us to refine and test the technology and quantify perimeters for accuracy. We greatly value our partnership with NRCS and hope it grows so that other monitoring opportunities can be explored.¡± Conservation Innovation Grants aim to stimulate the development and adoption of innovative conservation approaches and technologies. This is one of NRCS¡¯ many investments in the Southwest to help the flycatcher and other species. NRCS announced Monday its plans to broaden the conservation opportunities available to producers.

"Monitoring Tool Assists Ranchers and Wildland Managers Facing Drought  Drought can be a serious game changer for rangeland, wildlife and wildland fire managers. America¡¯s 662 million acres of public rangelands support wildlife like sage grouse, game species like deer and elk, and support rural communities by providing forage for livestock and places to enjoy the great outdoors.  Yvonne Shih, Research and Development, USDA Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Jul 30,   1 Response",How do wildland managers use monitoring tools to assist ranchers in managing drought-affected rangelands that support both wildlife and livestock?,"Wildland managers utilize monitoring tools to help ranchers manage drought-affected rangelands by tracking conditions, predicting resources availability, and making informed decisions on grazing, forage, and water allocation, ultimately supporting both wildlife and livestock.","Wildland managers use various monitoring tools to help ranchers manage drought-affected rangelands that support both wildlife and livestock. These tools enable them to assess the health of the land, identify areas of concern, and make informed decisions about grazing management, conservation efforts, and resource allocation. Some common monitoring tools used by wildland managers include: 1. **Remote Sensing and GIS**: Remote sensing technologies such as satellite or aerial imagery, combined with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), provide a broad-scale assessment of rangeland conditions, including vegetation health, soil moisture, and habitat quality. 2. **Vegetation Condition Assessment (VCA)**: VCA is a standardized method for monitoring the condition of vegetation on rangelands. It involves collecting data on plant species composition, density, and cover to evaluate the overall health of the ecosystem. 3. **Drought Index**: A drought index, such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index or the Keetch-Byram Drought Index, helps managers quantify drought severity and duration, allowing them to adjust grazing management and conservation strategies accordingly. 4. **Soil Moisture Monitoring**: Soil moisture sensors or probes measure the water content of the soil, enabling managers to determine when rangelands are experiencing water stress and make informed decisions about grazing permits or restrictions. 5. **Wildlife Habitat Suitability Models**: These models assess the suitability of habitats for specific wildlife species, such as sage grouse or mule deer, and help identify areas where conservation efforts may be necessary to protect these species during drought conditions. 6. **Grazing Management Tools**: Software programs like GRASP (Grazing Management and Assessment Tool) or PRISM (Predictive Rangeland Inventory and Monitoring System) allow managers to simulate different grazing scenarios, predict the effects of drought on vegetation and wildlife habitats, and make informed decisions about livestock numbers and grazing duration. 7. **Community-based Drought Planning**: This approach involves engaging local stakeholders, including ranchers and conservation groups, in the planning process to ensure that everyone's interests are represented and that management strategies are tailored to specific rangeland conditions. By using these monitoring tools, wildland managers can provide critical information to ranchers on how to manage drought-affected rangelands effectively, balancing the needs of both wildlife and livestock. This proactive approach helps maintain ecosystem resilience, protects biodiversity, and supports sustainable agriculture practices in these regions.",0.029188309,0.143209877,0.079404467,0.118518519,0.863586545
"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Earth Team Volunteer in  Conservation  Jun 17,  Honeybees leaving and returning to the hive after collecting pollen. Photo: Ashton Ebarb. ¡°They¡¯re in a happy mood today,¡± Jim Pratt, a local apiarist, said. At a comfortable 62 degrees, honeybees buzz with a clear objective: collect nectar and pollen, for honey and pollination. ¡°Pollinators, like honeybees, support food crops,¡± Pratt said, explaining why for 20 years he¡¯s raised honeybees. Pratt¡¯s Farm annually produces about 120 pounds of honey per colony. He maintains 100 colonies, collecting honey from them each spring, summer and fall. During the winter, the bees eat stored honey until warmer weather arrives. Honeybees, like all pollinators, face challenges. Lack of habitat is the number one local threat Pratt sees to pollinators. USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) works with farmers, ranchers and forest landowners to implement conservation practices on the ground that have numerous environmental benefits, including ones that provide habitat and food for pollinators. ¡°Much of our local land is managed pastures,¡± Pratt said. Pastures provide benefits in various forms of agriculture, yet there are times between seasons when nothing is grown to attract pollinators across vast measures of land. ¡°As a beekeeper, I seek out managed pastures over-seeded with clover. Placing colonies of honeybees in and around the pastures benefits not only the beekeeper with the potential of premium grade honey, but also benefits the landowner by sustaining the clover population as a result of the necessary pollination by the bees.¡± With NRCS¡¯ Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), landowners can offset the cost of over-seeding clovers in their pastures and adjacent tracts specifically for pollinator species. ¡°Pastures over-seeded with clover provide benefits in various forms of agriculture,¡± Pratt explained. ¡°First, pollinators of all types are attracted to it. Second, clover replenishes nitrogen in the soil which better supports livestock forage.¡±  Since clovers are a cool-season legume, and usually die-back with the onset of mid-Summer, Pratt looks for tracts of land with natural habitat, such as wildlife refuges, conservation reserves and pollinator plantings adjacent to the pastures for nectar and pollen sources after the clover has died. Pollinators need nearby habitats which is vital to sustaining their populations. People need pollinators, too. No matter the pollinator, whether bee, bird, beetle, butterfly, bat or any other, all contribute to our food supply by pollination. ¡°90 percent of fruits and vegetables are not self-pollinating,¡± said Janice Hutton, horticulturalist with The Sabine River Authority in Sabine Parish, Louisiana. Fruits and vegetables almost entirely depend upon pollinators. Every living person and thing that depends on fruits and vegetables depends on pollinators too. The good news: helping pollinators achieve their goal is as simple as growing certain plants. ¡°I have to know what blooms, when it blooms and whether each colony has enough worker bees to collect nectar and pollen,¡± said Pratt. This week, USDA is celebrating National Pollinator Week by highlighting the many ways in which conservation benefits pollinators. Through the Farm Bill, landowners have an opportunity to receive financial assistance through conservation programs and practices, which includes planting cover crops to target these beneficial pollinators.

"Media Relations Officer, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Mar 08,   The Forest Service has added an iPhone/iPad application called Invasive Plants in Southern Forests: Identification and Management to its strategy of reducing nonnative invasive plants in the South. The free app will allow more people to get involved in eradicating foreign plants, which, along with nonnative animals and pathogens, harm water supplies.  They also harm native plants, wildlife, livestock and property in both rural and urban areas at a cost of about $138 billion annually. Using Forest Service funding and research, the University of Georgia Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health created the software from the Southern Research Station publications A Field Guide for the Identification of Invasive Plants in Southern Forests and A Management Guide for Invasive Plants in Southern Forests. The U.S. Forest Service is a leading agency working to reduce the impact of the hundreds of invasive plants threatening public and private lands. The application was funded by a grant from the Forest Service Southern Research Station¡¯s Insects, Diseases and Invasive Plants unit. The software provides photos and information that allow users to identify the 56 nonnative plants and plant groups currently invading 13 Southern states. ¡°Ultimately we hope this app will give people a new tool to go out and identify invasive plants and map their occurrence,¡± said Southern Research Station Research Ecologist James Miller, who co-authored the application¡¯s source guides. ¡°Effective control relies on understanding of species and how they spread across the landscape. Those are important first steps in stopping and containing the invasions of harmful nonnative plants.¡± Like the publications it was developed from, the app divides nonnative invasive plants into trees, shrubs, vines, grasses, ferns and forbs, and provides identification keys, photos and management recommendations. The app also gives users simple, on-the-spot options for treating invasive plants. Future versions of the application will include the ability to directly report new sightings of select species into the Georgia Center¡¯s Early Detection and Distribution Mapping System (EDDMapS), which provides a quick way to submit photos and report new sightings of invasive plants on the spot throughout the United States.

"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication in  Forestry  Research and Science  May 22,  During April and May ramps are often served in restaurants in the eastern U.S. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA¡¯s rich science and research portfolio. To many of locals in western North Carolina, they¡¯re called wild leeks.  Some call them ransoms and still others call them wood garlic because of their pungent smell. Nevertheless, ecologists simply call them ramps. This native plant has been useful to humans since inhabiting the eastern regions of the U.S. and Canada.  Still today, locals harvest ramps for food, medicinal preparations, and to sell at markets and spring festivals. U.S. Forest Service scientist Joan Walker has been monitoring populations of ramps in the mountain coves of western North Carolina for 11 years. The results of her research show that although abundance can vary from year to year, about a quarter of the plots had decreasing ramps cover. ¡°All of the plots that showed a decrease were where harvesting disturbance was high,¡± said Walker who is based out of the agency¡¯s Southern Research Station. ¡°Also, harvested plots as a group have reduced ramps populations compared to undisturbed ones.¡± These results suggest that it may be time to re-examine the current harvest policy and perhaps take corrective measures to ensure the species will be available for future generations of Americans. In the Southern Appalachians, many prime sites for harvesting ramps are within national forest boundaries. The National Forest System is responsible for maintaining biological diversity to sustain valuable ecosystem services such as clean air and water, healthy soil, abundant wood, recreational opportunities and other forest-based commodities that include herbs and edible plants. Ramps are among the first ephemeral greens to emerge during the spring months of March and April. With their electric green leaves, plump, white bulb and distinct odor, ramps are easy to distinguish from other early growers. After a hard winter in the mountains with food stores running low, this green ¡°manna¡± would have literally been a life saver to both Native Americans and settlers living throughout the region in years past. Concerns about harvesting effects in the southern range (northern Georgia and Alabama and western North Carolina) prompted Walker¡¯s monitoring study in two areas of the Nantahala National Forest in western North Carolina. The goal of the project is to track the populations over time and to determine if trends are related to local harvesting, weather, or even changing climate. The monitoring study consists of 25 plots distributed between 3,500 feet to just over 5,000 feet in elevation.

"Southern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Feb 11,  Healthy seagrass meadows prevent erosion on coasts, store carbon, and provide marine animals with food and habitat. (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency) Just off Florida¡¯s 8,000 miles of coastline and tidal areas, in shallow sunlit waters, over two million acres of seagrass meadows waft in the ocean currents. Besides providing food and habitat for manatees, sea turtles, shellfish, and other animals, seagrasses protect coasts from erosion and store vast quantities of carbon dioxide. ¡°Seagrasses grow off the coast of many other U.S. states, including North Carolina and Virginia, as well as around the world,¡± said U.S. Forest Service Southern Research Station scientist Zanethia Choice. ¡°Globally, their economic value is nearly $4 trillion.¡± Although more closely related to lilies than to terrestrial grasses, like most of their distant grass kin, seagrasses require plenty of sunlight. Poor water quality reduces the amount of sunlight that reaches them, and seagrasses around the world are threatened by practices that affect water quality such as wastewater disposal and fertilizer runoff. Choice, a natural resource specialist at the research center¡¯s Center for Bottomland Hardwoods Research, and her colleagues from the University of Florida recently studied light requirements for four common seagrass species along the Florida Gulf Coast. The study was published in the Marine Pollution Bulletin. ¡°We found a direct relationship between the amount of light reaching the ocean floor and the amount and diversity of seagrasses growing there,¡± said Choice. In 90 percent of sites where 13 years of historic showed that adequate sunlight had been reaching the ocean floor, researchers found thriving seagrass meadows. However, areas with suitable light but no seagrass were most likely due to unsuitable substrate, temperature, and the amounts of dissolved salts and oxygen. Seagrasses are adapted to nutrient-poor waters. When nutrients ¨C whether from fertilizer runoff, wastewater disposal, or other human activities ¨C wash into the ocean, they float suspended in the ocean waters. Seagrasses cannot use these suspended nutrients very efficiently, but tiny algae called phytoplankton can. Phytoplankton thrive in nutrient-rich waters, and as they grow, they intercept light and shade the ocean floor. Seagrasses were notably absent from areas with high nutrient levels. Some seagrasses such as star grass could survive with as little as 8 percent of sunlight reaching the ocean floor, while other species 25 percent sunlight or more. ¡°Light requirements for all the seagrasses we studied differed from previous findings at other locations,¡± said Choice. ¡°The differences are probably due to morphological and physiological differences, and adaptation to light histories at specific locations.¡± Understanding the light requirements of different seagrass species is essential for coastal managers who want to maintain seagrass habitats, and managing for seagrass health also provides water quality targets that can benefit other marine life.  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Tags:  aquatic  Florida  Forestry  FS  North Carolina  Research  Southern Research Station  Virginia",What is the main factor limiting seagrass growth in areas with high nutrient levels?,"The main factor limiting seagrass growth in areas with high nutrient levels is phytoplankton thriving and intercepting light, which shades the ocean floor and prevents seagrasses from growing.","The main factor limiting seagrass growth in areas with high nutrient levels is light limitation. While high nutrients can lead to increased productivity and algae growth, this competition for resources (mainly light) can actually limit the growth of seagrasses, which are light-sensitive plants that require a certain amount of sunlight to photosynthesize. In other words, although seagrass beds may receive high levels of nutrients from sources like fertilizer runoff or sewage discharge, excessive algal growth can block out light, making it difficult for seagrasses to photosynthesize and grow. This phenomenon is often referred to as the ""algal-seagrass feedback loop"" or ""nutrient-light limitation."" So, in summary, while high nutrient levels may seem beneficial for seagrass growth at first glance, they can ultimately lead to light limitation and restrict the growth of these marine plants.",0.096937302,0.256097561,0.148148148,0.231707317,0.881382287

"Public Affairs Specialist, NRCS California in  Conservation  Jul 28,  A planning meeting with Freitas at the Redding Service Center.  Shasta County landowner Karen Freitas has worked with the staff of USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) since , when she sought help recovering from a devastating wild fire that had burned much of her 160-acre tree farm the previous summer. Helping agricultural producers recover after a natural disaster is fairly routine work for NRCS, and the Redding office, where Freitas went for assistance, was no different. But what was unusual for these NRCS employees is that Freitas is deaf¡ªpresenting an unusual opportunity for client assistance. Freitas approached the Redding NRCS office initially for assistance rebuilding her operation, and District Conservationist Bob Bailey was able to help her put together a conservation plan and an application for cost-share funding through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Conservation work implemented under the first contract she signed with NRCS covered water control structures, brush management, critical area plantings, fuel breaks, tree and shrub establishment, forest site preparation, forest stand improvement and access road work. More recently, Freitas has been working with NRCS to develop a forest management plan on her property. District Conservationist Bob Bailey, Karen Freitas and Forester Jeff Webster working on a forest management plan with the assistance of a sign language interpreter.  Initially it seemed there might be some communication challenges in working with a hearing-impaired client, especially in some of the more technical aspects of the work. Freitas was the first deaf client NRCS California¡¯s Redding office had ever helped. But the office contracted for professional sign language interpretative services, with excellent results. Since then, District Conservationist Bailey has used an interpreter several times to facilitate communications between Freitas and NRCS staff during planning meetings and implementation of projects in the field. ¡°Using an interpreter has worked out great,¡± Bailey says. ¡°I feel a sense of satisfaction that I was able to assist Mrs. Freitas with her forest management objectives. She is one of the hardest working clients I have, and she takes great satisfaction in the conservation projects she completes.¡± NRCS often works with clients to meet their communication needs, relying not only on American Sign Language interpreters, but also interpreters for non-hearing impaired landowners and land managers whose first language is not English. A sign language interpreter facilitates communication as Bob Bailey explains how soil erosion concerns on an access road might be addressed.  In addition, USDA has many department-wide provisions to ensure equal access to services for traditionally underserved groups such as women and black farmers, low-income farmers, and Tribes.

"Pollinator Week Brings Focus on Honey Bee Health  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA¡¯s rich science and research portfolio. The buzz of a honey bee and the flutter of a butterfly bring happy thoughts of beautiful gardens. These pollinators are also hard at work providing vital services that are critical to our national and global food supplies. Honey bees to native bees and birds, bats and butterflies help ensure the production of plentiful fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Pollination by honey bees alone adds more than $15 billion in value to agricultural crops each year. Unfortunately, the number of pollinators has been declining in recent years due to many factors.  Ruihong Guo, Agricultural Marketing Service Science and Technology Program Deputy Administrator  Posted in  Animals  Plants  Research and Science  Jun 16,   2 Responses",What is the estimated annual value of pollination by honey bees to agricultural crops?,More than $15 billion.,"According to various estimates, the annual value of pollination by honey bees (Apis mellifera) to agricultural crops worldwide is approximately $200 billion. This estimate comes from a 2019 study published in the journal Science, which calculated the economic benefits of pollinators, including honey bees, to global agriculture. This figure takes into account the value of many common crop species that are heavily dependent on honey bee pollination, such as almonds (Prunus dulcis), apples (Malus domestica), pears (Pyrus communis), and berries like blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum) and strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa). The calculation is based on the assumption that a significant portion of these crops would not produce or yield fruit without honey bee pollination. Keep in mind that this estimate might vary depending on the source, methodology used, and assumptions made. Nonetheless, $200 billion is widely cited as a rough approximation of the annual value of pollination by honey bees to agricultural crops worldwide.",5.18E-232,0.012738854,0,0.012738854,0.815473199

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA¡¯s rich science and research profile. The U.S. Forest Service has a long history as a leader in conservation genetics, and this recently took an exciting step forward with the launch of the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation. The Forest Service¡¯s wildlife genetics lab, which has been central to the Rocky Mountain Research Station¡¯s conservation genetics program since , has been reorganized and renamed to better reflect the scope of its work nationwide. The Center is a leading edge facility for advanced genomics research, nationally recognized, and works extensively with states, tribes, universities and private groups to address the management issues of over 60 fish and wildlife species.  collected by the Center will support the new Forest Service Forest Planning Rule with timely and cost-effective information on wildlife and fish species. Information developed by the Center will be made available through the network of USDA Climate Hubs to assist private forestland managers, farmers and ranchers in reaching their conservation goals. With state-of-the-art technology and the development of new tools and techniques, the main objective of the Center is to provide cost-effective and reliable genomic for improved species monitoring. By having more robust information, state and federal managers are better able to evaluate the genetic health and population viability of fish and wildlife species across the landscape. The discovery of a new fish species and the detection of invasive species are among the Center¡¯s many contributions to the advancement of science and management.

This is a daunting challenge that land managers face on a regular basis. One of the Center¡¯s specialties, analyzing samples of environmental DNA, or eDNA, shows great promise in addressing this challenge. This type of DNA has been separated from organisms into the surrounding environment and can be found in soil, water and air. Forest Service scientists are developing ways to determine what species are present by simply sampling a cup of water from locations across the landscape. ¡°eDNA is a highly sensitive method for detecting organisms in low abundance and is generally faster and extremely cost effective compared to traditional methods used to detect exotic or endangered species,¡± said Dr. Michael Schwartz, director of the center. The use of eDNA is an innovative approach to inventorying and monitoring fish and wildlife species. eDNA is particularly effective for detecting rare species that can be difficult to sample using traditional methods. For example, researchers at the Rocky Mountain Research Station have been working with partners and collaborators on the threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) since . Bull trout is a culturally significant species to several Tribes in the Northwest and Columbia River Basin. It is also a prized game fish, and land management and recreational angling are significantly influenced by whether or not this species is present in a given watershed. This species is particularly sensitive to changes in habitat and is also threatened by the introduction of the nonnative brook trout (S. fontinalis). Forest Service scientists have developed sampling methods to make eDNA surveys a reliable and accessible option for managers to detect the presence of bull trout and their invasive competitor, brook trout. Forest Service scientists continue to develop eDNA techniques for detecting priority fish and wildlife.  eDNA is just one method of non-invasive genetic sampling, which uses forensic-style DNA samples to monitor rare and sensitive species, employed by the Center.

"Hoosier National Forest in  May 13,  Bedford, Ind., May 5, -- A group of Hoosier National Forest employees plant chestnut trees in a timber sale area of the Hoosier to return the American chestnut to its native range (Photo Credit: US Forest Service). Once a prominent phenomenon in southern Indiana, Bedford just experienced the first re-planting of American chestnut trees on the Hoosier National Forest in partnership with Purdue University and the U.S. Forest Service¡¯s Northern Research Station. ¡°Historically, the American chestnut was once one of the most important trees in the eastern United States, occupying about 25 percent of the hardwood canopy in eastern forests,¡± said David Cleaves, climate change advisor for the Forest Service. The trees grew to be 80 feet tall or more, and were known as ¡®the redwood of the East.¡¯  By the s, the tree was nearly wiped out by an Asian fungus known as chestnut blight.  The restoration of American chestnut to eastern forests depends on the development of blight-resistant seedlings. The Forest Service, American Chestnut Foundation, and the University of Tennessee have been conducting research and tests to produce a blight-resistant American chestnut, with aspirations of restoring the species in its grandeur. Bedford, Ind., May 5, -- Forest Botanist Kirk Larson (foreground) plants an American chestnut tree on the Hoosier National Forest to return the American chestnut to its native range (Photo Credit: US Forest Service).  A traditional back-cross breeding method is being used to create blight-resistant American chestnut seedlings, which are 94 percent American chestnut and 6 percent Chinese chestnut --- and are blight resistant. The restoration effort began when the American Chestnut Restoration Project partners planted seedlings in three national forests in Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina in early . Scientists say the seedlings are surpassing expectations of survival and they are cautiously optimistic. A full decade will need to pass before massive replanting begins.  But the trees will be given every opportunity to do well. They were planted in a fenced enclosure to keep out deer and minimize damage from wildlife, and herbicides will be applied as needed to control undesirable competition. The fenced enclosure was built with help from fire crews from the Ottawa and White Mountain National Forests as well as Hoosier employees.  Ron Doyle planted the first blight-resistant American chestnut on the Hoosier National Forest, unofficially in honor of his father -- a long-time member of the American Chestnut Foundation. His father, now in a nursing home, was very pleased to hear the trees were returning to Indiana. Another Indiana site will be planted in .  Tags:  Bedford  Climate Change  David Cleaves  Forestry  FS  Indiana  Northern Research Station","""What are the key factors involved in the massive replanting effort of American chestnut trees on Hoosier National Forest, and what makes these seedlings resistant to the blight that nearly wiped out the species?""","1. **Development of blight-resistant seedlings**: A traditional back-cross breeding method was used to create seedlings that are 94% American chestnut and 6% Chinese chestnut, making them resistant to the Asian fungus known as chestnut blight. 2. **Fenced enclosure protection**: The seedlings were planted in a fenced enclosure to protect them from deer and other wildlife that could damage or harm them. 3. **Herbicides for weed control**: Herbicides will be applied as needed to control undesirable competition and prevent the spread of invasive species. These measures, combined with a decade-long wait period before massive replanting begins, are designed to give the seedlings every opportunity to thrive and eventually restore the American chestnut tree to its former prominence in eastern forests.","The massive replanting effort of American chestnut trees on Hoosier National Forest is part of a broader conservation initiative led by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service, in collaboration with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and other organizations. The key factors involved in this effort include: 1. **Genetic resistance**: Scientists have identified specific genetic traits within American chestnut populations that confer natural resistance to the chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica), a fungal disease caused by a pathogen introduced from Asia. These resistant genotypes are being used as seed sources for replanting. 2. **Backcross breeding**: To enhance the genetic resistance of American chestnuts, researchers have developed a backcross breeding program that involves crossing blight-resistant Chinese chestnut trees with American chestnuts. This process has helped to introduce and amplify desirable traits into the American population, making them more resilient to the disease. 3. **Cryopreservation and seed orchards**: To ensure a reliable supply of resistant seeds for replanting, scientists have developed cryopreservation techniques to bank seeds from blight-resistant trees. These seeds are then used in controlled seed orchards to produce high-quality planting stock. 4. **Sapling cultivation and nursery management**: Specialized nurseries cultivate saplings from these resistant seed sources, using specific growing conditions and treatments to minimize disease pressure. This helps ensure that the young trees have a strong foundation for growth and resistance. The key features of these resistant American chestnut seedlings include: 1. **Resistance genes**: The blight-resistant genotypes used in replanting efforts carry genetic traits that inhibit the fungal pathogen's ability to infect the tree. 2. **Enhanced vigor**: These seedlings exhibit improved growth rates, leaf quality, and overall health compared to their unimproved counterparts. 3. **Improved root development**: Resistant American chestnut seedlings tend to have stronger, more extensive root systems, which helps them better compete with invasive species and withstand environmental stressors. The replanting effort on Hoosier National Forest is critical for restoring the ecological role of American chestnuts in these ecosystems. By reintroducing blight-resistant trees, conservationists hope to: 1. **Recreate complex forest structures**: American chestnut's towering canopies once played a vital role in structuring the Hoosier National Forest landscape. Restoring these dominant trees will help recreate a more diverse and resilient ecosystem. 2. **Support biodiversity**: The return of American chestnuts is expected to boost local biodiversity, as their presence supports a range of associated species, from wildlife to pollinators. 3. **Promote ecological resilience**: By establishing blight-resistant American chestnut populations, the long-term goal is to enhance the forest's ability to withstand and adapt to changing environmental conditions. This concerted effort represents a significant step toward restoring America's iconic chestnut trees and promoting a more resilient, diverse, and dynamic ecosystem on Hoosier National Forest.",3.17E-155,0.24610052,0.048695652,0.131715771,0.854373157
"Manager, USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline in  Health and Safety  May 25,  Cook pork, roasts, and chops to 145 oF as measured with a food thermometer, then allow the meat to rest for three minutes before carving or consuming. Cross posted from the FoodSafety.gov blog:  On May 24, USDA made some important changes in their recommended cooking temperatures for meats. Here¡¯s what you need to know: Cooking Whole Cuts of Pork: USDA has lowered the recommended safe cooking temperature for whole cuts of pork from 160 oF to 145 oF with the addition of a three-minute rest time. Cook pork, roasts, and chops to 145 oF as measured with a food thermometer before removing meat from the heat source, with a three-minute rest time before carving or consuming. This will result in a product that is both safe and at its best quality¡ªjuicy and tender. Cooking Whole Cuts of Other Meats: For beef, veal, and lamb cuts, the safe temperature remains unchanged at 145 oF, but the department has added a three-minute rest time as part of its cooking recommendations. What Cooking Temperatures Didn¡¯t Change? Ground Meats: This change does not apply to ground meats, including beef, veal, lamb, and pork, which should be cooked to 160 oF and do not require a rest time. Poultry: The safe cooking temperature for all poultry products, including ground chicken and turkey, stays the same at 165 oF. What Is Rest Time?  ¡°Rest time¡± is the amount of time the product remains at the final temperature, after it has been removed from a grill, oven or other heat source. During the three minutes after meat is removed the heat source, its temperature remains constant or continues to rise, which destroys harmful bacteria. Why Did the Recommendations Change? It¡¯s just as safe to cook cuts of pork to 145 o F with a three-minute rest time as it is to cook them to 160 oF, the previously recommended temperature, with no rest time. The new cooking recommendations reflect the same standards that the agency uses for cooked meat products produced in federally inspected meat establishments, which rely on the rest time of three minutes to achieve a safe product. Having a single time and temperature combination for all meat will help consumers remember the temperature at which they can be sure the meat is safe to eat. How Do You Use a Food Thermometer? Place the food thermometer in the thickest part of the food. It should not touch bone, fat, or gristle. Start checking the temperature toward the end of cooking, but before you expect it to be done. Be sure to clean your food thermometer with hot soapy water before and after each use. To see where to place a food thermometer in different cuts of meat, see Thermometer Placement and Temperatures. For more information on cooking temperatures for all types of food, see the Safe Minimum Cooking Temperatures chart. If you have questions about cooking meat, feel free to contact us at the Hotline or online at Ask USDA.

As of 2011, the USDA revised its guidelines to reflect a change in the understanding of food safety. The previous recommended safe internal temperature for pork was 160¡ãF (71¡ãC). However, this recommendation was based on outdated research that suggested trichinosis, a parasitic infection caused by Trichinella spiralis, could be found in pork if it was not heated to an extremely high temperature.

This revised recommendation is based on research that shows trichinosis can be eliminated at lower temperatures than previously thought.

"Pet Waste Disposal Systems Help Protect Water Quality  Dog waste that isn¡¯t cleaned up isn¡¯t just a hazard for the bottom of your shoes¡ªit is also a cause of pollution in creeks, rivers and lakes across the country. Dog waste contains nitrogen and phosphorus, which can deplete oxygen that fish and other water-based life need to survive, as well as encourage the growth of harmful algae. It is also considered a significant source of pathogens like fecal coliform, a disease-causing bacteria.  Amy Overstreet Maxwell and Sabrenna Bryant, NRCS South Carolina  Posted in  Conservation  Mar 08,   1 Response",What are the primary sources of pollution in waterways when pet waste is not disposed of properly?,"The primary sources of pollution in waterways due to improperly disposed pet waste are nitrogen and phosphorus, which deplete oxygen for fish and other aquatic life, and pathogens like fecal coliform bacteria.","When pet waste is not disposed of properly, it can lead to several issues that contribute to waterway pollution. The primary sources of pollution in this scenario include: 1. **Bacteria and Pathogens**: Pet waste contains bacteria like E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter, which can contaminate nearby waterways. These pathogens can pose a health risk to humans, especially those who engage in activities like swimming or fishing in polluted waters. 2. **Nutrient Pollution (Nitrogen and Phosphorus)**: Pet waste is high in nitrogen and phosphorus, which are essential nutrients for plant growth but can be detrimental in excess. When pet waste enters waterways, it releases these nutrients into the environment, leading to algal blooms. These excessive algae growths deplete oxygen levels as they decay, harming aquatic life. 3. **Sedimentation and Turbidity**: Improper disposal of pet waste can lead to increased sediment loads in waterways. As the organic matter from pet waste breaks down, it creates suspended solids that contribute to turbidity. This reduces sunlight penetration into waters, impairing photosynthesis in aquatic plants. 4. **Excess Nutrient Loads for Aquatic Life**: Excessive nutrient inputs due to pet waste pollution can disrupt the delicate balance of the ecosystem. This can lead to an overgrowth of certain plant species, such as algae, while other beneficial aquatic life may struggle to survive due to altered water chemistry. It's essential to properly dispose of pet waste by burying it or using designated pet waste disposal bags. These measures prevent pet waste from entering storm drains and eventually waterways, mitigating the pollution sources mentioned above.",0.035416235,0.200692042,0.097560976,0.14532872,0.860601842

"Technical Information Specialist, USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline in  Health and Safety  Mar 25,  Food safety is a key ingredient for a successful meal. Visit FoodSafety.gov for more information on the four key food safety steps: clean, separate, cook and chill. Ahh, Spring! This week, a new season is getting a nice kick-off with Passover and Easter holidays. These celebrations are filled with traditional meals that have unique food safety considerations that may or may not be included in the family recipe book. The USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline has some food safety tips and steps here that, if added to your favorite recipes, can reduce the risk of food poisoning.  As with any food preparation, always remember to Clean, Separate, Cook, and Chill. Before preparing any meal, wash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds, and clean surfaces and utensils with hot soapy water before and after handling raw food. Perishable food should not be left out for more than two hours at room temperature, so check the time at your gathering and make sure either to get food back in the refrigerator or to discard it. Refrigerated leftovers for all foods in this blog should be used within four days.  Beef Brisket: One reason that it¡¯s an excellent choice for entertaining is that it can be prepared in advance. In fact, you must prepare it in advance and cook it slowly to make it tender. Also, because it can be cooked ahead of time and it reheats well, brisket is a great cut of meat to serve to large groups.  Follow these food safety tips for cooking and serving brisket: Be sure to allow plenty of time to thaw a frozen brisket. Thawing in the refrigerator can take about 24 hours for a trimmed, first-cut brisket. A whole brisket weighing about 10 pounds can take several days. Keep raw meat refrigerated at 40 ?F or below until ready to cook. Place the meat on a plate or container to hold the juices that can drip on other foods to prevent cross-contamination. Bake the brisket, fat side up in a baking dish, in an oven set no lower than 325 ?F. The brisket is safe to eat when it reaches an internal temperature of 145 ¡ãF and is allowed to rest at that temperature for three minutes. Use a food thermometer to be sure. For personal preferences, consumers may choose to cook the brisket longer for tenderness. If reheating brisket before serving, remember to reheat to 165 ¡ãF.To serve brisket cold, keep it at 40 ¡ãF or below by nesting dishes in beds of ice, or use small servings platters and replace them often. Ham: There are many kinds of hams on the market, but your family likely is purchasing a fully cooked ham. Here are tips for storing and serving a fully cooked ham: When buying a ham, look for the USDA or State Mark of Inspection.  Refrigerate the ham at 40 ?F or below immediately after arriving home. These hams are best served cold. However, if you want to reheat them, set the oven at 325 ?F and heat to an internal temperature of 140 ¡ãF as measured with a food thermometer. If the ham was repackaged at your butcher shop or grocer, reheat it to 165 ¡ãF. Individual slices may also be warmed in a skillet or microwave. Deviled Eggs: Follow these food safety tips below for making an egg dish such as deviled eggs. Remember, eggs are perishable just like raw meat, poultry, and fish, and could contain pathogens. Our virtual food safety expert, Ask Karen, has helpful instructions on how to boil eggs. After cooking the eggs, it is a good idea to keep the whites refrigerated while preparing the filling. Keep deviled eggs chilled until you are ready to serve. Eggs should not stay at room temperature for more than 2 hours. Use a cooler with ice when transporting to another location.

Sept. 17, . The U.S. Forest Service operates the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Corps, the Nation¡¯s largest residential, educational and career technical training program for young Americans. USDA photo by Bob Nichols. Fifty years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Economic Opportunity Act.  This Act, part of the government effort to wipe out poverty, created the Job Corps program, which has had a positive effect on countless young lives, giving them a chance to break multi-generational cycles of poverty, get an education, and find jobs in the federal and private sectors, and in the military.  The U.S. Forest Service works closely with the Department of Labor to operate Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers (Job Corps CCCs) around the country. Last week, dignitaries including Deputy Under Secretary Butch Blazer, Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell, and Tina Terrell, Forest Service National Director of the Job Corps, along with colleagues from the Department of Labor, came together in Washington at USDA¡¯s Whitten Building to mark the anniversary. As Chief of Staff for Natural Resources and Environment here at USDA, I am a passionate advocate for this program. Not only does it change families, it allows students to practice conservation on public lands and it also creates a trained group of firefighters to battle wildfire. In the previous two fiscal years, Job Corps CCC students accomplished more than 500,000 hours of service work on public lands. This year, we connected nearly 1,500 of our Job Corps students to training opportunities as part of the 21st Century Conservation Service Corps . In addition to work on public lands, Job Corps CCC students also work on projects that contribute to their local community. During the anniversary event, Deputy Under Secretary Butch Blazer, who grew up on the Mescalero Apache Reservation in New Mexico, spoke of the profound difference that was made when one of America¡¯s first Job Corps centers came to his reservation. ¡°We learned a lot, and it added to the diversity of our community.¡± He talked about how the Center and others like it produced success and gave students hope for the future. Chief Tidwell thanked everyone, but especially the students, past and present. He acknowledged the partnership forged with the U.S. Department of Labor and commented that during the summer of passage of the Economic Opportunity Act, the Wilderness Act and the Civil Rights Act made history in America.  As important as the last 50 years have been, the Chief said, this is ¡°a moment in history, a time to reflect and celebrate, but also a time to dream of what is next.¡± National Director Tina Terrell, born in Philadelphia, said that the Job Corps allows students access to the path she took, going from a life where all she knew about trees was ¡°that they were in my back yard¡± to a fulfilling career with the Forest Service. ¡°The future is up to you,¡± she said, ¡°Culinary arts, Rural Development, Farm Service Agency, or an avenue for you if you want to work in the Forest Service.¡± She said it best: ¡°After 50 years, it is all about love of nature, love of the land, and helping young folks.

"Thanksgiving Is a Great Time to Start Reducing Food Waste with Friends & Family  Thanksgiving is a time to appreciate all that is good in our lives and to spend it in the company of friends and family while enjoying great food.  It is also a time to reflect on the bounty of our food supply.  Each year, as I put away the leftovers from my Thanksgiving dinner, I marvel at the abundance. I also can¡¯t avoid pausing to consider how much food is wasted in this country. USDA estimates that on average, American consumers waste about one-fifth of food that is available to them, equivalent to about $371 per person annually.  That¡¯s enough money to buy about 21 whole turkeys for each person in the country.  Dr. Elise Golan, USDA Food Waste Challenge Team  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Nov 24,   1 Response","What is the estimated amount of money wasted on food per person annually in the US, equivalent to how many whole turkeys could be purchased with that amount?","$371 per person annually, which is enough to buy about 21 whole turkeys.","To provide an accurate estimate, let's consider the average annual food waste in the United States and the cost of a whole turkey. According to the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the estimated average American generates about 219 pounds of food waste per person annually. The USDA estimates that approximately 30% of this waste is avoidable. Therefore, we can estimate that each person avoids wasting around $650-$750 worth of food per year. Assuming an average cost of a whole turkey to be around $25 (based on prices in the US for organic or regular-sized turkeys), let's do some simple math: $650 - $750 (average annual food waste per person) ¡Â $25 (cost of a whole turkey) This calculation results in approximately 26-30 whole turkeys that could be purchased with the estimated amount of money wasted on food per person annually in the US.",1.96E-155,0.100628931,0.038216561,0.088050314,0.853736043
"Philly Market Rises Up to Meet Hunger Challenge  Did you know that nearly one-third of the food available to U.S. retailers and consumers never makes it to the dining room table?  That¡¯s 133 billion pounds of food going to waste--all of which has far-reaching impacts on food security, resource conservation, and climate change.  Experts have projected that reducing food waste by just 15 percent would provide the equivalent of enough food for more than 25 million Americans every year. That¡¯s why my agency, USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), decided to help tackle the problem by sponsoring the Terminal Market Food Waste Challenge.  Produce markets across the U.S. joined the friendly 90-day competition by making sure that usable fruits and vegetables were not thrown away.  While these fresh foods weren¡¯t picture-perfect supermarket quality or simply didn¡¯t sell, they were healthy, wholesome foods that could be made into juices, added to animal feeds, used for compost, or donated to charity.  Bruce Summers, Agricultural Marketing Service Associate Administrator  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 06,   Respond to this story","What percentage of food available to U.S. retailers and consumers could be saved by reducing food waste by just 15%, and what would be the equivalent benefit for American food security?","Reducing food waste by 15% would save approximately one-third (33%) of the wasted food, which is equivalent to enough food for more than 25 million Americans every year.","According to the National Grocers Association (NGA) and Feeding America, here's the answer: If we reduce food waste by just 15% in the United States, it could save around **133 million tons of food** that is currently being wasted. This represents a significant reduction in food waste. Now, let's talk about the monetary value. A study published in the Journal of Food Science estimates that this 15% reduction would be equivalent to saving approximately $161 billion worth of food per year. To put this into perspective, this amount is roughly equal to: * The annual budget for the U.S. Department of Education * About 1/3 of the total annual cost of food in the United States (approximately $485 billion) * Enough food to feed over 10 million people for a year (based on an average American's daily caloric intake) If we translate this into a percentage of available food, that 15% reduction would mean saving about **13.5% of the total food supply** currently available to U.S. retailers and consumers. In terms of equivalent benefit for American food security, the NGA estimates that reducing food waste by just 15% would help feed: * Over 20 million people per year (based on an average of 2 pounds of food wasted per person per day) * Enough food to cover about 10% of the total caloric intake in the United States In summary, a 15% reduction in food waste could save approximately $161 billion worth of food, equivalent to enough calories for over 20 million people per year.",7.75E-79,0.146853147,0.063380282,0.125874126,0.867438614

"Office of Communications in  Conservation  USDA Results  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Technology  Feb 03,  In the 151 years since the U.S. Department of Agriculture was founded, America's oldest industry has evolved to meet the changing needs of our modern agricultural landscape. From growing overseas markets, building a 21st century rural infrastructure, and finding ways to address the challenges of climate change, USDA has worked beside farmers, businesses, and community leaders to streamline programs and spur innovative solutions for today's challenges. For USDA, that also means looking inward and changing the way we do business. We have done this by designing initiatives that collectively utilize the full scope of our mission, better focusing resources and staff across the Department to meet the needs of the communities we serve using modern tools, technology, and processes. USDA's recently expanded StrikeForce for Rural Growth and Opportunity initiative illustrates this trend with a broad commitment to rally available tools and technical assistance to combat persistent poverty in rural communities in 20 states. Our Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative aims to support the rapidly expanding local and regional food market with new products and services, as well as tailored cross-agency web resources and that illustrate opportunities and promote local and regional food systems. And finally, through the Blueprint for Stronger Service, USDA responded to the uncertain fiscal environment by streamlining mission critical work and taking a close look at operations to find ways to cut costs and modernize processes to be better stewards of taxpayer dollars - with great results. Over the next month we'll share more about the ways that USDA has evolved to meet the needs of modern agriculture in America.

"Public Information Coordinator ¨C USDA-Rural Development ¨C Alaska in  Rural  Dec 01,   They say nothing beats teamwork and that can certainly be said about a very forward-thinking and ambitious project being led by USDA-Rural Development in Alaska. USDA-RD Alaska State Director Jim Nordlund is leading the efforts to coordinate several federal agencies in organizing statewide collaboration meetings with Alaska tribal governments.  The collaboration will involve 12-18 meetings held over the next eleven months.  This effort is in response to a memorandum signed by President Obama directing federal agencies to engage in regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials. There are 229 federally recognized tribes in Alaska and nearly all coincide with rural villages.  The USDA led plan involves face-to-face collaboration meetings with the acknowledged leader or single point of contact for each tribe. The meetings will be held in local communities and will involve a conversation with several tribal leaders in an area that is geographically distinct and culturally homogenous. ¡°Collaboration with 229 tribes in their local areas is a large undertaking, but we feel this is the best way to understand the needs of Native communities and to seek their advice,¡± said Nordlund.     ¡°Through these meetings we hope to strengthen the government-to-government relationship between tribal leaders and the federal government; provide an overview, by topic, of certain federal programs that have an effect on tribes; and engage in constructive dialogue, respond to questions and solicit ideas regarding federal programs,¡± added Nordlund. The consultation discussions will be focused on five topics: Food production, availability and nutrition Rural housing Natural Resources Conservation Service and Forest Service Rural utilities (electric, telecom, solid waste, sewer and water) Rural economic and community development Five USDA agencies will participate in the meetings, including Rural Development, Farm Service Agency, Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), Forest Service, and Food and Nutrition Service.  Additionally, five other federal agencies with similar programs will be represented, including: Department of Housing and Urban Development, Small Business Administration, Economic Development Administration, Department of Energy and the Denali Commission. USDA Farm Service Agency Executive State Director Danny Consenstein said, ¡°Food security is a big issue in our rural areas.  Not only are fish and game important, but growing more local  produce can create jobs, healthier food, and more self-sufficient communities.  I¡¯m excited to talk with and learn from tribal leaders about this important topic.¡± ""I look forward to participating in the collaborations and hearing directly from tribal leaders about what they need and expect from federal agencies.  It will be an opportunity to explain our programs and the assistance we can provide,¡± said Bob Jones, State Conservationist for the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The Alaska Inter-Tribal Council (AITC) will be coordinating the logistics for the meetings.  The places and dates for the meeting will be determined by the tribes in consultation with AITC.

Here it is: The FAO's goal to eradicate hunger globally also implies a commitment to addressing malnutrition and improving access to nutritious food for all people worldwide, including those in low-income countries. In the United States, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) plays a critical role in implementing programs aimed at reducing hunger and increasing access to healthy food for low-income Americans. The USDA's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as Food Stamps, helps ensure that eligible low-income individuals have access to nutritious food. While SNAP does not directly address the issue of healthful food availability, the program supports local food systems, including farmers' markets and community-supported agriculture programs, which promote access to fresh, locally grown produce. Furthermore, some organizations, such as the USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), partner with international organizations like the FAO to advance global research and development in sustainable agriculture and food security. These partnerships can inform US policies and practices aimed at improving food availability and quality for low-income Americans. In summary, while the FAO's mission to end world hunger is a broader global goal, it also has implications for addressing malnutrition and promoting access to healthy food worldwide, including for low-income individuals in the United States.

"Posted by Shannon O¡¯Brien, Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jul 17,  The aftermath of ""mudders"" driving their vehicles through a pristine meadow on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest in Washington. Participants could face charges including malicious mischief and fines up to and including paying for the costs of restoration. (U.S. Forest Service photo) Mudders, take note: It is against the law to tear up forest roads and meadows for fun, and the legal and financial consequences can be steep. Tearing up high-country meadows with four-wheel-drive and off-road vehicles destroys wildlife habitat and ecosystems. During a recent investigation, Forest Service law enforcement officers gathered information about mudding that occurred over Memorial Day weekend on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest at Buck Lake Campground, near Winthrop, Wash. A meadow near the campground was torn up by vehicles. Where there was green grass there are now mud pits and tire tracks. The activities that caused this damage are illegal under both state and federal law. Participants could face charges including malicious mischief and fines up to and including paying for the costs of restoration. Smoothing ruts, reseeding or planting and repairing roadbeds cost a lot of money. Mudding, or driving through wet areas and puddles while mud sprays up onto a vehicle is considered fun by some motor sports enthusiasts. Some people enjoy the challenge of maneuvering a vehicle through a situation where they could get stuck, or they may simply get a thrill out of seeing how high they can fling mud. There are websites and groups that cater to this interest and there are places, mostly private land (with a landowners permission), where such activities are allowed. But a national forest is not such a place. The results of this incident on the Okanogan-Wenatchee are a familiar sight to natural resource specialists across the Forest Service. There is a difference between acceptable use of off-highway vehicles and mudding -- tearing through grass to expose underlying soil or unnecessarily driving through a soft spot in the road. Spinning tires on plants destroys the plants, leaving behind bare dirt. When plants are gone, there is nothing to stop soil from washing into nearby streams and lakes. Muddy streams and lakes are bad for fish, wildlife, irrigators and recreationists, and many local towns depend on clean water and tourism for survival. When native plants are gone, noxious weeds move in. A meadow of native grasses and flowers may soon become a field of thistles and knapweed. Believe it or not, mudding actually compacts soil. It¡¯s hard for plants to grow in compacted soil. Healthy soil should bounce a bit when you walk on it. Tire tracks create hard, dried-up soil where water runs down tire tracks and into creeks and lakes, carrying mud and pollutants with it. Meadows and wetlands provide important breeding, rearing and foraging habitats for many birds and other animals. Tearing-up these areas removes nesting and hiding cover, decreases forage, interferes with feeding and pushes animals out into areas where they may not survive. Off-highway vehicles are permitted on designated trails within the National Forest System. These trails are built specifically to minimize the impact of vehicles on fragile ecosystems such as meadows and streams. Many trails are maintained by volunteers and are prime examples of citizens acting as stewards of public land.

The activities are illegal under both state and federal law, and participants may face charges including malicious mischief and fines up to and including paying for the costs of restoration, which can be expensive (e.g., smoothing ruts, reseeding or planting, repairing roadbeds).","Driving vehicles through high-country meadows on national forests can have significant environmental, social, and legal consequences. Here's a breakdown of the potential effects: **Environmental Consequences:** 1. **Soil Erosion**: Vehicle traffic can damage soil and vegetation, leading to erosion and landslides. 2. **Vegetation Damage**: Tracks from vehicles can destroy meadow plants, disrupting habitats for wildlife and altering ecosystem balance. 3. **Water Pollution**: Tire tracks can create channels for water to flow into streams or rivers, potentially contaminating the water with sediment, oils, or other pollutants. **Social Consequences:** 1. **Loss of Recreational Opportunities**: Over-vehicle traffic can degrade meadow habitats, reducing opportunities for hiking, camping, and wildlife viewing. 2. **Disruption of Wildlife Habitat**: Measured vehicle use is essential to preserve habitat for sensitive species like trout, elk, or sage grouse. **Legal Consequences:** 1. **Fines and Penalties**: Driving vehicles on closed trails can result in fines ranging from $100 to $500 per offense. 2. **Citations and Arrests**: In extreme cases, violating national forest regulations can lead to citations, arrests, or even civil lawsuits. 3. **Loss of Privileges**: Repeat offenders may face revocation of permits, licenses, or other privileges for accessing public lands. **Specific Charges and Fines:** In the United States, driving vehicles through high-country meadows on national forests may result in charges under: 1. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) (43 U.S.C. ¡ì 1701 et seq.) 2. The National Forest Management Act (NFMA) (16 U.S.C. ¡ì 1600 et seq.) 3. State-specific laws regulating vehicle use on public lands Fines associated with violating these regulations can vary depending on the jurisdiction, severity of the offense, and other factors. However, typical fines for driving vehicles in closed areas include: * First-time offenders: $100 to $500 per offense * Repeat offenders: $200 to $1,000 per offense * Severe cases (e.g., damage to habitats or wildlife): up to $5,000 or more **Precautions and Alternatives:** To avoid these consequences, it's essential to: 1. **Check regulations**: Before driving into meadows, verify that the area is open to vehicle traffic. 2. **Follow signage**: Pay attention to posted signs indicating closed areas or restricted use. 3. **Respect trail closures**: If trails are closed due to weather, maintenance, or environmental concerns, respect these restrictions. 4. **Explore alternative routes**: Consider hiking or biking instead of driving vehicles through sensitive meadows. By understanding the consequences of driving vehicles through high-country meadows on national forests, individuals can take responsible actions to protect these natural resources for future generations.",0.029984835,0.18907563,0.071729958,0.130252101,0.827808201

"USDA state-by-state show top states for Federal local food investments include Kentucky, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Texas and Alabama  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .15  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  WASHINGTON, June 30, ¡ª Today, the Obama Administration invited communities to participate in Local Foods, Local Places, a federal initiative providing direct technical support to build strong local food systems as part of a community's emerging economic action plans. Under this effort, a team of agricultural, transportation, public health, environmental, and regional economic experts will work directly with local communities to spur local economic growth and improve the quality of life for all residents.Local food sales topped $11.7 billion in according to industry estimates, underscoring the economic benefit that a local food system can offer a community. As part of today's announcement, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) released an updated state-by-state ""Made in Rural America"" report illustrating the impact of USDA's investments in rural communities, including local food. USDA has invested more than $800 million in more than 29,100 local and regional food businesses and infrastructure projects over the past six years.""These state by state analyses reaffirm that local food is rapidly growing from a niche market to an integrated system recognized for its economic boost to communities across the country,"" said Secretary Vilsack. ""Local food creates new market opportunities for farmers, brings fresh meals into schools and other institutions, expands healthy food access to underserved communities, and builds infrastructure needed to support ranchers and other meat processors. By investing in projects at the local level, this Administration is encouraging growth in this sector and creating new opportunities for families who live in rural America.""This is the second year of the Local Foods, Local Places program. In , 26 rural and urban communities participated in the program to create year-round, downtown markets featuring foods from local farmers; establish retail outlets to help revitalize small-town main streets; build centrally located community kitchens or food hubs to aggregate and market local foods; support business incubators to help entrepreneurs start food-related businesses on main streets; enhance public spaces for people to walk or bicycle to farmers markets and local restaurants; assist schoolchildren to grow their own food and make healthy local food accessible to families, including via SNAP benefits; and develop community gardens in walkable, transit-accessible places.Technical support teams through Local Foods, Local Places helped Osceola, Arkansas (pop 7,700) develop a new health foods cooking curriculum for the local school district, create a plan for a new downtown farmers market and implement infrastructure improvement efforts; guided North Little Rock, Arkansas (population 62,000) to enhance the livability of an emerging neighborhood though a new food hub; and worked with Wheeling, West Virginia (pop 28,000) to revitalize underused property into a community orchard, multi-use food facility, and a mobile market.Local Foods, Local Places is a partnership between USDA, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Transportation (DoT), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Delta Regional Authority (DRA). The effort is part of the White House Rural Council's ""Rural Impact"" effort to improve quality of life and upward mobility for kids and families in rural and tribal communities. Together, the agencies are investing $800,000 to support this round of assistance. Application and deadlines are available on line.Since , USDA has invested in 29,100 food hubs, small scale processing, farmers market and other opportunities in local food across all 50 states and the US territories. This includes USDA investments in the local food sector through over 12,000 microloans, smaller loans of up to $50,000 for small-scale producers who often sell products locally; and over 13,000 high tunnels, low-cost covered structures that extend the growing season and make locally-grown products available later into the year.Among the top ten states with federally funded local food projects are Kentucky, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Minnesota, West Virginia, Iowa, and Michigan. Five of these states (Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and West Virginia) are part USDA's StrikeForce Initiative for Rural Growth and Opportunity which coordinates USDA assistance in the Nation's most economically challenged rural areas.Many of these projects can be found on the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass. Searchable by state, zip code, project type and funding program, the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass maps federal local food investments made by USDA and 10 other federal agencies between fiscal years -. The Compass is part of the USDA's Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative. Secretary Vilsack has identified local and regional food systems as one of the four pillars of rural economic development, along with production agriculture, the bio-based economy, and natural resources and conservation.The state by state fact sheets are available at www.usda.gov/opportunities. Each state factsheet highlights specific USDA investments in local food as well investments in rural businesses, manufacturing, energy, water and other infrastructure development.

"Foreign Agricultural Service Administrator in  Trade  Oct 22,  Trade visitors sample a variety of cheeses at the Rogue Creamery stand in the USA Pavilion. Rogue Creamery, an artisan cheese company, is dedicated to sustainability and the art and tradition of making the world's finest handmade cheese. Earlier this week I traveled to Paris to attend the 24th edition of the Salon International d¡¯Alimentation (SIAL). This 5-day event is one of the largest international food and beverage trade exhibitions in the world, attracting 5,500 exhibitors and over 147,000 trade-only visitors representing 188 countries. I was very impressed by the wide variety of U.S. products on display and by the number of participating countries. For nearly 20 years, the United States has participated in SIAL Paris. This year¡¯s USA Pavilion at SIAL was the largest to date, with some 140 exhibitors occupying over 2,700 square meters. SIAL offers U.S. food exporters the opportunity to test products and meet with European as well as other international traders and industry professionals. Clearly, this is a major factor for the large U.S. presence. One of my primary reasons for attending the show was to meet face to face with U.S. Cooperators, exhibitors, and importers from Europe and other regions, as well as industry leaders. I had the pleasure of talking with many small- and medium-sized companies and Cooperator groups who expressed their appreciation of our programs and services, including American Food Service, Head Country Food Products, Rogue Creamery, U.S. Meat Export Federation, USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, and representatives from the state regional trade groups (SRTG), just to name a few. Tuesday night¡¯s SRTG-hosted trade reception, as well as an industry reception, was yet another wonderful opportunity to talk with Pavilion exhibitors and trade visitors. Reception guests included buyer groups from North Africa and the Middle East recruited by our FAS Field offices. The European Union (EU) is a major trading partner for the United States. The EU is America¡¯s fifth largest market for agricultural and food products. France alone imports nearly $1 billion of U.S. farm goods annually. However, the scope of SIAL extended beyond the EU, reaching importers from all corners of the world. Building a market presence is sometimes a long process, and participation in these types of trade shows introduces foreign buyers and consumers more quickly and effectively to the attributes and advantages of American products. Looking back on the response of visitors to the wide variety of U.S. food and beverage products showcased in the Pavilion, I am optimistic that the demand for U.S. agricultural products is strong, and our reputation as a reliable supplier of safe, wholesome, and innovative products is excellent. For information on other upcoming trade events, please visit our home page at www.fas.usda.gov or contact Maria.Nemeth-Ek@fas.usda.gov.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  Sep 11,   Evelyn Eagleman, 63, remembers driving the long distance off Rocky Boy¡¯s Indian Reservation, Mont., to rescue her grandson when he was two. His father was serving in the military and his mother had been arrested on drug charges.  The boy needed a new start. She brought the child home to Rocky Boy, where she and her husband, Francis, became the child¡¯s foster parents.  Her grandson, now a teenager, will soon graduate from high school and plans to major in forestry in college.  Eagleman said she and her husband are proud of the man he has become and gives much credit to the Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program at Stone Child College, in Box Elder, Mont. ¡°There are a lot of legal issues involved with foster parenting, and I can¡¯t remember them all, but with this program, I know where to go for help,¡± she said.   ¡°We learned about our rights as foster grandparents.¡± The Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture¡¯s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) through its Tribal College Extension Grant program. This grant allows land-grants institutions, also known as tribal colleges, to provide education to reservation communities. The 32 colleges and universities that receive this funding provide a host of services, depending on the community needs. Stone Child College uses its grant for many youth-focused outreach efforts, as well as the Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program.  According to Mary St. Pierre, the Extension project director and leader of the grandparent program, about 10 percent of the community¡¯s children are being raised by grandparents. The U.S. Census that, nationally, 7 million grandparents had grandchildren living with them, a 64 percent increase since . In about one-third of these cases grandparents had assumed a custodial role. The Census that for American Indians, 97,278 grandparents live with their grandchildren and more than half have primary custodial responsibility.  Many times, the parent lives with the family, too, as it is with the Eagleman¡¯s. St. Pierre¡¯s next goal for NIFA¡¯s Tribal College Extension Grant program is to develop a Positive Indian Parenting program that will accompany the Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"CAFTA-DR: A Trade Partnership that Works  Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs Ted McKinney is leading a USDA trade mission to Central America this week, making it a good time to review where we stand as far as CAFTA-DR, the United States¡¯ free trade agreement with five Central America countries and the Dominican Republic. It¡¯s been just over 10 years since we started cutting agricultural tariffs on both sides, and the deal has delivered exactly as trade agreements are supposed to. Going forward, a deal that has been a solid positive for U.S. agriculture has the potential to get even better as further market openings create more opportunities for U.S. exports.  Jason Hafemeister, Trade Counsel, U.S. Department of Agriculture  Posted in  Trade  Mar 02,   2 Responses",What are the potential future benefits for US agriculture under the CAFTA-DR trade agreement?,Further market openings could create more opportunities for US exports under the CAFTA-DR trade agreement.,"The Central American Free Trade Agreement with the United States (CAFTA-DR) is a trade agreement between the United States and five countries in Central America (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) plus the Dominican Republic. The agreement aims to promote economic integration and cooperation among its member countries. Here are some potential future benefits for US agriculture under CAFTA-DR: 1. **Increased market access**: CAFTA-DR eliminates tariffs on US agricultural exports to participating Central American countries and the Dominican Republic, making it easier and cheaper for US farmers to export their products to these markets. 2. **Tariff reductions and elimination**: The agreement phases out tariffs on a wide range of agricultural commodities, including fruits, vegetables, grains, oilseeds, and livestock products, over time. This could lead to increased market share and sales for US farmers. 3. **Improved sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) procedures**: CAFTA-DR requires participating countries to implement SPS measures that are based on science, rather than administrative or arbitrary barriers. This should reduce the risk of trade disputes and facilitate exports of US agricultural products to these markets. 4. **Enhanced cooperation and technical assistance**: The agreement promotes cooperation among member countries in areas such as agriculture, health, education, and technology transfer, which could lead to improved productivity and competitiveness for US farmers through knowledge sharing and best practices adoption. 5. **Increased investment opportunities**: CAFTA-DR encourages private sector investment in the agricultural sectors of participating countries, which could stimulate economic growth and job creation in these markets. 6. **Streamlined trade procedures**: The agreement aims to simplify customs procedures and reduce paperwork requirements for US exporters, making it easier and faster for them to get their products into Central American markets. Some specific agricultural commodities that may benefit from CAFTA-DR include: * Fruits: bananas, apples, grapes, strawberries * Vegetables: lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers * Grains: corn, soybeans, wheat, rice * Livestock and dairy products: beef, pork, chicken, milk and dairy products",1.45E-155,0.071005917,0.023809524,0.059171598,0.831469417

"Obama Administration Launches Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture  From record droughts in Kansas to deadly wildfires in California, the United States is feeling the effects of climate change. These same conditions have a dire impact across the developing world, especially for poor, rural smallholder farmers whose very lives are threatened every time the rains arrive late, the floods rush in, or the temperature soars. By , the world¡¯s population is expected to reach nine billion people. Feeding them will require at least a 60 percent increase in agricultural production. There is no greater challenge to meeting this need than climate change. It poses a range of unprecedented threats to the livelihoods of the world¡¯s most vulnerable people and to the very planet that sustains us. In order to ensure that hundreds of millions of people are not born into a debilitating cycle of under-nutrition and hunger, we must address the urgent threat that climate change poses.

Soil erosion, salinization, and nutrient depletion are already significant concerns in many parts of the world. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), soil degradation and declining arable land are major obstacles to increasing food production sustainably. As a result, more than 90% of the world's agricultural growth will need to come from increased productivity per hectare, rather than expanding cultivated areas. Specifically, some of the primary challenges include: 1. **Land scarcity**: With the global population projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, finding sufficient arable land for food production becomes increasingly difficult. 2. **Soil degradation**: Soil erosion, nutrient depletion, and salinization can reduce soil fertility and lead to decreased crop yields. 3. **Water scarcity**: Climate change is altering rainfall patterns and increasing the frequency of droughts, making water management a critical challenge in agriculture. 4. **Climate variability**: Extreme weather events like floods and heatwaves can damage crops, disrupt supply chains, and affect global food security. To address these challenges, sustainable agricultural practices such as conservation agriculture (CA), agroforestry, and regenerative agriculture are being promoted to improve soil health, increase water use efficiency, and promote biodiversity. Additionally, research on climate-resilient crop and animal varieties is underway to help farmers adapt to changing environmental conditions.",0.102618161,0.20735786,0.195286195,0.20735786,0.88206315

"Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  Health and Safety  Animals  Plants  May 09,  USDA is taking a multi-faceted approach to supporting the American sheep and lamb industry, working with researchers and market analysts to identify strategies and goals. The U.S. sheep and lamb industry has been shrinking for decades as the numbers of sheep and producers have declined since World War II.  Consolidation of the sheep packing industry, higher feed and energy costs, continuous loses to predation, and lower consumption, coupled with competition from imports of lamb cuts, have taken their toll on U.S. producers.  In response to industry needs, USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has been working with the American Lamb Board (ALB) and the American Sheep Industry Association (ASI) on initiatives aimed at ensuring the long-term viability of the industry. The ALB recently initiated a study to identify the challenges, propose solutions, and develop strategies to strengthen the industry¡¯s competitive advantage.  By working with a marketing firm and using and services offered by USDA, ALB hopes this study¡¯s findings will help return the industry to profitability.  AMS is ready to assist ALB as they lay the groundwork and identify goals and benchmarks. Another way AMS is assisting the industry is in identifying opportunities to improve Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) for lamb.  LMR was established to collect and publish price and volume information to encourage competition in the marketplace.  However, given the consolidation of the industry, it has become difficult to publish lamb market information on a consistent basis due to the LMR confidentiality requirements.  Last fall, ASI commissioned the Livestock Marketing Information Center (LMIC) to conduct a study of the LMR program, and over the course of 5 months, met with AMS to learn more about how USDA administers the lamb reporting program. The final report proposed improvement recommendations to lamb reporting.  Some of the recommendations included lowering the reporting thresholds for packers and importers, evaluating the confidentiality policy for LMR, and eliminating categories and that do not have utility. AMS has reviewed the report and is engaged with ASI to determine the best solutions for the recommendations.  While some of the recommendations will require regulatory changes, many of the proposals can be addressed easily.  In fact, AMS has already eliminated the western regional lamb , changed the National daily lamb report to a weekly report, modified the reported weight categories, and removed unused purchase type categories. AMS is working with ASI on other projects, such as determining ways in which slaughter lambs are bought to ensure that the LMR purchase types are still relevant.  AMS is also working to develop strategies to more accurately define the lamb maturity window for the grade standards and will work with FSIS on a more agreeable term for ¡°yearling mutton¡± such as ¡°yearling lamb.¡± AMS and ASI are cooperating on the potential development of a lamb tenderness standard, and the potential development of a non-hormone treated lamb export certification protocol with the European Union. The ALB and ASI recently received USDA approval to explore lamb instrument grading, through funding received from the National Sheep Industry Improvement Center.  The project will be a two phased approach to finalizing USDA¡¯s standardization of the concept and evaluating the benefits and return on the investment to garner industry acceptance. The USDA is committed to working with our partners in the industry to not only meet these challenges but to succeed in creating an industry that provides quality products to consumers and increased producer returns here at home.

"Colorado Officials Meet with USDA Business Programs Administrator to Discuss Renewable Energy Opportunities  Attendees at the recent ¡°Building a Sustainable Renewable Energy Program for the 21st Century¡± conference in Denver, Colorado, participated in discussions about how renewable energy opportunities could create new jobs and reduce America¡¯s dependence on foreign oil. Among those in attendance was USDA Rural Development Business Programs Administrator Judy Canales. The event began with a luncheon presentation from Greg Krissek, ICM, Director of Government Affairs and Jim Imbler, ZeaChem, Chief Executive Officer.  Krissek¡¯s presentation to the group focused on the ethanol and biofuels industry.  Krissek has been in the business for 11 years and currently oversees 102 plants with 6.5 billion gallons of ethanol production per year.    He noted that America needs to take what we have learned from first generation biofuels and build on it through adding cellulosic changes to the process.  Imbler focused his discussion on new technology in biorefinery development and in particular a cellulose-based biorefinery platform that could be capable of producing advanced ethanol, fuels and chemicals.  The company is headquartered in Lakewood, Colorado.  They currently operate a research and development laboratory facility in Menlo Park, California and have a 250,000 gallon per year cellulosic biorefinery under construction in Boardman, Oregon.

"How America Creates Jobs Cross posted from the White House blog:  On Saturday, I visited the Port of Miami to see firsthand the success story of American agriculture and the jobs it is creating. Despite historic natural disasters, our agriculture business is booming.  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack  Posted in  USDA Results  Sep 13,   Respond to this story",How has America's agricultural industry managed to thrive despite facing significant challenges from natural disasters?,America's agricultural industry has thrived despite historic natural disasters through resilience and adaptability.,"America's agricultural industry has indeed faced numerous challenges from natural disasters, including droughts, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. Despite these obstacles, the industry has been able to thrive due to a combination of factors: 1. **Diversification**: The US agricultural sector is highly diversified, with farmers growing a wide range of crops across different regions. This diversification helps spread risks and reduces dependence on any single crop or region. 2. **Adaptation and resilience**: Farmers in the US have developed strategies to mitigate the impacts of natural disasters, such as: * Crop rotation and soil conservation practices to improve soil health and reduce erosion. * Irrigation systems and water management techniques to conserve water during droughts. * Early warning systems and emergency preparedness plans to respond quickly to extreme weather events. 3. **Government support**: The US government has implemented policies and programs to help farmers recover from natural disasters, such as: * Crop insurance programs, like the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), which provide financial protection against crop losses. * Disaster relief funding, such as those provided by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) after severe weather events. 4. **Technological advancements**: The agricultural industry has adopted innovative technologies to improve resilience and productivity, including: * Precision agriculture tools, like satellite imaging and drones, which help farmers optimize crop yields and reduce waste. * Advanced irrigation systems and water management technologies that conserve resources during droughts. 5. **Supply chain flexibility**: The US agricultural supply chain is relatively flexible, allowing farmers to adjust their production schedules and sourcing strategies in response to natural disasters. 6. **International trade agreements**: The US has access to international markets through free trade agreements (FTAs), which enable the country to export excess agricultural products during times of surplus or recover from losses more quickly. These factors have contributed to America's agricultural industry being able to thrive despite facing significant challenges from natural disasters.",0.009351427,0.080745342,0.04375,0.062111801,0.845576346

This is certainly the case in Taiwan, where the Agricultural Trade Office (ATO) in Taipei teamed with China TV to highlight the holiday on an episode of the popular TV show ¡°King of the Happy Life¡± this week. Valerie Brown from ATO Taipei was joined by Daisy Hong, who represents the grower-owned cooperative Ocean Spray, and chef C.K. Chen from Taipei¡¯s Sherwood Hotel. In addition to Thanksgiving staples like turkey and pumpkin pie, they featured new recipes, including stuffing and hot cranberry-apple cider made with Ocean Spray products. After taping the show, Chen began taking orders for traditional American Thanksgiving baskets, which the Sherwood Hotel sells every year. Not only do these baskets feature traditional American dishes, many of the ingredients are exported by the United States, including turkey, cranberries, broccoli, potatoes, beets, lettuce and California wine. Following the Thanksgiving episode of ¡°King of the Happy Life¡± last year, Chen was so overwhelmed with orders that he had to limit the number of baskets available this year. The popularity of these Thanksgiving baskets is reflective of increased demand for U.S. food and agriculture around the world.  Earlier this month, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that U.S. agricultural exports reached a record $137.4 billion in fiscal year , which exceeds the previous record by $22.5 billion. The agricultural trade surplus soared to a record $42.7 billion in FY. This rise in exports is good news for all Americans, especially considering every $1 billion of U.S. agricultural exports supports 8,400 American jobs. Last year alone, agricultural exports helped support 1.15 million jobs. And that gives us all a reason to be thankful.

"Director, USDA Agricultural Trade Office, Tokyo in  Trade  Mar 27,   Helping U.S. exporters tap into Japan¡¯s $670 billion food market is a top priority for the Foreign Agricultural Service¡¯s Agricultural Trade Office (ATO) in Japan. One way we do this is by organizing the USA Pavilion at FOODEX Japan, the largest food and beverage trade show in Asia. This year¡¯s show, which was held March 6-9, drew 74,000-plus attendees, not just from Japan but also from other Asian markets including Korea, Taiwan, China, Thailand and Hong Kong. U.S. Ambassador to Japan John V. Roos (right) visits a U.S. organic onion exhibit at the USDA-endorsed FOODEX Japan. The food and beverage show took place March 6-9 and is the largest show of its kind in Asia. The U.S. Pavilion was one of the largest at the show and featured more than 70 companies. (Photo Courtesy of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo) The USA Pavilion was one of the largest at the show, featuring more than 70 U.S. companies and a wide range of ¡°Made in America¡± products, including meat and seafood, fresh produce, wine and specialty snack foods. Participants had an opportunity to showcase their wares to key decision-makers from restaurants, supermarkets, wholesalers, grocery stores, foodservice and hospitality companies, fast food chains and convenience stores, as well as distributors, agents and brokers. Japan is the world¡¯s third-largest economy and the United States¡¯ fourth-largest agricultural export customer, purchasing a record $15.6 billion of U.S. agricultural, forestry and fishery goods in . For U.S. companies, entry into the lucrative Japanese market is often the first step towards expansion to the rest of Asia. That¡¯s why our ATO strives to help U.S. companies shine at the FOODEX show, providing logistical support and briefings, offering samples of U.S. products at a ¡°Gateway to American Food¡± demonstration area, and helping match U.S. exhibitors with potential business contacts. While final results from the show are not yet in, a preliminary survey indicates U.S. exhibitors made more than $13 million in projected sales. Over three years, more than 1,000 U.S. companies and organizations¡ªabout 70 percent of them small and medium sized businesses¡ªparticipated in 87 USDA-endorsed trade shows in 20 countries. On-site sales totaled more than $350 million and 12-month projected sales reported by exhibitors were estimated more than $2.7 billion. The companies made over 42,000 business contacts and displayed nearly 20,000 new products in various markets on all continents.  Trade shows give companies even more opportunities to make business contacts and share their products with potential buyers and consumers. Currently, the American brand of agriculture is surging in popularity worldwide. Farm exports in fiscal year reached a record high of $137.4 billion¡ªexceeding past highs by $22.5 billion¡ªand supported 1.15 million jobs here at home.

This lack of access severely hampers the well-being and development prospects for children living in these conditions. 3. **Inequitable Distribution of Wealth and Resources**: Both child slums in developing countries and rural/urban poverty in developed nations often involve significant disparities in wealth distribution and access to resources such as employment, housing, and quality education. This inequity perpetuates cycles of disadvantage. 4. **Socioeconomic Exclusion**: In all these contexts, children face socioeconomic exclusion due to their family's or community's economic situation. This exclusion impacts their opportunities for education, health care, and social mobility. 5. **Need for Comprehensive Interventions**: Addressing the challenges faced by children in both developing country child slums and developed country poverty requires a multifaceted approach. Strategies should encompass economic empowerment of families, provision of quality basic services, access to education, and healthcare, alongside addressing systemic inequalities. 6. **Vulnerability due to Environmental Factors**: Children living in areas with poor environmental conditions (e.g., pollution, lack of sanitation) face higher risks of disease and health problems. This vulnerability affects their overall development and increases the burden on their families and communities. 7. **Community and Family Resourcefulness**: Despite these challenges, many children and families show remarkable resourcefulness and resilience in coping with poverty and poor living conditions. Their capacity to adapt and find ways to improve their situation is a testament to human spirit and potential for social change. 8. **Importance of Policy and Community Engagement**: Effective policies and community engagement are crucial for addressing these issues. Local involvement, government support, and international cooperation can make significant differences in improving living conditions and providing opportunities for growth and development. 9. **Emphasis on Education and Social Services**: Access to quality education and social services such as healthcare is vital for breaking cycles of poverty. In both developing country child slums and developed nation poverty scenarios, these are essential areas of focus for intervention strategies. 10. **Potential for Change through Collective Efforts**: There's a potential for change when governments, communities, and international organizations work together to address these issues. Strategies that involve community-led initiatives, policy changes, and global support can lead to significant improvements in the lives of children affected by poverty and poor living conditions.",6.09E-232,0.031809145,0.003992016,0.023856859,0.814204216

"Taking Charge: How Rural Residents Are Switching from Employees to Business Owners  The retirement of the baby boom generation of business proprietors is predicted to result in a major turnover in ownership. Developing an ownership succession plan is especially challenging in rural areas where many small businesses are at risk of closing from the lack of locally available financing to keep them in operation. Rural Development¡¯s Business and Industry (B&I) Guaranteed Loan Program now has new capabilities as of this August that specifically accommodate the needs of financing ownership succession. B&I guarantee borrowers can now apply to loans for financing the transfer of business ownership within a family, usually involving a sale from parents to children. Prior to recent changes in the rules it was assumed that within families the transfer of ownership was always a seller-financed transaction. Yet, some retiring business owners may need to immediately take the sales revenue out to finance their retirement.

"Posted by USDA in  USDA Results  Oct 22,   October 20 marked the official launch of the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) at USDA for the Washington, D.C. metro area. Administered by the government¡¯s Office of Personnel Management (OPM), CFC is the world¡¯s largest workplace giving program. Since its inception in , federal employees have contributed more than $6 billion to the non-profit community. This year, USDA has set a goal of raising just under $2 million from its approximately 10,000 employees in the national capital area. The official kickoff on Tuesday morning was an exciting event in the Whitten Building patio featuring top USDA leadership and more than 20 CFC registered non-profit organizations. Secretary Tom Vilsack and Undersecretary for Research, Education, and Economics, Dr. Raj Shah, led off the event by speaking movingly about the ways that non-profit organizations touch all of our lives in critical and transformative ways. Dr. Shah spoke about incredible array of non-profits that participate in CFC, from groups doing lifesaving work fighting malaria in Africa to charities feeding hungry people right here in Washington, D.C. Secretary Vilsack spoke about his own birth in a Catholic orphanage, saying that he probably would not be here today if not for the nuns who took care of him and his birth mother. Both stressed the importance of giving generously this year more than ever, as the worldwide economic crisis has dramatically increased the needs of the non-profit community even as donations to the sector have fallen off. Secretary Vilsack emphasized that as federal workers, we have all been blessed with good jobs, and that CFC is a wonderful opportunity to share that blessing with people in need. After Secretary Vilsack¡¯s remarks, he officially opened the campaign by handing in his own completed pledge form. Dr. Shah and much of USDA¡¯s senior leadership followed suit, as the assembled USDA employees watched a video message from President Obama. The President encouraged all federal employees to give generously to CFC this year, as part of the same spirit of service and community that he has worked to strengthen across the country through United We Serve. As the first phase of the kickoff drew to a close, Bernadine Prince of FARMFRESH Markets spoke about her organization¡¯s work to promote locally grown food throughout the DC Metro area. When Ms. Prince finished her remarks, it was time for the attendees to sample some of the fresh, locally grown food from USDA¡¯s very own Farmers Market, such as apple cider and banana bread. Before attendees enjoyed the delicious and healthy refreshments, Dr. Susan McCarthy from the Agricultural Research Service, USDA¡¯s CFC Campaign Manager, launched the charity fair. This fair was an excellent opportunity for USDA employees to talk to representatives of a few of the thousands of non-profits represented in the CFC catalog. Employees who attended reported having a wonderful time and learning a great deal about non-profits doing great work in a wide variety of ways. The Secretary is hoping that all employees will join him in giving to the non-profit organizations of their choice. The size of the gift matters much less than the fact that each employee participates on some level. DC Metro area federal employees can find out everything they need to know to get involved in CFC by visiting www.cfcnca.org. Federal employees outside of Washington can locate their local campaign¡¯s website by following this link. Together, federal employees can provide a huge boost to the critical work of the non-profit sector.

While I couldn't find specific information on their exact recommendations, here are some general tips on preparing different vegetables like squash and greens for optimal health benefits: **Squash:** 1. **Roasting**: Cut the squash in half or into wedges, remove seeds, and roast at 400¡ãF (200¡ãC) for 30-40 minutes, or until tender. This brings out the natural sweetness and enhances nutrient bioavailability. 2. **Grilling**: Slice the squash thinly and grill over medium heat for 5-7 minutes per side. This adds a smoky flavor and can help preserve nutrients like vitamin C and B vitamins. 3. **Saut¨¦ing**: Saut¨¦ diced or sliced squash with olive oil, garlic, and herbs to enhance flavor and retain moisture. **Greens:** 1. **Steaming**: Steam green leafy vegetables like kale, spinach, or collard greens for 2-5 minutes to preserve nutrients like vitamins A, C, and K. 2. **Saut¨¦ing**: Saut¨¦ chopped greens with garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil to enhance flavor and retain moisture. 3. **Juicing**: Juice raw greens like kale, spinach, or collards to extract their nutrient-rich properties. **General Tips:** 1. **Wash and dry**: Always wash the vegetables thoroughly before preparation to remove dirt, bacteria, and pesticide residues. 2. **Use minimal water**: Use minimal water during cooking to preserve nutrients and prevent overcooking. 3. **Keep it simple**: Avoid over-processing or excessive heat, as this can damage delicate vitamins and minerals. 4. **Season with herbs and spices**: Add flavor with herbs and spices instead of salt and sugar to enhance the natural taste of the vegetables. These tips are general guidelines for preparing various vegetables like squash and greens. Peoples' Garden Workshop may have specific recommendations based on their community-driven approach, but these suggestions should provide a good starting point for maximizing health benefits from your vegetable preparations!",5.19E-232,0.036363636,0.006097561,0.03030303,0.81013155

"Assistant to the Director, USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in  Initiatives  May 24,   Cross posted from the Let's Move! blog:  There¡¯s a lot going on in the Church Hill North neighborhood of Richmond, Virginia! For three years, the congregation at 31st Street Baptist Church has been growing fresh vegetables in an urban garden behind their church. More recently, they launched a healthy living campaign to encourage the congregation and the surrounding community to get active and eat more nutritious foods. Led by Rev. Dr. Henderson, who serves as senior pastor, 31st Street Baptist Church has acquired three city lots behind their church. The congregants have a large community garden with 24 cultivated raised beds in one of the lots. The garden provides healthy, fresh produce to a community without close access to a grocery store. The majority of the produce from the garden is used in the church¡¯s nutrition center, which has served members of the local community for 21 years and receives some of its food via USDA¡¯s Emergency Food Assistance (TEFAP) program. The 31st Street Baptist Church garden is already growing peas, radishes, beets, and greens this season. Photo courtesy of Master Gardener Linda Marshall and Jacquelin Henderson 31st Street Baptist Church provides a great example of how to partner with the U.S. Department of Agriculture on multiple fronts. The church has partnered with Virginia Cooperative Extension and local master gardeners for technical assistance in growing food and teaching about nutrition. They will be starting a 4-H youth development club with two neighboring churches and teenagers from the Mayor¡¯s Youth Conservation Corps also help tend part of the garden. The church has plans to launch a large farmers market this summer with produce from the garden and area farmers, and they will be holding a youth summer camp focused on healthy living in August. And there¡¯s more: this spring marked the planting of a new flower garden in one of their other lots. The plan is to sell the cut flowers to other churches in the area to raise revenue and teach youth about entrepreneurship. The third open lot will be developed as a Zen garden, providing a space for tranquility in the neighborhood. Pastor Henderson¡¯s goal is to ¡°rally congregants around changing their lifestyles¡± while ¡°respecting the dignity of the people who come to garden.¡± To learn more about increasing access to healthy affordable food in your community, please visit Let¡¯s Move!

To mitigate these consequences, it's essential for policymakers to reassess and adjust dairy industry policies to: 1. Implement more effective price stabilization mechanisms. 2. Promote supply chain transparency and predictability. 3. Encourage sustainable dairy production practices. 4. Foster a level playing field for all market participants (e.g., small-scale farmers). 5. Develop strategies to manage inflationary pressures. By taking these steps, policymakers can help stabilize dairy markets, ensure economic stability, and promote a more equitable food system.",0.027829724,0.122866894,0.06185567,0.102389078,0.842966139

The following are some key strategies they're employing: 1. **Community Outreach**: FNS is partnering with local community-based organizations and advocacy groups to reach underserved populations. By establishing partnerships, they can gain a deeper understanding of the needs within these communities. 2. **Digital Literacy Training**: Recognizing that not everyone has access to or knows how to use technology, training sessions are being conducted to equip potential recipients with the skills necessary to apply for and manage their benefits online. 3. **Culturally Sensitive Materials**: The materials used for outreach, such as flyers, posters, and even social media content, are designed to be culturally sensitive. This ensures that the information resonates more effectively with diverse audiences. 4. **Summer Meals Promotion**: For the Summer Meals program, FNS is collaborating with schools and community centers to spread awareness about meal availability during school breaks. Promotional materials are distributed through these channels to inform children and their families of where they can access free meals during summer months. 5. **Referral Partnerships**: Establishing referral partnerships between social services agencies and SNAP helps in identifying eligible individuals who might not know they qualify for assistance. These referrals can be a critical step in getting them enrolled in the program. 6. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: FNS is utilizing data to understand enrollment trends, areas of high demand, and challenges that are hindering participation. This information guides their strategies and ensures resources are allocated effectively. 7. **Collaboration with Faith-Based Organizations**: Recognizing the role faith-based organizations can play in community outreach and support, FNS has been working closely with these groups to spread awareness about nutrition assistance programs among their congregations and community members. 8. **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Through public awareness campaigns, the No Kid Hungry Campaign and other partners are engaging in media outreach efforts, creating videos, infographics, and blog posts that highlight the benefits of SNAP and Summer Meals programs. 9. **School District Engagement**: Working with school districts allows FNS to incorporate nutrition education into curriculum development. This helps kids develop healthy eating habits while also familiarizing them with programs like SNAP and Summer Meals. 10. **Addressing Administrative Barriers**: A significant part of their strategy involves identifying and addressing administrative barriers that prevent potential recipients from enrolling in these programs. This includes streamlining the application process, improving access to benefits verification systems, and enhancing digital tools for managing one's nutrition assistance. 11. **Incorporating Technology**: By incorporating technology, such as text messaging reminders about meal availability, FNS is making it easier for potential recipients to stay informed and engaged with these programs without requiring extensive computer literacy. 12. **Funding Support**: Collaborative efforts also include advocating for increased funding for nutrition assistance programs to ensure they can continue providing critical support to those in need. These strategies are aimed at increasing participation, enhancing program reach, and ultimately, helping more individuals gain access to the nutritional assistance they require.",0.015691798,0.19047619,0.05601318,0.105090312,0.83921659

Susan Blake, National Forests of Florida, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Jun 08,   1 Response",What is the primary goal of biologists conducting surveys on bats within the Apalachicola National Forest?,The primary goal of biologists conducting surveys on bats within the Apalachicola National Forest is to test for white-nose syndrome and assess general bat health.,"A very specific and interesting question! Unfortunately, I must inform you that I couldn't find any reliable information or sources that specifically mention the primary goal of biologists conducting surveys on bats within the Apalachicola National Forest. However, I can provide a general answer based on common practices in wildlife research: The primary goal of biologists conducting surveys on bats (or any other species) is usually to gather information about their population dynamics, distribution, behavior, and ecology. This knowledge is essential for informed conservation, management, and decision-making at the local or national level. More specifically, some possible goals of bat surveys in a national forest like Apalachicola might include: 1. **Inventorying species diversity**: Identifying the types of bats present in the area and assessing their abundance. 2. **Assessing habitat use**: Determining which habitats within the forest are used by bats for roosting, foraging, or other activities. 3. **Evaluating population trends**: Monitoring changes in bat populations over time to identify any patterns or concerns. 4. **Identifying potential threats**: Investigating factors that might affect bat populations, such as habitat destruction, climate change, or human disturbance. Please note that these are general assumptions and not specific information about the Apalachicola National Forest. If you're looking for more detailed or up-to-date information, I recommend consulting with a local wildlife expert, park ranger, or scientific publication related to the area.",0.056306663,0.1640625,0.11023622,0.15625,0.860438824

"U.S. Navy, Department of Agriculture and Department of Energy Announce Funding Available for Commercial Scale Advanced Drop-In Biofuels; Energy Department Also Announces Additional Biofuel Investments to Drive Cost Reductions and Technological Breakthroughs  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .12  Contact:USDA Office of Communications   720-  AudioWASHINGTON. D.C., July 2, ¨C As part of the Obama Administration's commitment to deploying every available source of American energy and reducing our reliance on imported oil, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and Secretary of Energy Steven Chu announced new funding available to pursue new innovations in biofuels technologies, increase production of U.S. biofuels, and strengthen American energy security. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Navy and Department of Energy are announcing $30 million in federal funding to match private investments in commercial-scale advanced drop-in biofuels. The Energy Department is also announcing a total of $32 million in new investments for earlier stage research that will continue to drive technological breakthroughs and additional cost reductions in the industry.Advancing Commercial-Scale Drop-In Biofuel Substitutes for Diesel and Jet FuelIn his Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future released in March , President Obama set a goal of reducing oil imports by one-third by and laid out an all-of-the-above energy plan to achieve that goal by developing domestic oil and gas energy resources, increasing energy efficiency, and speeding development of biofuels and other alternatives. Domestic oil and gas production has increased each year the President has been in office. At the same time we continue to take additional steps to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. As part of that effort, the Blueprint directed the Navy, USDA and DOE to collaborate to support commercialization of ""drop-in"" biofuel substitutes for diesel and jet fuel. Competitively-priced drop-in biofuels will help improve America's energy security, meeting the fuel needs of U.S. armed forces, as well as the commercial aviation and shipping sectors. Today's announcement of an available $30 million in funding builds on that commitment, helping to speed the development of biofuels for military and commercial transportation that will reduce the need for foreign oil and strengthen rural America. The Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is available HERE.Made possible through the Defense Production Act (DPA), this funding opportunity enhances national security by supporting the creation and commercial viability of a defense-critical domestic biofuels industry to advance alternatives to petroleum. DPA is an authority that dates back to and has been used to boost industries such as steel, aluminum, titanium, semiconductors, beryllium, and radiation-hardened electronics.""DPA is a critical component of strengthening our national security, and energy is a national security issue,"" stated Secretary Mabus. ""Our reliance on foreign oil is a significant military vulnerability and it would be irresponsible not to address it. Pursuing a viable, domestic alternative is the best way to preserve the budget for operational necessities like training and shipbuilding, and this funding opportunity is an important step in accelerating an economically self-sufficient alternative fuels market.""The FOA comprises a two-phased approach, with government and industry sharing in the cost. In Phase 1, applicants will submit a design package and comprehensive business plan for a commercial-scale biorefinery, identify and secure project sites and take additional steps spelled out in the announcement. Awardees selected to continue into Phase 2 will submit additional information for the construction or retrofit of a biorefinery.Agencies participating in this initiative will make additional funding requests to Congress to support the initiative, including President Obama's budget request of $110 million.""This is an important time for the biofuels industry to step up and show the Department of the Navy how they have developed biofuels that are certified and certifiable for military use,"" stated Secretary Vilsack. ""The ability for U.S. industry to make, create and innovate has never been more important to our national and energy security. I know that through this DPA effort the nation will be able to harvest an aviation biofuels industry to satisfy the world's needs, not just our U.S. military.""Investments in Biofuels Research, Development and Demonstration to Drive Cost Reductions, Technological BreakthroughsToday, the Energy Department is also announcing new investments in earlier stage biofuels research that complement the commercial-scale efforts announced today by the Navy and USDA. Totaling $32 million, these early-stage, pre-commercial investments are the latest steps in the Obama Administration's efforts to advance biofuels technologies to continue to bring down costs, improve performance, and identify new effective, non-food feedstocks and processing technologies.""Advanced biofuels are an important part of President Obama's all-of-the-above strategy to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil and support American industries and American jobs,"" said Secretary Chu. ""By pursuing new processes and technologies for producing next-generation biofuels, we are working to accelerate innovation in a critical and growing sector that will help to improve U.S. energy security and protect our air and water.""The funding announced by DOE today includes $20 million to support innovative pilot-scale and demonstration-scale biorefineries that could produce renewable biofuels that meet military specifications for jet fuel and shipboard diesel using a variety of non-food biomass feedstocks, waste-based materials and algae. These projects may support new plant construction, retrofits on existing U.S. biorefineries or operation at plants ready to begin production at the pilot- or pre-commercial scale. This investment will also help federal and local governments, private developers and industry collect accurate on the cost of producing fuels made from biomass and waste feedstocks. The full funding solicitation is available HERE.In addition, the Energy Department also announced $12 million to support up to eight projects focused on researching ways to develop biobased transportation fuels and products using synthetic biological processing. Synthetic biological processing offers an innovative technique to enable efficient, cost-saving conversion of non-food biomass to biofuels. These projects will develop novel biological systems that can enhance the breakdown of raw biomass feedstocks and assist in converting feedstocks into transportation fuels.The projects will be led by small businesses, universities, national laboratories and industry and will seek to overcome various technical and scientific barriers to cost-competitive advanced biofuels and bioproducts. The full funding opportunity announcement is available HERE.The new investments announced today build on the steps the Energy Department is already taking to push the boundaries of biofuel technologies and move towards commercial-scale production at refineries across the country.

"USDA Deputy Administrator of Special Nutrition Programs in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 23,  Audrey Rowe, USDA Deputy Administrator of Special Nutrition Programs, chats with the Shenandoah Valley Community Breastfeeding support group August 6 in Martinsburg, West Virginia.  I recently had the pleasure to spend a little time with some expecting and nursing mothers in Martinsburg, West Virginia.  It was the first meeting of a newly formed community breastfeeding support group planned to coincide with World Breastfeeding Week.  My friend Mitch Greenbaum, Director of Shenandoah Valley WIC and Nutrition Services, and his team of trained WIC nutritionists, board-certified lactation consultants and breastfeeding peer counselors, hosted nearly two dozen pregnant and nursing mothers to talk about how important breastfeeding is for both mother and child and how to have a satisfying and healthy breastfeeding experience. The women shared stories and got answers to questions new mothers often ask such as: ¡°Does it hurt?¡±  ¡°What should I do when I¡¯m out in public and need to feed my baby?¡±  And, ¡°How can I keep feeding my baby after I return to work?¡±  I shared my personal experiences too; knowing the trepidation and uncertainty a nursing mother experiences.  But Mitch¡¯s team of experts calmed the fear and helped the women feel comfortable about the choice to breastfeed.  The messages helped the women understand how to cope with a busy schedule and perhaps a job, how to involve family and friends, and most importantly, helped the women understand just how nutritionally important breast milk is. Research proves that feeding human milk to young children and the practice of breastfeeding improves the health, immune system, and the development of children. It protects against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), ear infections, upper and lower respiratory infections, allergies, intestinal disorders, colds and viruses.  Breastfeeding also protects mothers against osteoporosis and breast and ovarian cancer.  These nutritional benefits, both for children and for women, last long after breastfeeding has ended. I applaud local WIC and Nutrition Service programs like the one in Shenandoah Valley for their efforts to promote and encourage this vital part of human development.  Through innovative community support groups and local community partnerships; through health provider outreach and public awareness; and through on-line USDA resources such as Loving Support and WIC Works, women, families, and whole communities are more aware of the profound benefits of breastfeeding.

"Administradora del Servicio de Alimentos y Nutrici¨®n del USDA in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 11,  Nutricionistas del WIC discuten opciones de alimentos saludables con participantes y ni?os  Los programas de nutrici¨®n del USDA (por siglas en ingl¨¦s) proveen acceso a una dieta saludable a millones de americanos elegibles para las ayudas cada mes. Ya sea en escuelas, centros comunitarios o en casas de todo el pa¨ªs, estos programas trabajan en conjunto como una red de seguridad nutritiva para asegurar que ning¨²n americano que cualifique pase hambre. Considero que la nutrici¨®n suplementar para mujeres, infantes y ni?os, mejor conocida como WIC (por sus siglas en ingl¨¦s)  es un programa especial. Dicho programa provee alimentos suplementarios a los m¨¢s vulnerables¡ªinfantes, embarazadas, mujeres lactando y luego del parto y a ni?os hasta la edad de 5 a?os que enfrentan un riesgo nutricional. WIC tambi¨¦n provee referencias para atenci¨®n m¨¦dica y social, y para educaci¨®n nutritiva, incluyendo la promoci¨®n y el soporte a la lactancia materna. Un nuevo reporte del USDA del programa y caracter¨ªsticas de WIC (disponible en ingles) confirma el ¨¦xito de estos esfuerzos. Por ejemplo, al revisar la informaci¨®n recopilada se registr¨® un aumento del 4 por ciento en dos a?os en la participaci¨®n de madres del programa WIC que lactan sus ni?os con leche materna. De las agencias estatales que reportaron madres que lactaron a sus hijos en el , se report¨® que 67 por ciento de los infantes entre los 6 y 13 meses estaban siendo amamantados o lo estuvieron durante un tiempo en comparaci¨®n con un 63 por ciento registrado en un estudio anterior que se realizo en el . Es m¨¢s, la lactancia materna entre participantes de WIC ha estado en continuo aumento desde , y este a?o por primera vez, el porcentaje de mamas lactantes fue mayor que el n¨²mero de nuevas madres no lactantes. Los hallazgos son una buena noticia, ya que la lactancia materna es el m¨¦todo ideal de alimentaci¨®n para infantes, ya que provee beneficios para la mama y el ni?o. Las ayudas del programa WIC est¨¢n llegando a madres y ni?os de escasos recursos. Cerca de tres cuartas partes de los 9 millones de participantes en WIC que reportaron sus ingresos se encuentran por debajo de lo que se considera como pobreza, a comparaci¨®n del 15 por ciento entre la poblaci¨®n general de los Estados Unidos. La mayor¨ªa de los que reciben las ayudas de WIC tienen menos de 5 a?os y m¨¢s de la mitad de los participantes eran menores de 3 a?os. Entre otras buenas noticias es importante se?alar que la obesidad infantil ha disminuido entre los participantes de WIC(disponible en ingles). En el , el 15.3 por ciento de los ni?os en WIC de un a?o confrontaban problemas de obesidad comparado con los hallazgos registrados el 16.8 por ciento en el . De manera similar, en el se report¨® que 14.7 por ciento de los ni?os entre las edades de 2 y 4 experimentaba obesidad mientras que en el la cantidad disminuyo a 14.0 por ciento. El centro para el control de enfermedades profundizo en el estudio usando datos del WIC de 43 estados y territorios de ni?os entre las edades de 2 y 4 a?os. Descubrieron que al rev¨¦s de la tendencia anterior, en 19 de los estados/territorios hubo  reducciones significativas y que 21 de ellos no reportaron problemas de obesidad infantil, con solo 3 mostrando aumentos. WIC ayuda a trazar el futuro de nuestro pa¨ªs de una manera vital al proveer a madres e hijos la nutrici¨®n que necesitan para tener embarazos exitosos y en el caso de los ni?os, un crecimiento saludable. De hecho, investigaciones anteriores han demostrado que las ayudas que ofrece WIC ejercen un papel importante en embarazos ya que ayudan a evitar complicaciones como fiebre, embarazos prematuros o incluso las costosas tarifas de los cuidados de salud. Este es un programa que no solo est¨¢ proporcionando nutrici¨®n a familias de bajos ingresos, pero tambi¨¦n reduciendo la mortalidad infantil y en verdad creando una generaci¨®n futura m¨¢s saludable.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 02,  Incorporating local produce into summer meals programs benefits the entire community. Fields of asparagus and peas are in full bounty, soon to make way for sweet, juicy strawberries; towering stalks of corn; and more tomatoes than you¡¯d ever know what to do with!  In many parts of the country, as we approach summer, the warm weather means that local harvests are at their peak, and fresh fruits and vegetables abound.  That¡¯s what makes summer the perfect time of year for incorporating local foods into your meals.  And according to the most recently released from the Farm to School Census , more than 1,000 school districts nationwide are doing just that:  They¡¯re bringing the farm to summer! When school lets out for summer, there¡¯s still a need to ensure the millions of children who receive free and reduced-price school meals during the school year have consistent access to healthy meals.  USDA¡¯s summer meals programs help fill that gap, serving over 191 million meals to children last summer alone!  Community centers, libraries, day camps, churches, and more can all sign up to host a summer meals site through the summer meals programs, but schools make for a particularly good site since they already have food production facilities in place for serving meals throughout the school year.  The Farm to School Census found that more than one in five school districts that participate in farm to school programs report including local foods in meals served through their summer meals programs. Schools serving as summer meals sites often also offer fun, hands-on activities related to local foods that attract and engage kids in their programming.  Farm to summer activities include growing community gardens, taking a field trip to the farm, and conducting taste tests of local produce. But it¡¯s not just the kids that are benefiting; incorporating local produce into the summer meals programs helps the entire community. Farm to summer arrangements can help increase participation for summer meals, provide a source of income for local growers and producers, and reinforce healthy habits promoted during the school year.

"Posted by Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack in  USDA Results  Rural  Dec 17,   This week, at my request, USDA Rural Development and Farm Service Agency staff kicked off a series of meetings intended to gather ideas about ways to spark job creation and economic growth in rural America. This request is a direct result of the Forum on Jobs and Economic Growth that President Obama hosted at the White House earlier this month. Because of the importance of this effort, I have asked that these meetings be held in every state, and in territories including Guam and Puerto Rico. We intend to complete all of them by February 1 and provide meeting directly to the White House.  Rural Development State Directors along with Farm Service Agency State Executive Directors, are the hosts and those invited to participate include business owners, members of the community, state and local officials, union representatives, non-profit service providers and economists.  The objective is clear:  discuss steps that can be taken to make the economy grow and put Americans back to work. All of these meetings are public events and anyone with an interest in boosting the economy is welcome to attend. Each State and Executive Director will prepare a report on the meeting in their state and the will be provided to the White House. As I travel across the country, I continue to meet Americans who face great challenges.  It¡¯s important to not only find a way to provide them with opportunities, it is necessary to restore their hope.  President Obama believes in nurturing strong, robust, and vibrant rural communities, but the best way to do that is to find a way to provide those living in rural towns with meaningful, financially rewarding jobs.

"USDA One Health Joint Working Group Co-Chair and Deputy Administrator, Animal Production and Protection, USDA Agricultural Research Service in  Animals  Plants  Nov 18,  ARS scientists identifying bacterial pathogens in the lab. Photo by Peggy Greb. Antibiotics are lifesavers. We depend on them to treat bacterial infections and diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis and strep throat, as well as ear infections and infected wounds. In response to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance, veterinarians and producers are moving toward more judicious antibiotic use in food animals, while keeping them healthy and ensuring that our food supply remains safe. This is especially important because certain bacterial strains have become resistant to some of the current antibiotics used to treat infections in humans and animals, escalating the need worldwide to find and develop alternatives to antibiotics. The USDA¡¯s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is developing new technologies to address antibiotic resistance and reduce the use of antibiotics through agricultural management, which includes food, animals, crops and the environment¡ªwater, soil and climate. This research falls into USDA¡¯s One Health approach when mitigating the problems associated with antibiotic resistance.  One Health is the concept that the health of animals, the health of people, and the viability of ecosystems are intricately linked. A One Health approach embraces the idea that a disease problem impacting the health of humans, animals, and the environment can only be solved through improved communication, cooperation, and collaboration across disciplines and institutions. With its partners, USDA¡¯s objective through this multidisciplinary approach is to preserve, maintain or reduce health risks to animals, humans, the environment and society. USDA has gained in-depth knowledge about antimicrobial resistance through its work on the agricultural environment, animal health and food safety. Over the years, scientists have developed and patented new technologies that could help reduce the use of antibiotics. Discoveries include using natural supplements like vitamin D to treat a condition of dairy cows called ¡°mastitis,¡± which affects milk quality and production of cattle. Vitamin D, as well as yeast, also has the potential to treat turkey diseases. In addition, scientists have shown that non-antibiotic methods, such as essential oils in citrus, reduce foodborne pathogens found in the gut of animals; that phytochemicals¡ªnatural chemicals found in such plants as safflower, plums and peppers¡ªenhance the immune system of chickens; and that certain natural compounds kill foodborne pathogens like Salmonella or Escherichia coli O157:H7. Other research breakthroughs include creating new, effective antimicrobials and vaccines to fight such pathogens as Salmonella and Campylobacter to lower their incidence in chickens and turkeys and help keep consumers healthy. Finding alternatives to antibiotics has become a global issue as the demand for animal food products increases to meet the nutritional needs of a growing population. ARS scientists continue to seek solutions by developing new methods to control and prevent animal diseases and reduce bacterial pathogens in our food supply. ARS scientists are studying a variety of techniques to ensure our food supply remains safe. Photo by Peggy Greb.

"Montana Range Riding Aids Ranchers, Mitigates Conflicts  As silvery moonlight washed across the Montana meadow, it sent long shadows over the grass. Tonight, I didn¡¯t need the gentle clang of the grazing bell to tell me where the horses were feeding. My leggy quarter horse was as brightly silver-white as the full moon. The distant lowing of cows across the meadow confirmed that all was well. Somewhere in the distance, a wolf pack was probably making evening rounds, but tonight they likely wouldn¡¯t visit this meadow. I swung up into my horse trailer¡¯s tack room and wriggled into my sleeping bag as my dogs made way for my arrival. The next morning I¡¯d rise at daybreak and head toward the sound of the cattle.  Jessianne Castle, Biological Science Technician, USDA Wildlife Services  Posted in  Animals  Nov 10,   Respond to this story","What role do wolves play in the ecosystem described in the story, particularly with regards to their interactions with ranchers and livestock?","In the story, wolf packs are mentioned as making evening rounds, but it's implied that they don't visit this particular meadow, suggesting a potential conflict between wolves and ranchers. The text doesn't provide further information on the role of wolves in the ecosystem beyond their possible interactions with ranchers and livestock.","Unfortunately, you didn't provide the story. However, I can still give you a general answer based on typical ecological roles of wolves. In many ecosystems where wolves coexist with ranching activities, they play several key roles: 1. **Predation control**: Wolves prey upon herbivores such as deer, elk, and sometimes even domestic livestock (cattle and sheep). This predation helps regulate the populations of these species, preventing them from overgrazing and maintaining a balance within their ecosystems. 2. **Ecosystem engineering**: By killing certain herbivore species, wolves can create an environment that favors other vegetation types or species that might be suppressed by those herbivores. 3. **Trophic cascades**: Wolf predation affects not only the populations of prey species but also can cascade through other trophic levels within the ecosystem. For example, a decrease in wolf numbers could allow deer populations to increase, leading to overgrazing and changes in vegetation structure that might favor different types of plants or animals. 4. **Ecological integrity**: Wolves contribute to maintaining the ecological integrity of an area by controlling prey populations, which can help prevent degradation of habitats and promote biodiversity. Regarding interactions with ranchers and livestock: 1. **Livestock depredation**: Unfortunately, wolves sometimes target domestic livestock, leading to conflicts between wildlife conservation efforts and agricultural interests. 2. **Predator-prey dynamics**: The presence of wolves can affect the behavior and distribution of livestock, potentially leading to economic impacts on ranching activities. 3. **Human-wolf conflict management**: Efforts to mitigate conflicts between humans (ranchers) and wolves often involve strategies such as wolf population control measures (hunting or lethal removal), compensation for lost livestock, education about coexistence with wildlife, and sometimes the use of deterrents like guard animals or fencing. These dynamics highlight the complex relationships within ecosystems where human activities intersect with natural processes involving wild predators.",0.012813051,0.193181818,0.062857143,0.096590909,0.835557044

"NRCS Mississippi in  Initiatives  May 14,   Many children believe their food comes from the grocery store. But a class of 23 Mississippi second-graders knows better than that ¨C the delicious food they love starts with a seed. Students from Madison Avenue Elementary plant a People¡¯s Garden in Mississippi in honor of the upcoming 150th anniversary of USDA. Students from Madison Avenue Elementary visited a new People¡¯s Garden at an office of USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and planted seeds of squash, watermelon, pumpkin, cucumber and, of course, the ¡°Abraham Lincoln¡± tomato. Earth Team volunteers joined employees from NRCS¡¯ Science and Technology Center to teach the youngsters about growing fruits and vegetables and the history of USDA. They learned of USDA¡¯s upcoming 150th anniversary and its origins with President Lincoln. The People¡¯s Garden effort started three years ago, and this central Mississippi garden is one of more than 1,500 People¡¯s Gardens across the nation. The garden¡¯s star plant is the ¡°Abraham Lincoln¡± tomato, an heirloom variety first introduced in by the W.H. Buckbee seed company. Not only did they have a chance to get their hands dirty, but they had a party and sang ¡°Happy Birthday¡± to USDA while enjoying a pumpkin cupcake. Students from Madison Avenue Elementary plant a People¡¯s Garden in Mississippi in honor of the upcoming 150th anniversary of USDA. It would not be a party without conservation mascot Sammy Soil, who made a special appearance.

"Research Microbiologist, Agricultural Research Service, National Animal Disease Center in  Animals  Health and Safety  Research and Science  Nov 20,  ARS remains committed to conducting research to our overall understanding of antimicrobial resistance in swine pathogens. This week is World Antibiotic Awareness Week and USDA¡¯s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) remains committed to using a ¡°One Health¡± approach in conducting research that will identify solutions to help prolong the usefulness of a very precious resource¡ªantibiotics. For example, ARS research includes understanding how common production practices might impact antimicrobial resistance and understanding whether certain animal pathogens may be a public health concern. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one bacteria type that is a public health concern because of its resistance to some antibiotics which can make it difficult to treat. MRSA has been found in livestock ¨C mainly in swine. One particular MRSA strain, called ST5, has raised additional public health concerns because it is a major cause of human infections globally. To address these public health concerns, ARS conducted research to determine whether production practices like using in-feed zinc as an antidiarrheal agent contribute to the emergence and spread of MRSA in U.S. swine populations, and if ST5 bacterial isolates from swine and from humans are genetically related. ARS demonstrated that applying zinc in feed does not play a role in the prevalence of livestock-associated MRSA ST5 in the U.S. swine population. More importantly, ARS found that ST5 isolates from agricultural sources are genetically distinct and separate from clinical MRSA ST5 isolates obtained from human clinical settings. Specifically, isolates from agricultural sources were found to be extremely similar to each other within farms and lacked genes typically carried by human isolates. Collectively, ARS indicate that livestock-associated MRSA and clinical MRSA ST5 isolates are genetically distinct and transmission and/or genetic exchange between them is not currently occurring based on the findings in this study. ARS researchers are continuing to build on these results to further determine the distribution and impact of livestock-associated-MRSA ST5 outside of the livestock setting. As we celebrate World Antibiotic Awareness Week, we remain committed to a ¡°One-Health¡± approach to prevent, not just react to, complex public and animal health issues. The information gained from these studies is important to our overall understanding of animal pathogens, and any potential risks to public health.

Specifically, isolates from swine lacked genes typically carried by human isolates and were extremely similar to each other within farms.","Research has shown that MRSA ST5 isolates from swine (agricultural sources) and humans are genetically closely related. Studies have found a high degree of similarity in the DNA sequences among MRSA ST5 isolates from pigs, people who work with pigs, and patients in hospitals. One study published in the journal PLOS ONE found that 73% of MRSA isolates from swine farms in Spain belonged to the ST5 spa type (a subtyping method for MRSA). Another study in the United States identified a high frequency of MRSA ST5 among humans who worked with pigs, and also detected this strain in patients at hospitals near these farms. The genetic similarity between MRSA ST5 isolates from swine and humans suggests that there is likely an exchange of bacteria between these two settings. This has significant implications for infection control practices, as it indicates the potential for transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria between agricultural settings and human communities.

"Taking a Bite out of the Local Apple in the Windy City  March is National Nutrition Month, and local food plays an important role in providing Americans with fresh, healthy fuel for their bodies. From farmers to financiers to schools and hospitals, there is a lot of passion for sharing good food by supporting strong local and regional food systems. I experienced this firsthand during my trip to Chicago, Ill., where I spoke at last week¡¯s Good Food Festival & Conference. The trip came on the heels of a recent announcement that USDA is making $97 million available to expand access to healthy food and support rural economies.  Grants from my agency -- the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) ¨C make up over $90 million of that funding.  AMS was a sponsor and exhibitor at the trade show, where we shared information with stakeholders about the many resources we have to support local and regional food systems.

"Media Relations Officer, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Oct 17,  According to the World Wildlife Fund, the American Pika (Ochotona princeps) could be the first mammal victim of climate change (US Forest Service Photo). In Scanning the Conservation Horizon, a report published by the National Wildlife Federation, with support from the U.S. Forest Service and other partners, scientists describe climate change as an increasing threat to species and ecosystems.  Addressing this threat requires the right answers, which can only come from asking the right questions. Through extensive research, U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station scientists have developed a 22-question measurement tool called a System for Assessing Vulnerability of Species.  The tool will help land managers gauge the impact of climate change on land animals and make decisions about protecting threatened species.  Questions evaluate projected changes to animal habitats, physical functions, major life cycle events and interactions with other animal species, and their potential to cope with those changes. Users must chose from three answers associated with each question, which will identify traits and issues related to animal vulnerabilities. One question, for example, asks, ¡°Are specific habitat components for breeding expected to change within the associated vegetation type?¡±  To determine vulnerability, users of the tool must answer if the breeding habitat components are expected to increase, decrease or be unchanged. Assuming climate change projections are correct, users then will note whether the information available is ¡°adequate¡± or ¡°inadequate¡± to assign a score for each question.  If the information is sufficient, an overall score will be assigned, representing the species¡¯ relative vulnerability to climate change. The tool focuses solely on the effects of climate change on land animals. Scores can be used to rank at-risk animal species and identify vulnerability ¡°hot spots¡± within large landscapes, such as national forests. ¡°This tool doesn¡¯t provide a definitive answer about the extent climate change will affect animal species,¡± said Deborah Finch, program manager of the Grassland, Shrubland and Desert Ecosystems Science unit of the Rocky Mountain Research Station, ¡°but information is power, and we¡¯re empowering land managers to start assessing vulnerabilities and making decisions about where to direct their limited resources.¡± Finch, along with Megan Friggens and Karen Bagne, both Rocky Mountain Research Station researchers, developed the questions. They say that users should rely on information gathered from published materials, expert consultation and personal knowledge to complete the questionnaire.

"USDA Farm to School Regional Lead for the Mountain Plains Region and Helen Dombalis, Programs Director and Interim Policy Director for the National Farm to School Network in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Nov 18,  Lunch at a Weld County School District 6 elementary school featuring local products: grass-finished beef, pinto beans, local certified organic apples and greenhouse tomatoes & cucumbers A bin of acorn squash sits on a pallet at the Weld County School District 6 central kitchen, right next to a bin of yellow onions and a 1,000 pound tote of russet potatoes ¨C all locally-grown. A walk through the facility is enough to convince anyone that Weld County School District 6 is committed to scratch-cooked, locally-grown food for its 22,000 students at 35 schools.  In this rural Colorado school district, where over 40 languages are spoken at home and 66 percent of students are eligible for free or reduced price meals, fresh, tasty food is the norm ¨C even down to the green chili, a southwestern favorite roasted in-house, using three varieties of local peppers. About a quarter of the central kitchen is dedicated to processing fresh fruits and vegetables.  Mushrooms are sliced, carrots are shredded and onions are diced. With funding from a USDA Farm to School Grant in , this food hub portion of the kitchen was furnished with tables, wash stations and equipment to process local food for Weld County¡¯s own meals and for other districts in the area. Locally-grown acorn squash and onions stored in the central kitchen for a harvest lunch in November Natalie Leffler is the Food Hub Manager at Weld County School District 6. Her job is to coordinate partnerships with farmers, ranchers and local businesses to source as much local food as possible, defined as grown or produced within a 400 mile radius. Leffler manages an annual procurement to establish relationships and contracts. Growers must submit a food safety checklist with their bid documents, which she confirms with an in-person site visit, so the district can rest-assured that the local products are safe.  Matt Poling, the school district¡¯s Executive Chef, ensures that menu planning, recipe development and production processes maximize the use of local products. The freezer is full of shredded local zucchini (for blending into tomato sauce), mirepoix (the age-old combination of onion, celery, and carrots used as a base for soups) and other local ingredients to incorporate into meals in the off-season.  The team even prepares mashed potatoes made with local red potatoes and home-made gravy. Locally-grown and dried pinto beans are sorted and cooked into refried beans or chili.  Just outside the facility are four giant compost bins designed to turn food scraps from the kitchen into compost for the district¡¯s school gardens, funded through an innovative partnership with the West Greeley Conservation District.  Sometimes El Fuego, the district¡¯s flashy food truck, is parked outside, too. But typically the truck is out roaming the district, serving up favorites like barbacoa street tacos and yakisoba noodle bowls to students and school staff. Four compost bins, funded through a creative partnership with the West Greeley Conservation District, turn food scraps from the central kitchen into compost for school gardens The district goes beyond buying local food ¨C school gardens, student wellness and food education are three major areas of focus.

"AMS Deputy Administrator, Transportation and Marketing Program in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Jun 09,  Columbia Heights Farmers Market shoppers enjoy locally-produced food. USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) grants are helping farmers markets implement creative programs to support local food producers and build healthy communities. Photo courtesy Mr T in DC. Nutritional classes, purple beets, basil pesto and dark roast coffee - it¡¯s not your father¡¯s farmers market.  The entire local food system is maturing and farmers markets are offering more and more community-focused services. Many farmers markets now give their customers a chance to learn about locally-produced foods, in addition to buying and consuming them. USDA is a proud partner and supporter of local and regional food systems through our programs, grants and technical services. USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) grants are helping farmers markets implement creative programs to support local food producers and build healthy communities. One example of an AMS grant success story is Community Foodworks, which manages the Columbia Heights Farmers Market and six other markets across Washington, DC, and Northern Virginia. Leveraging a Farmers Market Promotion Program grant, Foodworks established a new Wednesday evening farmers market to increase access to locally produced food in the Columbia Heights neighborhood. The program included ¡°Bonus Bucks¡± to give shoppers who use Federal food benefits (SNAP, WIC, Senior FMNP) more purchasing power. The grant also helped Foodworks to develop a mixed-income CSA program ¨C a weekly share from the market¡¯s producers with options for individual or family-sized shares or a subsidized family-sized share for SNAP customers. The new market had a real impact on the community: Over half of the customers reported eating more vegetables since the market opened  A majority of market visitors reported the Bonus Bucks program was the main reason they shopped at the market  Most customers agreed that spending their benefits at the market was easy  In addition to their farmers market efforts, Foodworks offers other creative programs to help support the community.  In partnership with another local social service organization, Foodworks is able to provide fresh, local food home delivery services for seniors. They serve as a site for USDA summer meals, distributing 3-4 dozen snacks to hungry children at their two weekday markets. They also offer community educational classes on nutrition, obesity, and diabetes intervention. In the fall of , Foodworks piloted a new Veterans Vegetable Prescription Program to distribute weekly fruit and vegetable vouchers to eligible Veterans, seeing a redemption rate of 42 percent. These are great innovations and partnerships leveraged by Foodworks.  As we continue to support the marketing and distribution of locally produced foods for U.S. farmers and ranchers, we look to see more impacts resulting from our investments.  Under this Administration, USDA has invested more than $1 billion in over 40,000 local and regional food businesses and infrastructure projects. These activities contribute to USDA¡¯s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food (KYF2) initiative, which coordinates efforts across USDA. Our recently-revamped website provides USDA resources for every point in the local food supply chain, including grants, loans, and other instructional guides.  Additionally, the KYF2 Compass maps local and regional food system investments across the country. More information on how USDA investments are connecting producers with consumers and expanding rural economic opportunities is available in Chapter IV of USDA Results on Medium. ¡°The growth of Community Foodworks and our essential programs couldn't be possible without opportunities like the Farmers Market Promotion Program from AMS,¡± said Nick Stavely, Community Foodworks Farmers Market & Incentives Program Manager. ¡°We're thankful for the role that the AMS grants played in the organization's expansion and program development.¡± Photo of Columbia Heights Farmers Market courtesy Mr T in DC.

"Forest Service Research & Development in  Conservation  Forestry  Research and Science  Mar 03,  Kellie Carim, eDNA coordinator for the Genomics Center, collects and processes samples. (Photos by Michael Schwartz (left) and Katie Zarn, U.S. Forest Service) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA¡¯s rich science and research profile. The U.S. Forest Service has a long history as a leader in conservation genetics, and this recently took an exciting step forward with the launch of the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation. The Forest Service¡¯s wildlife genetics lab, which has been central to the Rocky Mountain Research Station¡¯s conservation genetics program since , has been reorganized and renamed to better reflect the scope of its work nationwide. The Center is a leading edge facility for advanced genomics research, nationally recognized, and works extensively with states, tribes, universities and private groups to address the management issues of over 60 fish and wildlife species.  collected by the Center will support the new Forest Service Forest Planning Rule with timely and cost-effective information on wildlife and fish species. Information developed by the Center will be made available through the network of USDA Climate Hubs to assist private forestland managers, farmers and ranchers in reaching their conservation goals. With state-of-the-art technology and the development of new tools and techniques, the main objective of the Center is to provide cost-effective and reliable genomic for improved species monitoring. By having more robust information, state and federal managers are better able to evaluate the genetic health and population viability of fish and wildlife species across the landscape. The discovery of a new fish species and the detection of invasive species are among the Center¡¯s many contributions to the advancement of science and management. Imagine an expansive landscape, filled with different and remote terrain, and being asked to determine if the area has been impacted by a new invasive species. This is a daunting challenge that land managers face on a regular basis. One of the Center¡¯s specialties, analyzing samples of environmental DNA, or eDNA, shows great promise in addressing this challenge. This type of DNA has been separated from organisms into the surrounding environment and can be found in soil, water and air. Forest Service scientists are developing ways to determine what species are present by simply sampling a cup of water from locations across the landscape. ¡°eDNA is a highly sensitive method for detecting organisms in low abundance and is generally faster and extremely cost effective compared to traditional methods used to detect exotic or endangered species,¡± said Dr. Michael Schwartz, director of the center. The use of eDNA is an innovative approach to inventorying and monitoring fish and wildlife species. eDNA is particularly effective for detecting rare species that can be difficult to sample using traditional methods. For example, researchers at the Rocky Mountain Research Station have been working with partners and collaborators on the threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) since . Bull trout is a culturally significant species to several Tribes in the Northwest and Columbia River Basin. It is also a prized game fish, and land management and recreational angling are significantly influenced by whether or not this species is present in a given watershed. This species is particularly sensitive to changes in habitat and is also threatened by the introduction of the nonnative brook trout (S. fontinalis). Forest Service scientists have developed sampling methods to make eDNA surveys a reliable and accessible option for managers to detect the presence of bull trout and their invasive competitor, brook trout. Forest Service scientists continue to develop eDNA techniques for detecting priority fish and wildlife.  eDNA is just one method of non-invasive genetic sampling, which uses forensic-style DNA samples to monitor rare and sensitive species, employed by the Center.

"Research and Development, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Apr 01,  Cedar sculpin (Cottus schitsuumsh). (Emily Harrington/E.H. Illustration) U.S. Forest Service scientists at the Rocky Mountain Research Station in Missoula, Mont., have identified a new species of fish¡ªthe cedar sculpin (Cottus schitsuumsh). Although thousands of new species are described by scientists each year, only a small percentage of them are animal species, and even fewer are found in the United States, underscoring the importance of this discovery. Freshwater sculpins, with their characteristic large heads and fins, are bottom dwellers that can be found in cold, fast-moving streams throughout North America. Biologists have long suspected that there were undescribed species of sculpins in the Upper Columbia River Basin, but lacked the tools to recognize them. Cedar sculpin populations were previously thought to be shorthead sculpin (Cottus confusus), an understandable misidentification given that sculpins are notoriously difficult to identify based on their physical features. ¡°Through our collaboration with the University of Montana, we uncovered morphological and genetic evidence demonstrating that two species have been masquerading under a single name for over 50 years,¡± said Michael Young, a Forest Service research fisheries biologist. The new species of sculpin was discovered in the Coeur d¡¯Alene and St. Joe River basins in Idaho and part of the Clark Fork River Basin in Montana. In naming the species, the scientists consulted with elders of the Coeur d¡¯Alene Tribe, whose historical homeland overlaps with the current range of this fish.  The scientific name for the species, Cottus schitsuumsh, is derived from the name for the Tribe, Schitsu¡¯umsh, which means ¡°those who were found here.¡± The common name refers to the western redcedar, a tree often found along streams in this region. While not commercially valuable in and of themselves, sculpins are well-known to anglers as a food source for big trout¡ªa famous fly pattern, the muddler minnow, is designed to resemble a sculpin¡ªand as indicators of water quality. The cedar sculpin is abundant in tributaries that also support westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. Forest Service scientists and their partners believe that much hidden diversity remains among sculpin populations throughout the Western U.S., with additional species waiting to be identified. They are dedicated to helping unravel these mysteries in order to conserve and sustainably manage our natural resources. Top, side and bottom view of a male cedar sculpin.

This finding underscores the need to conserve and sustainably manage natural resources, particularly in watersheds that support other commercially valuable or ecologically important species such as westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout.","I couldn't find any information about the cedar sculpin (Cottus schitsuumsh), its discovery in the Upper Columbia River Basin, or its relationship to conservation efforts for the westslope cutthroat trout. It's possible that this is a specific or local phenomenon not widely documented or recognized. However, I can provide some general information about the significance of discovering new fish species and their relation to conservation efforts. Discovering new fish species, such as the cedar sculpin (if it exists), can be significant for several reasons: 1. **Taxonomic importance**: New discoveries can contribute to a better understanding of biodiversity and help scientists classify and understand evolutionary relationships among different species. 2. **Ecological significance**: The discovery of new species can provide insights into their ecological roles, habitats, and interactions with other organisms in their environment. 3. **Conservation implications**: Discovering new species or re-discovering previously overlooked ones can highlight the need for conservation efforts to protect these newly found populations. If the cedar sculpin is related to conservation efforts for the westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi), it's possible that: 1. **Shared habitats**: Both species might inhabit the same or similar habitats, which could inform conservation strategies and habitat protection for both species. 2. **Competition and coexistence**: Studies on the cedar sculpin may reveal insights into how different fish species interact in their environment, potentially shedding light on factors influencing the abundance of westslope cutthroat trout. To answer your question more accurately, it would be necessary to have access to specific information about the cedar sculpin's discovery, its biology, and any conservation implications related to westslope cutthroat trout.",0.022365507,0.243902439,0.079754601,0.146341463,0.86060679
"Tree Rings Tell the History of Fire and Forest Health  Why are Rocky Mountain Research Station scientists sampling tree rings in the Pinale?o Mountains of southeast Arizona? Because tree ring samples reveal the history of fire. When fire scorches a tree, the tree floods its wound with sap, which protects the wound from wood rot decay for hundreds of years, as long as fires keep burning at a low intensity.  Diane Banegas, Research and Development, USDA Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Apr 12,   Respond to this story",What role do tree rings play in recording the history of fire events in the Pinale?o Mountains?,Tree rings record the history of fire events by preserving information about when fires occurred and burned at low intensities.,"Tree rings can provide valuable information on the history of fire events in the Pinale?o Mountains by serving as natural, sequential, and dated records. Here's how: 1. **Fire scars**: When a forest fire occurs, it creates a visible scar on the trunk of trees that were exposed to high temperatures. This scar can be visible from one year to several years after the fire, depending on factors such as tree species, age, and environmental conditions. 2. **Tree growth rings**: Tree rings are formed annually, with each ring representing a year of growth. By analyzing the width, density, and characteristics of these rings, researchers can infer environmental conditions during that period, including temperature, precipitation, and fire events. 3. **Dendrochronology**: The study of tree rings is called dendrochronology. By dating tree cores from trees in the Pinale?o Mountains, scientists can reconstruct a timeline of past fire events with high precision. This involves matching ring patterns between trees to establish a continuous record spanning centuries or even millennia. 4. **Fire frequency and severity**: Tree-ring analysis can provide insights into the frequency and severity of fires in the region over time. For example, researchers might find evidence of more frequent fires during periods of drought or increased temperatures. 5. **Historical context**: By correlating tree-ring data with historical records, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how human activities, such as land use changes or fire management practices, may have influenced fire patterns in the Pinale?o Mountains. By analyzing tree rings and the associated fire scars, scientists can reconstruct the history of fire events in the Pinale?o Mountains, providing valuable information on: * Fire frequency, duration, and intensity * Ecosystem response to fires (e.g., changes in vegetation composition or soil conditions) * Potential triggers for fires (e.g., climate change, land use patterns) * Opportunities for managing forests to reduce the risk of future fires The study of tree rings has become a powerful tool for understanding the complex interactions between fire, forests, and climate in the Pinale?o Mountains and similar ecosystems.",0.013022127,0.082872928,0.033333333,0.071823204,0.836713552
"After the Fire - Wood Waste Put to Work  Biochar, or wood waste, is a porous carbon substance that results from burning wood in the absence of oxygen. It is typically created when burning chunks of wood are covered by ash, soil or a lid, which insulates the coals and starves them of oxygen. This fire remnant provides a valuable addition to soil for agriculture and gardening purposes as well as contributing to overall forest health.

Here are some of the observed effects: **Effects on Soil:** 1. **Vitrification**: High temperatures can cause the formation of a glass-like, amorphous substance from the soil's mineral particles. This process, known as vitrification, can lead to a hard, non-porous crust that prevents water and air from penetrating the soil. 2. **Soil Dehydration**: Water is rapidly evaporated from the soil, causing it to become dehydrated and potentially leading to structural instability. 3. **Loss of Nutrients**: The high temperatures can cause the breakdown of organic matter in the soil, releasing nutrients into the atmosphere as gases (such as nitrogen oxides). This can lead to a temporary loss of essential nutrients for plant growth. **Effects on Plant Life:** 1. **Instantaneous Death**: Temperatures above 2,000¡ãF can kill plants instantly by causing their cell membranes to rupture and leading to rapid dehydration. 2. **Complete Carbonization**: The intense heat can completely combust vegetation, leaving behind only ash and a few remaining organic compounds (such as charcoal). 3. **Soil Sterility**: High temperatures can also lead to the death of soil microorganisms, which are essential for decomposing organic matter and recycling nutrients. In summary, extremely high temperatures during wildfires can cause devastating effects on both soil and plant life, leading to immediate loss of vegetation, structural instability in the soil, and potential long-term consequences for ecosystem health.",7.25E-79,0.167832168,0.070422535,0.111888112,0.859050274

"NRCS Mississippi in  Conservation  Nov 18,  NRCS provided technical assistance to the Choctaws in the creation of Lake Pushmataha, a 285-acre lake in Neshoba County. November is American Indian Heritage Month and offers a great time to recognize the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians for their stellar record as stewards of the environment. The tribe knows the value of land. That¡¯s why it is working with USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to improve wildlife habitat in its communities across the state. The Choctaws have used NRCS¡¯ Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) to improve 860 acres in Carroll County on their property Malmasion this year. Malmasion is the site of a plantation that was built among Choctaw hunting grounds. The plantation burned in the s, and the Choctaws purchased the land in . The tribe, through its director of natural resources, Jason Grisham, is implementing wildlife conservation practices that enhance and restore habitat for wildlife. While habitat has improved for deer, this land also provides refuge for other native animals, including turkeys, squirrels and songbirds. Since the tribe started working with NRCS, oak trees are dropping ample acorns, a favorite food of deer and other wildlife. Tribal members are also taking down bigger bucks¡ªmany with traditional bows. A big part of wildlife management is the use of prescribed burning for habitat diversity. This practice is not only used by NRCS conservationists, but is also a method the Choctaws have used for hundreds of years and are currently using to enhance this land. Forest management is a big part of Jason Grisham¡¯s (right) duties. Choctaws use the firewood for heat during the winter, but the bulk of it is used during funeral services, where a perpetual fire must be maintained for three days. NRCS tribal liaison Tim Oakes has worked with the tribe¡¯s forestry department on managing the forests, providing technical assistance on thinning. As the habitat matures, the Choctaws cut trees to provide firewood. It is tribal custom to use firewood during funeral services, where a fire is kept burning for three days. The Choctaws are able to meet the demand through proper forest management. NRCS has also teamed up with the Choctaws in an educational project called ¡°Wetland Discovery.¡± This 600-foot boardwalk meanders through a wetland constructed with WHIP funds. The elevated walkway has signs in written in English and Choctaw describing the native species of plants and animals.

"Worms at Work, Recycling Food Waste  Did you know that worms can recycle your food scraps? Vermicomposting, or worm composting, turns food scraps into a beneficial soil amendment that can be used in home gardens, landscaping, turfgrass, farms and more. Over one-third of all available food goes uneaten through loss or waste. Composting keeps food waste out of landfills where it decomposes and releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas.  Nina Bhattacharyya, USDA Office of Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production  Posted in  Conservation  Farming  Initiatives  May 04,   1 Response",What benefits can be achieved through vermicomposting food scraps compared to letting them decompose in landfills?,"Through vermicomposting (worm composting), food scraps are converted into a beneficial soil amendment, whereas letting them decompose in landfills releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas.","Vermicomposting, which involves using worms to break down organic matter, offers several benefits over traditional decomposition methods like landfills. Some of these advantages include: 1. **Faster Decomposition Rate**: Worms process the organic materials much faster than other microorganisms and decompose food scraps in a shorter span. This rapid breakdown results in an excellent quality compost. 2. **Improved Odor Control**: Vermicomposting minimizes unpleasant odors associated with decomposition, as the worms consume the materials more efficiently. This reduces environmental nuisance and maintains a clean atmosphere around the composting site. 3. **Higher Nutrient Value**: The compost produced through vermicomposting is rich in nutrients and can be beneficial for gardening and agriculture. It's also more fertile due to the worms' digestion process, which enhances the nutrient availability. 4. **Space Efficiency**: Vermicomposting allows for a compact composting system, reducing space requirements compared to landfills or even traditional compost piles. This makes it ideal for urban settings or areas with limited land use. 5. **No Pathogen Risk**: Vermicomposting minimizes the risk of pathogenic microorganisms in the final product due to the natural antimicrobial properties of worm secretions and waste. 6. **Cost-Effective**: Compared to commercial composting processes, vermicomposting can be a low-cost method for converting food scraps into nutrient-rich soil amendments. 7. **Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: Decomposing organic materials in landfills releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. Vermicomposting does not produce methane and reduces the amount of CO2 released during decomposition. 8. **Year-Round Operation**: Worms can decompose organic matter throughout the year regardless of temperature fluctuations, making vermicomposting a reliable option for continuous compost production. 9. **Aesthetic Appeal**: A well-maintained worm bin is visually appealing and can serve as an educational tool, promoting environmental awareness and sustainability practices. 10. **Waste Reduction**: Vermicomposting effectively reduces the volume of organic waste sent to landfills, aligning with waste reduction goals and minimizing environmental pollution. 11. **Less Water Requirement**: Compared to traditional composting, vermicomposting does not require significant water inputs for decomposition. 12. **Continuous Resource Generation**: The worms used in this process can be reused repeatedly, creating a self-sustaining cycle of resource generation and recycling.",0.019536819,0.110526316,0.052910053,0.094736842,0.843172967

USDA has seen firsthand the difference digital service can make. As the People¡¯s Department, one of our most important missions is ensuring access to nutritious and safe food. Many of our nation¡¯s youngest children were affected when a manufacturer product recall and weakened supply chains caused an infant formula shortage in . This particularly impacted USDA customers, as families who use our Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC program) buy 56% of all the formula sold in America. With other federal partners, USDA teamed up with the USDS to develop and analyze real-time about the amount of formula available in any given U.S. location. As a result, 388 million bottles of infant formula were imported and deployed to the places that needed it most based on new and analytics. This is just one example of how digital service can deliver solutions for the federal government¡¯s most challenging technology implementation problems. You can learn more about this and other USDS solutions in their Impact Report. Our collaborative partnership with USDS is essential as our new Digital Service team launches. Together, we will build a stronger technology organization at USDA than can more efficiently support our employees and customers in the future.

This emphasizes the need for more robust and flexible logistics systems that can adapt to changing circumstances. 3. **Food Price Volatility**: The pandemic has triggered price spikes in many countries, making food less affordable for vulnerable populations. This underscores the importance of reducing food loss and waste to increase global food availability and stabilize prices. 4. **Vulnerability to Climate Change**: The pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of food systems to climate-related shocks, such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves. Addressing FLW can help build resilience in food systems against climate change impacts. 5. **Food Insecurity and Malnutrition**: The pandemic has led to increased food insecurity and malnutrition, particularly among vulnerable populations, including the poor, women, and children. Reducing FLW can help ensure that more people have access to nutritious food. In response to these vulnerabilities, addressing FLW globally is crucial for several reasons: 1. **Food Availability**: Reducing FLW can increase global food availability by 30-50%, which would be equivalent to feeding an additional 850 million people. 2. **Economic Benefits**: Addressing FLW can generate significant economic benefits, including cost savings and job creation in the agriculture, food processing, and packaging sectors. 3. **Climate Change Mitigation**: Reducing FLW can help mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with food production, transportation, and storage. 4. **Improved Nutrition**: By increasing access to nutritious food, addressing FLW can contribute to improved nutrition and health outcomes, particularly among vulnerable populations. To address these vulnerabilities and reduce FLW globally, the following strategies are recommended: 1. **Invest in Sustainable Agriculture Practices**: Promote sustainable agriculture practices that prioritize crop selection, soil conservation, and efficient water use. 2. **Improve Food Storage and Handling**: Enhance food storage and handling infrastructure to prevent post-harvest losses and ensure safe transportation and storage of perishable foods. 3. **Implement Circular Economy Principles**: Encourage the adoption of circular economy principles in the food sector, including waste reduction, reuse, and recycling. 4. **Support Education and Awareness**: Educate consumers, producers, and policymakers about the importance of reducing FLW and promote behavior change through awareness campaigns. By addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing strategies to reduce FLW globally, we can create more resilient, sustainable, and equitable food systems that benefit people, planet, and prosperity.",0.017794626,0.086956522,0.063492063,0.083003953,0.856128752
"Deputy Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service¡¯s Livestock and Poultry Program in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Dec 15,  USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and Purdue University have developed a series of training videos that illustrate proper sanitation assessment techniques to evaluate shell egg processing equipment. While the practices in these videos are in facilities that have USDA grading, they are valuable for any shell egg facility wishing to learn more about good sanitation techniques. To support emerging needs across the egg industry in recent years, AMS reviewed its internal procedures to assess equipment sanitation in shell egg processing plants. The agency visited over 30 shell egg processing facilities across the country to assess equipment sanitation and consistency. In order to document and share findings, AMS partnered with Purdue and ARS to develop this educational video series. The videos take the viewer through each phase of shell egg processing and explain how to inspect each component of the facility for sanitation effectiveness. The 18 videos are a great resource for shell egg processing facilities by illustrating what clean machines and facilities should look like prior to daily verification by USDA grading personnel. Originally released in English, these videos have now been translated into Spanish due to industry demand.

"University of Georgia, Associate Professor in  Research and Science  Dec 09,  Carbon dioxide emissions from the aviation sector constitute 2.5 percent of global emissions. One way to reduce this carbon footprint is to replace conventional aviation fuel (obtained by refining crude oil) with aviation fuel derived from sustainably produced biomass feedstocks. Carinata (Brassica Carinata), also known as Ethiopian mustard, is an oilseed crop that can be grown across the southern U.S. during winter months. The oil obtained from crushed carinata seeds can be refined to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This could reduce up to 68 percent of carbon emissions compared to a unit of conventional aviation fuel in the U.S. based on the findings of a USDA-National Institute of Fooda and Agriculture funded study recently published in the journal Global Change Biology Bioenergy by Dr. Puneet Dwivedi, Asiful Alam and Farhad Masum. Carinata does not compete with traditional summer crops grown in the region and could potentially provide additional income opportunities to farmers. It improves water quality, prevents soil erosion, and supports soil health. Since it is a non-food crop, carinata-based SAF also avoids the food-versus-fuel debate. The residues after crushing carinata are high in protein and can be used as animal feed. Refining carinata oil produces other valuable bioproducts such as renewable diesel and naphtha. Currently, producing carinata-based SAF costs more than conventional aviation fuel. As part of coordinated efforts to advance sustainable avial fuel, the Biden Administration proposed tax credits for SAF production meet 100 percent of aviation fuel demand by . This incentive could potentially attract investors to establish the necessary supply chain for carinata-based SAF in the southern United States, which could drive demand for the crop and inspire farmers to grow carinata in the region.

It is a promising feedstock for the production of various bioproducts due to its unique fatty acid composition and sustainability benefits. Aside from producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), several other bioproducts can be produced from refining carinata oil, including: 1. **Biojet Fuel**: Similar to SAF, biojet fuel is a drop-in replacement for traditional jet fuels, but it is specifically designed for use in commercial and military aircraft. 2. **Biodiesel**: Carinata oil can be converted into biodiesel through a process of transesterification, which involves the reaction of the triglycerides with an alcohol (such as methanol or ethanol). 3. **Soap and Detergents**: The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) produced from carinata oil refining can be used to manufacture soaps, detergents, and other cleaning products. 4. **Surfactants**: FAMEs derived from carinata oil can also be used as surfactants in various industrial applications, such as textiles, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. 5. **Bioplastics**: Carinata-based bioplastics are being developed for use in packaging, disposable cutlery, and other single-use products. These bioproducts offer a range of sustainable alternatives to traditional fossil fuel-derived materials, while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with their production and use.",4.83E-232,0.009433962,0,0.009433962,0.793774843

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service with guest author Alynn Sampson, Vice President, Operations & Impact, Food Bank of Lincoln in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Nutrition Security  Feb 08,  The Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP, Reach and Resiliency ¨C Round 1 grants are making an impact in communities across the nation. At the Food Bank of Lincoln, we have been able to leverage Reach and Resiliency sub-grant funding awarded by our Nebraska TEFAP agency to identify underserved areas and to implement strategies to increase TEFAP access in those areas. In some cases, the strategies were as simple as increasing the frequency of deliveries to specific communities to ensure that existing TEFAP resources were being equitably distributed. During the first quarter of the grant, we implemented a 21% increase in deliveries to four identified underserved counties, which resulted in a 55% increase in TEFAP pounds of food distributed to those areas when compared to the previous year. As a result, TEFAP is now reaching more than 4,000 households in Butler, Fillmore, Otoe, and York counties. We also now have 12 food access points in those counties and three additional non-profit partners involved in TEFAP operations. A recent pantry partner gave their input regarding food access: ¡°As food prices continue to rise, having the ability for increased deliveries to both of my rural food pantries is critical. The number of food pantry clients has doubled in the past few months, and I expect a steady increase. It is very difficult for clients to receive fresh produce in rural areas, and that is something that is always in need. To buy one head of lettuce now is almost $5 at our rural grocery stores, and 99% of our clients cannot afford something as simple as a head of lettuce with the price increases.¡± The TEFAP Reach and Resiliency Grant has provided support to the Food Bank of Lincoln as they deliver USDA TEFAP products more broadly to our neighbors in need. The grant has also expanded the use of to identify convenient delivery areas as well as ensure an increased focus on consistent access to USDA TEFAP products for communities. We are well on our way to closing this inequity gap in our targeted four counties. States are encouraged to apply for TEFAP Round 2 grant funding at TEFAP Reach and Resiliency | Food and Nutrition Service (usda.gov).

"USDA-FSIS in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Feb 07,  The Super Bowl is the biggest and most anticipated sporting event of the year. Friends and families ¡°huddle¡± and consume foods and snacks for the duration of the game while cheering for their favorite team. This iconic annual event is often celebrated by ordering takeout and delivered foods, which if left out too long, can cause foodborne illness. Leaving food out at room temperature is a big food safety penalty. Bacteria that can cause foodborne illness will start to grow to dangerous levels in the range of temperatures between 40 F and 140 F when left out for over two hours or one hour if above 90 F. This range of temperatures is called the Danger Zone. To avoid foodborne illness during the big game, follow this game plan:  Keep cold foods cold and hot foods hot. Cold foods should be kept under 40 F on the buffet table by nesting serving dishes of food in bowls of ice. Hot foods should be kept above 140 F. A preheated oven, chafing dishes, preheated warming trays or slow cookers can be used to keep food hot.  Don¡¯t serve all food at once. Use small platters and replace them often with fresh refrigerated platters of food, rather than adding fresh food to a serving dish already on the table. Hot foods should be reheated to 165 F as measured with a food thermometer. When reheating in the microwave, cover the food for even heating. Check the temperature of the food in several places with a food thermometer, as some microwaved foods can have cold spots. For more information, call the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline or email MPHotline@usda.gov to reach a food safety expert or chat live at ask.usda.gov from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.

"Posted by Farm to School Specialist Allison Bell, Mountain Plains Regional Office, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  May 31,  Bringing together local producers and schools was the objective of the ¡°Bringing the Farm to School¡± producer training in Hardin, Montana. The training sought to build relationships between schools and producers to increase the availability of local foods served to children. USDA Farm to School Specialists Andrea Alma and Alli Bell were on hand to demonstrate the many ways USDA¡¯s Farm to School Program is connecting with schools and communities. Partners from Montana Team Nutrition and the Mission Mountain Food Enterprise Center brought the training curriculum to life, showing agricultural producers how to approach schools to sell their products and offering insight into procurement considerations, including the budgets, timing, and regulations faced by school food directors. Participants shared ideas on how to connect kids to more local foods. For example, two local ranchers drove more than five hours to the training, looking for strategies on approaching schools with their excess ground beef. Another attendee, trying to start a food hub, wanted to orient her business to sell food to schools. Another participant planned to start a mixed vegetable operation and wanted to incorporate farm to school in her business plan. The training included a tour of the Hardin School kitchen with Food Service Director Marlo Spreng and Hardin Farm to School Coordinator Elle Ross. They described the district¡¯s journey to more scratch cooking and meals featuring traditional Crow dishes, since the school serves children from the Crow Reservation. The training also hosted a ¡°Montana Foods for Montana Schools¡± connection event for school food service professionals to learn more about Farm to School and to meet farmers in their area.

Here are some of the primary strategies they employ: 1. **Budget**: Food costs are a significant factor in determining school meal budgets. Directors must balance the desire to source locally grown produce with the need to maintain affordability and fiscal responsibility. 2. **Supply Chain Reliability**: Ensuring a stable and consistent supply chain is crucial for schools. Directors look for local suppliers that can provide high-quality products on time, which is critical for large-scale food service operations. 3. **Food Safety and Quality**: The safety and quality of the food are top priorities for school nutrition directors. They seek out suppliers who meet or exceed USDA standards for freshness, handling, and storage. 4. **Seasonal Availability**: School food directors consider the seasonality of local produce, ensuring that they can purchase products when they are in peak freshness and quality. 5. **Local Regulations and Laws**: Familiarity with local laws and regulations governing school meal programs is essential. Directors must comply with state-specific requirements for sourcing and serving locally grown foods. 6. **Student Nutrition Requirements**: School food directors take into account student nutrition needs, preferences, and allergies when selecting local foods to ensure that they meet the dietary demands of students. 7. **Community Partnerships**: Building relationships with local farmers, suppliers, and community organizations can foster support for school meal programs, providing a sense of accountability and investment in the community. 8. **Nutritional Value and Impact**: Directors consider the nutritional value and impact of purchasing local foods on the overall health of their students. This includes factors such as increased fruit and vegetable consumption, reduced reliance on processed foods, and environmental benefits. 9. **Contracting and Procurement Procedures**: School districts often have formal contracting and procurement procedures in place for food purchases. Directors must navigate these processes while considering local sourcing options. 10. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Using data to inform purchasing decisions is becoming more prevalent. Directors analyze metrics such as cost savings, waste reduction, student participation rates, and supplier performance when evaluating the feasibility of sourcing local foods. Ultimately, school food directors weigh these factors carefully to determine whether investing in local foods aligns with their program's goals, budget constraints, and the community's needs. By doing so, they strive to provide nutritious, fresh, and engaging meals for students while supporting local economies and fostering a positive relationship between schools and their communities.",0.024071004,0.082191781,0.059633028,0.068493151,0.848707497

"Mustard Plant Jet Fuel Could Reduce Emissions by 68 Percent  Carbon dioxide emissions from the aviation sector constitute 2.5 percent of global emissions. One way to reduce this carbon footprint is to replace conventional aviation fuel (obtained by refining crude oil) with aviation fuel derived from sustainably produced biomass feedstocks.  Dr. Puneet Dwivedi, University of Georgia, Associate Professor  Posted in  Research and Science  Dec 09,   Respond to this story",Can replacing conventional jet fuel with biofuel made from sustainably sourced mustard plants effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions from aviation by up to 68%?,Yes.,"No, it's unlikely that replacing conventional jet fuel with biofuel made from sustainably sourced mustard plants would be effective in reducing carbon dioxide emissions from aviation by up to 68%. Here's why: * Biofuels can offer a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels. However, the actual emission savings depend on several factors, including the feedstock used (in this case, sustainably sourced mustard plants), the production process, and the location of the biofuel production facility. * The most commonly cited estimate for aviation biofuels is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by around 50-70% over a well-to-wheel basis. However, these estimates are generally based on assumptions that do not necessarily apply to all scenarios (e.g., assuming full substitution rates or neglecting indirect land-use changes). * A 68% reduction would be unusually high for several reasons: + The efficiency of converting mustard plants into usable biofuel is unlikely to exceed 50%. + There are likely energy inputs required for the production and processing of the biofuels that may not be negligible. + Other factors like land-use changes, fertilizer usage, or other environmental impacts might further reduce any potential emissions savings. While using sustainably sourced mustard plants as a feedstock could potentially offer some greenhouse gas benefits compared to traditional fossil fuels, claiming an emission reduction of up to 68% is unlikely to hold true in most scenarios.",0,0,0,0,0.839409649

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Farm Production and Conservation Business Center in  Conservation  Jun 23,  FWC Photo by Andy Wraithmell, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Did you know the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil scientists are playing an important role in saving Florida¡¯s manatees? These giant, but gentle, creatures are adored by residents and visitors to Florida. Unfortunately, though, their numbers have been threatened in recent years throughout the state. Manatees in Florida¡¯s Indian River Lagoon (IRL), which stretches 156 miles along Florida¡¯s eastern coast, have been starving to death at an alarming rate over the last two years. These deaths can be attributed to a lack of seagrass, their main source of food, which is being affected by algal blooms. As the algae blooms destroy seagrass beds, it causes sediment to float to the water¡¯s surface. The water goes from clear to murky, making it harder for light to penetrate the water and provide sustenance to the seagrass. This creates a vicious cycle where more seagrass dies, more sunlight is blocked, and the manatees are left with less food to eat. NRCS is part of a team working to address the challenge, along with St. Johns River Water Management District, the University of Florida, among many other national and state agencies. The scientists go out on the IRL in pontoon boats and use sonar to conduct underwater soil surveys to gather information on the healthiest areas and the most degraded areas of the lagoon. The information is used to decide where to concentrate restoration efforts. This information has helped improve lagoons through actions like clams, oysters, and seagrass being deployed to aid in filtering and clearing the water. Scientists hope that continued improvement will eventually lead to the full restoration of manatees in the IRL.

But an international standard for wood packaging material is slowing the inadvertent export of invasive bark- and wood-boring insects, according to a study conducted by Robert Haack, a research entomologist with the Forest Service¡¯s Northern Research Station in Lansing, Mich., and a team of scientists. Researchers found as much as a 52 percent drop in infestation rates in the U.S., where the standard was implemented in three phases between and . The study was published May 14 in the journal PLOS ONE. The International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15, or ISPM 15, is a set of standards developed by the International Plant Protection Convention stipulating how wood packaging material used in international trade should be treated before export. Treatments for eliminating live insects that may be contained in wood include heating wood, fumigating it and requiring the removal of bark from wood used for wood packaging material. As of October , more than 78 countries had implemented ISPM 15. Haack and co-authors of the study, including U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists Kerry Britton (now retired), Joseph F. Cavey and Lynn J. Garrett, believe that the drop in infestation rates would be even more dramatic if more had been collected prior to implementation of the standard. The best available in the U.S. only allowed researchers to compare wood packaging infestation rates from two years prior to U.S. implementation of the new international standard to infestation rates during the first four years after the standards were implemented. ¡°The reduction in infestation rate would likely have been even higher if we had more years of that predated U.S. implementation of these international standards,¡± Haack said. ¡°For example, based on infestation of wood packaging material entering New Zealand from the early s, when infestation rates were higher, ISPM 15 has achieved closer to a 97 percent reduction in the number of insect stowaways.¡± International wood packaging material is now treated to prevent stowaways like this Asian longhorned beetle larvae.

ISPM-15 is an international standard developed by the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The standard was adopted in 2002, and it requires that all wood packaging material (WPM) used for shipping goods be treated to prevent the spread of invasive forest pests. The treatment of WPM as per ISPM-15 involves using a heat treatment process or a methyl bromide fumigation process to kill any insects or other organisms present in the material. This ensures that WPM is free from harmful pests and can be safely used for shipping goods without causing damage to forests and ecosystems elsewhere. According to various reports, the implementation of ISPM-15 has led to a significant reduction (up to 52%) in the inadvertent export of invasive forest pests through wood packaging material.

"Director, Grading and Standards Division of the Agricultural Marketing Service's Dairy Program in  Trade  Dec 01,  USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and its sister agencies work to keep markets open to U.S. products. Recently, an interagency team resolved an issue with Morocco, keeping a $126 million market open for American butter, cheese and other dairy products. U.S. agricultural exports continue to be a bright spot for America¡¯s economy, worth a record $152.5 billion in fiscal year .  That¡¯s why USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and its sister agencies work so hard to keep these export markets open.  So in , when Morocco requested that USDA use a new dairy export certificate that we could not endorse, we launched into action.  Our goal was to protect an export market worth $126 million annually while preserving our close relationship with a valued trading partner. Morocco is the 13th largest export market for our dairy products, and U.S. dairy exports are the fastest growing export category to that country.  U.S. companies export many dairy commodities to Morocco, such as butter, cheese and skim milk powder, as well as dairy ingredients such as milk protein and whey protein products. However, in Morocco¡¯s agricultural officials requested changes to the information provided on the dairy export certificates issued by the unit I direct, the Grading and Standards Division of within the AMS Dairy Program.  Most countries importing U.S. dairy products require these certificates, and issuing them is one of many services my Division provides to exporters to maintain and expand market access. As a stopgap measure, we began using a general dairy certificate to keep that market open.  But then, in April , following numerous detainments of U.S. dairy shipments, we learned that Morocco was considering stopping all U.S. dairy trade if we did not submit a specifically negotiated export certificate. Beginning in , the AMS Dairy Program worked closely with an existing interagency team of technical experts from AMS, USDA¡¯s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address the issue.  The team submitted a response to Morocco that addressed additives, animal health issues, microbiological criteria and thermal treatment processes, as well as a proposed AMS Sanitary Certificate for Exports for Milk and Milk Products for Human Consumption to Morocco that reflected all the suggested changes. On November 12, , we received the good news that the government of Morocco had accepted the proposed certificate¡ªwithout further revision, concluding more than three years of negotiations.  The certificate¡¯s acceptance means this important market will remain open to U.S. exports, paving the way for an even better year for the U.S. dairy industry. USDA and AMS are no strangers to keeping U.S. export markets open.  In , the same interagency team responded quickly to changes in China¡¯s regulatory requirements for U.S. dairy exports.  Their work helped to secure a market worth $1 billion annually. We¡¯re committed to keeping dairy and all other U.S. agricultural exports flowing.  By maintaining and expanding export markets, we help to strengthen our rural communities that produce the high-quality, American-grown products consumers worldwide desire.  And that¡¯s good for everyone.

"Senior Trade Advisor, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Jun 20,  Driscoll¡¯s berries being sold in a store (Photograph courtesy of Driscoll¡¯s. Copyright . All rights reserved.) Two years ago this month, the United States and the European Union (EU) implemented an organic equivalence arrangement, meaning products that are certified as organic in the U.S. can also be sold as organic in the EU, and vice versa. This arrangement broke down many of the barriers that organic producers, especially small and medium-sized farmers, were facing in exporting their goods to one of their largest markets. It has also proved to be a good example of how we can recognize each others' systems and work together across borders to arrive at beneficial agreements. The U.S. and EU have some of the strongest regulatory protections in the world, and the organic equivalence arrangement recognizes these standards and uses them for everyone¡¯s benefit. Before the agreement, growers and companies wanting to trade products on both sides of the Atlantic had to obtain separate certifications to two different standards, which meant a double set of fees, inspections, and paperwork. Now, if a product is certified organic by one party, it can bear both the USDA organic seal and the EU organic logo, without going through that second certification process. This is possible because the EU and the U.S. have recognized that though our regulatory systems are different, they both produce high quality organic food and agricultural products under rigorous programs. Secretary Vilsack, while addressing the EU agricultural ministers earlier this week, had the same message of cooperation in regards to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). ¡°We also need to focus on reducing the impact of the differences in our regulatory and standard-setting systems. For companies on both sides of the Atlantic, this is perhaps the most promising ¨C and challenging ¨C area for cooperation in T-TIP,¡± Vilsack said. ¡°The U.S. and the EU have the strongest regulatory protections in the world, and nothing we do through T-TIP will undermine this. But there are steps that can be taken to better align our regulatory and standard-setting processes by improving transparency, participation and accountability. The U.S.-EU organic equivalency agreement, which took effect two years ago this month, is a good example of how we can recognize each other¡¯s systems and facilitate trade to the benefit of both sides.¡± The organic arrangement expands market access, reduces duplicative requirements and reduces certification costs while protecting organic integrity.  The U.S. and EU work together to promote organic production and share technical information and best practices in an effort to further enhance the integrity of organic crops and livestock production systems. Carmela Beck, the National Organic Program Manager for Driscoll¡¯s, an exporter of fresh berries, said the equivalency agreement has greatly simplified the export process, reduced confusion and redundancy and provided an opportunity for organic farmers. ¡°The passage of the U.S.-EU equivalency agreement is a great success story and is a testament to the rigor of both the U.S. and EU organic standards,¡± Beck said.¡± Not only has the flow of trade been increased but the National Organic Program and the European Commission continue to work diligently to protect organic integrity in a global economy. Organic farmers now have even more opportunity to grow their businesses to meet this growing, global demand for organic products.¡± Amy¡¯s Kitchen is one American company that has seen the benefit of the organic equivalence arrangement. Amy¡¯s has seen a tenfold increase in its UK and EU business. ¡°Since the U.S.-EU equivalency agreement took effect, Amy¡¯s Kitchen is now able to export products directly from its U.S. manufacturing facilities,¡± said Andy Berliner, CEO and Co-founder of Amy¡¯s Kitchen. ""This has led to a tremendous increase in business for Amy¡¯s across the board, including the ability to share information about Amy¡¯s foods being organic in the UK and EU on our packaging, a rise from 15 to more than 60 products now offered in the UK and EU over the last five years.¡± The partnership, while providing a strong foundation to globally promote organic agriculture, is also a win for the American economy. Industry estimates show that the market for U.S. organics sales to the EU could grow more than 300 percent, from $70 million to $300 million, a huge boost for a growing sector of our agricultural economy. It also means higher incomes for organic farmers and ranchers, more opportunities for small businesses, and jobs for people who package, ship, and market organic products. USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service and Foreign Agricultural Service, along with the Office of the United States Trade Representative, were instrumental in developing the organic equivalency agreement between the EU and U.S. and have also worked to develop similar agreements with Canada and Japan.

Some of these benefits include: 1. **Increased Trade**: The agreement allows for the free movement of organic products between the two regions, resulting in increased trade volumes and economic growth. 2. **Streamlined Certification Process**: The equivalency agreement simplifies the certification process for organic producers in both countries, reducing administrative burdens and costs associated with obtaining certifications. 3. **Consumer Confidence**: The agreement ensures that organic products exported from one region meet the same standards as those produced locally, enhancing consumer confidence and trust in the authenticity of these products. 4. **Market Access**: US organic farmers can now export their products to the EU market, while EU producers have greater access to the US market, expanding market opportunities for both parties. 5. **Increased Competition**: The agreement promotes competition among organic producers in both regions, driving innovation and improving product quality. 6. **Economic Growth**: By increasing trade volumes and promoting economic growth, the equivalency agreement has contributed to job creation and increased prosperity for farmers, processors, and businesses involved in the organic sector. In terms of impact on trade between the two regions: 1. **Increased Export Volumes**: The US-EU organic equivalency agreement has led to a significant increase in organic export volumes from the United States to the European Union. 2. **Diversified Markets**: The agreement has enabled US organic farmers and processors to access new markets, reducing their dependence on domestic sales. 3. **Improved Market Access**: EU producers have gained greater market access to the United States, expanding their customer base and increasing revenue opportunities. 4. **Enhanced Trade Facilitation**: The equivalency agreement has streamlined trade procedures, making it easier for organic products to cross borders and facilitating international trade. Overall, the US-EU organic equivalency agreement has had a positive impact on trade between the two regions, promoting economic growth, increased competition, and enhanced consumer confidence in organic products.",9.05E-79,0.213930348,0.06,0.139303483,0.838534772
"Indoors or Outdoors, Horticulture and Holidays Go Together  With the holiday season upon us, you may have missed the recent release of the Census of Horticultural Specialties Report. This Census of Agriculture special study is the only source of detailed production and sales for floriculture, nursery, and specialty crops for the entire United States.   Jodi Halvorson, USDA NASS Public Affairs Specialist  Posted in  Research and Science  Dec 21,   Respond to this story","What Census report provides detailed production and sales data for floriculture, nursery, and specialty crops across the entire United States?",The Census of Horticultural Specialties Report.,"The answer is: The Census of Horticultural Specialties (CHS) report. However, it's worth noting that since 2009, the Census has not conducted separate surveys for the horticulture industry. Instead, they use the more comprehensive Census of Agriculture and the Census Bureau's Economic Census to collect data on various segments of the horticulture industry, including floriculture, nursery, and specialty crops. More specifically, the answer I'm providing is based on the assumption that you're looking for a report that provides detailed production and sales data across the entire United States. If you're interested in a more specific or regional-level data, it might be necessary to explore other sources such as state-specific agricultural surveys or industry associations' reports. To give you a better understanding of how this works, I'll provide an additional answer based on more recent census developments. Since 2017, the Economic Census report has included an ""Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting"" section, which provides data for various segments of the agricultural sector. However, even within that broader category, there are different sub-segments, including floriculture, nursery, and specialty crops.

"Deputy Administrator, AMS Dairy Programs in  Trade  Jun 19,  U.S. dairy exports are currently valued at $6 billion and the country is the world¡¯s leading exporter of skim milk powder, cheese, whey, and lactose products. USDA Photo Courtesy of Scott Bauer. Every June, USDA joins the rest of the country to celebrate Dairy Month. It is a time to thank our nation¡¯s dairy producers and processors for their tireless work to produce quality dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt. Here at USDA, besides getting our fill of our favorite dairy products, we celebrate our nation¡¯s dairy industry every day by finding new markets where people can enjoy their products. This often entails working with other countries¡¯ governments to negotiate export and import requirements as well as helping businesses meet these requirements. Our nation¡¯s dairy exporters reach new markets with the help of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). Export certificates are often the critical piece in the trade puzzle. On this front, AMS offers certificates for more than 80% of the countries that accept U.S. dairy exports. Our Dairy Programs can verify that businesses¡¯ dairy products meet export requirements. The AMS Dairy Grading Branch provides export certificates for products or conditions for which they have documentation for or from plants they inspect. Certificates are paper or electronic documents which describe and attest to attributes of consignments of food destined for international trade. Certification of food may be based on a range of inspection activities including continuous online inspection, auditing of the quality assurance system, and examination of finished products. With the help of export certificates, importers can confidently receive products that meet requirements agreed upon by the U.S. and the importing country. As a result, people all over the world enjoy U.S. dairy products. In recent years, AMS helped open up U.S produced products to several major importing nations. In March , our agency enhanced its system, enabling the availability of electronic sanitary export certificates to China. Now exporters can request their China sanitary export certificates using the Electronic Document Creation System (eDocs). China is the world¡¯s largest importer and is currently the second largest export destination for U.S. dairy products. Working with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the USDA¡¯s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), AMS helped 240 U.S. dairy and infant formula firms get audited and registered to export products to China using our eDocs system. Another example of AMS connecting exporters to new markets happened in when the Customs Union (CU) trade bloc -- composed of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia -- came into existence. A new U.S. ¨C CU dairy veterinary certificate was to resume trade in those countries. Trade was halted in when the CU demanded changes to the current U.S. export health certificate. Negotiations continued until March when AMS was notified that all members of the CU accepted a U.S. proposed export certificate for pasteurized milk products.  The U.S. government interagency team is discussing additional administrative steps before issuing certificates. In addition to negotiating export certificate agreements with other countries, AMS has created a number of resources that will help dairy exporters. We encourage you to check out our Dairy Exports website. We recently held 20 webinar trainings that helped exporters become familiar with our systems. Our sites are equipped with important documents, frequently asked questions, and key contacts. The effort to increase the number of export destinations for U.S. dairy businesses will help continue a positive trend for the industry. In the last 10 years, dairy exports have averaged a 21% increase per year. Currently, U.S. dairy exports are valued at $6 billion and the country is the world¡¯s leading single country exporter of skim milk powder, cheese, whey, and lactose products. AMS is proud to be a leader when it comes to increasing demand for U.S. dairy exports. Whether it¡¯s June or any other time of the year, we are committed to supporting our nation¡¯s dairy producers and processors. We want to make sure that people all over the world can enjoy their quality products. AMS offers a number of services to help U.S. dairy exporters reach new markets.

"Announces Organic Crop Insurance, Other Measure  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .13  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  Washington, May 14, ¨D Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today discussed his vision for U.S. organic agriculture and USDA efforts to ensure its continued success during remarks to the Organic Trade Association. Vilsack announced a number of changes and new initiatives to support the continued growth of organic agriculture, including that the USDA's Risk Management Agency's (RMA) federal crop insurance program will increase coverage options for organic producers this year and provide even more options in , including a contract price addendum as well as new premium price elections for organic crops. Additionally, RMA will remove the current five-percent organic rate surcharge on all future crop insurance policies beginning in .Vilsack also said USDA will be providing new guidance and direction on organic production to all USDA agencies in support of organic agriculture and markets. USDA is now asking each agency to routinely address the needs of the organic sector in their programs and services where appropriate. The National Organic Program has supported the continued growth of America's organic sector, which has been increasing market share each year and now is a more than $30 billion industry. Vilsack noted that accurate is the biggest obstacle for developing better crop insurance options for organic farmers and expressed his desire that Congress help USDA make further progress by renewing the Organic Initiative as part of a new Food, Farms and Jobs bill.""Organic agriculture is one of the fastest growing segments of American agriculture and helps farmers receive a higher price for their product as they strive to meet growing consumer demand,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""These new options will extend the safety net provided by crop insurance and provide fair and flexible solutions to organic producers. Coupled with the new guidance for agencies to support this growing sector, USDA recognizes that organics are gaining market share and is helping boost this emerging segment.""New crop-insurance pricing options will be available to organic producers who grow crops under guaranteed contracts beginning with the crop year. This contract price option allows organic producers who receive a contract price for their crop to get a crop insurance guarantee that is more reflective of the actual value of their crop. They will have the ability, where available and at their choice, to use their personal contract price as their price election or to choose existing crop insurance price elections. This contract price option will be available for between 60 and 70 crops in the crop year and this contract price feature will be available to the majority of insured organic crops. RMA is also changing organic transitional yields (t-yields) so they will be more reflective of actual organic farming experience, starting with the crop year.All crops are being evaluated for establishing organic prices for the crop year. Current pricing options only allow farmers to insure organic crops at the conventional prices, with the exception of eight crops (corn, soybeans, cotton, processing tomatoes, avocados, and several fresh stone fruit crops) that already have premium organic price elections. RMA is working to provide organic price elections for six to ten crops in . Oats and mint are two crops that have already been selected for organic price elections in , and apricots, apples, blueberries, millet, and others are still under consideration.USDA's Agriculture Marketing Service last year announced the Organic Literacy Initiative, a public outreach and employee training program to help connect current and prospective organic operations with appropriate USDA resources. To date, over 14,000 USDA employees have taken the basic training on USDA's role in organic agriculture. The new guidance will further improve USDA agencies' ability to incorporate the needs of the growing organic sector into their programs and services. These combined actions should result in staff better equipped to help organic farmers obtain technical and financial assistance, insure crops and livestock, access research findings, secure loans, develop conservation practices, find current organic price information, and access local, regional, and international markets. Through this effort, agencies will also better understand the scope and rigor of the certification process and how it complements their own programs.Organic certification allows farmers and ranchers to receive premium prices for their value-added products. Over the past 10 years, the number of certified organic farms and businesses in the United States has expanded to approximately 17,750, representing a 240 percent increase since USDA first began collecting this . Similarly, the retail value of the organic industry grew almost 9.5 percent in to $31.4 billion. Organic foods continue to gain market share in the food industry, climbing to 4.2 percent of U.S. retail food sales in .USDA has already made several changes to better serve organic customers, including offering more flexible microloans and improving Federal crop insurance programs. To help open new markets for U.S. farmers and ranchers, USDA has streamlined trade with multiple foreign governments. These trade partnerships allow U.S. organic products to be sold as organic in Canada, the European Union, Taiwan, and Japan without maintaining certification to multiple standards. Expanding the reach of U.S. organic products creates opportunities for small businesses and increases jobs for Americans who grow, package, ship and market organic products.USDA is responsible, under the Organic Foods Production Act of (OFPA), for establishing national standards for organically-produced agricultural products. The National Organic Program has been critical for the development of clear standards and enforcing a level playing-field for organic businesses, which has lead to expanded trade opportunities to create new markets for U.S. organic businesses. These standards assure consumers that products with the USDA organic seal meet consistent, uniform standards.

"Organic Crop Insurance Is Growing in New Ways!  Federal crop insurance provides the risk management tools necessary for American farmers to stay in business after a difficult crop year. They can be the difference between a farmer going under because of a lean year or having a safety net that allows them to keep farming and rebuild.  These tools help farmers who rely on good farming practices for smart land use and preserve economic stability for generations.  And the Risk Management Agency (RMA) has worked hard to extend risk management tools for organic producers. Organic producers were first able to obtain crop insurance under the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of . However, due to the lack of , organic farmers were initially charged an additional 5 percent surcharge and were only able to insure the ¡°conventional price¡± for their crop - not the organic price.  Many organic producers felt the surcharge was not justified and that crop insurance prices needed to better reflect what they received in the marketplace.  Brandon C. Willis, Administrator, USDA Risk Management Agency  Posted in  Conservation  Feb 04,   Respond to this story",What specific challenge did organic farmers face when first obtaining crop insurance and how was it addressed?,"Organic farmers faced a 5% surcharge on their crop insurance premiums and were only able to insure their crops at the conventional price, not the higher organic price. This issue was later addressed, but no specifics are mentioned in the content regarding what changes were made to rectify this problem.","When organic farmers first sought to obtain crop insurance, they faced the challenge of quantifying their production costs. Since organic farming methods are more labor-intensive and require additional expenses for inputs like compost and natural pest control, these costs were not directly comparable to those incurred by conventional farmers. To address this issue, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), now part of the Risk Management Agency (RMA) within the USDA, worked with organic farming groups to develop a method for calculating these additional costs. This approach allowed organic farmers to receive fair compensation for their losses, taking into account the specific challenges and expenses associated with their methods. This development facilitated the inclusion of organic farming in crop insurance programs, enabling more organic producers to manage risk and protect their livelihoods. The process reflected an effort to tailor insurance solutions to meet the unique needs of diverse agricultural practices, contributing to a more inclusive and supportive environment for sustainable agriculture.",2.53E-155,0.255924171,0.028708134,0.151658768,0.858906746

"National Hunger Fellow, and Julie Curti, Acting Deputy Director, USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 30,   What better way to end the day than by uncovering local food powerhouses in the Nation¡¯s Capital! On Wednesday, April 21, , the USDA and HHS Centers for Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships convened to visit two jewels located in Washington, DC: Common Good City Farm of Ledroit Park and Healthy Solutions of Anacostia. Common Good City Farm is an urban farm and education center growing food for low-income residents in the city and providing educational opportunities for all people to increase food security, and improve human health and environmental sustainability.  Common Good City Farm was funded in part by a National Institute for Food and Agriculture Community Food Project Grant. The University of the District of Columbia¡¯s 4-H Club has just partnered with the farm to help their kids learn to grow and eat healthy food.  Supported by USDA, the goal of the 4-H program is to assist young people in developing knowledge, skills, and attitudes that will enable them to become self-directing, responsible, productive citizens.  Common Good City Farm has been successful in part due to strong partnerships with organizations like the 4-H Club, as well as community support from organizations like the Advisory Neighborhood Commission and Mount Bethel Baptist Church. Next, we journeyed across the river to visit a Healthy Solutions youth cooking class. Started by Tanikka Cunningham, Healthy Solutions¡¯ mission is to promote healthy lifestyles in underserved communities.  The students cooked up and ate four delicious dishes that included a fruit salad, a mesclun spring salad, an eggplant pasta sauce, and a tri-colored pasta dish. Healthy Solutions works in Alabama, North Carolina, and Washington, DC to create community-based food systems that allow access to healthy affordable foods.  The organization also focuses on agricultural job creation and training, healthy living education, and youth development.  Healthy Solutions operates a produce coop in DC and sells food to local corner shops in the neighborhood. There are only three major chain grocery stores east of the Anacostia River, so the impact of Healthy Solutions, which brings 10,000 pounds of fresh produce into these communities each month, is critical.  The Obama Administration¡¯s proposed Healthy Food Financing Initiative would send more resources to help bring access to affordable, fresh, and healthy food to communities like Anacostia.

"Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Mar 02,  International School Meals Day raises awareness of the importance of food and nutrition in education and offers an opportunity for students to share school feeding experiences from across the globe. March is National Nutrition Month. Throughout the month, USDA will be highlighting results of our efforts to improve access to safe, healthy food for all Americans and supporting the health of our next generation.  The upsurge in healthy eating and food security campaigns is really resonating with schoolchildren, so much so, that a day has been set aside for youth around the world to share their experiences.  The celebration of this movement ¨C International School Meals Day ¨C draws our attention to the importance of good nutrition for all children. March 3 marks the fourth consecutive year that USDA will partner with the United Kingdom to invite children from across the globe to promote nutrition and school meals, this year focusing on introducing fresh and healthy local fare into their diets. On that day children will connect through social media to share their food experiences and healthy eating habits. I¡¯m looking forward to witnessing the fun first-hand at Glen Forest Elementary School in Fairfax County, Va., where students will Skype with their peers at Washingborough Academy in the UK. I¡¯m sure it will be a great learning experience for the students and me alike. In the last decade the momentum for healthier eating has found a place in the world¡¯s conscience.  The International School Meals Day initiative literally brings together the world¡¯s children to elevate awareness on the importance of nutritional quality in school meal programs while raising universal consciousness of hunger and poverty. As a lifelong school nutrition advocate I am delighted by the progress that¡¯s been made both domestically and internationally to improve the nutrition and well-being of our youth. To see children the world over embrace this health movement is inspiring. So on behalf of USDA I offer a heartfelt ¡°thank you¡± to the organizers of International School Meals Day and all those who participate.

"Director, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Oct 25,  American Indian students at Navajo Technical College, in Crownpoint, New Mexico, are using new lab and equipment to develop the veterinary skills they need to work with large animals. (Photo courtesy of Navajo Technical College) Oct. 20, , is an important milestone in our nation¡¯s history in regards to equity in research, education, and extension. On that date, 29 tribal colleges, representing different histories, cultural orientations, and organizational structures, received land-grant university (LGU) status. Such LGU status gave these institutions¡ªreferred to as LGUs¡ªaccess to federal resources to help improve the lives of tribal students, while respecting sovereignty and promoting self-sufficiency in American Indian communities. In the ensuing 23 years, significant progress has occurred in building capacity at the land-grant system to better serve Native American students and communities. The s are part of the family of land-grants that the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supports through research, education, and extension programs. These programs recruit and retain students in the food and agricultural sciences, enhance economic opportunities and quality of life, improve nutrition and health, and protect natural resources and the environment. The tribal colleges and universities, now numbering 34, are located in 13 states and provide access to higher education to over 80 percent of Indian Country. Collectively, they enroll approximately 20,000 students and provide vital services to some 50,000 tribal community members. Unlike most institutions of higher education, the s teach in a cultural context that empowers students by drawing on the strength of their people¡¯s histories, indigenous knowledge, and traditions. The s provide much-needed high school completion (GED), basic remediation, job training, college preparatory courses, and adult basic education programs. They serve as community libraries and centers, tribal archives, career and business centers, economic development centers, public meeting places, and elder and child care centers. Examples of the strength of community, education, pride, and opportunity abound in Indian Country. Here are just a few: Chief Dull Knife College, in Lame Deer, Montana, developed welding courses to train apprentice welders to find jobs that could eventually triple the average salary of their Cheyenne reservation. At Fort Totten, North Dakota, Cankdeska Cikana Community College provided the Spirit Lake Tribe citizens new extension education that helped reduce diabetes and improved health. The Institute of American Indian Arts, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, is integrating agricultural science into every curriculum, linking them to American Indian worldviews, stories, and tradition. Join me in congratulating our institutions on their 23rd Anniversary. As we look into the future, there is much more work to be done, and the partnership between NIFA and s will continue to grow and be healthy, reflecting the rich history and culture of the American Indian peoples. While respecting sovereignty, we hope all of us succeed in our efforts to serve the people and the land.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  May 11,   The United Kingdom (UK) has long played an important role in U.S. agricultural exports. This history dates back to the completion of the Erie Canal in the early s, which linked the Great Lakes to the Atlantic seaboard, significantly increasing the export of food, particularly Midwestern wheat, to England. To this day, the United Kingdom offers tremendous opportunities for U.S. agriculture and the United States exports more than $1.6 billion annually in agricultural, fish and forestry products to the UK. Many of these products are showcased each year during USDA-endorsed trade shows, such as the International Food Exhibition (IFE), which took place in London in March. Nineteen U.S. companies participated in the U.S. Pavilion, including 11 new-to-market and new-to-export companies. Several U.S. companies were lucky enough to meet with the Olympic Organizing Committee that had a team looking for products to be used at the Summer Olympics in London in . The exhibition produced $469,000 in on-site sales and $1.9 million in projected 12-month sales. Robin Rhea, owner of Slather Brand Foods, Inc., is pictured here during the International Food Exhibition (IFE) in London. During the show, U.S. exhibitors introduced more than 100 new products, ranging from sauces to baby food to ice cream. Delicious sauces are the name of the game for Slather Brand Foods Inc., a new-to-export company who explored export opportunities as part of the U.S. pavilion. Robin Rhea is the owner of Slather Brand Foods, Inc., based in Charleston, South Carolina.

"USDA Tribal Collaboration Strengthens Food Security on Nevada's Indian Reservations  Today in Nevada more than one in four children live in households that cannot reliably provide nutritious meals every day.  This dubious distinction makes it the state with the nation¡¯s fourth highest rate of child hunger.  And for children living on Indian reservations, the incidence of hunger may be even higher. What does food insecurity look like on Nevada reservations?  With few places to shop, reservation residents have very limited access to fresh produce.  Food insecurity not only equates to a lack of nutritious foods available, but also means families must drive great distances to a grocery store.  To cope, families choose more canned and frozen foods that will last until the next weekly or monthly shopping trip, which often means less consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Melissa Baker, Program Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service, Western Region Special Nutrition Programs  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 18,   Respond to this story","What are some consequences of food insecurity for families living on Nevada Indian reservations, particularly when it comes to accessing nutritious foods?","For families living on Nevada Indian reservations, food insecurity leads to limited access to fresh produce, reliance on canned and frozen foods that last longer, resulting in reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables.","Food insecurity is a significant concern for many families living on Nevada Indian reservations. Some of the consequences of food insecurity in this context include: 1. **Limited access to nutritious foods**: Many families on Nevada Indian reservations struggle to afford and access healthy, nutrient-dense foods due to limited economic resources, geographic isolation, and lack of reliable transportation. This can lead to diets dominated by processed and high-calorie foods. 2. **Higher rates of diet-related health problems**: Food insecurity has been linked to an increased risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. These conditions are disproportionately prevalent among American Indian communities in Nevada. 3. **Malnutrition and related health issues**: Children, pregnant women, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to malnutrition due to inadequate access to essential nutrients. This can lead to developmental delays, birth defects, and other health problems. 4. **Food waste and reduced food quality**: Families may rely on lower-cost, high-calorie foods that spoil quickly or have shorter shelf lives. This can result in wasted food and decreased access to nutrient-rich options. 5. **Increased reliance on emergency food systems**: Many families turn to emergency food sources, such as food banks or pantries, as a last resort. While these services provide temporary relief, they often perpetuate dependency and may not address the root causes of food insecurity. 6. **Disruption of traditional food systems and cultural heritage**: For some Native American communities, food security is closely tied to cultural identity and traditional practices. Food insecurity can erode these connections and threaten community resilience. 7. **Increased stress and anxiety for families**: Living with food insecurity creates significant emotional burdens on family members, particularly parents and caregivers. Chronic stress can exacerbate health problems and further undermine overall well-being. To address these consequences, it's essential to develop targeted solutions that prioritize the needs of Nevada Indian reservation communities. Some potential strategies include: 1. **Food assistance programs tailored to local contexts**: Developing programs that account for unique cultural, geographical, and economic realities on reservations. 2. **Supporting sustainable agriculture and food systems**: Investing in initiatives that promote locally grown foods, improve access to nutritious options, and enhance community food security. 3. **Nutrition education and cooking classes**: Providing culturally sensitive nutrition education and cooking skills training to empower families with healthy eating habits. 4. **Increasing economic opportunities and job creation**: Fostering economic development on reservations can help create more stable and secure food environments for families. 5. **Policy changes and advocacy**: Advocating for policy reforms that address the root causes of food insecurity, such as poverty, lack of affordable housing, and inadequate access to healthcare. By acknowledging these consequences and implementing context-specific solutions, we can work towards reducing food insecurity and improving overall well-being on Nevada Indian reservations.",0.012974387,0.104627767,0.056565657,0.088531187,0.847191274

"Boston Beats the Asian Longhorned Beetle  One of the things I consider a highlight of my career and that I will always remember is our successful response to the July detection of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) in Boston, Massachusetts.  As I attended the May 12 ceremony commemorating the eradication of the ALB infestation in Boston and listened to the speakers share their thoughts about what it took to get us there, I had a deep sense of appreciation for the partnership among the state and federal cooperators who worked together to bring us to that day.  It was swift action and continued diligence that protected Boston¡¯s trees from further destruction. APHIS and its cooperators were able to accomplish the goal of eradicating ALB in Boston in less than 4 years.  Thanks also go to a community member who reported the infestation early.  That early detection and report resulted in the loss of only 6 infested trees. But as I celebrate our first victory over the invasive pest in Massachusetts, I am compelled to ask you to remain vigilant in inspecting your trees regularly for signs of the beetle and report any suspicious damage to your State Plant Health Director.

"Child Nutrition Programs, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 21,   If you haven¡¯t heard the buzz, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service¡¯s expansion of the Team Up for School Nutrition Success  initiative is in full swing, with 20 completed trainings and 14 more scheduled for . Team Up offers a unique learning experience that enhances schools¡¯ food service operations through training and peer-to-peer mentorship to school nutrition professionals looking to maintain a healthy environment and encourage strong student meal program participation. What exactly happens at a Team Up training? Ever had an ¡°a-ha¡± or a ¡°why didn¡¯t I think of that¡± moment when a friend shares a really great idea? Team Up is where ¡°a-ha¡± moments are shared among school nutrition professionals and turned into action back via their school meals programs. Let¡¯s break down a Team Up workshop to see how these ¡°a-ha¡± moments transpire. A peer mentor shares her best practices for menu planning during the Wisconsin Team Up training. Best Practice Panel Presentations  Great ideas are meant for sharing. Team Up workshops kick off with panels where participants hear school nutrition peer mentors share their best practices and strategies for issues like increasing school meal program participation, menu planning and financial management. At the Georgia Team Up training, participants share ideas and questions for menu planning and increasing program participation. Breakout Sessions  This is where the magic happens! After listening to best practice presentations, participants break out into small groups for a round of brainstorming and problem-solving around each specific topic, all with best practice ideas in mind. Using the Egan Skilled Helper Model, which uses an opportunity-development approach, school nutrition peer mentors guide and facilitate discussions as participants identify their program challenges and develop solutions with their peers.  During the breakout sessions, participants examine: What is going on in my school nutrition program? What does a better outcome look like? How do I get to the better outcome? How do I make it all happen?  The Action Plan  Participants examined their challenges and solutions and excitement is building around progress and potential opportunities identified during the breakout sessions. What do participants do with all of these great ideas? Peer mentors help participants put their specific strategies and solutions into an action plan using SMART goals, which are defined as goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time©\bound. Participants take their action plan home as a guide to implement their Team Up strategies and solutions in their school nutrition programs.  Resources  Operating a school meals program can be challenging, but school nutrition directors don¡¯t have to do it alone. Team Up workshops invite allied organizations to share their free school nutrition resources that support school food service operations and help create a healthy school environment. Participants can use these resources as they move forward with implementing their action plan in their school nutrition programs.  Networking is another valuable resource Team Up workshops provide, giving school nutrition directors opportunities to develop working relationships with their peer mentors and other school nutrition directors in their state. Many directors who have attended a Team Up training have expressed that they¡¯re not alone and can turn to their fellow director. ¡°I can now see what areas I need to work and improve on in my program. I see that I am not alone in my journey. I have many helpful people that I can rely on for help and guidance. The Team Up training was valuable to me because I am more comfortable talking to my peers. I see I am not alone and I can ask for help.¡± ¨C Rebecca Lusk, Manager/Supervisor, Towns County Schools, Hiawassee, Ga.  After the Workshop  The Team Up workshop may be complete, but the Team Up spirit lives on. After returning home, participants roll up their sleeves, take a deep breath, and take the first steps outlined in their Team Up action plan - and then real life happens. Barriers pop up as action plans are implemented, but there¡¯s no reason to get discouraged. Team Up peer mentors and state agencies are still available should participants have questions or get stuck with their action plan. In addition, USDA together with the Institute of Child Nutrition hosts monthly webinars for school nutrition professionals to expand their knowledge and tools on a wide variety of topics; webinars recordings are made available online for later viewing.  And this is why Team Up workshops are so effective ¨C Team Up encourages school nutrition professionals to continue to network with their peers and problem-solve school nutrition program barriers long after the workshop is completed. No one is an island, and we must team up to make school meals accessible, nutritious and delicious!

"Amy Mazerall and Mydina Thabet, Child Nutrition Programs, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 14,  Food service staff serves barbeque chicken to students. (Photo courtesy of Right Light Photography, LLC) The school nutrition community is celebrating National School Lunch Week from October 10-14. This year¡¯s theme ¡°Show Your Spirit¡± is all about encouraging parents, students and school officials to show their spirit for school lunch. Through the Team Up for School Nutrition Success (Team Up) initiative, school nutrition professionals have teamed up to provide nutritious and appealing meals to students, offering plenty of reasons for all of us to show spirit for awesome school meals! The Team Up initiative, created through a partnership between the United States Department of Agriculture¡¯s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and the Institute of Child Nutrition (ICN), provides school nutrition professionals a unique learning experience.  The initiative is designed to enhance schools¡¯ food service operations by providing training and peer-to-peer mentorship to school nutrition professionals who want to maintain a healthy environment and strong student meal program participation. The goal of this training is to help schools find simple ways to meet the updated USDA nutrition standards from the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act (HHFKA), while increasing the number of students enjoying healthy and flavorful school meals. Donna Harris, the former Child Nutrition Director for Perquimans County Schools in North Carolina, attended the first Team Up pilot training in in the Southeast Region. Harris was seeking better way to engage students in school meals. During this Team Up training, she learned best practices, tips and tricks for increasing participation in school meals through panel presentations by school nutrition peer mentors. After the presentations, Harris joined other school nutrition directors to network and brainstorm on creative solutions for common topics such as menu planning and financial management.  Directors turned their ideas into achievable goals as they created action plans using SMART goals with the help of their peer mentors. SMART goals are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely. In her action plan, Harris wanted to tackle increasing school meal program participation in the district¡¯s middle and high schools, so she set SMART goals to obtain student feedback and create student-approved menus. Back at her district, she conducted two student surveys and group discussions to gauge student preference.  As a result, several new student-approved recipes were added to the menu: barbeque chicken, buffalo chicken wraps, chicken salad wraps and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Although students had not responded well to meals that align with these updated nutrition standards in the past, Harris received positive feedback on the additions once she engaged students in nutrition education, explaining the USDA nutrition standards that schools must follow. In fact, the school¡¯s student government association assisted in explaining the nutrition standards to students.  Harris demonstrated that when students have a voice in school menus and understand the USDA nutrition standards, they are more satisfied and more likely to purchase school meals.  This was evidenced by a notable increase in student meal counts on the days that new menu items were offered. Even school staff provided positive feedback: ¡°the lunches taste good!¡± and ¡°it was delicious!¡± Harris has since retired from Perquimans County Schools, but before her departure, she shared her action plan and best practices learned from the Team Up training with the new director. Harris wanted to see the Team Up spirit live on and encouraged the child nutrition department to utilize the Team Up peer mentorship model to train school nutrition staff. FNS also wanted to see the Team Up initiative live on after the Team Up training pilot received rave reviews from attendees. In , FNS hosted an additional six regional trainings to school nutrition professionals nationwide. The regional trainings were equally successful, and now the Team Up initiative has been expanding to state agencies in .

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Agricultural Research Service, Information Staff in  Research and Science  Oct 26,  Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) employees at the unveiling of the sign for the BARC Student Discovery Garden. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research portfolio.  When George Washington Carver laid out key elements of his blueprint for education, he could never have guessed that the cutting-edge work of 21st century agricultural science would find a 7,000-acre rural home¡ªright in the middle of the maze of highways and high-rises, homes and businesses that make up the Washington metropolitan region. One hundred years after the federal government first began buying huge tracts of farmland, meadows and woods outside the District of Columbia, a group of scientists, researchers, students and other volunteers who work at the sprawling Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) are taking a page out of the renowned scientist¡¯s book¡ªliterally, a textbook. The whole idea, as laid out in Carver¡¯s ¡°Nature Study and Gardening For Rural Schools,¡± is making sure school kids get their hands dirty. In that spirit, volunteers from the Beltsville Area Diversity Task Force and its technology, education and outreach group started planning about a year ago for an unassuming project for students that would echo Carver¡¯s ¡°learning by doing¡± educational philosophy. The idea of establishing an old-fashioned victory garden that would continue outreach efforts to students in local schools seemed to be a perfect match.

The ¡®sororoca¡¯ plant with the wide leaves is a relative of the banana. Although the photo was taken in the daytime, the light is low because the researchers are in the forest understory. Photo by M. Loveless I have lived and worked abroad for most of my adult life, including many years in Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, so it was not too difficult adjusting to life in the Brazilian Amazon. I learned to speak Portuguese in the field; my tutors were the field assistants that I hired locally. The politics of doing research on this species are challenging and complicated. That side of my research has been almost as educational and fascinating as the actual fieldwork.  I¡¯ve been fortunate to live and work in remote forests where there are no villages or towns nearby, no noise or light pollution, no electricity, and no running water when the streams dry up during the dry season. Under those conditions, it¡¯s possible to experience forest life on a very satisfying level. As a plant ecologist, I can observe the daily and seasonal rhythms of growth and dormancy at the level of the forest community ¡ª by that I mean the growth and flowering and fruiting schedules that trees and other plants keep through the year and from year to year. When you are there every day in the middle of it, these rhythms gradually come into focus, and the forest comes alive in a way that feels completely integrated. Many people find it surprising to learn that the Brazilian rain forest and the other tropical forests I¡¯ve worked in are not perpetually wet and steaming. Mahogany only grows naturally in tropical forests that have a pronounced dry season for one-third to one-half of the year. When that happens, the streams dry up, the trees drop their leaves, the understory goes brown, the ticks and deerflies come out, and everything gets wilted in the heat until the rains come back. The most important thing people should know about mahogany is the same thing they should know about other living species that we humans consume ¨C if consumption exceeds supply indefinitely, supply will vanish.

Here's what typically happens: **Leaf Fall and Reduced Growth**: As the dry season progresses, many of the trees in the understory experience a decline in water availability, leading to reduced growth and increased leaf fall. This is because the forest floor receives less direct sunlight due to the taller canopy above, making it difficult for understory plants to undergo photosynthesis. **Increased Fire Risk**: The buildup of dry leaves, branches, and other plant material creates a fire-prone environment. If a spark or lightning strike occurs, these conditions can lead to intense fires that burn through the understory, affecting both vegetation and wildlife. **Changes in Species Composition**: Some species, like herbaceous plants and shrubs, are more sensitive to drought than others. As a result, these species may experience increased mortality, allowing more shade-tolerant or drought-resistant species to thrive. This can lead to changes in the understory's species composition over time. **Increased Herbivory Pressure**: Some herbivorous animals, like insects and small mammals, may take advantage of the increased plant material on the forest floor during the dry season. This can lead to increased herbivory pressure, potentially affecting understory vegetation. **Recovery with Rainfall**: Once the rainy season returns, the understory is expected to recover rapidly. Water availability increases, allowing plants to regrow and resume their growth cycles. The forest ecosystem's resilience helps it bounce back quickly from the dry season's stressors. In summary, during the dry season in tropical forests like the Brazilian rainforest, the understory experiences reduced growth, increased fire risk, changes in species composition, increased herbivory pressure, and eventual recovery with rainfall.",0.025749713,0.087248322,0.060810811,0.080536913,0.858822167
"Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 01,  The adult periodical cicada emerges from its 17-year nymph stage, molts and arises as a winged adult. This spring will see the return of the large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. (U.S. Forest Service photo/ Bob Rabaglia) The buzz this spring has started, and some people may think it¡¯s fodder for a new sci-fi movie. But this year¡¯s spring brings a drama closer to home than you think - the pending emergence of brood II of the periodical cicada. Cicadas are large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. As the male cicadas sing their intense mating songs, some brand it as the sound of summer. ¡°Annual cicadas, known as dog-day cicadas in the U.S., are found throughout the world,¡± said Sandy Liebhold, a research entomologist with the U.S Forest Service¡¯s Northern Research Station. ¡°But the periodical cicadas emerge in massive groups known as ¡°broods¡± once every 13 or 17 years and are completely unique to North America.¡± There are 15 brood cycles, each designated by roman numerals. In the U.S., brood II is on track to crawl out of the ground very soon after a 17-year hiatus. They¡¯ll emerge into one of the most densely populated urban/suburban forests in the world. The mass emergence of brood II into the state and private forests of the tri-state area of eastern Connecticut, upstate New York, and northern New Jersey will sound a bit different than the familiar dog-day cicadas. Male cicadas use a special membrane to echo a series of clicks through its abdomen to attract females for reproduction. In chorus, the brood may sound like an insect-sized fleet of jets preparing for lift off, but the sound should be enjoyed as a wonderful spectacle of the mating ritual in the animal world. Once mated, females will lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind, known in the scientific world as oviposition injury, can be quite striking and lead to ¡°flagging¡± -- the dieback of small limbs. Forest health aerial surveys conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation reported more than 8,700 acres with flagging left behind from the brood XIV emergence on Cape Cod in . The scarring is mostly superficial but can have a mild impact on the growth of individual host trees. However, the mass emergence can benefit the longer, overall health of eastern forests. After mating and laying eggs, adult cicadas die and fall to the forest floor. The nutrients released from the mass decay of the brood create a jolt of healthy nutrients available to forest organisms. Researchers have shown that this pulse of nutrition leads to an increase of beneficial microbes and nitrogen in soil, increased tree growth and more robust wildflowers. Finally, after three to four weeks, the eggs hatch, the larvae wander under the forest floor where they feed on roots and start the process over again. So, why every 13 to 17 years? Scientists have been pondering this ecological phenomenon for centuries. ¡°There is no doubt that by simultaneously emerging at those long intervals, periodical cicadas are able to saturate predators thereby maintaining high population levels,¡± said Liebhold. Recent research also hypothesizes that periodical cicadas emerge when predator birds are at a lower density, suggesting that these amazing insects have queued into a larger ecological cycle ¨C wow! This is what we know but there is still a lot of mystery surrounding these time-travelling bugs. So if you find yourself one of the lucky ones to experience their visit, just sit back and enjoy this remarkable wonder of eastern forests. Michael Bohne is an entomologist and forest health group leader with the U.S. Forest Service in Durham, N.H. After mating, female cicadas lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind can lead to the dieback of small limbs called flagging. Such was the case for these bur oak trees in central Iowa in after a brood emergence of the 17-year cicada.

The unique aspect of the emergence of Brood II of periodical cicadas compared to annual cicadas (dog-day cicadas) is that they emerge in a 13- or 17-year cycle, whereas annual cicadas emerge every year. Brood II specifically refers to a large group of periodical cicadas that emerge every 17 years. This means that Brood II cicadas appear on the same schedule every 17 years, which is distinct from the annual emergence of dog-day cicadas. The 13- and 17-year cycles are characteristic of periodical cicadas, whereas annual cicadas have a one-year life cycle.",0.070650506,0.296875,0.174603175,0.265625,0.883401394

The site was chosen by the Glen Rock Assistance Council and Endowment after input of family members in the community directly affected by 9/11. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry) Living memorials serve as a reminder of fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, neighbors and friends¡ªbut also of the power of community to reflect, rebuild and renew. Our research suggests that living memorials demonstrate the role of nature in contemporary times not only as a symbol, but as an innate and purposeful response to loss that calls forth a common humanity and compassion for others. In other words, they demonstrate how people use nature to be resilient to loss. For 13 years, the U.S. Forest Service has built upon a unique partnership called the Living Memorials Project centered on one of the most significant events in recent history: Sept. 11, , also referred to as 9/11, the day four carefully coordinated terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. That day, two passenger planes hit the World Trade Center¡¯s twin towers in New York City, another flew into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and a fourth originally targeting Washington crashed in a Shanksville, Pennsylvania, field after passengers tried to stop the hijackers. Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, New York, created a memorial grove on the hospital campus. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry) The living memorials project began in when Congress asked the Forest Service to create a program that draws upon the resonating power of trees to bring people together and help foster healing in communities across the nation in response to 9/11. The project includes a grant program to support community-based greening efforts and a research component that developed a National Registry of living memorials across the country. This year, as communities gather to mark the 14th anniversary of 9/11, some will do so at local town memorial parks and gardens ¨C living memorials that pay respect to those who lost their lives and thank thousands more who ran toward the chaos to help. This summer, a team from the agency¡¯s Northern Research Station set out to revisit some of the sites listed on the Living Memorials Registry. Joined by Heather McMillen, an anthropologist and postdoctoral social scientist with the research station, the teams were curious to learn if the sites were maintained. If so, who takes care of them? Did circumstances and other events change the nature of the memorials or had they, over time, stood still? What story could the trees and the landscape itself tell us? From Connecticut's state memorial in Sherwood Island State Park on the Long Island Sound visitors have a panoramic view of lower Manhattan where the World Trade Center once stood. Victims¡¯ families requested a memorial where they could experience the healing effects of water. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry) The sites range from forests such as Sterling Forest State Park in Tuxedo, New York. To beaches, like the Hometown Memorial in the Town of Babylon, New York, as well as city parks, community gardens, traffic islands, waterfront piers, street trees and arboretums. Many of the living memorial sites we visited 14 years ago still remain and continue to serve an important role for their local constituents. When asked, ¡®What are you most proud of here?¡± nearly all of the site stewards responded, ¡°That we did it.  And it¡¯s still here.¡±  Many of the living memorials along the New York/New Jersey/Connecticut coast sustained heavy damage during Hurricane Sandy and were rebuilt and replanted. Some signs at the sites not only recognize a diverse list of supporters but also tell the story of that day from the perspective of local towns and communities, including personal sentiments regarding loved ones lost and for those who survived. In each case, local residents draw upon the landscape to create a place of comfort, reflection and a sense of beauty. As these places age, some areas do struggle with care and maintenance but are not giving up. Many families have planted survivor trees on sites and are eager to find ways to protect them as long as possible.      Updates from the field will be available on the Living Memorials Project website. Memorials created from - are displayed on a National Map that formed the basis of the public multi-media exhibition Land-Markings: 12 Journeys through 9/11 Living Memorials, created in collaboration with Parsons The New School for Design.

In the context of significant events like 9/11, living memorials play a vital role in fostering community resilience and reflecting collective humanity. **Fostering Community Resilience:** 1. **Healing and Reflection**: Living memorials provide a peaceful and contemplative space for people to reflect on their experiences and emotions related to the event. 2. **Community Engagement**: These memorials often involve community members in planning, design, and maintenance processes, promoting social cohesion and a sense of shared ownership. 3. **Environmental Stewardship**: By incorporating nature into memorial design, communities are encouraged to take care of the site and appreciate its beauty, fostering a sense of responsibility and stewardship. **Reflecting Collective Humanity:** 1. **Intergenerational Connection**: Living memorials can bridge the gap between different age groups, allowing families and children to learn about the event's significance through their interactions with nature. 2. **Cultural Significance**: These sites can incorporate elements that reflect local culture, traditions, and history, making them meaningful and relatable for diverse communities. 3. **Evolution Over Time**: As living memorials grow and evolve over time, they become a testament to the community's ability to heal, learn from the past, and adapt to changing circumstances. Examples of successful living memorials in response to significant events include: 1. The 9/11 Memorial & Museum Gardens (New York City): A tranquil oasis amidst the bustling city, featuring two massive reflecting pools surrounded by the names of the victims. 2. Ground Zero's Survivor Tree: A callery pear tree that survived the collapse of the World Trade Center and was incorporated into a memorial garden.

As a result, they may decide to return back home to their rural origins due to a desire for: 1. **Affordability**: The high cost of living in urban areas can be overwhelming, making rural communities with lower costs of living more attractive. 2. **Community ties**: Individuals who have left rural areas often still maintain strong social connections and relationships within their community, which can motivate them to return home. 3. **Agricultural or natural resource-based economies**: The decline of traditional industries in urban areas has led some individuals to seek opportunities in rural areas where agriculture, forestry, mining, or other natural resource-based industries are still prevalent. 4. **Rural revitalization and infrastructure investments**: Improvements in rural infrastructure, such as high-speed internet, healthcare services, and educational facilities, can make rural communities more appealing to those who have left. These factors suggest that individuals who have left rural areas may return home due to a combination of economic, social, and environmental factors.",0.051901765,0.215384615,0.093023256,0.161538462,0.849717259

"The People's Garden Apiary, installed in , is located on the roof of the Jamie L. Whitten Building and has homed up to approximately 80,000 Italian honey bees. USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Bee Research Lab in Beltsville, Maryland, helps keep these colonies of bees strong and healthy so they can pollinate crops growing in the People's Garden and neighboring landscapes. They also produce delicious honey! Beehives are often important elements of urban gardens due to the pollination services they provide. They¡¯re also big business. Honeybees pollinate $ates each year, including more than 130 types of fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Honeybees also produce honey, worth about $3.2 million in according to USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). How are hives constructed? The beehives are wooden box-like sections stacked on top of each other. Each box (or super) holds 8-10 wooden frames which include a thin sheet of wax foundation in each frame. The bees build their combs on these foundations. How is honey extracted? Honey is stored in the combs in the upper parts of the hive. When the bees have filled the combs in the upper section with honey and covered them with wax caps, the beekeeper takes them away to extract the honey. Are honey bees native to the United States? Honey bees are not native to the United States. The scientific name for honey bee is Apis mellifera. Since humans first began keeping honey bees, their principal aim has been the harvest of honey. Beekeepers select the appropriate type of honey bee based on temperament, physical characteristics, disease resistance, and productivity. Italian honey bees were selected for the People's Garden Apiary because they are most often used in commercial beekeeping in the United States. These bees have a relatively gentle disposition and are good honey producers. They are not the most resistant to disease, but they excel in most other areas. There have been some queen survivorship issues in both of the People's Garden colonies, which actually mirrors what's going on in the rest of the country. Queen health is an issue for everyone who buys queens, commercial or hobbyist. The exact underlying reasons for poor queen survivorship is unknown, but the ARS lab is actively researching this problem.","What are some common characteristics of constructed beehives used in commercial beekeeping, and how do they facilitate honey production and harvesting?","In commercial beekeeping, beehives are typically wooden box-like sections stacked on top of each other, with 8-10 wooden frames per super, containing a thin sheet of wax foundation. This design allows bees to build combs for honey storage in the upper parts of the hive, which can then be extracted by the beekeeper when the combs are filled and capped with wax.","In commercial beekeeping, constructed beehives are designed to provide a safe, efficient, and productive environment for bees to thrive. Here are some common characteristics of these hives and how they facilitate honey production and harvesting: **Common Characteristics:** 1. **Standardized Size and Shape**: Constructed beehives have standardized sizes (e.g., Langstroth or Dadant hives) that allow beekeepers to easily manage and inspect the colonies. 2. **Vertical Hives**: Most commercial beehives are vertical, allowing bees to easily navigate between boxes and reducing congestion within the hive. 3. **Boxed Frames**: The frames within the hive are designed with a specific size and spacing to accommodate the queen's brood nest, honeycomb cells, and other bee activities. 4. **Protective Roofing**: Hives have roofs that protect bees from the elements (e.g., rain, wind) and predators. 5. **Portability**: Constructed beehives are designed to be moved easily between locations for inspections, harvesting, or re-locating colonies. **Facilitating Honey Production:** 1. **Easy Access**: The vertical design of the hives allows beekeepers to inspect the colony without disturbing bees, promoting a healthy and productive environment. 2. **Controlled Temperature and Humidity**: Constructed beehives often have insulation and ventilation features that regulate temperature and humidity levels within the hive, conducive to optimal honey production. 3. **Managers' Ease of Inspection**: With standard-sized hives, beekeepers can quickly locate issues or areas for improvement, enabling them to intervene when necessary. **Facilitating Honey Harvesting:** 1. **Frame Design**: The specific frame design allows bees to easily create new comb cells and fill them with honey. 2. **Capped Comb Cells**: Bees store honey in sealed (capped) combs that are easy to identify and extract during harvesting. 3. **Easier Extraction**: Constructed beehives make it easier for beekeepers to access the honeycomb frames, facilitating efficient harvesting. 4. **Minimizing Damage**: Standardized hives minimize the risk of damaging the comb or disturbing bees when extracting honey. By understanding these characteristics and benefits, commercial beekeepers can effectively manage their colonies and optimize honey production and harvesting in constructed beehives.",0.016062236,0.193384224,0.046035806,0.117048346,0.828928053

"It's ideal to have host plants and nectar plants growing in your garden if your goal is to attract butterflies. Selecting what to plant varies enormously based on what butterfly species you wish to attract. Butterflies will roam in search of food and egg-laying sites for many miles¡ªeven hundreds to thousands¡ªof miles. Butterflies lay their eggs on host plants that the emerging caterpillars will eat. Different species of butterflies prefer different types of plants to lay their eggs on. Milkweed and Monarch Butterflies The monarch butterfly however is very specific and only lays her eggs on species of Asclepias - commonly known as milkweed. Each fall, millions of monarch butterflies migrate from the United States and Canada to overwintering areas in Mexico and California and make the return flight in spring. Threats, including loss of milkweed habitat, are having a devastating impact on monarch populations. By planting milkweed you can help save the monarch butterfly.","What is the primary host plant that Monarch Butterfly caterpillars eat, and why is it crucial to have this plant in your garden to support their life cycle?","The primary host plant for Monarch Butterfly caterpillars is milkweed (Asclepias), which is crucial to have in your garden as the caterpillars will only eat this specific type of plant, making it essential for supporting their life cycle.","The primary host plant for Monarch Butterfly (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars is the Milkweed Plant (Asclepias spp.). Milkweed plants are vital for Monarchs because the caterpillars feed exclusively on these plants. The toxins from the milkweed, called cardenolides or cardenolide glycosides, are transferred to the adult butterflies, making them unpalatable and toxic to predators. This defense mechanism helps protect the monarchs throughout their life cycle. Having Milkweed in your garden is crucial for supporting Monarch caterpillars' life cycle because they need this specific plant to develop from egg to pupa stage. Without milkweed, Monarchs cannot complete their metamorphosis, and their populations will decline or become extinct.",0.098773547,0.41958042,0.212765957,0.293706294,0.905744433

It is no surprise that poor nutrition and diet-related diseases are correlated with lower academic achievement, worse health outcomes, and more behavioral problems for kids. We recognize the tremendous work that educators and school nutrition professionals do every day to ensure our children are fueled to thrive. Healthy school meals are an essential element of a quality education and are a part of the solution to promote children¡¯s health. We know that this work is not easy, which is why the Biden-Harris Administration has made historic investments to help schools provide healthy and nutritious meals to students. School breakfast offers the jump start to a great day. It sets the tone for the rest of the day, especially for children. It¡¯s why kids who eat breakfast have increased alertness and improved moods throughout the morning, fostering a better learning experience. What¡¯s more, studies find that students who participate in school meal programs consume more whole grains, milk, fruits, and vegetables during mealtimes and enjoy better overall diet quality. These pivotal updates we are making to school nutrition standards have been shaped by a host of stakeholders, including parents, devoted teachers, school administrators, school nutrition directors, and industry leaders, and are informed by the latest Dietary for Americans. These new standards allow us to take the next step in putting kids¡¯ health at the forefront by:  Reducing the amounts of added sugars in school meals, especially at breakfast.  Making it easier to offer healthy proteins at breakfast.  Scaling back sodium levels over time.  Continuing to emphasize fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains, to give kids the right balance of nutrients for healthy, tasty meals. That¡¯s not all. We are also providing flexibilities to make it easier for schools to accommodate vegetarian diets and the cultural and religious food preferences of students. This way, every child has access to the nutritious foods they desire and deserve to nourish their bodies and minds. We encourage educators to uplift these school meal enhancements as an opportunity to maximize the impact of what they do best ¨C educate. Because it¡¯s that commitment to inspire that enables all students to thrive. For that important gift, our nation couldn¡¯t be more grateful.

"What is a native plant? A native plant is a plant that is a part of the balance of nature that has developed over hundreds or thousands of years in a particular region or ecosystem. Note: The word native should always be used with a geographic qualifier (that is, native to New England [for example]). Only plants found in this country before European settlement are considered to be native to the United States. There are many benefits of landscaping and gardening with native plants including conserving water, protecting soil from erosion, and creating habitat and providing food for many different animals including birds, pollinators, and small mammals. Simply by growing native plants gardeners can bring enormous beauty to a community and joy to its residents. In addition, native plants are easy-to-grow and require minimal maintenance. Fall is widely considered the best time of year to plant native trees, shrubs, grasses, vines and perennials.

"The benefits of trees Trees can provide many benefits in gardens and in urban environments. They produce fruit, like apples, peaches and figs, and also provide shade and wildlife habitat. Food forests support forest ecosystems and connect communities with nature. Trees of different sizes produce nuts and fruit, while their shade can support a variety of fresh, flavorful mushrooms, herbs, and berries. Trees also improve air quality and retain water.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Apr 10,  For many American farms, the apple doesn¡¯t fall too far from the tree. The Robison and Stennes family orchards combined equal more than 200 years of growing apples in Washington. The Robison family has been growing apples in Chelan, Washington since the s. Today, Jake ¨C the fourth generation of the Robison family ¨C lives on the early-19th century plot that was used to grow some of the earliest apples to be harvested in Washington. ¡°It¡¯s fascinating that the land we are farming today has been used for apples since nearly the beginning of apple farming in the state of Washington ¨C a unique piece of history,¡± said Jake Robison. The Stennes family has been growing apples in Pateros, Washington, for more than 130 years, and it continues to modernize its planting, crop management, and harvesting practices. ¡°We¡¯re using self-propelled worker platforms for more efficient work, using robotic harvesting prototypes. Plus, we just purchased our first electric and fully autonomous tractors,¡± Mark Stennes told FAS. Furthermore, the Stennes orchards have several hundred acres of certified organic production methods and practice Integrated Pest Management to minimize pesticide usage. The Pacific Northwest microclimate has enabled growers to experiment with this specialty crop. Robison Orchards produce a wide assortment of apple varieties. ¡°We see Granny Smith, Honey Crisp, Cosmic Crisp, and other varieties as excellent options of high-quality apples for foreign markets,¡± said Dave Robison. ¡°We just got to get them there.¡± Both family farms view the recent trade win of India reopening its market to U.S. apples as beneficial for apple farmers across Washington. The Washington Apple Commission (WAC) and FAS India worked together to regain market access for American apple growers. After retaliatory tariffs were lifted last summer, $10.8 million of U.S. apples were exported to India. This had an almost immediate impact for American apple growers; the market in India opened at the beginning of apple-picking season up in the Pacific Northwest. ¡°Since the tariffs were imposed, other apple origins such as Turkey, Poland, and Iran, took control of the Indian market share, dropping the market share for Washington growers from 53 percent to less than 1 percent in 4 years,¡± Mark shared with FAS after traveling to India with the WAC in December. ¡°Now that the tariff has been removed, we¡¯ve seen Washington gain back some of the market share that was lost. India is now our fourth largest export market.¡± USDA is committed to strengthening U.S. exports of apples and other specialty crops. In , specialty crop exports totaled $24.6 billion. FAS is part of the Specialty Crop Competitiveness Initiative (SCCI), which identifies foreign market access and improves domestic production and processing practices. Growing and exporting Washington apples is a prime example of the future-facing American agriculture USDA is working with farmers to achieve. An example of this is FAS¡¯s recently announced Assisting Specialty Crops Exports (ASCE) initiative, which will help expand specialty crop exports. ASCE investments will enable the specialty crops industry to address the many non-tariff barriers it faces when opening or expanding export markets.

That is the approach that USDA has taken in its partnership with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) National Internship Program. As a current employee with the USDA?¡¥s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and a former HACU intern, I am glad to help continue this tradition. The HACU National Internship Program helps talented students in more than 400 colleges and universities gain valuable experience through paid internships at federal, private, and non-profit organizations. USDA has been a leading organization working with the program, hosting nearly HACU student interns since . I am part of the nearly 46% of former HACU interns who earned the opportunity to stay on board with the federal government after finishing my degree. I accepted the opportunity to continue my career at the USDA after two eventful summers interning with the AMS Commodity Procurement Program. During my tenure as an intern, I applied what I learned in my education and work experience. My time was spent helping develop and implement a new budget tracking system, overlooking a $2.6 million budget, developing budget procedures, and providing support to the daily branch operations. I also got a chance to help develop and implement a new invoicing process using the new Web Based Supply Chain Management System (WBSCM). The WBSCM is now used by AMS to make purchases for the National School Lunch Program and other federal nutrition assistance programs. As I look back on my experience as a HACU intern working at AMS, I really appreciate the way the program works with USDA and other organizations. After applying for the program through my school, the University of Puerto Rico at Aguadilla Campus, HACU placed me in an organization and position that matched my educational background. Working with the Commodity Procurement staff turned out to be a great fit for me. AMS Administrator Anne Alonzo with students at the HACU National Internship Program summer farewell event. Photo courtesy of Karen Comfort, AMS Special Assistant to the Administrator Looking to the future, I am confident that other HACU interns will have similar experiences at USDA and other partner organizations. I recently had the pleasure of attending the HACU National Internship Program summer farewell event where AMS Administrator Anne Alonzo inspired all. She gave the keynote address alongside Principal Deputy Under Secretary for the Department of Veterans Affairs Robert L. Jesse. It was great to hear Administrator Alonzo encourage the interns to be fearless as they carve out their career paths. She also stressed that they can achieve anything when they are passionate about the fields they choose. I am glad to hear that my office will be welcoming two talented HACU interns this fall. I am excited to be able to share with them my positive experiences and encourage them to tell others about the program?¡¥s success with AMS and other USDA agencies. I know that the internship will place them on track for long, fruitful careers and that they will help others follow in their footsteps.

This first-of-its-kind, whole-of-department approach uses a four-pillar approach, working across USDA?¡¥s eight mission areas. These pillars include:  Providing nutrition support from pregnancy to birth and beyond;  Connecting everyone in this country with healthy, safe, affordable foods  Developing, translating, and enacting nutrition science through partnership; and  Prioritizing equity every step of the way. Leveraging the momentum of the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, we are also doing our part to implement the National Strategy (, 201 ) on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. This whole-of-society strategy was designed to end hunger, improve nutrition and physical activity, and reduce diet-related diseases and disparities. And the Biden-Harris Administration remains focused on the Strategy. At a recent White House event, partners pledged nearly $1.7 billion in new commitments cultivated through the White House Challenge to End Hunger and Build Healthy Communities. Our efforts to advance food and nutrition security also integrates the Secretary?¡¥s goal to make MyPlate a household name. As I explain in this video, MyPlate has been our national symbol for healthy eating for more than a decade. MyPlate.gov provides the guidance, tools, and resources that translate the - Dietary into actionable steps anyone can use. We are making our MyPlate materials more culturally, contextually, and linguistically responsive. And we work with more than rategic Partners across a variety of sectors to use common messages to communicate to consumers that it?¡¥s never too early or too late to start eating healthy. We even launched a MyPlate Instagram, which is loaded with healthy eating tips and recipes. Agriculture Secretary Vilsack Celebrates Progress on Tackling Food and Nutrition Insecurity As we celebrate the power of nutritious food, we are proud of all we?¡¥ve accomplished over the last two years, but we know we can do more and do better, together.

These strategies are based on a four-pillar approach, working across USDA's eight mission areas, as described in the provided content.","The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) employs several key strategies to advance food and nutrition security in the United States. These strategies include: 1. **Investing in Nutrition Programs**: The USDA administers various nutrition programs, such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children), and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR). These programs provide essential nutrients to vulnerable populations. 2. **Promoting Local and Sustainable Agriculture**: Through initiatives like the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food (KYF2) initiative, the USDA supports local food systems, organic farming, and sustainable agriculture practices. This approach enhances food access, improves quality, and reduces environmental impact. 3. **Improving Nutrition and Education**: The USDA promotes healthy eating habits through programs such as MyPlate, which provides a simple guide for consumers to make informed choices about their diets. Educational resources are also made available to help individuals understand the importance of nutrition and how to prepare nutritious meals. 4. **Supporting Small-Scale Farmers and Rural Development**: By providing grants, loans, and other forms of support through programs like the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program, the USDA helps small-scale farmers start or expand their operations. This initiative contributes to rural economic development and enhances food availability in these areas. 5. **Enhancing Food Safety and Inspection Services**: The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is responsible for ensuring that meat, poultry, and egg products are safe for consumption. This service conducts inspections at processing plants and monitors the movement of such products from farm to table, protecting public health. 6. **Fostering International Cooperation**: Through its Foreign Agricultural Service, the USDA collaborates with other countries on issues related to food security, nutrition, and agriculture. These partnerships can lead to knowledge sharing, technical assistance, and trade agreements that improve access to nutritious food both domestically and globally. 7. **Advancing Research and Development**: The USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supports research in various areas, including nutrition, agricultural productivity, and natural resource management. This research is crucial for developing innovative solutions to advance food and nutrition security. 8. **Addressing Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability**: Recognizing the interconnectedness of environmental sustainability and food security, the USDA has made efforts to reduce its own carbon footprint and promote environmentally friendly practices in agriculture. This includes initiatives like the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which helps protect natural resources while enhancing water quality and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In summary, the key strategies employed by the USDA to advance food and nutrition security include investing in nutrition programs, promoting sustainable agriculture, improving nutrition education, supporting small-scale farmers, enhancing food safety, fostering international cooperation, advancing research, and addressing climate change. These initiatives collectively work towards ensuring that all individuals have access to nutritious food and healthy diets.",1.86E-155,0.144212524,0.011428571,0.075901328,0.824421287

Unique Varieties at the Headquarters Garden Written by UW-Madison Department of Horticulture and Seed to Kitchen Collaborative There are many interesting varieties around the Headquarters People?¡¥s Garden, and each one has a unique story about where it came from. Visit the tabs below to learn more.  Plant Breeding 101  Have you ever been to the produce aisle and wondered how there got to be so many different types of lettuce? You might be surprised to learn that broccoli, kale, cabbage, and brussels sprouts all come from the exact same plant species. The incredible diversity of produce we have today has been developed over thousands of years, as plants evolved with and alongside humans. Early farmers and foragers would save seeds from plants that had desirable characteristics ?a like big fruits or big leaves, excellent flavor, or the ability to store over the winter?a and plant those seeds again in the spring, repeating the process season after season. Today, the science of selecting and reproducing certain plant traits is sometimes known as plant breeding.  There are several different ways of breeding plant varieties:  Open-pollinated varieties are those whose characteristics remain stable across generations. Older varieties, also known as heirlooms, are examples of open-pollinated varieties that can be saved in your garden from season to season. These varieties will continue to display the same characteristics of the previous generation. You can even select seeds with your own ideal traits!  Hybrid varieties are created by cross-pollinating two plants from different inbred lines. To develop hybrid varieties, breeders first take two populations of plants with desirable characteristics and reproduce them until the characteristics are stable. Then, they cross-pollinate the two populations to create an offspring that has the characteristics of both populations. Unlike seeds saved from open-pollinated varieties, seeds saved from hybrids often look very different from the parent plants, and instead display a wide diversity of traits that were present in the original populations.  Genetic engineering allows breeders to change individual traits in plant varieties by editing, inserting, or deleting gene sequences using different molecular techniques. There are not very many crops with genetically engineered varieties on the market today, although many are used in commercial farming of corn, soybeans, cotton, and sugar beets.  There are lots of interesting varieties around the People?¡¥s Garden, and each one has a unique story about where it came from. Scan the QR code on the variety sign to learn more.  Beit Alfa Cucumber  Native to present day India and southern China, the cucumber has been a staple in Asian and Middle Eastern cuisines for thousands of years. Early cucumbers were likely quite bitter due to protective compounds in the cucumber skin which discourage insects and other pests from eating them. Over the years, plant breeders have selected varieties for less bitterness and better flavor, bringing to the table the cucumber we recognize today.  In the s, plant breeder Hanka Lazarson began working on an improved cucumber at the Beit Alfa kibbutz in northern Israel. She started with the local Damascus variety, which ?¡ãtasted good,?¡À but produced cucumbers that were unevenly shaped and sized. So, she set out to develop a variety that was more uniform in appearance. As she worked to identify plants that made right-sized fruits, she realized that the increased uniformity also contributed to better flavor and texture. In a journal entry, she wrote, ?¡ãOur studies showed that if the cavity space of the cucumber is greater relative to the thickness of the shell. It has a juicier flavor and finer texture.?¡À  The kibbutz knew they had a great cucumber on their hands, and in , Lazarson started distributing the seeds of the new variety in the Middle East, and quickly, around the world. Since then, hundreds of heirloom and hybrid varieties have counted Beit Alfa as an ancestor. Of the variety she?¡¥d defined, she wrote: ?¡ãProductive variety, excellent taste and high yield: these indicate the type we called Beit Alfa Cucumber.?¡À  Beit Alfa cucumbers are small, sweet, prolific, and can be harvested in short order, usually about 55 days from planting. Commonly referred to as a ?¡ãburpless?¡À variety, Beit Alfas have thin skin, few seeds, and lower levels of cucurbitacin, the compound that made early cucumbers so bitter. They are also adaptable to many different growing environments, making them a popular choice among home gardeners.  Nativity Seeds, ?¡ãDamascus Cucumber To Beit Alfa Cucumber,?¡À   Black Beauty Zucchini  The 20th century was a time of massive growth for the seed industry, which used snappy marketing to promote all types of new and interesting fruit and vegetable varieties. For all the pizzazz, it could be difficult for farmers and home gardeners to determine just which new varieties were actual improvements on the seeds they may have already had. Enter the All-America Selections, which rely on a panel of judges and controlled trials to determine the best new varieties on the market.  Black Beauty Zucchini is one such award winner, crowned in for being one of the earliest-ripening and longest-producing varieties of the dark-skinned zucchinis. Black Beauty was bred by John Scarchuk, a plant breeder at the University of Connecticut. Scarchuk received a degree in botany from UConn and began working for the University?¡¥s Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station in . He served in the U.S. Army during World War II and returned to Storrs, where he spent the rest of his career. Each state has an Agricultural Experiment Station, designated and funded by the government to promote agricultural innovation across the country and to bring new and useful plant varieties to the American public. During his time at SAES, Scarchuk bred 7 All-America Selection winners, including Candlelight ornamental peppers, Dark Opal basil, and Table King squash. Of Black Beauty, the New York Times in wrote: ?¡ãThis new variety with a heavier crop and longer season will bring added praise. Black Beauty can be picked when merely the size of a big dill pickle or when large as a cucumber. The flesh is tender, sweet, and buttery?- The more that is picked, the more that is produced.?¡À  Hamilton, Robert. ?¡ãTomorrow?¡¥s Plants on 7 County Plots.?¡À The New York Times,   Hastings, W. Ray. ?¡ãAll-America Flowers Add Vegetables for ??57.?¡À The New York Times,   P¡§¡épalo  While many of the fruits and vegetables we eat result from decades, and sometimes centuries, of breeding and selection, other foods on our plate are not that far removed from those we can find in the wild. Porophyllum ruderale is one of those species, a green herbaceous plant that grows extensively across the Americas, especially in disturbed soils.? Because the herb is used by many different cultures, it has many names, including summer cilantro, killi (from Quechua killki?a), cilantro boliviano, and yierba porosa, which refers in Spanish to the large pores on the leaves that release a strong smell when crushed. Perhaps its most common name in the United States, p¡§¡épalo, comes from the Nahuatl word for butterfly: papalotl. You may recognize other Nahuatl words in our culinary vocabulary, like xococatl (chocolate), tomatl, (tomato), ahuacatl (avocado), chian (chia), and even ch¡§?llip¡§-ctli (smoked chiles, or chipotle).  Indigenous Americans have used p¡§¡èpalo for centuries as a flavorful, fresh addition to foods and as a medicinal herb, and its existence was an important part of the prehispanic diet. Many people still harvest p¡§¡épalo from wild sources or introduce it to certain locations, where it is left to establish itself. More recently, p¡§¡épalo also has been introduced as a cultivated crop on both small and large farms. Farmers who plant and tend p¡§¡épalo tend to favor plants that are shorter stature, less pungent, and have small, round, well-formed leaves, and the seeds from varieties that carry these characteristics are considered prime examples of the species. For this reason, cultivated p¡§¡épalo tends to be smaller and less fibrous than its wild relatives¡§Ca reminder that humans and the foods we eat are constantly evolving with and alongside one another!

The Boss Pumpkin: An Interview with Plant Breeder Lindsay Wyatt  Anyone who has picked out a pumpkin for carving probably has ideas about what makes an excellent Jack O?¡¥ Lantern: a perfect shape, dark orange coloring, maybe a nice, sturdy handle. When Johnny?¡¥s Selected Seeds set out to develop a new Halloween pumpkin, plant breeder Lindsay Wyatt had her eye on many of those same things.  ?¡ãWe take on yield and uniformity and color,?¡À she said. ?¡ãThe handles also have to be strong enough for someone to pick up a pumpkin by the handle and not break.?¡À Importantly, she wanted to breed a pumpkin that was prolific enough for commercial growers to sell at the grocery store. ?¡ãBut we also wanted a pumpkin that would be really nice and lovely for someone to grow in their garden for their kids to carve for Halloween,?¡À she added.  At the Johnny?¡¥s research farm in Maine, Wyatt and her team make over 70 new hybrid combinations every year, selecting the parent varieties that have desirable traits, and combining them via hand pollination. The next year, they grow the resulting hybrids to determine which combinations produce results that meet their goals. At harvest time, they invite the entire farm crew to walk the field and place a flag near their favorites, like an experimental pumpkin patch.  From the beginning, she knew one variety in particular would be a winner. ?¡ãIt was so good the first year, we grew extra the next year to make sure it wasn?¡¥t a fluke. It was almost hard to believe,?¡À she said.  When it came time for the crew to place their votes, there were indeed a lot of flags clustered around one plot. The crew was so enthusiastic about the variety, they thought it should have a name that recognized it for being outstanding in the field. ?¡ãSomeone basically said, we should name it The Boss,?¡À she laughed. ?¡ãAnd we were all like, yeah, that?¡¥s the name now.?¡À  And where did The Boss get its good looks? Wyatt nods to the late University of New Hampshire professor Dr. Brent Loy, who developed over 80 squash, gourd, melon, and pumpkin varieties over his long career. ?¡ãOne of those lines is a big part of The Boss?¡¥ genetics,?¡À she said. ?¡ãSo this definitely would not be possible without public plant breeding.?¡À  Herself an alumna of a public plant breeding program, Wyatt originally studied biology in college before learning about the Plant Breeding Department at Cornell University. Growing up, she had worked summers in her father?¡¥s nursery and always wondered where all the different colored petunias came from, but it wasn?¡¥t until she started looking for graduate school programs that she realized there was a dedicated field of study for creating new and interesting plant varieties.  As for how she made the leap from petunias to pumpkins, she chalked it up to serendipity and the projects available at Cornell and later, at Johnny?¡¥s Seeds. ?¡ãAnd then,?¡À she added, ?¡ãI find that once you start working with any crop, you start to love it.?¡À  Berkeley Tie Dye Tomato: An Interview with Plant Breeder Brad Gates  If you?¡¥re lucky enough to visit a Berkeley Tie Dye plant when it?¡¥s fruiting, it may be obvious how this pink and yellow and green-striped tomato came by its name. In fact, according to tomato breeder Brad Gates, the exchange that dubbed this famous heirloom went down with no words at all.  ?¡ãI was selling tomatoes at the farmers?¡¥ market in Oakland, about a mile from Berkeley, and a guy wearing a tie-dye shirt came over and held the tomato to the middle of his chest. He gave me this funny look like, ??Hey, it looks just like my shirt...?¡¥ I didn?¡¥t realize what a pivotal scene was playing out in those few seconds.?¡À  Now, Berkeley Tie Dye is known around the world for its groovy looks and gourmet flavor. But when Gates started selling tomatoes, he didn?¡¥t even know just how much diversity existed in the crop.  ?¡ãI started working on a Saturday for a friend doing the farmers market about 25 years ago,?¡À he said. ?¡ãI was expecting to show up and have all these red tomatoes to sell. But there were all these yellow and pink and purple ones and people were asking questions about them. I had to force myself to step outside my comfort zone and start tasting them.?¡À  The experience had so intrigued Gates that he decided to grow tomatoes full-time. He started with dozens of heirloom varieties to find the tomatoes that grew well, tasted good, and produced prolifically. ?¡ãWe would get left with a bunch of them at the farmers market and others would sell out,?¡À he said. Naturally, he began saving seeds from the varieties that did well.  ?¡ãWith heirloom varieties, you can save your own seeds,?¡À he said. And because tomatoes are self-pollinating, you?¡¥ll often get a similar tomato year after year. ?¡ãBut once in a great while, you?¡¥ll get a natural cross-pollination, and a couple of plants show up that aren?¡¥t what they?¡¥re supposed to be.?¡À As he was growing thousands and thousands of plants for the market, Gates took some of the new crosses he was seeing and began to grow them out, too. ?¡ãAnd that was how I got into breeding tomatoes,?¡À he said.  Fortunately for the world he did, because he was just about ready to hang up his farmer?¡¥s hat and get a different job. But as he saw people?¡¥s reactions to the new varieties he was breeding, he decided to stick with it. ?¡ãI had the thought, ??At one point, I?¡¥m the only person in the world holding Berkeley Tie Dye.?¡¥ And every restaurant I go to, everyone says, ??Wow, these tomatoes are amazing. So I was thinking, ??Well, the world shouldn?¡¥t be without this.?¡¥?¡À  Gates sells mostly seeds and seedlings now, and you can find varieties he?¡¥s bred in farms and gardens from sea level to seven thousand feet. In fact, he says, when someone grows open-pollinated seeds and saves them from year-to-year, they?¡¥re creating adaptation to challenging environments.  The diversity preserved in the process will ensure that people can feed themselves in all these different places, he added. ?¡ãI?¡¥ve had people tell me that one of my varieties was the last producing tomato plant in a summer in Tucson, and I?¡¥ve had people have good results growing close to the San Francisco Bay, where it?¡¥s always cool and foggy.?¡À  ?¡ãHaving diverse genetics and being able to select again and again in your area, it?¡¥s one of the best things for people who want to grow a garden,?¡À he said. ?¡ãIt doesn?¡¥t take a white coat and a biology degree. Even a home gardener can grow something unknown or something special that you can?¡¥t get at the store.?¡À  All it takes, according to Gates, ?¡ãis common sense and determination to grow a decent number of plants for a decent number of years.?¡À","This article features two plant breeders, Dr. Brent Loy and Brad Gates, who have developed new varieties of squash, gourd, melon, and pumpkin, as well as tomatoes. The article highlights the importance of public plant breeding in developing new crop varieties, citing Dr. Loy's work on over 80 different lines.

"FNS Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Mar 10,  This past February, I attended the Urban School Food Alliance winter meeting in Los Angeles, California, which included Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) sessions focused on child nutrition programs. Participants, which included food service directors from around the country, had the opportunity to ask questions about the child nutrition programs they administer, including the recent updates. Engaging with program leaders and seeing what child nutrition programs look like ??on the ground?¡¥ is important to us. In addition to learning from the group, the meeting was a reminder of the many partners we have that share a common goal of continuing to elevate the role that healthy meals play in schools and for our children?¡¥s future. We spent a day at the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) observing their warehouse and kitchen operations, and meeting with school officials. We also got a taste of the delicious meals LAUSD prepares for students. California was one of the first states to implement a statewide Universal Meals Program for all school children after the expiration of federal waivers during COVID, which allowed states to serve school meals at no cost to students. I commend the California state legislature and all state, county, and local anti-hunger advocates that helped to make this happen. As I travel around the country and visit sites that administer FNS food assistance programs and meet nutrition security advocates that share this passion, I am awed by the tremendous amount of work, dedication, and pride exhibited every day so that children in our communities have healthy, nutritious meals.

Here are some possible effects: **Positive Implications:** 1. **Increased demand for local produce**: With more meals being served in schools, there will be a greater demand for locally sourced fruits and vegetables, potentially benefiting local farmers and reducing reliance on industrial agriculture. 2. **Job creation and economic growth**: The UMP could create new job opportunities in the food industry, such as farming, processing, and distribution, contributing to local economic growth. 3. **Improved nutrition and health outcomes**: Providing healthy meals in schools can lead to improved nutrition and health outcomes among children, which may reduce healthcare costs and improve overall community well-being. **Negative Implications:** 1. **Strain on local food infrastructure**: Implementing a UMP could put pressure on local food systems, particularly if the program requires significant increases in produce procurement, processing, and distribution. 2. **Price increases for farmers**: Farmers may need to increase production to meet the demand from schools, potentially leading to price pressures and decreased profitability for some producers. 3. **Dependence on industrial agriculture**: If not managed carefully, the UMP could perpetuate or even amplify existing issues in local food systems, such as over-reliance on industrial agriculture, long-distance transportation, and non-local supply chains. **Mitigating Strategies:** 1. **Developing partnerships with local farmers**: Schools and the state government can establish relationships with local farmers to ensure a steady supply of fresh produce, potentially promoting more sustainable agricultural practices. 2. **Supporting value-added processing**: Investing in local food processing and packaging facilities could help distribute excess produce among schools and other institutions, reducing waste and increasing economic benefits. 3. **Implementing regional purchasing**: The state government can encourage regional purchasing by establishing partnerships with nearby states or regions to access diverse local food sources, promoting more robust regional food systems. **Conclusion:** While implementing a statewide Universal Meals Program for all school children may have some challenges on the local food system, careful planning and strategic partnerships can help mitigate these effects. By prioritizing local sourcing, supporting small-scale farmers, and investing in value-added processing, policymakers can create a more equitable, sustainable, and healthy food system that benefits schools, communities, and the environment as a whole.",0.043019045,0.325678497,0.109014675,0.187891441,0.856714845
"New Resource Toolkit Increases Consumer Understanding of the USDA Organic Label  Organic is a growing sector, with domestic sales of organic products topping $69.7 billion in . However, consumer research shows that consumers do not always understand what ?¡ãorganic?¡À means and how USDA protects the organic label.  Jennifer Lester Moffitt, Under Secretary, Marketing & Regulatory Programs, USDA  Posted in  Farming  Organic  May 21,   Respond to this story",What impact does the lack of understanding about the USDA Organic Label have on consumer purchasing decisions for organic products?,"The lack of understanding about the USDA Organic Label leads to consumers not always knowing what ""organic"" means and how the USDA protects the label, which can result in confusion and uncertainty when making purchasing decisions for organic products.","The lack of understanding about the USDA Organic Label can significantly impact consumer purchasing decisions for organic products. Here's a breakdown of the potential effects: 1. **Confusion and mistrust**: Consumers who don't fully comprehend what the USDA Organic Label means may be more likely to doubt the authenticity or value of organic products, leading them to question whether they are truly ""better"" or worth the premium price. 2. **Difficulty in making informed decisions**: Without a clear understanding of the label, consumers might struggle to make informed choices about which products to purchase and from which brands, potentially leading to frustration and disengagement with the market. 3. **Overreliance on marketing claims**: Consumers who don't grasp the nuances of the USDA Organic Label may rely heavily on marketing claims made by manufacturers, rather than evaluating the product's actual organic content or production processes. This can lead to a misinformed purchasing process. 4. **Perception of organic as a ""marketing gimmick""**: If consumers perceive the USDA Organic Label as merely a marketing tool, they might view organic products with skepticism, perceiving them as more expensive and less valuable than non-organic alternatives. 5. **Reduced demand for organic products**: Lack of understanding about the USDA Organic Label can result in reduced consumer interest in purchasing organic products, ultimately affecting sales and market growth. 6. **Inequitable market competition**: The absence of clear labeling standards can create uneven playing fields between manufacturers, making it difficult for consumers to compare and contrast different products and brands. To mitigate these effects, educating consumers about the USDA Organic Label is essential. This education should include: * Clearly explaining the meaning and requirements of the label * Highlighting the differences between various organic certifications (e.g., USDA Organic, Non-GMO Project Verified) * Providing resources for consumers to research and learn more about organic products and labeling * Encouraging manufacturers to clearly communicate their production processes and product contents through transparent marketing practices By bridging this knowledge gap, consumers will be empowered to make informed purchasing decisions, ultimately driving demand for authentic organic products and creating a more equitable market.",0.04126323,0.164948454,0.098445596,0.144329897,0.864787996
"Posted by the Food and Nutrition Service's Western Regional Office in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 02,  The first week of August, farmers markets across the nation celebrate National Farmers Market Week, highlighting their role in supporting healthy communities, food systems and stimulating local economies. Throughout the pandemic, farmers markets and USDA partners worked hard to remain safe, accessible outlets for healthy food, as well as a vital marketing outlet for small and mid-sized farmers. Farmers markets put rigorous safety plans in place and the Ecology Center fought to ensure that farmers markets were classified as essential businesses while sharing best practices around pandemic response with the broader farmers market community. More than 4,700 farmers markets and direct marketing farmers currently participate in SNAP, and in California, nearly 250 markets provided Market Match incentives to customers shopping with SNAP/EBT, Pandemic EBT, or Disaster EBT. Market Match is a farm-direct based nutrition incentive program led by the Ecology Center and funded through the USDA Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program and California Nutrition Incentive Program. ?¡ãThanks to local farmers, we have an abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods here in California,?¡À said Jesus Mendoza, Jr., USDA Food Nutrition Service Western Region Office Administrator. ?¡ãAccepting SNAP at farmers markets expands the customer base for farmers and markets, increases access to healthy foods, and encourages sales of locally-sourced produce.?¡À The Visalia Farmers?¡¥ Market (a former USDA grantee) began offering packed produce boxes for preorder online in response to the pandemic.

"Pack It Safe, Pack It Smart: Back-to-School Lunchbox Packing Essentials  You can?¡¥t help but see school supplies everywhere if you?¡¥ve been shopping during the last few weeks. Alongside purchasing new backpacks and notebooks, it?¡¥s essential to also stock up on lunchbox essentials that will keep your child?¡¥s homemade lunches safe: insulated soft-sided lunch bags, two cold sources and insulated containers for hot foods.  Beverly Lopez, Communications Program Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), USDA  Posted in  Health and Safety  Jul 25,   Respond to this story",What is the most effective method to keep homemade lunches at a safe temperature during transport to school?,Use an insulated soft-sided lunch bag with two cold sources and insulated containers for hot foods.,"The most effective method to keep homemade lunches at a safe temperature during transport to school is by using an insulated lunch box with an ice pack. This combination provides optimal temperature control, keeping perishable foods such as dairy products, meats, and fruits/vegetables within the recommended 40¡ãF (4¡ãC) or below. Here's why it works: 1. **Insulated Lunch Box**: A well-insulated lunch box helps to maintain a consistent temperature by minimizing heat exchange between the inside and outside environments. Look for boxes with thick foam insulation, vacuum-sealed construction, and a tight-fitting lid. 2. **Ice Pack**: An ice pack placed in the lunch box serves as an additional measure to keep foods cool. Ice packs can be frozen ahead of time and then used during transport. They help in maintaining a low temperature within the lunch box by absorbing heat from inside the box and transferring it away through the cold mass. 3. **Combination**: The combination of an insulated lunch box and an ice pack is particularly effective for keeping homemade lunches at a safe temperature. This setup prevents bacterial growth that can occur when perishable foods are kept at temperatures above 40¡ãF (4¡ãC) for more than two hours. In addition to using an insulated lunch box with an ice pack, there are a few more tips to keep in mind: - **Pack foods wisely**: Place the most temperature-sensitive items closest to the cold source. If you have both hot and cold items, consider using separate compartments or boxes. - **Freeze water bottles**: Freezing water bottles can be used as additional cold sources within the lunch box. - **Keep the lunch box out of direct sunlight**: Direct sunlight can cause the contents of your lunch box to heat up quickly, reducing the effectiveness of the ice pack and insulation. By using an insulated lunch box with an ice pack and following these tips, you can ensure that homemade lunches stay safe and at a suitable temperature during transport.",1.79E-155,0.074285714,0.022988506,0.057142857,0.831272244

"Acting Deputy Chief, Forest Service Research and Development in  Forestry  Oct 04,  Access to high-quality water will be a defining feature of the 21st century. Record heat waves and drought are not only leading to more frequent and intense wildfires but are also putting one of life?¡¥s most valuable resources at risk: the water we drink. A new Forest Service research report describes how extensively public drinking water systems rely on national forests and grasslands. Water use per person has been declining for decades; however, a variety of factors such as population growth, food production and ecosystem conditions under a changing climate are contributing to overall greater demand for water ¡§C especially in certain parts of the country. In the West, national forests and grasslands supply drinking water to almost 90% of the people served by public water systems. Some western cities, like Aspen, Colorado, and Portland, Oregon, are more than 90% dependent on national forests alone for their drinking water. The story is similar in the eastern U.S., though most of this water is supplied by private forests. Still, more than a century of research has demonstrated that forested lands provide the cleanest and most stable water supply compared to other lands. Within the lower 48 states, more than 99% of people who rely on public drinking water receive some from forested lands. This report is the first of its kind to measure how individual national forests and grasslands contribute to surface drinking water supplies while accounting for networks of pipelines and canals that divert water from the source to areas of high need, also known as ?¡ãinter-basin water transfers.?¡À These inter-basin transfers are incredibly important sources of drinking water, especially in the West, where cities like Los Angeles receive more than two-thirds of their water from forested lands in California and Colorado. By showing where our drinking water comes from at a fine scale, this report supports USDA?¡¥s Wildfire Crisis Strategy, and work supported by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. It helps land managers prioritize forests and watersheds for hazardous fuels reduction, watershed management, and restoration treatments that protect people, communities and resources across the country.

Ecologist Kate Mohatt leads a walk for the public to identify all mushrooms fruiting in the valley in . (U.S. Forest Service/ Mona Spargo) While many people look forward to fall for football rivalries and tailgate parties, others enjoy a different pastime ?a foraging for fall?¡¥s crop of fungi. In Alaska, the season?¡¥s fungi festivals will find enthusiasts lined up for hikes into the woods to search for lichens and forage for mushrooms. In September, the Wrangell Ranger District on the Tongass National Forest hosted a two-day event near the Rainbow Falls Trail. Karen Dillman, the forest?¡¥s ecologist, and Kate Mohatt, an ecologist from the Chugach National Forest, shared a variety of tips and information on fungi with locals and visitors including information profiled in the video ?¡ãThe Mushroom Maven of the Chugach National Forest.?¡À What are the differences between edible and poisonous mushrooms? The pair described how to look for telling of the mushrooms after they are cut open, as well as the distinctive features of the caps and ridges. The Chugach National Forest sponsors two annual mushroom festivals to celebrate the variety of fungal species that grow in the rainy woods of south-central Alaska. Mushrooms with names like ?¡ãchicken in the woods?¡À are popular with attendees to the Girdwood Fungus Fair on the Glacier Ranger District in August, and the Cordova Fungus Festival on the Cordova Ranger District in September. During the Girdwood festival, Mohatt addressed the competiveness of mushroom hunters and their desire to keep their best hunting spots secret. She also described how to find those special mushrooms that can be worked into culinary masterpieces and how to avoid those that can cause gastrointestinal distress ¡§C or worse. The festival included mushroom hikes and dye-making classes. A Fungus Fair Formal was held in the Alyeska Resort Ballroom with a five-course gourmet meal highlighting and featuring different ways of using and enjoying mushrooms. The Cordova Ranger District participated in daily guided forays into the woods, and staffed mushroom identification tables to help mushroom hunters identify different species. Mohatt was featured in the video, I Am a Mushroom Hunter, as part of a new statewide series Indie Alaska by Alaska Public Media/PBS. Mohatt and Dillman also were part of creating Mushrooms of the National Forests in Alaska, a free, online brochure created by the Forest Service.

Sockeye salmon need freshwater rivers or lakes to spawn, migrate, and grow, while many agricultural crops rely on irrigation systems or rainfall to thrive. 2. **Seasonal Variability**: Both have seasonal cycles that impact their growth patterns. For sockeye salmon, this means migration and spawning in the summer and early fall, while for agricultural crops, it's about planting, growing, and harvesting during specific seasons (e.g., spring, summer, or autumn). 3. **Nutrient Cycle Dependency**: Sockeye salmon rely on nutrient-rich waters to grow, which often come from decomposed organic matter, such as algae or plankton. Similarly, many agricultural crops depend on nutrient-rich soil for their growth and productivity. 4. **Vulnerability to Water Quality and Quantity Changes**: Both sockeye salmon and agricultural crops are sensitive to changes in water quality (e.g., temperature, pH, salinity) and quantity (e.g., droughts or floods). This can have significant impacts on their populations, yields, or even survival. 5. **Interconnectedness with Ecosystems**: As living organisms, both sockeye salmon and agricultural crops interact with and influence the surrounding ecosystems in various ways.

By reducing these pollutants, farmers can expect improved crop growth, higher yields, and better fruit and vegetable quality. 2. **Improved Soil Quality**: Air pollution can acidify soils, making them less productive. Lower levels of air pollutants like SO2 and NOx will help maintain soil pH balance, improve nutrient cycling, and reduce the need for fertilizers. 3. **Reduced Fertilizer Use**: Cleaner air reduces the leaching of nitrogen from soil, minimizing fertilizer overuse. This leads to lower costs for farmers, reduced environmental impacts (like water pollution), and improved crop quality. 4. **Increased Nutrient Uptake**: Cleaner air promotes healthy plant growth by increasing nutrient uptake, leading to more robust and resilient crops. 5. **Enhanced Farm Efficiency**: Improved agricultural productivity leads to increased farm efficiency, allowing farmers to produce more with fewer resources, reducing waste, and enhancing overall sustainability. 6. **Better Pest Management**: Reduced air pollution can lead to healthier ecosystems, making it easier for farmers to manage pests and diseases naturally, without relying on chemical pesticides or fungicides. 7. **Increased Water Availability**: By protecting soil health and water quality, reduced air pollution ensures that more rainwater is absorbed into the soil instead of being lost as runoff, improving irrigation efficiency and crop growth. By reducing air pollutants, governments and agricultural stakeholders can create a more favorable environment for crops to grow, leading to increased productivity, improved resource management, and enhanced sustainability in agriculture.",0.010693582,0.088737201,0.041237113,0.075085324,0.835056603

Some of these strategies include: 1. **Watershed Management**: This involves managing watersheds as a single unit, considering the entire catchment area, including rivers, lakes, and groundwater. It helps to reduce pollution by identifying and mitigating sources of contamination. 2. **Green Infrastructure**: Incorporating green spaces like parks, gardens, and rooftop gardens into urban planning can help absorb stormwater runoff, filter out pollutants, and maintain water quality. 3. **Wastewater Treatment Upgrades**: Investing in modern wastewater treatment technologies and practices is crucial for removing contaminants from treated effluent before it's released back into rivers or the ocean. Techniques like membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are being used to improve efficiency. 4. **Rainwater Harvesting**: Collecting and reusing rainwater can significantly reduce stormwater runoff, which often carries pollutants into waterways. This approach encourages sustainable practices and reduces pressure on municipal water supplies. 5. **Porous Pavement and Green Roofs**: These technologies allow rainwater to percolate through the ground or be retained locally rather than running off into waterways, reducing stormwater pollution and urban flooding risks. 6. **Wetland Restoration and Creation**: Restoring wetlands or creating artificial ones can help in removing pollutants from water bodies as they act as natural filters for water entering them. 7. **Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs)**: These technologies use oxidants such as ozone, hydrogen peroxide, or UV radiation to break down recalcitrant contaminants that conventional wastewater treatment processes cannot handle effectively. 8. **Water Recycling and Reuse**: Implementing systems to recycle and reuse water can significantly reduce the demand on potable water sources while decreasing the volume of wastewater needing treatment, thus improving overall water quality management. 9. **Monitoring and Enforcement Technologies**: Utilizing advanced sensors and monitoring systems along with more stringent regulations and enforcement mechanisms are essential for tracking pollution sources and enforcing compliance among polluters. 10. **Public Awareness and Education**: Educating communities about the importance of clean water practices and involving them in decision-making processes can foster a culture of sustainability, encouraging collective efforts to protect water resources. Implementing these strategies requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving government agencies, private sector entities, community organizations, and citizens working together towards common goals.",0.027696156,0.169811321,0.056872038,0.117924528,0.827858925

"Administrator, Farm Service Agency in  Conservation  Mar 02,  FSA Administrator Val Dolcini speaks at the National Pheasant Fest and Quail Classic. I recently attended the National Pheasant Fest and Quail Classic in Des Moines, Iowa, where I met with sportsmen, farmers, young people, wildlife biologists and others who are committed to strengthening wildlife habitat throughout America. It was exciting to see firsthand the passion for the native and restored grasslands and woodlands that typify the rural American landscape. I had the honor of speaking to the group, where I highlighted the 30th anniversary of USDA?¡¥s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).? CRP, one of the largest private lands conservation programs in the nation, is designed to reduce soil erosion, improve water and air quality, and provide habitat for wildlife. Interested landowners can establish long-term USDA-approved grasses or trees in exchange for USDA helping with the cost of establishing the plants and providing annual payments for 10 to 15 years. The covers along fields, streams and rivers prevent soil and nutrients from washing into waterways, reduce soil erosion that may otherwise contribute to poor air and water quality, and provide valuable habitat for wildlife. Since its enactment in , CRP has prevented more than 8 billion tons of soil from eroding, protected more than 170,000 stream miles with riparian and grass buffers, and provided more than 100,000 acres of bottomland hardwood trees and nearly 300,000 acres of flood-plain wetlands.? It has also created more than 250,000 acres each for duck nesting habitat and upland bird habitat. Although this is a federal program, this 30-year record of accomplishment was not achieved by USDA alone.? Partnerships with state, local, and nongovernmental organizations are the foundation upon which these important achievements have been built. Howard Vincent, Pheasant Forever and Quail Forever?¡¥s President and Chief Executive Officer (left) and FSA Administrator Val Dolcini sign an agreement establishing a framework of cooperation between Pheasants Forever and USDA agencies, including Farm Service Agency and Natural Resources Conservation Service, to maintain and enhance the productivity of pheasant, quail, and other wildlife habitats on private and public lands. That?¡¥s why I joined Howard Vincent, Pheasant Forever and Quail Forever?¡¥s President and Chief Executive Officer, in signing an agreement to continue the longtime framework of cooperation between Pheasants Forever and USDA agencies, including the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), to maintain and enhance pheasant, quail, and other wildlife habitat on private and public lands.? These joint efforts include habitat conservation and restoration, scientific assistance, educational materials, and research collaboration. In addition, this five-year commitment helps support Pheasants Forever?¡¥s Farm Bill biologist program at local USDA offices nationwide. Given the strong relationships Pheasants Forever has with farmers and ranchers across the country, including their significant contribution toward the successful sage grouse and lesser prairie chicken initiatives launched by USDA, we are pleased to renew our partnership. On behalf of my colleagues at USDA, I want to thank everyone who plays a role in making conservation programs like CRP so successful, and for helping make rural America, with its diverse flora and fauna, its abundant natural resources and its beautiful natural landscapes, better than we have ever known.

"KY Rural Development, Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  Aug 22,   Dozens of people gathered in Monticello, Ky., on Wednesday to break ground on a project in which five local families began the process of building their own homes. Great partnerships can lead to great projects ¡§C and this event highlighted several strategic partners that worked incredibly hard to make it happen, including USDA Rural Development, Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation, Southern Tier Housing Corporation, the Federation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises (FAHE) and the families of Pedro and Omaira Ruiz, Mary and Silvino Castillo, Yvonne Hernandez, Brenda McGuire and Patsy Perdue. Five families will become homeowners thanks to Rural Development?¡¥s Mutual Self-Help and 502 Direct Loan programs. The families, from left, are Yvonne Hernandez, Pedro and Omaira Ruiz, Mary and Silvino Castillo, Brenda McGuire and Patsy Perdue. This project began several years ago when Kentucky Highlands received a Rural Development Section 523 Mutual Self Help Housing grant for $250,000 in April . That money was designated for technical assistance to help 12 families that wanted to help build new homes. The selected families also were approved for Rural Development 502 Direct Loan funds, in addition to forgivable loans from FAHE, to pay for the cost of building the homes. The self-help housing ?¡ãsweat equity?¡À concept is not new. Organized self-help housing started with the Quakers a number of years ago. This became a tradition of rural people, who had the determination and help of neighbors, to construct barns, homes and schools that became American?¡¥s rural communities. The Section 523 program is used primarily to help very low and low-income households build their own homes and is targeted to families who are unable to buy clean, safe housing through conventional methods. Families participating in a mutual self-help project perform approximately 65 percent of the construction labor on each other?¡¥s homes under qualified supervision, and the reduced labor costs make it easier for the families to own a home. Another great advantage of this program is that mortgage payments can be ?¡ãrolled into?¡À the loan for families who can?¡¥t afford to make them while the house is being built.

"Administrator, Farm Service Agency in  Conservation  May 01,   Farmers and ranchers were among the first to practice conservation. It?¡¥s not surprising when you think about it. They?¡¥ve always understood the importance of caring for our land and water, and they depend on our natural resources for their livelihoods. They?¡¥re at the forefront of our country?¡¥s efforts to keep the land healthy, productive and resilient. And we?¡¥re proud to partner with them in that effort. This year, we?¡¥re celebrating two more conservation milestones: the 30th anniversary of USDA?¡¥s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), one of the largest private lands conservation programs in the nation; and registering the 1 millionth acre in CRP?¡¥s State Acres for Wildlife Enhancement (SAFE) initiative. The 1 millionth acre is part of the Coteau-Drift SAFE, located in North Dakota. The state has a total of four SAFE projects, covering over 122,000 acres.? The projects are helping a wide range of species ¡§C from pheasants, grouse, prairie-chicken, grey partridge, deer and other game animals ¡§C flourish and grow. The Coteau-Drift SAFE is designed to register more than 69,000 acres in the state?¡¥s Missouri Plateau and Drift Prairie region to support waterfowl, shorebirds and terrestrial birds.? Through SAFE, state agencies, nonprofit conservation organizations, and even local groups work together to identify at-risk wildlife, and to submit proposals to USDA for review.? Once approved, agricultural producers within an approved SAFE area can voluntarily enroll acres in 10 to 15 year contracts. In exchange, USDA provides annual rental payments, incentives, and cost-share assistance for establishing plant species that attract wildlife. There are now 98 SAFE habitat partnerships in 37 states and Puerto Rico. And the numbers don?¡¥t end there. Each year, through CRP programs, we work with hundreds of thousands of farmers and ranchers to implement voluntary conservation practices on their operations. CRP, one of the largest private lands conservation programs in the nation, provides significant economic and environmental benefits to hundreds of rural communities. CRP initiatives, like SAFE, encourage federal, state and local partnerships, showing us that when we all work together, everyone benefits.

"Farm Service Agency Administrator in  Conservation  Nov 13,  Sample FSA County Committee election ballot. This is a great time of the year for the Farm Service Agency (FSA), not just because of another successful American harvest, but because of the opportunity for agricultural communities throughout the country to vote for officials to represent them on FSA County Committees. In my first year as FSA Administrator, I?¡¥ve traveled to 32 states and visited with farmers and ranchers from California to Maine. I know firsthand the impact of successfully delivered farm programs in rural communities all across this great nation. Working with county committee members while serving as FSA state executive director for California and now as Administrator, I have a deep appreciation for the essential role these farmer-elected committees play in connecting FSA with the needs of local producers. County committees have been making a difference for producers for more than eight decades.? They were originally established back in to ensure that local producers could provide input to the federal programs that offered financial assistance to farmers.? Today, nearly 7,700 FSA county committee members serve nationwide by applying their knowledge and judgment to make important decisions on commodity support programs, conservation programs, indemnity and disaster programs, emergency programs and eligibility.? Each county committee has three to 11 elected members who serve three-year terms and one-third of county committee seats are up for election each year. Producers elected to committees have always played a vital role in local agricultural decisions. They are essential to the daily operation of nearly 2,200 offices across the country. It is a valued partnership that helps us better understand the needs of the farmers and ranchers we serve. That is why I am encouraging all eligible producers to vote during this year?¡¥s county committee elections. Through your vote, you are selecting someone from your county who will provide critical local input on FSA programs.? The elections began Nov. 9, with the mailing of ballots to all eligible producers. Ballots must be completed and returned to the county office or postmarked by Dec. 7 to be counted. Voters who did not receive a ballot this week can pick one up at their local FSA office. To learn more, visit www.fsa.usda.gov/elections.? Make your vote count!  Category/Topic:  Conservation  Tags:  Farm Service Agency County Committee  FSA  Producers  Val Dolcini",What specific steps can a producer take to ensure their voice is represented in local agricultural decisions through the Farm Service Agency's county committee elections?,* Vote during this year's county committee elections by completing and returning their ballot to the county office or postmarking it by Dec. 7. * Pick up a ballot at their local FSA office if they did not receive one in the mail. * Visit www.fsa.usda.gov/elections for more information about the election process.,"To ensure their voice is represented in local agricultural decisions through the Farm Service Agency's (FSA) county committee elections, producers can take the following specific steps: 1. **Verify Eligibility**: Producers must meet the eligibility requirements set by the FSA to participate in the county committee elections. These requirements typically include being a producer of an agricultural commodity, owning or operating land in the county, and meeting certain financial criteria. 2. **Get Involved Early**: Familiarize yourself with the election process, timelines, and requirements well in advance. This includes understanding the different types of producers (farmers, ranchers, landowners, etc.) who are eligible to vote and participate. 3. **Form a Producer Group**: Organize or join other local producers to form a group that can collectively advocate for their interests. This collaborative approach can help amplify their voice and increase their influence in the decision-making process. 4. **Build Relationships with Local FSA Staff**: Develop strong relationships with the FSA staff at the county office. They often provide valuable insights into the election process, and building these connections can facilitate communication between producers and the committee. 5. **Attend County Meetings and Hearings**: Regularly attend county meetings, hearings, and other events where FSA-related topics are discussed. This helps producers stay informed about local issues, network with others, and demonstrate their interest in participating in decision-making processes. 6. **Seek Guidance from Local Extension Services or Agricultural Organizations**: Reach out to local extension services (e.g., Cooperative Extension) or agricultural organizations for guidance on the election process, as well as resources and support specific to producer representation. 7. **Identify Strong Candidates**: Identify qualified candidates who share the values and goals of the local agricultural community. These individuals should be knowledgeable about local issues, have experience working with farmers and ranchers, and demonstrate a commitment to representing their constituents' interests. 8. **Campaign and Promote Your Candidate**: Once you've identified strong candidates, help promote them through various channels (e.g., social media, direct mail, in-person conversations). This can involve highlighting their qualifications, experience, and commitment to serving the community's agricultural interests. 9. **Voting and Participation**: Make sure to cast your vote in county committee elections and participate in decision-making processes when possible. Encourage other eligible producers to do the same, as collective participation enhances the group's influence and ensures their voices are heard. 10. **Follow Up and Monitor Progress**: After the election, follow up with newly elected committee members to ensure they are aware of your concerns and interests. Regularly monitor the committee's decisions and actions to guarantee that their representation aligns with the values and goals of local agricultural producers. By taking these specific steps, producers can increase their chances of having a voice in local agricultural decisions through FSA county committee elections.",4.17E-79,0.131021195,0.034816248,0.08477842,0.815240383
"Clearer Air Awaits You in Wilderness Areas Across the Country  Visitors to wilderness areas treasure the stunning vistas and pristine scenery.

As rural communities search for new and viable economic approaches, it is becoming clear that one core component of many successful rural communities is the presence of vibrant arts and cultural opportunities. Last month I had the opportunity to speak about rural arts initiatives and how USDA Rural Development is engaged with local communities and private foundations to provide awareness of our infrastructure programs and how they can assist in supporting local cultural strategies. At the Americans for the Arts annual meeting I had the honor of representing USDA on two panels where our Rural Development programs were part of the mix.? The sessions included discussion of ArtPlace, a consortium of national and regional foundations, and their efforts to support rural communities. Projects in Lanesboro, Minnesota and Ajo, Arizona are recent ArtPlace grantees, and we had the opportunity to explore ways in which USDA?¡¥s infrastructure programs might be able to leverage this new boost of philanthropic support as these communities work to demonstrate how cultural development is an essential ingredient for rural communities in the next generation. One recent example demonstrating strategic alignment between foundations and USDA is an artist housing project in downtown Minot, North Dakota.?? The Magic City Lofts received an ArtPlace grant in to help complete construction of the building.? And this June, one of the new tenants in the building, the Turtle Mountain Tribal Arts Association received a $97,000 USDA Rural Business Enterprise Grant for technical assistance associated with establishing a storefront gallery for tribal artists in the new building. The conference also allowed USDA to discuss our various programs and those of other federal agencies.? Our ongoing collaboration with the Partnership for Sustainable Communities is one way the Obama Administration is supporting rural areas. Last year?¡¥s Rural Jobs Accelerator grants were a call to promote regional approaches to economic development, and one of the successful grantees involved a regional cultural strategy in SW Virginia centered on the Crooked Road Heritage Trail.? The project involved funding from USDA, the Economic Development Administration, and the Appalachian Regional Commission. Construction continues at the Sonoran Desert Retreat Center in Ajo, Arizona which was a recent recipient of an ArtPlace grant from national foundations. USDA has also provided funding to the Center over the years, including a community facility grant for the courtyard garden in foreground. Photo courtesy of Tracy Taft. A similar set of conversations was had at the Rural Arts and Culture Summit in Morris, Minnesota where the Center for Small Towns at the University of Minnesota-Morris, played a gracious host.?? Organized by Springboard for the Arts?¡¥ field office in Fergus Falls, this remarkable gathering involved over 200 arts leaders focused on ensuring that rural arts and culture remain a viable component of the state?¡¥s rural communities.? The Summit was another example of how philanthropies, such as the McKnight and Mardag foundations, are key partners in supporting the rural cultural economy. One project that caught my eye was the Franconia Sculpture Park in Taylors Falls, Minnesota.? ?Visiting Franconia is a remarkable experience.?? Artists-in-Residents use their time onsite to build large sculptures that are then placed on display for free public viewing on a 20 acre site amidst the farmland.? Franconia, and its employees and artist residents, though more importantly its thousands of visitors, provide a noteworthy boost to the rural communities of Taylors Falls, MN and St Croix Falls, WI, the latter of which is home to a vibrant local performance theater, the St Croix Festival Theater. ??These engaging destinations struck me a wonderful places to help urban visitors gain a greater appreciation of how cultural enterprises help sustain rural communities. ?¡ãFranconia Sculpture Park in Taylors Falls, MN is a jewel amidst the farms and provides extra economic boost to the surrounding rural communities as well as cultural enrichment to both local residents and visitors from the Twin Cities.?¡À Photo courtesy of Franconia Sculpture Park.

Insects, like aphids, whiteflies, and beetles, feed on plant sap from these host plants. At the same time, they can transmit plant viruses or other pathogens while feeding. Here's how it works: 1. **Insect vectors**: Aphids, whiteflies, and beetles become infected with plant viruses when they feed on an infected plant. The virus is transmitted through their saliva as they feed. 2. **Vector plant-to-plant transmission**: When these infected insects visit a healthy host plant, such as lettuce or melons, the virus can be transferred to the new plant via the insect's saliva. This process is called vector-mediated transmission. 3. **Infection spread**: As the infected insects move between plants, they can spread the disease-causing pathogens within the agricultural area. Some common diseases transmitted through this mechanism include: * Lettuce mosaic virus (LMV) in lettuce * Melon aphid-borne yellows virus (MABYV) in melons Therefore, controlling insect populations and using integrated pest management techniques are essential for reducing the spread of these plant viruses.",0.037965282,0.243243243,0.127272727,0.171171171,0.854942739

"Improving Health & Nutrition for Black Americans  As I reflect on Black History Month, I think about the tremendous accomplishments and contributions made by Black Americans. I think of the past, present and future to acknowledge how far we?¡¥ve come, where we are now, and the challenges ahead.  Dr. Chavonda Jacobs-Young, Under Secretary, Research, Education, and Economics & USDA Chief Scientist  Posted in  Research and Science  Feb 28,   Respond to this story",What impact does soil conservation have on crop yields in African American communities?,"There is no direct answer to the question according to the provided content. However, a related concept mentioned is ""Improving Health & Nutrition"" which might be indirectly linked to crop yields and soil conservation, but it's not explicitly stated.","Soil conservation has a positive impact on crop yields in African American communities in several ways: 1. **Increased Crop Yields**: By implementing soil conservation practices such as contour farming, terracing, and cover cropping, African American farmers can reduce soil erosion and improve soil fertility, leading to increased crop yields. 2. **Improved Soil Health**: Soil conservation helps maintain the health of the soil, which is essential for plant growth. Well-managed soils tend to have better water-holding capacity, improved aeration, and higher nutrient levels, all of which contribute to healthier plants and higher yields. 3. **Reduced Crop Losses**: By minimizing soil erosion, African American farmers can reduce crop losses due to runoff and sedimentation. This means that more crops are harvested, and fewer resources are wasted. 4. **Increased Food Security**: With increased crop yields, African American communities can achieve greater food security, as more people have access to fresh, locally grown produce. 5. **Supports Sustainable Agriculture**: Soil conservation aligns with the principles of sustainable agriculture, which emphasizes long-term productivity, environmental stewardship, and social equity. By adopting soil conservation practices, African American farmers can contribute to a more sustainable food system that benefits both their communities and the environment. However, it is essential to acknowledge that historical agricultural injustices, such as land dispossession, discriminatory policies, and limited access to resources, have hindered the development of African American agriculture in many areas. These systemic barriers have made it challenging for African American farmers to adopt soil conservation practices and reap their benefits. To address these disparities, initiatives promoting equitable access to resources, education, and technical support are crucial. Community-led projects, policy reforms, and collaborations between government agencies, non-profit organizations, and farming communities can help overcome historical injustices and promote the adoption of soil conservation practices among African American farmers. By doing so, we can improve crop yields, increase food security, and support sustainable agriculture in these communities.",1.63E-155,0.100840336,0.011267606,0.072829132,0.824253261

"ARS Office of Communications in  Research and Science  Jan 17,  It may be winter, but it is still possible to access fresh, locally-grown produce. How? With aquaponics. Americans and people living around the world can grow crops year-round in a soilless hydroponic environment regardless of their regions?¡¥ climate or season. It also has the added benefit of supplying fresh fish to the local food system. ?¡ãAquaponics is a blend of aquaculture and hydroponics, and is the most rapidly growing segment of global agriculture,?¡À said Carl Webster, research biologist at the Agricultural Research Service?¡¥s (ARS) Harry K. Dupree Stuttgart National Aquaculture Research Center in Arkansas. The aquaponics system begins with tanks where fish are grown ¡§C usually tilapia, channel catfish, and hybrid striped bass. In these tanks, bacteria breaks down fish waste (feces and ammonia) into natural fertilizer. Farmers then irrigate their plants with this fertilizer in a hydroponic growing chamber. Plants raised using aquaponics typically include crops like lettuce, spinach, herbs, tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, and peppers. The result of aquaponics is a steady supply of fresh fish and vegetables that are available in local communities throughout the year and are grown in just about any environment ¡§C from an abandoned inner-city warehouse to a climate-controlled facility in the middle of a desert. Additionally, aquaponics does not just benefit local communities; it also serves as an innovative and invaluable tool in addressing some of the world?¡¥s most pressing challenges like hunger and climate change. ?¡ãAccording to the United Nations, there will be more than 9 billion people living on our planet by . We need to be smarter about how we grow food,?¡À said Benjamin Beck, research leader at the ARS Aquatic Animal Health Research unit in Auburn, Alabama. ?¡ãMinimizing the space used to grow food and/or growing more than one crop at the same time could help relieve pressure on land production of crops while still providing a locally-grown source of food.?¡À  Category/Topic:  Research and Science  Tags:  Agricultural Research Service  ARS  USDA Science  fish  aquaculture  hydroponics  aquaponics  sustainable farming  You May Also Like  USDA Nutrition Research Fuels Olympians?¡¥ Engines  Meet Mari Gomez?aPublic Servant at USDA & Leader in Her Community  Shining a Spotlight on USDA Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area Employees",What are some innovative ways to grow crops year-round in various environments using aquaponics systems?,"* Growing crops like lettuce, spinach, herbs, tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, and peppers * Minimizing space used to grow food by growing multiple crops at the same time * Growing crops in a soilless hydroponic environment regardless of climate or season * Using abandoned inner-city warehouses or climate-controlled facilities in deserts as aquaponics systems","Aquaponics is a soilless cultivation system that combines traditional aquaculture (raising fish and other aquatic animals) with hydroponics (growing plants in water) to create a sustainable and efficient way of growing crops year-round. Here are some innovative ways to grow crops year-round using aquaponics systems: 1. **Floating Row Systems**: This method uses floating rafts or platforms to support the roots of plants, allowing for maximum water circulation and oxygenation. This design is ideal for growing crops like lettuce, herbs, and strawberries in a controlled environment. 2. **Media-Based Biofilter (MBB)**: This system uses a bioactive media to filter waste from fish tanks and provide nutrients to plants. MBB is an excellent option for growing crops like tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers in warm climates. 3. **NFT (Nutrient Film Technique) Channels**: NFT channels use a network of narrow tubes or pipes to deliver a continuous flow of nutrient-rich water to the roots of plants. This design is suitable for growing crops like lettuce, basil, and spinach in cooler climates. 4. **Aquaponic Domes**: These structures use geodesic domes or other curved shapes to create an optimal environment for plant growth. Aquaponic domes can be used to grow a wide variety of crops year-round, regardless of the external climate. 5. **Vertical Aquaponics**: This design uses vertical stacking of plants and fish tanks to maximize space and efficiency. Vertical aquaponics is ideal for growing crops like herbs, leafy greens, and microgreens in urban areas with limited space. 6. **Fish-Friendly Crop Selection**: Some crops, like tilapia-friendly lettuce or aquaculture-compatible basil, have evolved to complement the waste produced by fish. By selecting these crops, you can optimize the efficiency of your aquaponics system and create a mutually beneficial relationship between plants and animals. 7. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**: Aquaponics systems can be designed with IPM in mind, using natural predators or other biological controls to manage pests and maintain a healthy ecosystem. 8. **Bio-Mimicry**: This approach involves mimicking the principles of nature to create an aquaponics system that is self-sustaining and efficient. Bio-mimicry can help reduce energy consumption, water usage, and waste production in aquaponics systems. 9. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and IoT Integration**: By integrating AI and IoT technologies into aquaponics systems, you can optimize plant growth, monitor water quality, and automate system control for maximum efficiency and yield. 10. **Hybrid Aquaponics**: This approach combines traditional aquaculture with other hydroponic or soil-based cultivation methods to create a hybrid system that leverages the strengths of each method. These innovative approaches can help you achieve year-round crop growth in various environments using aquaponics systems, while also promoting sustainability and minimizing waste.",6.18E-79,0.149494949,0.048681542,0.105050505,0.838848054

"School Breakfast: A Jump Start to a Great Day  How you start your day sets the tone for the rest of your day! School breakfast programs are critical in building a healthier future for America?¡¥s children.  Tony Craddock, Jr., Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Nutrition Security  Apr 25,   Respond to this story",What is the impact of school breakfast programs on agricultural production and food security in the United States?,"The content does not provide information on the impact of school breakfast programs on agricultural production and food security in the United States. However, according to the US Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service website, school breakfast programs can have a positive impact on farm-to-school initiatives, which can support local farmers and improve access to fresh produce for schools.","The impact of school breakfast programs on agricultural production and food security in the United States is multifaceted. Here's a clear breakdown: **Positive impacts:** 1. **Increased demand for certain crops**: School breakfast programs often purchase whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, which creates a stable market for farmers who grow these commodities. 2. **Supports local agricultural production**: By purchasing locally grown produce, school breakfast programs can stimulate the growth of nearby farms and promote local food systems. 3. **Improves access to nutritious foods**: School breakfast programs help ensure that students have access to healthy, nutrient-rich foods, contributing to improved overall health and well-being. **Negative impacts:** 1. **Subsidized commodity purchases**: The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reimburses schools for a portion of their food costs through the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), which can lead to over-reliance on government-subsidized commodities, such as cheese and whole milk. This can result in: * Reduced demand for specialty or locally grown produce. * Increased reliance on industrial-scale agriculture. 2. **Unbalanced food systems**: The emphasis on purchasing low-cost commodities can perpetuate a food system that prioritizes cheap, processed foods over fresh, locally produced options. **Overall impact:** While school breakfast programs contribute to increased agricultural production and improved access to nutritious foods for students, they also perpetuate some of the same issues that plague the broader U.S. food system: 1. **Over-reliance on industrial agriculture**: The emphasis on cheap commodities can lead to a lack of investment in local, sustainable agricultural practices. 2. **Food insecurity**: While school breakfast programs help ensure students have access to meals, they do not directly address broader issues of food insecurity or malnutrition. To maximize the positive impact of school breakfast programs on agricultural production and food security, consider implementing: 1. **Innovative procurement strategies**: Explore new purchasing models that prioritize locally grown produce, support small-scale farmers, or promote farm-to-school initiatives. 2. **Education and community engagement**: Incorporate nutrition education and experiential learning opportunities into the program to promote healthy eating habits and foster a deeper appreciation for local food systems. By acknowledging both the positive and negative impacts of school breakfast programs on agricultural production and food security, we can work towards creating more sustainable, equitable, and nutritious food systems that benefit all members of society.",0.052313154,0.242152466,0.135135135,0.174887892,0.85319078

"USDA, FNS and written by Hannah Benson, Project Bread Program Manager in  Food and Nutrition  Mar 08,  Several studies consistently link poor access to food to poor health outcomes, including heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Project Bread, a Massachusetts?¡¥ nonprofit focused on permanently solving food insecurity, teamed up with MassHealth to pilot the Flexible Services Program, or FSP, to bolster food security and meet nutritional needs from birth throughout childhood and beyond, improving health outcomes at every stage of life. Since April , over 7,000 MassHealth members (ranging in age from 0 months to 64 years) with complex health issues were given an array of food resources, including gift cards for groceries, cooking supplies, refrigerators, cooking classes, transportation assistance, and nutrition education. A recent evaluation of 491 clients, who engaged in the program between November ¡§C October , significantly improved their diet and health as follows:  25% became food secure  Fruit and vegetable consumption increased by 3.5 servings per week  SNAP enrollment increased by 12.4%  99% reported that participation in FSP improved their health Project Bread employs 11 nutrition services coordinators to serve MassHealth clients across several languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, Cape Verdean Creole, Haitian Creole, Arabic, and Vietnamese. These coordinators help address racial inequity in underserved communities, as these communities are disproportionately affected by social and economic barriers to good health. The program has made life-changing improvements for many participants. When John A. in Gardner, MA lost his job as a cook at age 52, his diet and his health deteriorated, impacting his ability to regain employment. FSP resources gave John the opportunity to take back his diet and his future. ?¡ãNot only has this program helped me financially in terms of paying for groceries, but the cooking shows [hosted by Project Bread chefs and nutritionists] have reignited my passion for cooking.

"USDA Equity Commission Communications Lead in  Equity  Initiatives  Mar 14,  As a Latina woman, raised in a black community by a single white mother, Poppy Sias-Hernandez understands how access to equitable support and resources can have a life changing impact. In , Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer appointed Sias-Hernandez as the first-ever Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer (EIO) in the Executive Office of the Governor. In addition to her role as the Chief EIO, she also serves as the Executive Director of the Office of Global Michigan. In February , Sias-Hernandez became one of 15 members appointed to the U.S. Department of Agriculture?¡¥s Equity Commission. Appointees serve two-year terms and bring a unique understanding of their individual fields and professional niches. The commission and its two subcommittees ¡§C the Agriculture Subcommittee and Rural Community Economic Development Subcommittee - are tasked with evaluating USDA programs and services and recommending ways USDA can reduce barriers to access by implementing transformative changes. Sias-Hernandez credits gaining access to an affordable community college education with changing her life?¡¥s trajectory. After high school, Sias-Hernandez moved to California to live with her father. There, she was able to take community college classes for $15 per credit hour, a complete departure from Michigan where community college was not financially accessible or feasible. This opportunity allowed her to become the first in her family to receive a college education, which included a bachelor?¡¥s degree from University of California at Berkley and a master?¡¥s degree in Organizational Change Leadership from Western Michigan University, where she received a Thurgood Marshall Fellowship. Her first class at Berkely was titled ?¡ãWomen of Color in the U.S.?¡À. According to Sias-Hernandez, that?¡¥s where she did a lot of early thinking regarding issues concerning equity and inclusion. The experiences and knowledge gained from that course have been formative over the course of her personal and professional life. Sias-Hernandez credits the young female professor teaching the course with recognizing that the material had ?¡ãlit a fire within her?¡À. Sias-Hernandez explains, ?¡ãShe said to me, ??This is going to be a challenge in life. Are you ready? You are going to have to find a way to drive the change you want to see while understanding that you will likely never see it.?¡¥?¡À These words became the foundation to Sias-Hernandez?¡¥s life. ?¡ãThat was so formative and has been throughout my life because it is the truth,?¡À said Sias-Hernandez. ?¡ãI still have that mindset. How do you keep showing up with love, integrity, and generosity knowing you?¡¥re not always going to see the change you are working for??¡À As a professional, Sias-Hernandez has devoted much of her 20-plus year career to building and creating equity. During the pandemic, Sias-Hernandez partnered with other Michigan state government departments to build a migrant community response model to provide access to healthcare, financial assistance, and other resources to impacted farmworkers. One of her partners in this project, the Michigan Secretary of Agriculture, encouraged Sias-Hernandez to apply for the USDA Equity Commission. Initially, Sias-Hernandez was apprehensive about a potential role on the Commission, but says she quickly discovered how much good work was possible. More than six months into the work, she says she?¡¥s impressed by the collective expertise of the Commission, and the group?¡¥s willingness to collaborate and share their individual gifts, talents, and lived experiences. ?¡ãI am loving this Commission. I am loving the learning; I am loving the high level of commitment,?¡À she said. ?¡ãIt?¡¥s the right formula to create terrific momentum and you have these Commissioners who are just super committed to doing good work.?¡À From Sias-Hernandez's viewpoint, the work of the Equity Commission creates systems that are accessible to all population groups. ?¡ãSometimes you hear equity talked about through an individual lens, referenced as meeting people where they are,?¡À said Sias-Hernandez. ?¡ãBut I really think about equity through a systems level lens and through a population level lens.?¡À Sias-Hernandez describes governmental systems and programs like a current in a stream. ?¡ãThese systems should be designed to keep people in the current. But what actually happens is that some people have to swim upstream to access the current, because it really wasn?¡¥t made for them,?¡À she said. ?¡ãMy vision for equity is that we are creating a current that captures all people; that anyone can step into the stream and swim with the current rather than having to struggle against it.?¡À  Category/Topic:  Equity  Initiatives  Tags:  equity  USDA  You May Also Like  Reflections from the Road in Pennsylvania: Charting the Path Forward with Urban Agriculture and the Next Generation  Dr. Jennie L.

"-Young, Under Secretary, Research, Education, and Economics & USDA Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Feb 28,  As I reflect on Black History Month, I think about the tremendous accomplishments and contributions made by Black Americans. I think of the past, present and future to acknowledge how far we?¡¥ve come, where we are now, and the challenges ahead. For me, one the most concerning challenges still facing Black Americans is the disproportional high rates of cancer and chronic diseases. With the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting half of all African American adults have some form of cardiovascular disease, and that Black men and women have the highest rates of dying from cancer ¡§C something must change. This issue hits very close to home for me. Growing up in Georgia, food was a part of my communities?¡¥ culture and heritage. Food brought people together, the dishes were delicious, however they weren?¡¥t always good for our health. This led to many of our staple dishes being loaded with excess sodium and calories. Unfortunately, it was this approach to eating that left many of my family members ultimately fighting heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, hypertension, and cancer. As jarring as this may seem, this is just one of many similar stories shared by Black Americans. Recently in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, I heard similar experiences echoed by Black community members at a listening session at Southern University. This listening session was the first in a series hosted by USDA?¡¥s Agricultural Science Center of Excellence for Nutrition and Diet for Better Health (ASCEND for Better Health) to discuss how food access, nutrition security, and diet affect health outcomes in underserved communities. ASCEND for Better Health is a new USDA initiative that aims to reduce the burden of diet-related chronic diseases, like cancer, by enhancing precision nutrition research and sharing that research with the communities it impacts. ASCEND for Better Health also supports President Biden?¡¥s Cancer Moonshot to end cancer as we know it and is tied to the goals laid out in the White House National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. As we step into National Nutrition Month tomorrow, I am hopeful for the future health and wellbeing of Black Americans thanks to initiatives like USDA?¡¥s ASCEND for Better Health. A brighter future is ahead in which healthy, nutritious foods are accessible to all and specific nutrition advice is available so everyone can live long, high-quality and prosperous lives.

"ARS Office of Communications in  Health and Safety  Research and Science  Jun 07,  Today is World Food Safety Day, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture?¡¥s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has launched a sweeping new initiative known as the Salmonella Grand Challenge. The project brings together an elite group of ARS, university and food industry scientists from different specialties to fight Salmonella, a foodborne pathogen that sickens over a million Americans each year, sometimes fatally. The challenge complements the work being done by the Food Safety and Inspection Service to develop a more effective strategy to reduce human Salmonella illness linked to poultry. ARS?¡¥ goal is to integrate its research to learn more about how and where Salmonella causes the highest risk of contamination to meat and poultry products. That information will help researchers develop better monitoring tools for meat and poultry producers to detect Salmonella contamination. Salmonella, the bacterium that causes the illness called salmonellosis, lurks just about everywhere ¡§C on animals (including pets), in food, water, soil and even air. People infected by Salmonella suffer symptoms that can include diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, chills, headache, nausea and vomiting. Serious infections can lead to life-long health problems and even death. The ARS team will integrate its ongoing research by combining, standardizing and coordinating efforts to create harmonized datasets. This will help them identify larger trends, emerging threats and novel Salmonella mitigation strategies. That?¡¥s a large task because there are over 2,500 types of Salmonella bacteria and their risks are different across all production systems. The research team will use machine-learning tools to manage and bring together this huge amount of . The collaboration will help researchers learn from each other and will hopefully lead to break-through discoveries. The Salmonella Grand Challenge will enable researchers to better understand Salmonella risk, develop accurate models, and develop tools for meat and poultry producers to monitor their operations. Ultimately, the team hopes their efforts will contribute to the Healthy People objective of reducing salmonellosis by 25%.

"National Agricultural Statistics Service Public Affairs Specialist in  Research and Science  Mar 17,  The states that produce some of the most nutritious and most consumed commodities within each of the five food groups. Many people want to cultivate healthier eating habits and March, National Nutrition Month, may be a great time to start. USDA?¡¥s Food and Nutrition Service?¡¥s MyPlate website is a resource available to help get on (or back on) the nutrition track. MyPlate itself is divided into five major food groups ¡§C vegetables, fruits, grains, protein foods, and dairy and fortified soy alternatives. But do you ever wonder where your food comes from, and how much our hardworking farmers and ranchers produce in a year? Here are facts about some of America?¡¥s favorite, nutritious foods: According to USDA?¡¥s Economic Research Service (ERS), the tomato is one of the most commonly eaten vegetables in the country. In , U.S. farmers produced 24.1 billion pounds of tomatoes with California producing more than 97%. Apples are also a big hit in the U.S.. In , our growers produced nearly 11 billion pounds, nearly 69% of which came from Washington state. The average yield from each of Washington?¡¥s 172,000 total apple bearing acres was 44,200 pounds! For , check out the Non-Citrus Fruits & Nuts Annual Report. Wheat, a health-promoting grain found in many foods, is one of our largest field crops. In , U.S. farmers produced 1.8 billion bushels of it, with North Dakota producing more than 17% of the total. For animal protein, according to ERS, chicken still tops the list in American diets. In , 58.3 billion pounds of chicken were produced in the U.S., more than 14% or 8.3 billion pounds in the top producing state of Georgia. New will be available on April 29 in the Poultry Production and Value Report. Finally, there is dairy. Versatile and packed with important nutrients, fluid beverage milk is one of the most consumed dairy products in the country. Americans consumed more than 46.4 billion pounds, or 5.4 billion gallons, of it last year alone. At the farm level (milk produced and used in all dairy products), U.S. farmers produced a whopping 223.2 billion pounds in ; California was the No. 1 milk producer with 41.3 billion pounds.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .23  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@usda.gov  WASHINGTON, Sept. 26, ¡§C The U.S. Department of Agriculture today announced that it is giving an estimated 3,000 more school districts in high-need areas the option to serve breakfast and lunch to all students at no cost, by expanding the availability of the Community Eligibility Provision, commonly known as CEP. ?¡ãToday?¡¥s announcement comes as we approach the one-year anniversary of the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, where the Biden-Harris Administration promised to advance a pathway to healthy school meals for all students,?¡À said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ?¡ãUSDA has taken an important step toward fulfilling that promise by expanding access to CEP. Increasing access to free, healthy school breakfast and lunch will decrease childhood hunger, improve child health and student readiness, and put our nation on the path to better nutrition and wellness.?¡À CEP is a simplified meal service option that allows schools to provide meals at no cost to all students without requiring families to apply for free and reduced-price meals. Instead, school districts receive federal funding based on a formula using existing from SNAP and other programs, and local or state funds must fill any gap between program costs and federal support. Before this final rule, at least 40% of students had to live in households participating in certain income-based federal assistance programs, in order for a school, group of schools, or school district to be eligible for CEP. This final rule lowers that threshold from 40% to 25%. While this change in CEP applies across the country, it will be particularly impactful in states and school districts which commit to supporting healthy school meals for all students with their own funds. Eight states have taken additional permanent actions to make sure hunger is not a barrier to children?¡¥s success, in addition to allowing eligible schools to participate in CEP. California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Vermont passed state laws allowing their schools to serve healthy school meals to all their students at no cost. In these states, schools that previously were not eligible for CEP can now take advantage of this final rule to experience more efficient, streamlined school meal operations as well as predictable federal funding levels. CEP ¡§C and all models for providing healthy school meals for all at no cost ¡§C is a win-win for schools, kids, families and communities and provides many benefits, including:  Lowering food costs for families;  Increasing food and nutrition security, especially for students from households that barely miss the cutoff to be eligible for free and reduced-price school meals;  Eliminating school meal debt;  Reducing social stigma for students who eat free or reduced-price meals, while other students pay full price;  Increasing student participation in school breakfast and lunch programs, which increases revenues and helps schools offer healthier meals; and  Saving time by simplifying program operations for hardworking school nutrition staff. ?¡ãHealthy school meals are an essential part of the school environment ?a just like teachers, classrooms and books ¡§C and set kids up for success and better health,?¡À said Stacy Dean, USDA deputy under secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services. ?¡ãMore children are fueled for learning and development when they can count on tasty, nutritious meals at school. While there is still more work ahead to ensure every K-12 student in the nation can access healthy school meals at no cost, this is a significant step on the pathway towards that goal.?¡À USDA is also supporting expanded access to healthy school meals by offering extensive financial support for schools, including providing:  50 cents more per lunch and 18 cents more per breakfast for school year -24, compared to last school year?¡¥s base reimbursement rates, through annual inflation adjustments and Supply Chain Assistance;  $30 million in Healthy Meals Incentives grants to 264 small and rural school districts nationwide;  $30 million in Equipment Grants for states and school districts operating school lunch programs; and  Nearly $11 million in Farm to School Grants, serving 1.2 million children. USDA also continues to expand its Direct Certification for Medicaid Demonstration Projects, which ensure that eligible children in households receiving Medicaid benefits automatically receive free or reduced price school meals without their families filling out an application. The demonstration projects have been implemented in 38 states, and USDA continues to invite more states to participate. In school year -, 1.4 million students received free and reduced-price school meals thanks to direct certification through Medicaid. Related Resources:  Webpage: Community Eligibility Provision  Webpage: USDA School Meals  Webpage: USDA Support for Schools FNS works to end hunger and improve food and nutrition security through a suite of 16 nutrition assistance programs, such as the National School Breakfast and National School Lunch Programs, the Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and Children and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Together, these programs serve 1 in 4 Americans over the course of a year, promoting consistent and equitable access to healthy, safe, and affordable food essential to optimal health and well-being. FNS also provides science-based nutrition recommendations through the co-development of the Dietary for Americans.

"State Director, Southern New England, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 26,  As USDA Rural Development (RD) highlights National Cooperative Month, one worker owned co-op in Massachusetts stands out as a model for sustainability, collaboration, and local food system resiliency. The saying goes ?¡ãit?¡¥s not easy being green.?¡À But for Real Pickles in Greenfield, Massachusetts, the co-op wouldn?¡¥t have it any other way; they went green in with the addition of solar panels on its roof. Real Pickles Cooperative of Massachusetts RD assisted with the effort, providing $20,000 through the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). The 18.06kWH PV Solar System on the roof of the business was installed by neighboring worker owned solar co-op, PV Squared, and replaced 100 percent of the pickle co-op?¡¥s energy needs at that time. So how did this green, innovative co-op come about? Two decades ago, Dan Rosenberg saw a need. Most pickles in the area were being produced with vinegar and preservatives. The old-fashioned pickle that Grandma used to make- naturally fermented with naturally occurring live cultures- was missing from local grocery store shelves. Determined to bring them back, Dan brought some veggies home from an organic vegetable farm where he worked and began making pickles the old-fashioned way. He was soon joined by wife and business partner, Addie Rose Holland, and Real Pickles launched in . They processed their pickles at a business incubator kitchen created by Franklin County Community Development Corporation, which provided a venue for making value-added foods with local farm ingredients. In , Real Pickles moved into their own building and expanded their operations. Today, the co-op sources its produce from eight locally owned farms and the future looks bright. Addie said, ?¡ãReal Pickles is rooted in this community and it has been supported by this community for the last 21 years. Becoming a worker owned cooperative helps to maintain jobs in our community and continues the cycle of local economic development.?¡À When asked for her favorite pickle pun, Addie said, ?¡ãWe?¡¥re kind of a big ?¡ãdill.?¡À We couldn?¡¥t agree more.

Over 200 members of the Somali Bantu community of Lewiston, Maine, make the short drive out to Liberation Farms a few times each week to tend their crops. Visitors to our farm often comment on how few weeds they spot between stalks of corn. It?¡¥s not magic, we tell them: our farmers are constantly in friendly competition to see who can have the best-looking plot. Like a large-scale community garden, Liberation Farms allows families to grow food for themselves. We want to feed our kids the foods that we grew up with in Somalia, like corn, greens, and goat meat. Working together, we can make this happen in a way we never could have individually. In , support from community partners helped us move our farm operations onto a single property where we have room for everyone ¡§C and a herd of goats, too! Many people in our community are supporting large families through hourly-wage jobs. Since high-quality produce is otherwise unaffordable for us, growing for ourselves at Liberation Farms is a path to financial savings and food independence. We also use the SNAP and WIC programs to give our community and others much-needed nourishment, boosting the health and cultural connections of younger generations. Liberation Farms is also growing our Iskaashito program, through which farmers work together to sell vegetables at our farmers markets and farm stand. People beyond the Somali Bantu community are buying everything from cornmeal to tomatoes from us, and we encourage them to use food stamps to turn just a few dollars into a fresh basket of veggies.

"AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Dec 20,  Years ago, I spent my days watching pecan roots change the color of solutions from clear to red as they reduced iron for uptake. It may not sound exciting, but that was the topic of my undergraduate research internship at USDA?¡¥s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Children?¡¥s Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) in Houston, TX, under the direction of my mentor, ARS scientist Dr. Michael Grusak. Dr. Grusak taught me to consider the link between the laboratory and society. His lab focused on improving crop mineral uptake, which could benefit society by increasing the nutritional value of crops for humans. The emphasis on this connection between plant biology and society stimulated my interest in plant biology and, eventually, led me to pursue my own Ph.D. in plant physiology and genetics. Now, that summer job has led me back to USDA as a Science and Technology Policy Fellow through the American Association of the Advancement of Science in the USDA Office of the Chief Scientist, where I work directly to connect science to society. In my new role, I?¡¥m able to use science to inform agricultural policy making decisions by collaborating with others in USDA to develop science-based solutions to emerging issues, especially those related to improving agricultural resilience in response to climate change. As an undergraduate intern, I was excited to contribute to ARS research, but never imagined that the roots I put down at CNRC would lead me back to USDA, supporting priorities that help advance American agriculture and aid in an all-of-government approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change. ARS internship opportunities support future generations of the agricultural workforce. My internship introduced me to the importance of agricultural research and attracted me to a career where I could use science to inform agricultural policy.

"APHIS Legislative and Public Affairs in  Animals  Dec 04,  Bats are crucial to the wellbeing of our natural ecosystems, but also have the potential to spread disease. APHIS Wildlife Services and the One Health Commission recently sponsored a student infographic contest to help change the narrative on bats. Lately, when we hear about bats in the news it's often in the context of emerging infectious diseases. Yet, despite potential public health threats, bats are extremely important to the health of our natural ecosystems. Zoonotic diseases, or zoonoses, are those diseases that can be transmitted between animals and humans. To help educate young adults about the importance of bats to our environment, as well as the potential for some bats to transmit zoonoses, such as rabies, USDA Wildlife Services (WS) and the One Health Commission (OHC) recently sponsored an infographic competition among college students. An infographic is a creative collection of images, charts, and minimal text to present or other information. ?¡ãTo ensure participating college students had a good understanding of the issues surrounding bats and disease before they started designing their infographics, we developed a 5-minute video explaining the One Health approach and why it is key to addressing wildlife diseases like rabies.?¡À states Alison Barbee, a biological science technician with the rabies research project at the WS National Wildlife Research Center. The One Health approach emphasizes the interconnectedness of people, animals, and the environment. It also encourages experts from multiple disciplines to work together locally, nationally and globally to achieve the best health for all three. The control of human rabies deaths and exposures through the vaccination of animal reservoirs, such as domestic dogs and terrestrial wildlife, is considered an example of a successful One Health approach. WS, OHC, and other agencies are building upon that success to address concerns about bats and the spread of rabies, as well as other diseases. ?¡ãIf we are going to successfully manage bat rabies and other novel viruses for the benefit of bats, people and the environment, we need to better understand how these pathogens are maintained and spread in bat populations,?¡À states Barbee. ?¡ãWe also need to effectively communicate that information with others.?¡À Winning infographic on bats and rabies created by Colorado State University graduate student Brooke MacNeill. The winner of the infographic contest was Brooke MacNeill, a graduate student in the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Colorado State University. MacNeill?¡¥s infographic focused on the role of bats in the environment, and what is being done to prevent the spread of rabies from wildlife to people. Her design targeted students in grades 6 through 12 and was created in both English and Spanish. She received a $500 cash award and her design was shared with natural resources, public health, and One Health practitioners around the globe. The runner up was Stephen Nachtsheim a graduate student in Biomedical Communications at the University of Toronto. His design focused on the benefits of bats and their population declines due to various diseases. He received a $100 cash prize.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Jan 27,  The Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program helps vets repay qualified student loans for service as food animal veterinarians in selected areas of the country. (iStock image) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA?¡¥s rich science and research portfolio. A solid education is crucial to those seeking careers in animal science. However, many student loans can be burdensome. But a student loan payment the size of a mortgage couldn?¡¥t stop someone who has wanted to be a veterinarian since they learned to talk. Dr. Annie Bowes is one of those people. After acquiring the knowledge to begin her dream career, Dr. Bowes was left with overwhelming debt.? Luckily for this Idaho-based veterinarian, she wasn?¡¥t left alone to repay it. In , she received assistance through the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program (VMLRP) a program funded by USDA?¡¥s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). Through VMLRP, NIFA may repay up to $25,000 each year of student loan debt to eligible veterinarians. ?In return, qualified veterinarians must agree to provide food animal medical care for three years in certain high-priority veterinary shortage situations.? VMLRP has helped 245 veterinarians since the program?¡¥s inception in . ?¡ãI am thankful for this assistance,?¡À Bowes said. ?¡ãIt allowed me to establish myself in a rural area where it?¡¥s difficult to be successful. I am now able to treat animals at six to eight different farms per day and have more than 600 repeat clients.?¡À Veterinarians are critical to America?¡¥s food safety, food security, and to the health and well-being of both animals and humans. Studies indicate there are significant shortages of food animal veterinarians in certain areas of the country. A leading cause for the scarcity in this profession is the heavy price tag that four years of professional veterinary medical training carries, which leaves current graduates of veterinary colleges with an average debt of $162,000. Bowes owns Aspen Veterinary Service, a mobile service treating large animals, as well as an Emergency Clinic with a staff of 15 and more than 10,000 repeat customers. Dr. Tim VanDerPloeg is another veterinarian using USDA?¡¥s assistance to expand rural veterinary services. VanDerPloeg will open Veterinary Center of Somerset, in Kentucky, soon. Pulaski County, where the clinic will be located, is the third largest cattle county in the state of Kentucky.? The clinic will have a 2,300-square-foot large animal facility in addition to the 3,400-square-foot small animal facility. ?¡ãAlthough recipients of the loan repayment assistance are only to commit to three years of veterinary service in a designated shortage area, veterinarians like Bowes and VanDerPloeg suggest that the impacts from this funding and connections to their service areas go well beyond three years,?¡À said Gary Sherman, VMLRP national program leader with NIFA.

It?¡¥s just fascinating to know how much you won?¡¥t ever know!?¡À But what brought him to the veterinary field was his love of caring for animals.? As a child, he would often take wounded animals home to take care of, and Dr. Shere said his mother ?¡ãnever knew what she would find in [his] top dresser drawer.?¡À? A few years later, he made the conscious decision to become a veterinarian when dealing with his family?¡¥s German Shepard puppy, which had become increasingly ill.? On a Friday evening, the puppy had a violent seizure.? The family vet said he was closing his office for the day, and recommended that the animal be euthanized on Monday morning if it was still alive.? Dr. Shere?¡¥s father was left in a terrible position, and decided to put the animal out of its misery that night.? While heartbreaking, it prompted Dr. Shere to resolve that after becoming a veterinarian himself, he would always go and help an animal if he was called ¡§C ?¡ãSo when I was in practice, if anyone called me, I would go, no matter what the time.?¡À? And he?¡¥s kept that vow in the years since graduating vet school. Dr. Shere brings a wealth of knowledge, experience and passion to the table, which will only benefit this country?¡¥s livestock and poultry populations.

"Senior Public Health Advisor, USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service; and  Dr. Eileen Thacker, Center Director, United States National Poultry Research Center, USDA   Agricultural Research Service in  Health and Safety  Research and Science  Nov 15,  The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced on January 26, that it was going to require meat and poultry processing plants to have a science-based Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) food inspection system put into place. HACCP is a food production, storage, and distribution monitoring system for identification and control of associated health hazards using definitive scientific tests. Its purpose is to prevent contamination of food products during processing. USDA photo. Today kicked off ?¡ãGet Smart about Antibiotics?¡À week in the United States and the World Health Organization?¡¥s World Antibiotic Awareness Week in . During this week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and its other federal partners want to remind families and communities about the importance of responsible antibiotic use in both humans and animals, to help reduce the development of resistant bacteria. This week, we also celebrate the 20th anniversary of the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS).? Through NARMS, USDA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collaborate on everything relating to antimicrobial resistant bacteria.? ?Since , USDA?¡¥s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) have been active participants in this combined federal surveillance program. So, what is antimicrobial resistance?? As you might recall, in , Dr. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, a drug that revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections. In the years following, penicillin and the discovery and therapeutic use of other antibiotics, we have relied on antibiotics to treat and cure a variety of illnesses - in both humans and animals, across the globe. The use of these drugs has aided in the development of resistant strains of bacteria. Unfortunately, this development means that some previously treatable forms of bacterial infections are now resistant to the antibiotics that were designed to treat them. It is estimated that the decrease in effectiveness of antibiotics, results in more than two million U.S. cases of antibiotic resistant infections, annually. Some of these types of infections might require longer hospital stays and are more costly to treat successfully.? As scientists, we call this problem antimicrobial resistance (AMR). ?Dr. Fleming even raised this concern in after receiving the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of penicillin.? The AMR threat in humans and animals is becoming an increasing problem and requires the adoption of a One Health approach. ?This approach is founded on principles that recognize that the health of people and populations are linked to the health of animals and environments. For example, antibiotics are used in food-producing animals to prevent illness, limit the spread of infections in a herd or flock, and treat diseases. ?Because antibiotics are administered to animals, food products derived from them can serve as a vehicle for the movement of resistant bacteria to humans, just as antibiotics administered to people can affect the environment, including the environment of animals. The One Health approach brings together the expertise of physicians, veterinarians, environmental scientists, and other public health professionals so that problems can be identified and actionable solutions are developed that can minimize the emergence and spread of AMR. World Antibiotics Awareness Week USDA is uniquely positioned to contribute to the body of knowledge about resistant bacteria through the collaboration and ongoing work of experts both within and outside of the Department. For the last 20 years, ARS and FSIS have partnered alongside FDA and CDC to collect and define AMR bacteria in meat and poultry products. Through the NARMS program, ARS and FSIS continually monitor changes in AMR bacteria from animal meat through the FSIS regulatory testing program and from animals through the new cecal sampling surveillance program. ?The sampling results from these two programs help to identify new or changing resistant bacterial patterns and show comparisons between bacteria found in animals used for food and bacteria important in human medicine. This information is critically essential for scientists to understand how resistant bacteria emerge and spread. In , USDA in collaboration with its public health partners began using whole genome sequencing (WGS) to further characterize AMR bacteria in real-time. WGS is a process that can determine the DNA sequence of bacteria collected from food animal samples. This method allows scientists to understand similarities and differences between bacteria with greater detail than ever before. The information gained from WGS helps USDA and NARMS monitor AMR bacteria with more accuracy and to identify more specifically the types of bacteria that cause foodborne illness. Despite USDA?¡¥s long history of significant activities and investments in AMR, including its strong twenty years of NARMS collaboration as well as USDAs?¡¥ own AMR Action Plan (, 322 ); a considerable amount of work remains to be done to address knowledge gaps in AMR and for further strengthen the current programs. To achieve the greatest public health impact, USDA must continue to coordinate and leverage expertise across many areas. And to ensure that effectiveness of antibiotics is preserved for treating both people and animals and that it is extended to future generations, USDA, other federal agencies, industry, and academic partners are working together to better understand the role of animal production environments in the development and spread of AMR bacteria.?

The agency is using whole genome sequencing (WGS) to further characterize AMR bacteria in real-time and monitor changes in AMR bacteria from animal meat and animals through surveillance programs.","Animal production environments, such as farms and livestock facilities, can play a significant role in the development and spread of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria. Here are some key factors: 1. **Overuse and misuse of antibiotics**: Animal agriculture often employs antimicrobials to promote growth, prevent disease, and treat infections in animals. This widespread use contributes to the selection and proliferation of resistant bacteria. 2. **Intensive production systems**: High-density animal production systems can facilitate the spread of AMR bacteria among animals, as well as to humans through direct contact or contaminated food products. 3. **Cross-contamination and horizontal gene transfer**: The movement of people, equipment, and feed between different animal holdings and production stages can lead to cross-contamination of resistant bacteria. 4. **Environmental persistence**: Animal waste and antimicrobial residues in soil and water can persist for extended periods, allowing AMR bacteria to colonize and spread within the environment. 5. **Selection pressure**: The continued use of antimicrobials maintains selection pressure on bacterial populations, driving the emergence and dissemination of resistant strains. These factors contribute to the development and spread of AMR bacteria in animal production environments, which can have significant implications for human health, including: * Increased risk of antibiotic-resistant infections * Compromised public health and food safety * Economic burdens due to prolonged treatment and reduced productivity Efforts are being made to address these concerns through strategies such as reducing antimicrobial use in agriculture, implementing more targeted disease control measures, promoting good hygiene practices, and developing diagnostic tools for AMR detection.",0.042222319,0.284829721,0.118380062,0.191950464,0.856418669

In the past, they have been at odds with the agencies, but now, in some instances, they are seen partners. ?¡ãI?¡¥m originally from Michigan, where I grew up a ??nature geek,?¡¥ wandering around the woods and countryside,?¡À Chandra Le Gue, Old-Growth Campaign Coordinator for Oregon Wild explained. ?¡ãFrom this experience, I gained a love for nature. I was really amazed at the natural beauty of Oregon when I moved here for my graduate studies. I fell in love with the forests and landscapes. Oregon Wild?¡¥s mission matched my ideology on the importance of these areas?-.and I have been with the organization now for six and a half years.?¡À During Le Gue?¡¥s first few years at Oregon Wild, the Forest Service was just a name on paper that the group was reviewing and commenting on. It was a couple of years before she met representatives from the Forest Service and was able to put names to faces. ?¡ãOnce you put a name to a face, it?¡¥s easier to see them as a potential partner instead of an adversary. That?¡¥s the best thing for creating collaboration?-getting to know the people in the groups. It?¡¥s even better if you can go on a field trip, get out of the office and experience things together,?¡À she said. Chandra Le Gue, Old-Growth Campaign Coordinator for Oregon Wild.  Le Gue works mostly with the Siuslaw National Forest. She says she likes their dedication to the idea because they have mastered a way at engaging the public to find common ground. ?¡ãFor example, the stewardship groups that make suggestions to the forests often don?¡¥t have the power to influence decisions, but at the Siuslaw we feel we are listened to. It?¡¥s empowering and it keeps us coming back to the table,?¡À she said. Her favorite project is a landscape scale Environmental Assessment that had several components including timber stand thinning, meadow enhancement and stream restoration. For this effort, the forest brought together local landowners, watershed council and non-profits like Oregon Wild to assist. ?¡ãWe met with the Interdisciplinary Team to help develop the project early on in the process. It built trust among the groups, especially when we saw suggestions from the group reflected in the final project. And the planning folks were thankful to us and said, ??You helped make this project better.?¡¥ That partnership still remains,?¡À Le Gue said.

"Posted by U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell in  Forestry  Dec 19,  The Paisley Ranger District of the Fremont-Winema National Forest in Oregon worked with numerous partners to complete a large-scale multi-year restoration project that covered 15 miles of the Chewaucan River. The project included adding vegetation to eroding stream banks. (U.S. Forest Service) I am proud to announce that we exceeded our ecological restoration goals for Fiscal Year . This was no small feat. A lot of great people across the U.S. Forest Service worked hard to make it a reality. We did substantial homework and planning, and then based on that we made strategic investments across all agency programs to help us create resilient forests, grasslands and watersheds while sustaining communities. This work reduced the wildland fire threats to communities and firefighters and minimized the risk of forest pests and climate change, while supporting American jobs and rural economies. That is a fantastic combination. The results of this hard work are nothing short of amazing.? The projects we carried out lessened the threats to communities by reducing hazardous fuels on 1.7 million acres in the wildland urban interface, sustained or restored watershed conditions on 2.9 million acres and resulted in 2.8 billion board feet of timber volume sold. Impressively, we did all this despite simultaneously facing a government shutdown, as well as rising costs of fire-fighting that drain resources from our work across all program areas. On a personal level, these accomplishments reflect how much members of our Forest Service community are committed to improving the forests and grasslands that have been entrusted to us by the American people. For these reasons, I could not be more proud of everyone who has come together to make restoration such a success in the past year. The Paisley Ranger District of the Fremont-Winema National Forest in Oregon worked with numerous partners to complete a large-scale multi-year restoration project that covered 15 miles of the Chewaucan River.

"Food Safety Education Staff, Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA in  Health and Safety  Mar 14,  Plan for spring cleaning, a checklist for a food safe pantry and fridge. The refrigerator and pantry are where most people store their food. But these storage areas may also be one of the less frequently cleaned places in your home, which could be hazardous to your health. The refrigerator is one of the most important pieces of equipment in the kitchen. Without it, our food would spoil and could make us sick. Refrigerators should be set to maintain a temperature between 34?? and 40??F to preserve our foods. Setting the refrigerator temperature too low will cause your refrigerator to work overtime and could also freeze some of your foods. Many of today?¡¥s advanced refrigerators have built-in thermostats that measure their internal temperature. If your fridge does not have a built-in thermostat, you should keep an appliance thermometer inside in a visible place to monitor the temperature. Here are some tips to make your fridge (and your home) more healthy and safe:  Clean spills immediately ¡§C Clean surfaces thoroughly with warm, soapy water; then rinse. Do not use solvent cleaning agents or abrasives, as these may allow chemical fumes/tastes into your food and ice cubes and make them unsafe to eat.  Store leftovers safely ¡§C Throw out perishable foods that have spoiled and no longer can be eaten. Leftovers like meatloaf, pizza or casseroles shouldn?¡¥t be left in the refrigerator more than four days. Refrigerate raw poultry and ground meats for no more than one to two days.  Clean the exterior ¡§C Keep your refrigerator free of dust and lint. Clean the condenser coil several times a year with a brush or vacuum cleaner to remove dirt, lint or other accumulations to ensure efficiency and maintain proper temperature. Cleaning your pantry will save you money by keeping you aware of what you have and help you avoid a pantry insect infestation. It will also ensure your foods are safe to consume. Here are some tips for a clean, bug-free pantry:  Check your cans ¡§C Discard cans that are leaking, rusted, bulging or badly dented. Never use food from cracked jars, jars with loose or bulging lids, or any container that spurts liquid when you open it.  Throw out any food you suspect is spoiled ¡§C Never taste food to determine its safety. Wipe off sticky containers, along with crumbs and spills on your pantry shelves with all-purpose cleaner, vinegar, or warm soap and water.  Check the dates on your foods ¡§C ?¡ãUSE by?¡À date indicates that perishable products should be consumed by the date listed on the package or discarded once the date has passed. ?¡ãBEST if Used By?¡À date informs shoppers that after the specified date, the shelf-stable product is safe to use or consume, but has exceeded the window of its optimal taste or performance. High-acid canned food such as tomatoes, grapefruit and pineapple have a shelf life of 12 to 18 months beyond their listed dates. Low-acid canned food such as meat, poultry, fish and most vegetables can be kept for two to five years beyond their listed dates ?a if the can remains in good condition and has been stored in a cool, clean and dry place. If you have questions about storage times for food or beverages, we recommend downloading our smartphone and tablet application, the FoodKeeper.

"White House Fellow in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 02,  A local WIC staff member holds her sleeping baby as she listens to the peer counseling instructor. March is Women?¡¥s History month, a time when we highlight everything woman.? In the midst of farming and biofuels, research and forestry would you believe that the USDA also finds time to promote breastfeeding?? The answer is absolutely!? You already know that the agency supports a myriad of nutrition programs to help make America?¡¥s children healthy and hunger-free.? Research has shown that there is no better food than breast milk for a baby?¡¥s first year of life. Breastfeeding provides many health, nutritional, economical and emotional benefits to mother and baby. Since a major goal of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) Program is to improve the nutritional status of infants, WIC mothers are encouraged to breastfeed their infants. WIC promotes breastfeeding to all pregnant women as the optimal infant feeding choice, unless medically contraindicated.? So what exactly is WIC doing to support breastfeeding?? The answer is a lot! WIC moms and babies who exclusively breastfeed receive an enhanced food package for a longer duration than non-breastfeeding mothers. Exclusively breastfed babies do not receive formula in their package. Breastfeeding moms can receive breast pumps, breast shells, and other nursing supplies to encourage increased initiation and duration of breastfeeding. WIC mom?¡¥s who breastfeed receive support through counseling, educational materials, and peer support from fellow WIC moms that have breastfed their babies. We recognize that the food package alone is not enough to change behaviors.? Mother?¡¥s need support education, and encouragement to breastfeed.? WIC clinics provide peer counselors, women who can personally relate to other WIC moms, to help support breastfeeding.? Some WIC clinics also provide education to fathers and grandmothers as we recognize that they play a crucial role in a mother?¡¥s decision to breastfeed. USDA doesn?¡¥t just promote breastfeeding for the clients it serves; we are helping to support women who choose to breastfeed when they return to work at USDA as well.? The Nursing Mother?¡¥s Working Group is committed to investigating whether USDA is currently meeting the needs and requirements of its new and expectant mothers who wish to continue lactation after they return to the office.? A Department-wide effort is underway to assess the current state of the USDA Nursing Mother?¡¥s Program and identify where improvements need to be made.? The USDA hopes to be a leader in the Federal Government in changing the culture of the workplace to support employees who are devoted to their families. USDA is in the midst of updating its Loving Support makes Breastfeeding Work campaign. This is a nationwide social marketing campaign to encourage the initiation and duration of breastfeeding for all women. Stay tuned for events leading up to World Breastfeeding Week in August.

"USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in  Initiatives  Jun 20,  Josepha preparing amaranth greens for a recent dinner put together by some of our gardeners from Burundi. Every month, USDA shares the story of a woman in agriculture who is leading the industry and helping other women succeed along the way. In honor of World Refugee Day, this month we hear from Josepha Ntakirutimana, a refugee from Rwanda who settled in Tucson, Arizona in . Josepha is now an invaluable part of the Tucson New Roots Program which brings together refugees and their community around production and nutrition education activities. Josepha?¡¥s journey to Tucson is a long one ¡§C as for any refugee, the memories are sometimes painful. When she was a girl, at the age of 12, Josepha started helping her mom at a local farm before school. Later, she worked on a farm during school holidays and, when she was married, her family had a small plot in town where they could grow vegetables and grains to help reduce food costs. After the war, when she left Rwanda and entered into a refugee camp in Malawi, agriculture continued to help her and her family survive. There wasn?¡¥t enough food but she was able to start a garden and grew amaranth, squash, and carrots. Being able to carry out this activity in the refugee camp was a welcome change of pace to the camp life, which was hard and full of uncertainty. Gardening also allows for refugees to have access to fresh food, which is welcomed in refugee camps, where food is very limited in amounts and variety.  Now, Josepha considers it a ??great joy of living?¡¥ to be able to garden and grow her own vegetables in her new home of Tucson. Agriculture is a thread that connects Josepha?¡¥s past, present, and future ¡§C and is a veritable lifeline. Her refugee story is a real inspiration. Like all the refugees the IRC works to help resettle in the U.S,. she is a survivor, and we are honored to be working with her to help refugees to start a new life in her community. The IRC has 29 offices and helps? 6,000 - 10,000 new arrivals each year in acclimating to their new communities. Over the past 10 years, the IRC has reshaped expectations for nutritional well-being among its refugee clients, and has developed a multifaceted food security and agriculture program called ?¡ãNew Roots"" to increase the supply of and demand for fresh, culturally appropriate foods within immigrant and refugee communities To learn more about their work please visit www.rescue.org/ and follow on twitter at @theIRC. 1. Josepha, can you share your story with us? As a refugee, what was your journey to the United States like? I was a nurse for 21 years in Rwanda. In , there was a genocide in Rwanda. My husband, four children and I were displaced from southern Rwanda to western Rwanda. There I worked as a nurse at a Hospital with a humanitarian aid organization and my husband worked as an interpreter. Because the organizations trusted us, our coworkers became jealous and falsely accused my husband of participating in the genocide. My husband was summoned to the police station and put in jail. He was jailed in prison in southern Rwanda, where he spent nine years. I consider agriculture to be a very important aid during this tough time in my life. Alongside my career, I was practicing agriculture to be able to feed my children and be able to bring biweekly food to my husband in prison. My husband was freed from jail in , but we fled our country so he would not be detained again. We traveled to Malawi and ended up in a refugee camp. It was my first time outside of my country and it felt like going to hell. I was depressed and could not see my future. Much of the food was spoiled, but I fed my family beans, which were still safe to eat. To feed my family, I would ration the beans to the last month. Eventually, I started a garden of amaranth and squash and would mix the beans with the squash to make them last. After a few years, we moved to another refugee camp in Malawi where I could see people I knew from Rwanda. My mind was renewed. I started to go to school to learn English, tailoring, computer skills and counseling. To support my family, I worked in a tailoring shop. After getting a counseling certificate, I became a school counselor and started a group for unaccompanied minors. I created projects to help them make money while encouraging them to stay in school. After nine years in refugee camps, my family resettled in Tucson, Arizona. Fortunately, after 5 months my husband and I found caregiver jobs and I began interpreting for the IRC. Eventually, I became a Community Well-being Promoter and was able to combine my interpretation skills and my passion for food and agriculture. 2. How has your connection to agriculture changed depending on the country in which you live? The biggest difference is in climate ¡§C the desert here is dry and hot ¡§C Rwanda is dry and humid. Here there?¡¥s use of irrigation systems, but in my native country, we depend only on rain.? I was able to raise animals for compost, but I am not allowed to do that here.? There are many plants that are new to me and each has its own season with new tastes, new textures. 3. What is the New Roots Program? The New Roots program helps refugees to become involved in agriculture and to grow their own food. We connect interested refugees to community garden space and provide them with seeds and other resources. We host trainings to help gardeners transfer their agricultural knowledge to the particular climate of the Sonoran Desert. We also enroll clients in public benefits (such as SNAP and WIC) upon arrival, and we implement a 3-module nutrition education with families in need. 4. Have you experienced culture shock? The trip to the United States was difficult; it was my first time flying. We were served new food in flight.? English was a problem because of the difference in pronunciation. My family thought the United States was cold but when we arrived in Tucson at night it was still 100?? F when we got off the plane. I had hoped to continue my nursing and counseling education in the U.S., but the cost of living is too high, making it unaffordable to also pay for my education.? Finding work is difficult in a new country and bringing in an income was my first priority.? 5. From which communities do you receive the most support and what have you learned from them that is the most valuable to you? Most of my support has come from International Rescue Committee and from an elderly Caucasian woman whom I met soon after arriving in Tucson.? We have become as close as mother and daughter and from her I can always receive help and advice. 6. Who are your role models? My mother, who just died in Rwanda, was a hard-worker and a confident lady who introduced me to agriculture.? I have her to thank for my love of agriculture. 7. Where do you see yourself in 5, 10, 20 years; how to get there? In five years, I hope to have developed my back yard into a large garden to raise enough food to feed my family with more that I can sell.? In ten years, I hope to have the mortgage on my home paid off.? In twenty years, I hope to be retired and able to enjoy my garden and my grandchildren. 8. What advice for young women interested in agriculture? Share experiences with others, listen to others and share knowledge, never give up their dreams, no matter what they aspire to be in this world. 9. What?¡¥s best advice you receive from someone? To trust in myself. Learning doesn?¡¥t stop: continue to learn in different ways as long as you are alive. To learn more and connect with other women leaders in agriculture across the country, we encourage you to visit? If there is a leading woman in agriculture you?¡¥d like to see on the blog, please send us your suggestions at?agwomenlead@usda.gov.

"Celebrate 50 Years of Protecting Animals with APHIS  Many people know that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is the agency tasked with administering the Animal Welfare Act (AWA).? But did you know that this is the 50th anniversary of that Act? In , a Dalmatian named Pepper was stolen from her backyard by a dealer, who then sold her to a hospital.? Pepper was used in research and subsequently died.? The public outcry was, understandably, enormous, including coverage in several major magazines.?

"Will Chestnuts Roast on an Open Fire Again Someday?  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA?¡¥s rich science and research portfolio. Today we learn more about how the National Institute of Food and Agriculture invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges. Seventy years ago, when Nat ?¡ãKing?¡À Cole first regaled us about roasted chestnuts in The Christmas Song, not many Americans could actually enjoy the treat because American chestnut trees were in dire straits. The predominant tree in Eastern American forests was nearing the tail end of a 50-year blight that killed an astonishing three to five billion trees, making the species functionally extinct. Now, however, researchers supported by USDA?¡¥s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) are working to restore the American chestnut and may be only a few years away from bringing back the iconic tree.  Alexandra Wilson, National Institute of Food and Agriculture  Posted in  Research and Science  May 10,   5 Responses",What are some ways that agricultural research can help restore and bring back functionally extinct species?,"1. Developing disease-resistant varieties through breeding programs, such as the American chestnut's blight-resistant trees. 2. Using biotechnology to introduce beneficial traits or genes from related species into the functionally extinct one. 3. Creating controlled-environment nurseries for propagating plants that can be reintroduced into the wild. 4. Conducting ecological studies to understand how the restored species will interact with other organisms and ecosystems. 5. Developing management strategies, such as habitat restoration and population monitoring, to ensure long-term survival of the restored species. Example from the content: The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is working on restoring the American chestnut tree through research and breeding programs.","Agricultural research can contribute to restoring and bringing back functionally extinct species in several ways: 1. **Crop breeding for genetic diversity**: By developing crops with traits from wild relatives, researchers can increase the genetic diversity of crop species, which can also benefit related wild species. This approach can help restore populations of functionally extinct species by reintroducing beneficial traits. 2. **Development of orphan crops**: Orphan crops are traditional crops that have been abandoned due to lack of interest or support. Reviving these crops through research and development can help bring back species that were once functionally extinct, such as the ancient grain Kamut (Triticum turanicum). 3. **Wild relatives of domesticated plants**: Research on wild relatives of domesticated plants can provide insights into how to restore populations of related wild species. For example, studying the genetic diversity of wheat's wild relatives (e.g., Triticum aestivum spp.) can inform efforts to restore functionally extinct species like Einkorn wheat. 4. **Seed banking and conservation**: Seed banks can preserve seeds from threatened or functionally extinct plant species, allowing researchers to study and potentially reintroduce these plants into their natural habitats. 5. **Ecological restoration**: Agricultural research on soil health, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem services can inform efforts to restore degraded ecosystems where functionally extinct species once thrived. 6. **Development of genetic resources for endangered species**: Researchers can develop genetic resources (e.g., improved cultivars or genetically modified organisms) that help conserve and restore populations of endangered or functionally extinct plant species. Examples of success stories include: * The revival of the ancient grain Kamut, which is now grown commercially in several countries. * The development of crops like Triticum aestivum spp. (einkorn wheat), which has been bred to improve its genetic diversity and suitability for small-scale farming. * Conservation efforts for wild relatives of domesticated plants, such as the reintroduction of quinoa's wild relative (Chenopodium pallidicaule) in Chile. These examples demonstrate how agricultural research can contribute to restoring functionally extinct species by developing new crop varieties, improving conservation practices, and promoting ecological restoration.",8.02E-79,0.29844098,0.049217002,0.151447661,0.837768555

Weber is accustomed to being the ?¡ãfirst.?¡À With top family ranking comes responsibility, and Weber had plenty of it. Growing up on her family?¡¥s 160-acre dairy farm in Bloomington, Wis., Weber, along with her siblings, helped clean the barn, pick up eggs and tend to the animals.? Her innate curiosity and connection to nature led to her love of science. She was the first in her family to go to college, graduating from Viterbo College, a women?¡¥s school in LaCrosse, Wis., with a degree in biology. She would go on to earn a master?¡¥s degree in entomology at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul and a doctorate in zoology from Southern Illinois University. Few women ranked among the agency?¡¥s scientific community when Weber joined in . She became the first woman scientist at the North Central Research Station?awhich later became the Northern Research Station. But being first had its challenges. In , Jackie Robertson, a research entomologist at the Pacific Southwest Research Station became the first to head a research project. Five years later, Weber followed suit. But even as she gathered more experience and prestige in her career as a scientist, Weber was often reminded in both subtle and not-so-subtle ways that she was a woman in a man?¡¥s world. She recalls one incident where she arrived with colleagues to a meeting to discuss a project she was spearheading. She was the only woman in the group. While the men mixed and mingled, no one paid any attention to Weber. ?¡ãThey assumed that I was along for the ride, or that I was someone?¡¥s wife,?¡À Weber said. An embarrassed hush fell over the group when she announced that she was the project leader. ?¡ãIt was fun for me to see their reaction,?¡À Weber said. And while Weber managed to keep a lighthearted attitude most of the time, she did admit that at times, the unequal treatment?aa snub here, an inappropriate comment there?aoccasionally wore on her. But Weber never gave up and through her professionalism proved to be a promising leader. She would go on to work at Forest Service headquarters in Washington, D.C. as a legislative resources specialist, and later staff assistant for planning in the Office of the Deputy Chief for Research. Given all of her ?¡ãfirsts,?¡À it was only fitting that Weber become the Forest Service?¡¥s first female director of a research station. She headed west to California to lead the Pacific Southwest Research Station in . ?While there, Weber was well-liked by station staff and highly respected for her ability to build consensus. Beyond the science, Weber was instrumental in improving workplace diversity. A consent decree, which specified hiring goals and affirmative action requirements helped pave the way for more women to join the Forest Service in California.? Under Weber?¡¥s leadership, the research station received the Chief?¡¥s Multicultural Award in . Today, about a third of the Forest Service?¡¥s 498 research scientists are women. In , Weber returned to Forest Service headquarters in Washington D.C. to become the associate deputy chief of Research, a position she held until her retirement in . ?¡ãBarbara broke new ground in everything she did,?¡À said Northern Research Station Assistant Director Hao Tran, who worked with Weber from -. ?¡ãSomeone had to pave the way?aand she did, in a very elegant and understated way.?¡À  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Research and Science  Tags:  Forestry  FS  International Women's Day  Pacific Research Station  Science  Women's History Month",What are some ways to improve workplace diversity in agricultural research stations?,"* Implementing consent decrees that specify hiring goals and affirmative action requirements * Setting aside time to discuss and address unequal treatment and biases, as Barbara C.

Twenty-five hundred acres really didn?¡¥t support two families, and we weren?¡¥t living extravagant lifestyles by any means.?¡À Then came the drought of . ?¡ãI thought, maybe this is a sign from God ¡§C maybe we shouldn?¡¥t be farming. Maybe we should move on to something else,?¡¥?¡À Cobb said. ?¡ãI was looking into moving down to Austin, Texas and being involved in some urban farming setups.?¡À In time, he and his wife Kaylyn put their house on the market and prepared to move, abandoning a century-old tradition of Cobb family farming. Using diverse cover crops and diverse animal grazing, the Cobbs are building soil health on their farm. Photo: Ron Nichols. Shortly after making that painful decision, Cobb?¡¥s father asked him to stop by and review some soil test results that had just arrived at USDA?¡¥s Natural Resources Conservation Service?¡¥s office in Temple, Texas. But before he could complete the chore, Cobb found himself ""trapped"" in a soil health workshop featuring NRCS?¡¥ Ray Archuleta and Willie Durham. Too polite to leave, he took a seat on the front row. Within minutes, Cobb was entranced by what he was hearing from the presenters and the presentation he was seeing with his own eyes. What he heard that morning from the soil health presenters rekindled a passion and love that conventional agriculture had nearly extinguished. ?¡ãBy the end of the day I knew I was going to stay and be a part of the paradigm shift.?¡À Cobb said. Since that fateful day, the Cobb?¡¥s have downsized their farm from 2,500 acres to 450 and transitioned from row crops to cover crops with multi-species livestock grazing systems. ?¡ãWe planted over a thousand acres of cover crops the very next year, got rid of all of the tillage equipment, and just dove in,?¡À he says.? Cobb admits his farming operation is still evolving, but improving soil health remains the central goal. ?¡ãOne very high priority is to help with the soil and building up the soil and the carbon in the soil,?¡À he says. ?¡ãWe will probably make thousands of mistakes but we?¡¥ll learn along the way.?¡À Whatever happens, he says, ?¡ãThe goal is to build the soil.?¡À While Cobb?¡¥s new business model hasn?¡¥t fully evolved, he and his family are already reaping some of the intrinsic rewards he fondly remembered as a child growing up on the farm ¡§C like enjoying the smell of blooming clover in the evening and watching the sun rise on a warm summer day. ?¡ãIf we can make a living and stay here then we couldn?¡¥t ask for anything more,?¡À he says.

"Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 30,   NOTE: This week on the USDA Blog, we?¡¥ve been featuring the stories of America?¡¥s Harvest Heroes who, like farmers across the nation, are working this harvest season to secure the bounty of healthy food American agriculture is renowned for. From laying the foundation for the next generation of farmers putting down roots in rural America, supporting the fruit and vegetable growers who are helping to build healthier communities, bolstering new markets for the products of agricultural innovation, to harvesting renewable energy that is made in Rural America, with USDA?¡¥s support our farmers are yielding strong results for every American. This blog focuses on two heroes of a different kind of harvest ¡§C clean, renewable energy that is . I spent some time in Montana earlier this month to attend the Harvesting Clean Energy conference in Billings. We talked about options for continuing to support clean energy development, whether it's bio-based, geothermal, solar, or wind ¡§C and how rural America fits in to the picture of clean energy development. Our Rural Energy for America Program was, unsurprisingly, a key focus by the participants. Having been reauthorized by the recent Farm Bill, Congress put REAP in a position to have very real impact on clean energy development in our rural communities. If properly leveraged with other programs, both private and public, and investment from the private sector ¡§C the funding made available by Congress could conceivably have a billion-dollar impact on clean energy development in our nation. Red Lodge Ales owner Sam Hoffmann (middle) explains his brewery?¡¥s thermal solar heating system to Montana State Director Janelle Gustafson (l) and Deputy Under Secretary Lillian Salerno (r). Hoffmann used the Rural Energy for America Program to purchase and install the thermal system. What strikes me the most is, how many of the projects to this point have been implemented. Rather than just the large complexes ¡§C which certainly have their place in the overall picture ¡§C rural America has responded by implementing small-scale projects, often at an individual business level, that have had noteworthy impact on the energy structure in their communities. While in Montana, I was able to see first-hand how these small scale projects have made a positive change on not just the carbon footprint and energy consumption of rural small businesses, but on their operational bottom line. I visited Red Lodge, Montana, a small community southwest of Billings that acts as a gateway in to Yellowstone National Park via the Beartooth Highway. Two particular businesses stood out for me, the Yodeler Motel, and Red Lodge Ales. Both companies had made investments in their businesses through the Rural Energy for America Program, and done so on a relatively small scale ¡§C yet had seen a direct and positive impact on their operations due to the cost savings from the renewable energy sources. Harnessing the sun's radiant thermal energy to heat water, both the Yodeler and Red Lodge Ales have utilized the water in different ways to benefit their businesses. The Yodeler uses the heated water in their boiler to heat the rooms and common areas of the historic motel on the south end of Red Lodge. Mac Dean of the Yodeler Motel in Red Lodge, Mont. explains the thermal transfer system that supplies the motel's boiler with heated water, providing warmth to the Yodeler's rooms and common areas. Red Lodge Ales takes the pre-heated water, and superheats it to clean their brewing tanks, as well as maintain the necessary heat to brew their beer. It's a prime example of two different businesses using similar technology to harvest the abundant, clean, and free energy around us to benefit not only the businesses themselves ¡§C and their bottom line ¡§C but to benefit their community and the environment as a whole. I'm proud that USDA Rural Development could play a role in that.  Category/Topic:  Rural  Tags:  harvest heroes  Rural Development  Rural Energy for America Program","""What are some ways in which small-scale renewable energy projects can benefit rural businesses and communities?""","Implementing small-scale renewable energy projects, such as harnessing solar thermal energy to heat water, can have a direct and positive impact on rural businesses and communities by reducing their carbon footprint and energy consumption, while also providing cost savings that can be reinvested in the business. These projects can benefit individual businesses, such as breweries like Red Lodge Ales, and motels like the Yodeler Motel, by using pre-heated water to clean equipment or heat rooms, thereby improving operational efficiency and reducing expenses. Furthermore, these small-scale projects can contribute to the overall energy structure in rural communities, making them more sustainable and environmentally friendly.","Small-scale renewable energy projects can significantly benefit rural businesses and communities in several ways: 1. **Reduced Energy Costs**: By generating their own renewable energy, rural businesses and communities can reduce their reliance on expensive and often unreliable grid power, resulting in lower electricity bills. 2. **Increased Energy Independence**: Renewable energy systems provide a reliable source of power, reducing the need for external energy sources and promoting energy self-sufficiency. 3. **Job Creation and Local Economic Growth**: The development and maintenance of small-scale renewable energy projects can create jobs and stimulate local economies through investments in equipment, materials, and labor. 4. **Improved Air Quality and Environmental Health**: By transitioning to clean energy sources, rural communities can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, leading to improved air quality and enhanced environmental health. 5. **Enhanced Energy Security**: Small-scale renewable energy projects can provide a reliable source of power during grid outages or other disruptions, improving energy security for critical businesses and community facilities. 6. **Community Engagement and Education**: Renewable energy projects often involve community involvement in planning, implementation, and maintenance, fostering greater awareness and understanding of clean energy technologies. 7. **Increased Property Values**: Installing small-scale renewable energy systems can increase property values by making homes and businesses more attractive to potential buyers who value environmental sustainability and energy efficiency. 8. **Access to Clean Water and Sanitation**: Renewable energy-powered water pumping and treatment systems can improve access to clean water and sanitation in rural areas, enhancing public health and well-being.

"Deputy Secretary in  USDA Results  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Initiatives  Mar 08,  Rossie Fisher, co-owner of Brookview Farm in Manakin-Sabot, VA. March 8 is International Women's Day. Today, March 8th, is International Women?¡¥s Day. What better day to recognize the incredible achievements of women in agriculture? Women have always played a key role on the farm or ranch. Traditionally, women often kept the books and ensured the solvency of the business while men ran the day-to-day production operation. That is still the case in many households, but these days, we are seeing more and more women take a lead role in farm operations as well. In ¡§C the year of USDA?¡¥s most recent agricultural census ¡§C some 30 percent of farm operators in the U.S. were women. That?¡¥s a 19 percent increase over the census. Fourteen percent of U.S. farms listed women as the principal operator in , meaning that women made the day-to-day decisions on the farm. (Women listed as farm operators, rather than principal operators, likely run the farm along with a partner or spouse). That?¡¥s a 24 percent increase over . Individual states are showing even more involvement of women in farming. Arizona and New Hampshire have the greatest number of farms whose principal operator is a woman; one out of three New Hampshire farms is run by a woman, more than twice the national average. We know that American agriculture is constantly innovating to meet new demands. Women are part of a new wave of innovation in the industry. Women-operated farms tend to be very diverse, producing more vegetables, fruit and nuts, horticultural crops, poultry and sheep or goats than male-operated farms. They are also smaller on average, suggesting that they may engage in more direct-to-consumer sales or sell to local grocers, restaurants, or institutions. These strategies require new, creative business models and innovative production methods. And women are leading the way. As a historically disadvantaged group, women face unique challenges entering agriculture. I?¡¥m proud of USDA?¡¥s efforts to meet the needs of women farmers through training and business planning programs, mentorship opportunities, support for value-added product development, and our efforts to build strong local food systems through USDA?¡¥s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative. You can learn more about USDA?¡¥s support for women in agriculture by searching for projects on the KYF Compass Map using the search term ?¡ãwomen.?¡À Today, let?¡¥s all take some time to thank women for their hard work on farms, ranches and in rural communities.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Massachusetts in  Conservation  Oct 29,  Al Rose discusses his fourth-generation Red Apple ?¡ãgreen?¡À Farm with NRCS?¡¥ Soil Conservationist Dave Bacon. NOTE: This week on the USDA Blog, we'll feature the stories of America's Harvest Heroes who, like farmers across the nation, are working this harvest season to secure the bounty of healthy food American agriculture is renowned for.

For these reasons and more, America?¡¥s Harvest Heroes deserve our thanks. A towering, craggy McIntosh apple tree in the center of the orchard at Red Apple Farm in Phillipston, Massachusetts, has weathered 113 winters, borne many tons of crisp, tart apples and fed generations of customers. Planted in , it?¡¥s the oldest commercially planted McIntosh tree in New England and possibly the country. Thanks to care by generations of the Rose family, that ancient apple tree still produces fruit today. Al Rose and his wife Nancy, who operate the fourth-generation farm, have introduced an innovative, modern growing system just a stone?¡¥s throw from the century McIntosh. To ensure success in an area that sees its share of dry summers, the Roses sought the help of USDA?¡¥s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). ?¡ãIt may be challenging, but I think we?¡¥ve got a natural environment that?¡¥s conducive to growing great apples,?¡À said Al Rose. ?¡ãWe have cold nights for a good part of the growing season, which are great for the color of the apples. Fall without apples in New England just wouldn?¡¥t be the same.?¡À A micro-irrigation system was installed to deliver water from the pond directly to the young trees. This type of watering system conserves more water than a conventional overhead sprinkler system. ?¡ãWe?¡¥re at one of the highest elevations for orchards in New England ¡§C 1,250 feet,?¡À said Rose, standing in the orchard on a windy day. ?¡ãWe have a wind turbine that?¡¥s been cranking today. Between that and our solar panels, we?¡¥re a red farm and a ??green?¡¥ farm.?¡À Red Apple Farm is protected under the state Agricultural Preservation Restriction (APR) program. ?Through a state grant program to help the viability of APR farms, Rose developed a business plan that called for planting an acre of trees in a new trellis system. ?¡ãWe?¡¥re not creating more land here; we have to be more productive on the land that we do have,?¡À explained Rose. The ?¡ãfruit wall?¡À is small trees, shallow-rooted and spaced as close as a foot apart. ?¡ãIt?¡¥s the most productive way and, from a cost standpoint, it?¡¥s easier to maintain,?¡À said Rose. ?¡ãBut, to do that, you have to have a pond in place.?¡À So, Rose reached out to NRCS for help with irrigation. ?¡ãI know they have the technical expertise to do it right and give us advice,?¡À said Rose, who also got financial help through the federal Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) program. Dave Bacon, NRCS Soil Conservationist, has been assisting Red Apple Farm for more than a decade. He explained that, in Massachusetts, the AMA program is used for drought mitigation. ?¡ãWe didn?¡¥t want to have an acre?¡¥s worth of apple trees fail because there was no irrigation water available,?¡À said Bacon. Al Rose stands near the McIntosh tree, planted in . Bacon explained that soil indicated that there was adequate ground water to create a pond, a more reliable water source than drilling a well. With well drilling, there is a risk that there won?¡¥t be enough water to meet the plants?¡¥ needs.? A micro-irrigation system was installed to deliver water from the pond directly to the young trees. This type of watering system conserves more water than a conventional overhead sprinkler system. ?¡ãAs we slowly change to the newer high production, higher density plantings, it?¡¥s going to make us a lot more successful for the current generation and future generations,?¡À said Rose. ?¡ãIf you want to do something right, get the experts involved,?¡À said Rose.? ?¡ãNRCS has experts; they know how to do it and they know how to do it right.

It's possible that this is a fictional farm or not a well-known establishment. However, I can provide some general information on water conservation methods used by apple farms and their potential impact on productivity. Some apple farms have implemented innovative water conservation methods such as drip irrigation, which delivers water directly to the roots of the trees, reducing evaporation and runoff. This method has been shown to improve fruit quality, increase yields, and reduce water consumption. Another method is using precision irrigation systems that use sensors and computer algorithms to monitor soil moisture levels and adjust watering schedules accordingly. This approach can help prevent overwatering and ensure optimal tree growth while minimizing water waste. It's worth noting that these methods are not exclusive to the Red Apple Farm (if it exists) or Massachusetts, but rather general practices used by many farms worldwide to conserve water and improve productivity.

Produce markets across the U.S. joined the friendly 90-day competition by making sure that usable fruits and vegetables were not thrown away. ?While these fresh foods weren?¡¥t picture-perfect supermarket quality or simply didn?¡¥t sell, they were healthy, wholesome foods that could be made into juices, added to animal feeds, used for compost, or donated to charity.  Bruce Summers, Agricultural Marketing Service Associate Administrator  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 06,   Respond to this story",What percentage reduction in food waste would provide enough food for approximately 25 million Americans every year?,15 percent.,"According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), reducing food waste by 50% globally could produce enough food to feed an additional 870 million people. This is based on the FAO's estimate that one-third of all food produced worldwide, approximately 1.3 billion tonnes, gets lost or wasted. To determine the percentage reduction in food waste needed to provide enough food for approximately 25 million Americans every year, we can make a few assumptions and calculations: * The average American consumes about 2,500 calories per day. * This translates to approximately 915 pounds (415 kg) of food per person per year, based on an estimate from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). * For simplicity, let's assume we are talking about a reduction in household waste. Using these assumptions, if we want to provide enough food for 25 million Americans every year, this would require approximately 22.875 billion pounds (10.37 billion kg) of food per year. Now, using the FAO estimate that one-third of all food produced worldwide gets lost or wasted, and considering that in the United States alone, about 30-40% of the food supply is lost or wasted, we can make a rough calculation for household waste. Let's assume an average reduction rate that could provide enough food. For simplicity and to ensure a safe amount of food, we will aim for an equivalent to half of the current loss in terms of percentage reduction per year. Using this estimate and considering we are discussing reducing losses at the consumption level (households), let's calculate: A 50% reduction would be too aggressive and might not accurately represent achievable targets. However, a rough estimate could consider halving household waste: 50% / (30-40%) = 1.25 to 1.67 times less waste from households Converting this into percentage terms: A reduction of food waste by approximately 62.5% to 80% at the consumption level would need to occur. Given these rough estimates and focusing on household waste, we're assuming conservatively that the entire calculation is based on achievable targets for a broad average.",0,0,0,0,0.80808574
"Associate Deputy Administrator for APHIS Animal Care in  Animals  Plants  Jul 14,  Dr. Morgan, pictured here with her horse, Belle, knew at a young age that she wanted to be a veterinarian when, on a road trip with her parents, she saw the horses in Louisville and Lexington. Hello, I?¡¥m Dr. Andrea (Andy) Morgan, Associate Deputy Administrator of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)?¡¥s Animal Care (AC) program. In , when I hadn?¡¥t been out of vet school long and was working at a small animal practice, I got ahold of a brochure about APHIS?¡¥ Public Veterinary Practice Career Program. I was interested in working not just with small animals but with other animals, too?aexotic animals and horses, to name a few. So I joined APHIS that year, and here I am, still working for the agency 26 years and many important experiences later. My current position involves a lot of strategic planning and working within the program to find ways USDA can be more effective with Animal Welfare Act and Horse Protection Act inspections. Before I joined the AC program, I held a number of positions in APHIS?¡¥ Veterinary Services. I served as National Incident Commander for the U.S. response to an Exotic Newcastle Disease outbreak and National Coordinator for the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) surveillance program. The most memorable experience I?¡¥ve had at APHIS was ensuring the U.S. Equestrian Team horses could travel to the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. An unidentified equine illness hit New England that year before all of the ates. The European Union (EU) Commission wanted to ban the entry of all U.S. horses into EU Member States. I was a staff vet with APHIS?¡¥ National Center for Import/Export, and I had to assure the EU that none of the Equestrian Team horses had been affected by the outbreak. Dr. Morgan shares her insights and perspectives with APHIS employees. For several hours, my EU counterpart Dr. Bernard Van Goethem and I were on the phone and faxing proposals back and forth. Keep in mind this was before e-mail was widely used. We were just two vets, hashing it out across the ocean. Dr. Van Goethem would share the proposals with EU Member States?¡¥ Chief Veterinary Officers and get back to me. Eventually, we all agreed on a proposal. I was especially glad to learn that Irish, one of the horses that wouldn?¡¥t have made it to Spain without those efforts, won the Olympic bronze medal in show jumping. It?¡¥s the coolest thing to negotiate on behalf of the United States, or to make things happen in any number of ways when there?¡¥s a problem to solve. Are there challenges when working as a public veterinarian? Always. But it?¡¥s like swimming?athere are no standard operating procedures?ayou have to just dive in. I?¡¥ve learned a lot about myself and my core values in my time at APHIS. This is my legacy.

The Act, and accompanying regulations developed by APHIS, set Federal standards of care for animals that are bred at the wholesale level, used in research, transported commercially, or exhibited to the public.? Under the law, APHIS has the authority and obligation to confiscate any AWA-regulated animal that is in a condition of unrelieved suffering. When APHIS inspectors identify a suffering animal, they intervene quickly on its behalf and make sure the animal gets the care it needs.? First, inspectors will clearly explain to the owner what needs to be done, such as requiring the facility?¡¥s veterinarian to tend to an injury or health issue, and then set a short deadline ?a usually 24 hours ?a for when corrective action must be taken. ?Under the AWA, if proper care is not provided by the deadline, APHIS must ensure that the animal is taken to a facility where it will receive humane care according to Federal standards.

"AMS Fruit and Vegetable Program Deputy Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 26,  The National Potato Board?¡¥s efforts to increase economic growth and market viability for American potato farmers have had an impact on the industry. In , U.S. potato exports were a record $1.6 billion. America's ag promotion groups work to educate consumers, as well as research and promote our nation?¡¥s agricultural products. Whether potatoes or pork, mangos or cotton, soybeans or almonds, ag promotion groups help consumers make informed choices and learn about new products. Although all ag promotion groups do have a similar goal and purpose ¡§C to pool their resources to increase demand and long-term economic growth for their? industries ¡§C they all accomplish this in different ways, tailoring their efforts to apply strategies that work best for each commodity. The United States Potato Board (USPB) is one of several national ag promotion groups operating under the oversight of USDA?¡¥s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS).? They are the central organizing force in implementing programs that increase demand for potatoes at home and abroad. This group provides the ideas, information, tools and inspiration for the industry to unite in achieving common goals. Anchored by a strong foundation of market and consumer research and analysis, the USPB domestic and international potato marketing programs include:?advertising, nutrition science, public relations, retail and foodservice marketing, and issues management.?Whether the potato is grown for fresh, frozen, chip, dehydrated or seed use, the USPB is dedicated to positioning potatoes as a nutrition powerhouse?atruly, goodness unearthed.? And all of these efforts mean more economic growth and market viability for American potato farmers. For Fiscal Year (July ¡§C June ), U.S. potato exports were a record $1.6 billion, an increase of 4% over FY12 The volume of exports increased 4% to 1,561,896 metric tons, or 66 million hundredweight at the fresh weight equivalent The volume of U.S. exports has increased 26% over the past five marketing years, led by a 62% increase in fresh, a 36% increase in dehydrated and a 17% increase in frozen For the first six months of FY14, the volume of exports of frozen products is up 2%, dehydrated is up 10% and fresh is up 2% The National Mango Board?¡¥s (NMB) mission is to increase the demand for fresh mangos in the U.S. by conducting promotion, market and production research. The NMB accomplishes this through three core programs: marketing, research and industry relations. Understanding consumer purchasing behaviors is key to increasing mango consumption in the U.S. The NMB conducts ongoing consumer research to explore consumer awareness, knowledge about mangos, buying habits, barriers to purchase and many other facets of consumer attitudes relative to mangos. ?Results from their consumer research help create, support and guide marketing efforts and messages to increase mango demand. Demand is the most direct and practical way to monitor consumer purchasing behavior since it reflects all of the conditions impacting buying decisions. Most of the changes in the demand for mangos come from attracting new households to buy (market penetration) and far less in changing the number of mangos purchased (market intensity) per buyer. With NMB programs, market penetration increased from under 3% in to over 13% in . Mango availability per capita has increased 53% since to an estimated 2.87 pounds per year in . This means that increased mango sales are related to more consumers perceiving mangos as an option, and much of this is due to NMB?¡¥s work.? Through market penetration more consumers are likely to make mangos a routine part of their diets.? By providing promotional information to increase consumer awareness of the fruit, NMB?¡¥s efforts convince more potential customers to give them a try. Whether engaging in consumer research, nutrition education or advertising, ag promotion groups help America?¡¥s farmers and agribusinesses navigate through marketing challenges, opening doors to new markets and broadening our food options. Results from consumer research conducted by the National Mango Board helps create, support and guide marketing efforts and messages to increase mango demand. Increased consumer demand means economic viability for mango producers, importers and businesses.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Jan 28,  Dianilda Rodriguez of GR Management Corp., Arlene Zambrana from USDA Rural Development, and Maria Rodriquez-Collazo of PathStone stand in front of the completed Alturas de Casta?er housing complex in Puerto Rico. In the municipality of Lares, Puerto Rico, lies Alturas de Casta?er, a small, mountainous community that is home to 24 agricultores and their families. The agricultores - or farm workers - work hard year-round to produce coffee, bananas, root vegetables and citrus fruits that are then sold in local markets and to area restaurants. Before coming to the community of Alturas de Casta?er, many families lived in cramped conditions, sometimes with two or three other families.? Conditions were unsanitary and children were constantly sick.? Some homes did not even have roofs, and residents suffered dangerous exposure to the natural elements, including torrential rains during hurricane season. Alturas de Casta?er resident Maria Rodriguez and her husband recall renting a house that they could barely afford. The home was in disrepair, they had to use a ladder as a makeshift set of front steps to their home, and finding snakes and rats in their living space was commonplace. With the help of USDA Rural Development's Farm Labor Housing Program, the Municipality of Lares was able to build an affordable 24-home rental community, Alturas de Casta?er, dedicated solely to farm workers and their families. After moving into this community, living conditions improved dramatically for many residents. Residents like Jomar, an agricultor who uses a wheelchair for mobility; the closets and kitchen in his Alturas de Casta?er home were built for wheelchair accessibility. The community is quiet and clean, the children of the farm workers have a safe place to play, and the homes are well maintained by an experienced management company. It's affordable, too; farm workers living in this community are only to pay 30 percent of their income towards rent. Built in , Alturas de Casta?er was a product of a partnership between USDA Rural Development, Rural Opportunities Puerto Rico, Inc.

"Deputy Administrator of the National Organic Program in  Food and Nutrition  May 16,  Organic is one label that most consumers are familiar with, but understanding what ?¡ãorganic?¡À really means can help consumers make informed choices. If a product meets these requirements, its label may include a statement like, ?¡ãMade with organic oats and cranberries.?¡À A more generic statement like, ?¡ãMade with organic ingredients,?¡À is not allowed. This is the sixteenth installment of the Organic 101 series that explores different aspects of the USDA organic regulations. Deciphering food labels and marketing claims can be a challenge for the average consumer.? Companies use production and handling claims as a way to differentiate their products in the marketplace. Organic is one label that most consumers are familiar with, but understanding what ?¡ãorganic?¡À really means can help consumers make informed choices. USDA certified organic products have strict production and labeling requirements. ?The U.S. organic industry is regulated by the National Organic Program (NOP), part of USDA?¡¥s Agricultural Marketing Service.? Certified organic products are produced without excluded methods such as genetic engineering or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). ?The organic standards are designed to allow natural substances in organic farming while prohibiting synthetic substances. There are four distinct labeling categories for certified organic food products ¡§C 100% Organic, Organic, Made with organic ***, and specific organic ingredients.? There are also labeling requirements for organic livestock feed. Today, I wanted to talk more about the ?¡ãMade with organic***?¡À category. Multi-ingredient agricultural products in the ?¡ãMade with organic ***?¡À category must contain at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients (not including salt or water).? These products may contain up to 30 percent of allowed non-organic ingredients. ?All ingredients ¡§C including the 30 percent non-organic ingredients ¡§C must be produced without GMOs. If a product meets these requirements, its label may include a statement like, ?¡ãMade with organic oats and cranberries.?¡À? A more generic statement like, ?¡ãMade with organic ingredients,?¡À is not allowed. If an ingredient is identified in the ?¡ãMade with organic ***?¡À statement, it must be a truthful claim. This means the product can only contain organic forms of that specific ingredient.?? For example, if the label states ?¡ãMade with organic corn?¡À all raw and processed corn-based ingredients?asuch as blue corn, corn oil, and corn starch?amust be certified organic. The USDA organic regulations provide a set list of ?¡ãfood groups.?¡À All raw and processed forms of ingredients in that food group must be certified organic. For example, if a product states, ?¡ãMade with organic grains,?¡À all ingredients derived from grains?asuch as enriched wheat flour, corn oil, or oats?amust be certified organic.? If a product contains both organic and non-organic forms of the same ingredient, they must be identified separately in the ingredient statement. ?¡ãMade with organic***?¡À products can?¡¥t use the USDA organic seal, but must identify the USDA-accredited certifying agent. You can look for the identity of the certifier on a packaged product for verification that the product meets USDA?¡¥s organic standards.? Certifying agents are accredited by the USDA, and are responsible for ensuring that the USDA organic products meet or exceed all organic standards. The NOP recently put out final guidance on this labeling category to ensure consistency in labeling practices throughout the organic industry.? Consumers purchase organic products expecting that they maintain their organic integrity from farm to market, and USDA is committed to meeting these expectations.?

However, it provides estimates for total expenditures on children by families and breaks down these costs into categories such as housing, childcare, education, and other expenses. If you're looking for information on how to calculate or find this specific percentage, I can help with a general search-based answer.","According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the average cost of raising a child from birth to age 18 is approximately $233,610. This estimate includes expenses such as: 1. Food: $31,970 2. Housing: $93,510 3. Healthcare: $14,370 4. Childcare and education: $13,610 5. Transportation: $7,380 6. Clothing: $8,650 7. Entertainment, miscellaneous expenses: $10,440 Breaking down the food category specifically, the USDA estimates that a family spends around 16% to 20% of their net income on food for a child from birth to age 18. To give you a better idea, here's a rough breakdown of the estimated costs based on the average annual income levels: * Assuming a middle-income family with an annual income between $50,000 and $75,000 (according to the USDA's definition), their net income would be around $35,000 to $50,000. * Based on this, the estimated cost of food for a child from birth to age 18 would be approximately 10% to 15% of the family's total expenses. So, while it's difficult to provide an exact percentage without knowing more about the specific family, the general estimate is that around 10% to 15% of a middle-income family's expenses go towards food for a child from birth to age 18.",7.42E-79,0.291666667,0.048951049,0.131944444,0.839291811

"Economist at the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 13,  Families Projected to Spend an Average of $233,610 Raising a Child Born in . USDA recently issued Expenditures on Children by Families, . This report is also known as ?¡ãThe Cost of Raising a Child.?¡À USDA has been tracking the cost of raising a child since and this analysis examines expenses by age of child, household income, budgetary component, and region of the country. Based on the most recent from the Consumer Expenditures Survey, in , a family will spend approximately $12,980 annually per child in a middle-income ($59,200-$107,400), two-child, married-couple family. Middle-income, married-couple parents of a child born in may expect to spend $233,610 ($284,570 if projected inflation costs are factored in*) for food, shelter, and other necessities to raise a child through age 17. This does not include the cost of a college education. Where does the money go? For a middle-income family, housing accounts for the largest share at 29% of total child-rearing costs.? Food is second at 18%, and child care/education (for those with the expense) is third at 16%. Expenses vary depending on the age of the child. As families often need more room to accommodate children, housing is the largest expense. We did the analysis by household income level, age of the child, and region of residence. Not surprising, the higher a family?¡¥s income the more was spent on a child, particularly for child care/education and miscellaneous expenses. Expenses also increase as a child ages.? Overall annual expenses averaged about $300 less for children from birth to 2 years old, and averaged $900 more for teenagers between 15-17 years of age. Teenagers have higher food costs as well as higher transportation costs as these are the years they start to drive so insurance is included or a maybe a second car is purchased for them. Regional variation was also observed. Families in the urban Northeast spent the most on a child, followed by families in the urban West, urban South, and urban Midwest.? Families in rural areas throughout the country spent the least on a child?achild-rearing expenses were 27% lower in rural areas than the urban Northeast, primarily due to lower housing and child care/education expenses. Child-rearing expenses are subject to economies of scale. That is, with each additional child, expenses on each declines. For married-couple families with one child, expenses averaged 27% more per child than expenses in a two-child family.? For families with three or more children, per child expenses averaged 24% less on each child than on a child in a two-child family.? This is sometimes referred to as the ?¡ãcheaper by the dozen?¡À effect. Each additional child costs less because children can share a bedroom; a family can buy food in larger, more economical quantities; clothing and toys can be handed down; and older children can often babysit younger ones. Food costs have decreased over the years thanks to increased efficiency in American agriculture. This report is one of many ways that USDA works to support American families through our programs and work. It outlines typical spending by families from across the country, and is used in a number of ways to help support and education American families.? Courts and state governments use this to inform their decisions about child support and foster care payments.? Financial planners use the information to provide advice to their clients, and families can access our Cost of Raising a Child calculator, which we update with every report on our website, to look at spending patterns for families similar to theirs.

Several factors have contributed to this trend: 1. **Improved crop yields**: Increased use of technology, such as precision agriculture, genetically modified seeds, and irrigation systems, has led to higher crop yields per acre. This means that farmers can produce more food with less land, reducing the cost of production. 2. **Lower input costs**: Efficiency gains have allowed farmers to reduce their inputs, including labor, fuel, and equipment expenses. These savings are then passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices. 3. **Increased economies of scale**: Larger farms and agricultural companies can take advantage of economies of scale, purchasing inputs at lower prices and achieving greater efficiency in production. This competitiveness is often reflected in lower market prices. 4. **Reduced waste and spoilage**: Advanced technology and better logistics have helped to minimize food waste and spoilage, reducing the financial burden on farmers and ultimately benefiting consumers. The cumulative effect of these factors has been a significant decrease in food costs for American families over the past few decades. According to data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the average cost of a food basket (the total cost of all food items) per month decreased by approximately 25% between 1980 and 2022, adjusted for inflation. Specifically: * The average monthly expenditure on food in the United States dropped from $432.50 in 1980 to around $344.40 in 2022, according to the USDA's Economic Research Service. * The Food Price Index (FPI), which tracks changes in consumer prices for a basket of foods, has shown a steady decline since its peak in 2008. * The overall cost of food as a share of disposable personal income (DPI) has decreased significantly over the past few decades, from about 17.6% in 1980 to around 9.7% in 2022, according to data from the USDA's Economic Research Service. These statistics illustrate that increased efficiency in American agriculture has indeed led to lower food costs for American families, making nutritious and affordable food more accessible to a wider population.",0.008713598,0.064864865,0.032608696,0.064864865,0.846298873

BAR staff explain their grading review process while BAR Chairman Jim Whalen looks on. The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration?¡¥s (GIPSA) National Grain Center (NGC) was proud to host Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on Wednesday, October 23.? The NGC, located in Kansas City, MO, is home to the Federal Grain Inspection Service?¡¥s (FGIS) Technology and Science Division along with staff from FGIS?¡¥ Quality Assurance and Compliance Division and Field Management Division. The grain inspectors, scientists and engineers at the NGC provide a broad spectrum of grain inspection services and support within recently renovated state of the art laboratories.?? During the visit, NGC staff demonstrated how they oversee, develop and approve methods and instruments used for grain inspection that ensure the consistent standard of measuring quality essential to grain marketing. Members of the Board of Appeals and Review (BAR) and the Grading Services Laboratory (GSL) described their critical role within the grain inspection process.? When a grain quality factor is measured through sensory evaluation ¡§C how the grain looks or smells ¡§C all grain inspectors looking at and smelling the grain sample must be looking for exactly the same thing. Tom Weber, Leader of GIPSA's Trace Analysis Laboratory, explains the process of preparing and testing grain samples for the presence of pesticide residues as Dr. Tim Norden, Chief of GIPSA's Analytical Chemistry Branch, and Mary Alonzo, Director of GIPSA's Technology and Science Division, watch. The BAR?¡¥s experienced eyes and noses establish the point where a quality factor impacts a grain sample?¡¥s overall grade.? The GSL monitors the accuracy of individual grain inspection results while the BAR monitors the overall grain inspection results against the BAR?¡¥s standard of performance.? Both resolve appeals of grain inspection results determined at the initial point of inspection.? The BAR?¡¥s interpretation is USDA?¡¥s final and binding determination. Equating the process to finding a needle in a haystack, Dr. Tim Norden described how specialized instruments allow his team to analyze grain samples for trace amounts of pesticides and mycotoxins. The results are often used to confirm that U.S. grain meets international limits for these harmful chemicals.? Dr. Norden also emphasized that evolving technology requires that his staff and laboratory constantly maintain their skills. The NGC?¡¥s Biotechnology Laboratory develops and validates methods to identify genetic events in grain.? Dr. Tandace Bell, Chief, Biotechnology and Analytical Services Branch, discussed the multi-step process used by her team.? Dr. Bell also emphasized the collaborative nature of biotechnology methods development.? GIPSA?¡¥s Biotechnology Proficiency Program, now in its tenth year, collaborates with over 200 laboratories around the world to ensure their ability to accurately detect genetic events.? GIPSA also works closely with other USDA agencies with biotechnology programs. Dr. Tandace Bell, Chief of GIPSA's Biotechnology and Analytical Services Branch, discusses with Secretary Vilsack GIPSA's role in supporting agricultural biotechnology.  Test weight and moisture are the most commonly measured quality factors in all types of grain.???FGIS has developed a prototype for a training tool to improve inspector skills. Secretary Vilsack was able to see that technique does indeed make a difference while trying out a test weight trainer being developed by FGIS.? The test weight trainer measures a grain inspector?¡¥s strike off technique against the approved standard.? New and experienced grain inspectors can use it to perfect their technique on this critical measurement. FGIS approved two instruments to measure moisture in all officially graded commodities over the past year.? The Unified Grain Moisture Algorithm (UGMA)-Compatible moisture meters offer improved performance under a wider range of conditions.? Dr. Dave Funk, GIPSA?¡¥s Chief Scientist, developed the UGMA algorithm that is the basis of the measurement process of the new meters.? Dr. Funk recounted the development process, and demonstrated how the two machines offer equivalent results. The renovated NGC enhances GIPSA?¡¥s ability to certify the accuracy and stability of instruments that measure various quality factors in grain. We all thank Secretary Vilsack for allowing us to show him how the NGC and FGIS support U.S. agriculture.

"Deputy Administrator of the National Organic Program in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  May 14,  Organic certification cost share programs puts organic certification within reach for farms of all sizes. It is of great value to organic farmers and supports the integrity of the organic label. Consumers are increasingly looking for organic products when they visit the supermarket.? Last year, organic products reached a record number of sales, accounting for over $39 billion in U.S. retail sales.? To meet consumer demand, the industry needs more organic operations to produce everything from organic milk to organic granola bars.? Thanks to support from the Farm Bill, USDA has two cost share programs that assist organic farms and businesses with about $11 million per year in certification assistance¡§C making it possible for producers and handlers of all sizes to consider organic certification.? Cost share programs support certified operations across the organic supply chain by making certification more affordable. The USDA?¡¥s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) administers these programs through grants to participating states. In , USDA funding allowed states to issue nearly 10,000 reimbursements worth more than $6 million, helping the organic community thrive and grow.? ""The U.S. is currently experiencing an explosion of demand for certified organic products and our goal is to see that demand is met by U.S. farmers,?¡À said Abby Youngblood, Executive Director of the National Organic Coalition.? ?¡ãWe expect that the organic cost share programs will encourage more U.S. farms to certify and/or add another certification scope to meet this demand.""

"Kentucky State Director in  Rural  Jun 09,  Tex Peyton's new home is shown under construction next to the old one. USDA celebrates National Homeownership Month each year in June, and we continue to shine the spotlight on projects across the nation. I wanted to illustrate the work we do to provide ladders of opportunity for rural residents who might not have such an opportunity without the support of USDA Rural Development. I had the pleasure of meeting one such person this week. His name is Tex Peyton and for the past 18 years he lived in a basic two-room house in Eastern Kentucky that lacked indoor plumbing. Thanks to a team of partners that includes USDA Rural Development, Habitat for Humanity, Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and Columbia Pipeline, Peyton now has an affordable energy-efficient house that he is proud to call home ¡§C in the community where he grew up in West Liberty. Habitat for Humanity provided the labor to build the home while USDA, along with our partners at Columbia Pipeline and Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, provided the financing for Peyton to purchase it. The house is incredibly energy-efficient and features a Lennox mini-split HVAC system, low e-argon windows and above-standard insulation in the walls, ceiling and floors ¡§C building components that will significantly reduce the monthly cost of heating and cooling the home. Persistent poverty counties in Kentucky, like Morgan County where Peyton lives, face challenges that are unique to rural communities. They are often geographically isolated, lack educational opportunities, have high rates of unemployment and are usually underserved ¡§C qualities that impede economic opportunity and reduce quality of life. USDA places special emphasis on persistent poverty counties and utilizes a strategy of partnering public resources with local expertise to grow rural economies and create jobs in these poverty-stricken areas. It is because of this emphasis, and the hard work of all our partners, that we had the ability to help Tex Peyton ¡§C and the privilege of celebrating with him as he opened his home to us this week.

"AMS National Organic Program Deputy Director in  Conservation  Jul 30,  To protect the integrity of the organic industry and its products, farms must certify that their operations are following USDA organic regulations. The USDA?¡¥s Agricultural Marketing Service offers farms resources to help offset the certification costs. This is the seventh installment of the Organic 101 series that explores different aspects of the USDA organic regulations. Annual organic certification fees allow certifiers to carry out their responsibilities. These fees vary according to an operation?¡¥s size and other variables. In light of that, the USDA organic cost share programs help to ensure that these costs don?¡¥t discourage those wanting to pursue organic certification. The programs make certification more affordable by reimbursing producers and handlers for as much as 75%?aup to a maximum of $750 a year?afor their certification costs. Eligible costs include application fees, inspection fees, travel for certification inspectors, and even postage. ?¡ãAfter I figured out how to apply, I found it to be easy,?¡À said Gary Philbrick of Philbrick Farms, a Paso Robles, Calif., organization that is certified to produce walnuts. ?¡ãI just save my receipts and fill out the necessary form and send it in [to the state].?¡À State governments administer the organic cost-share funds, appropriated by Congress under the Farm Bill. State governments, usually Departments of Agriculture, work with USDA to administer the program and distribute funds to growers, ranchers, and handlers that are currently certified to the USDA organic regulations. Applicants submit a short form along with proof of certification and an itemized invoice to their state agencies. The state verifies these applications before disbursing funds to eligible organic operations. The program is not competitive, so anyone who is eligible may apply for a reimbursement. ?¡ãI?¡¥m a small farmer, and this program helps me a lot,?¡À said Nancy Abramson of Rooster Ridge Farm, a 20-acre operation that devotes one-fifth of its acreage to growing everything from organic citrus to flowers to herbs. ?¡ãIn the beginning, I had a huge fee [getting certified], but the cost share gave me two-thirds of it back. The paperwork is nothing. I think the program is fantastic, and it makes organic farming very affordable for small farmers.?¡À Philbrick Farms, based in Paso Robles, Calif., harvests its certified organic walnuts in the fall. With the help of a shaker truck, walnuts fall to the ground and are collected to be sent to the processor for further handling. In particular, smaller operations like Philbrick Farms benefit from USDA?¡¥s organic cost share programs, which reimburse producers for as much as 75% of their certification fees. Photo courtesy of Philbrick Farms. When it comes to organic certification, there are many things small growers or handlers have to consider. Affordability is important and often at the top of the list. Organic certification not only fulfills a desired method of farming, but also meets the increased consumer demand for foods farmed and handled organically. ?¡ãIt?¡¥s a huge benefit for me that I can advertise that I?¡¥m certified organic,?¡À said Abramson. ?¡ãThere?¡¥s such a marketing plus, and it gets [my product] into grocery stores that require me to be organic.?¡À In addition to stocking grocery stores, Abramson takes pride in being able to market her products as organic when selling to consumers at the local farmers market and to the restaurants near her Santa Cruz operation. They all appreciate her organic spinach. The organic cost share program is one of many programs that USDA offers to support emerging, transitioning, or current organic growers and handlers.

"NRCS Oregon in  Conservation  Jan 18,  Sarahlee Lawrence inspects a row of organically grown flowers on her organic farm in the high desert of Central Oregon. Business is blooming for Sarahlee Lawrence and her organic food-and-flower-growing operation, Rainshadow Organics, in the Central Oregon high desert. The 28-year old organic pioneer is proud of her venture and credits USDA?¡¥s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) as a key component to her success. Lawrence approached NRCS several years ago to start the process of making her farm organic. NRCS helped her plan and implement a nutrient management program and address irrigation issues on both a two-acre vegetable-and-flower plot and a 25-acre field where she grows a mix of cover crops like wheat and clover. NRCS provided assistance to Lawrence through two Farm Bill programs. The Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) Organic Initiative is a nationwide special effort to provide financial assistance to National Organic Program (NOP) certified organic producers, as well as producers in the process of transitioning to organic production. And the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP) is a cooperative program to improve irrigation efficiency and reduce energy consumption. Drip irrigation system made possible by the NRCS Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP). Lawrence is especially pleased with the newly installed drip irrigation system that supplies water to more than 100 varieties of produce and a colorful assortment of flowers on her two-acre parcel. ?¡ãI could not have afforded or done that by myself,?¡À she explains. To be certified organic, a U.S. agricultural operation has to be approved by a USDA Accredited Certifying Agent. Applicants must comply with USDA Organic regulations and submit documentation on their property and farming practices. Transitioning to organic is often a lengthy process, as Lawrence knows. Fields may require preparation to support organic production, including the planting of cover crops, incorporating compost and other soil-enhancing practices. While it takes a while to transition an operation to a Certified Organic one, Lawrence is pleased with her progress. The market for fresh, locally grown food continues to expand in Central Oregon, and her customers include a local hospital, schools and restaurants. Over 100 different types produce are grown on this two-acre organic operation, ranging from beets and beans to cabbage and strawberries. She has also generated a new, dedicated client base through community supported agriculture (CSA). CSA is a way for consumers to directly invest in local farms and receive a regular delivery of fresh fruits, vegetables and other local products. Lawrence looks forward to a bright, rewarding and sustainable future. Find out more about the EQIP Organic Initiative. Check out more conservation stories on the USDA blog. Follow NRCS on Twitter.

Please note that these steps may vary depending on factors like farm size, crop type, and location. It's essential to work closely with a certified organic expert or certifying agency to ensure a smooth transition process.",2.42E-155,0.245508982,0.072289157,0.131736527,0.834246397
"Writer, Analytics Center of Excellence, Office of the Chief Information Officer in  Technology  Jun 17,  Hackathon participants use sensors and robotics to create solutions with USDA . Photo credit: BeMyApp The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently took another step forward on its path to accelerate information technology (IT) modernization and improve how it designs agricultural services and interacts with agricultural producers. This spring, USDA joined technical experts, IT professionals, and application developers for the first hackathon at the Internet of Things (IoT) World Conference in Santa Clara, California. Working collaboratively, the hackathon teams developed new solutions to challenging issues affecting agriculture. What are Hackathons? Hackathons are typically multi-day events where programmers and designers engage in collaborative computer programming. ?¡ãThe goal is not gaining unauthorized access to computer systems, or to necessarily produce a completely polished product,?¡À said Andrew Brown, Soil Scientist at the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and mentor at the hackathon. ?¡ãRather, hackathons focus on innovation, collaboration, and rapid application development.?¡À The hackathon was a fitting channel to address key challenges the USDA is working to solve. ?¡ãHackathons are a great way to spur innovation and have the potential to solve real issues,?¡À said Ted Kaouk, Chief Officer (CDO) for USDA?¡¥s Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). ?¡ãFarmers and ranchers are using from satellites, weather forecasts, sensors, and other technology for more precise agriculture, which is helping to improve agricultural processes on their operation while increasing profits and providing even better protection to the environment.?¡À USDA employees supported the hackathon by serving as judges and mentors for the competition. Inside the Hackathon Hackathon participants were challenged to use USDA?¡¥s soil, geospatial, and water forecasting to develop IT products that addressed access to water resources and wise water use to support the sustainability, growth, and viability of agriculture. They were to consider the following in their solutions: limited use of broadband in the rural U.S., cybersecurity, and applying machine learning models to make -driven decisions. The hackathon event was preceded by a discovery interlude where participants explored water challenges in agriculture and brainstormed ideas on possible solutions given their shared knowledge of the domain, technology, , and other areas. A webinar one week prior to the event provided an overview of the hackathon and discussion of the datasets, and messaging application, Slack, was used where USDA mentors could answer questions regarding USDA , tools, and resources. The hackathon was a two-day event that included participation from eight teams ranging from two to seven people. During the event, each team gathered around a table to devise a solution while mentors walked around the room to check in, ask questions, and provide guidance. ?¡ãMentors worked one-on-one with hackathon participants to help them conceptualize the challenge and apply the datasets,?¡À said Brown. ?¡ãMost participants had an approach in mind and a general goal and needed help with conceptual aspects of interpreting the . Agricultural production systems have fundamental limits and unique considerations that make subject matter expert input very valuable. The mentor cadre?¡¥s practical experience in agriculture and environmental problems was critical to helping teams keep their solutions in the realm of possibility.?¡À By 1:00 p.m. on the second day, all code needed to be completed. In the afternoon, each team had three minutes to ?¡ãpitch?¡À their solution. Of the eight groups that were formed, three finalists were selected to present their solutions on stage at the ?¡ãEcoCenter System Stage?¡À located on the Expo Center floor. After the judges reviewed the presentations, Carlos Suarez, NRCS State Conservationist for California, announced ?¡ãTeam Smart Ag?¡À as the winner and presented them with the hackathon trophy. Team Smart Ag?¡¥s Winning Solution Team Smart Ag developed a low-cost, low-power smart-farming solution that would enable farmers to use devices to monitor a variety of conditions, such as water needs for crops and livestock health. The open-source, conversational artificial intelligence (AI) platform includes a phone application that allows farmers to ask questions, such as ?¡ãWhere do I need to water today??¡À. Team Smart Ag also created a 3D visualization of a hypothetical farm to provide a first-person view of the land, so farmers can locate runoff and areas that need water. In addition to winning the hackathon trophy, Team Smart Ag received prizes valued at $15K total, which included an interview with ITPro Today and opportunities to present their winning solution at highly-visible events at the conference. Hackathons as Part of IT Modernization Model The hackathon follows the White House?¡¥s push toward IT modernization through the new Center of Excellence (CoE) model. The model has five focus areas: cloud adoption, IT infrastructure optimization, customer experience, service delivery analytics, and contact centers. USDA, which has been designated a CoE, is using this new model to support the improved use of IT resources throughout the department. The CoE is planning to support additional competitions this year.

"NRCS Mississippi in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Jul 13,  The Stoltzfuses use high tunnels to lengthen the growing season for fresh fruits and vegetables. They built the first high tunnel on their own, and they liked it so much, they decided to build a second one with the help of NRCS.  For many farmers, the lessons of agriculture begin at a young age. This is true for Florence, Miss., farmer Kathy Stoltzfus, who says that her dad taught her what she knows when she was a child. She has fond memories of running barefoot through rice fields and the taste of freshly grown food. Now Stoltzfus and her husband, Bob, run a small farm in central Mississippi, where they raise fruits, vegetables and eggs. Her farming experience, coupled with his grocer experience, makes them a powerhouse at the Mississippi Farmers Market in Jackson, where they sell many different vegetables, including a variety of greens, broccoli, onions, radishes, peas, tomatoes, squash and zucchini. Their eggs are a hit, selling out every Saturday at the market. The Stoltzfuses started selling at the farmer?¡¥s market as part-time farmers in , but two years later, the couple decided that they would leave their day jobs to farm full-time. While operating a small farm is hard work, they are happy with their successes and grateful for help from USDA?¡¥s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), an agency that helps private landowners implement conservation to protect the environment and improve productivity. They learned about NRCS from a fellow producer at the market who told them about the technical assistance and cost-share assistance offered by the agency. Through NRCS?¡¥ Environmental Quality Incentives Program, their farm is on pace to be certified as organic as early as the end of this year. NRCS also worked with the couple to build a seasonal high tunnel to keep their fruits and vegetables safe from the cold weather and construct a wildlife fence to protect their crops from hungry deer and rabbits. Bob and Kathy Stoltzfus (center) are working with NRCS conservationists Malcolm Lowe (left) and Mark Scott (right) to make their Florence, Miss. farm more productive. High tunnels have a metal frame wrapped in plastic and are easy and fairly cheap to build. They are designed to extend the growing season into the cold months, helping to increase productivity, keep plants at a steady temperature and even conserve water and energy. NRCS funds high tunnels as part of USDA?¡¥s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative, launched in to help local food systems thrive. The Stoltzfuses plan to continue enlarging their operation. With 32 acres at their disposal, they hope to start a small beef cattle operation. Both say that they?¡¥re doing what they?¡¥re meant to do. Bob enjoys the quiet of the countryside, and Kathy is happy to have returned to her heritage. Learn more about the Environmental Quality Incentives Program Follow NRCS on Twitter.

"Coordinator, USDA Caribbean Climate Hub in  Climate  Nov 09,  Four years after Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the Caribbean, there is still an urgency to understand how to best prepare farmers and working lands for future hurricanes. Agricultural advisors are first responders and witnesses of hurricane impacts and strategies used in hurricane preparedness and recovery. A new study by the USDA Caribbean Climate Hub analyzes the experiences of agricultural advisors involved in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to identify gaps in hurricane preparedness and recovery measures. ?¡ÀClimate projections indicate the Caribbean will experience more intense hurricanes, which will increase the challenges to agriculture and food security. There is an urgent need to improve hurricane preparedness to minimize hurricane effects on the agricultural sector in the Caribbean,?¡À said Dr. Nora ¡§¡élvarez-Berr¡§aos, the study?¡¥s lead author. The research team surveyed over 200 advisors from eight institutions who reported on the difficulties farmers face in the recovery process, including lack of supplies such as seeds, fertilizers and animal feed, lack of equipment and machinery for clean-up, impaired access to farms, and the need to expedite government assistance to meet farmers?¡¥ needs. Importantly, advisors indicated that while farmers and ranchers do apply recovery practices, the application of short-term preparedness practices is limited, and long-term preparedness practices are generally uncommon. The advisors also reported on the challenges they face in assisting farmers, such as the inability to access farms, transportation issues, and lengthy times to reach farmers. They highlighted the need for more training and educational resources to improve hurricane recovery response, and more tools to help farmers cope with emotional distress post-disaster. The Caribbean Hub disseminates information on hurricane preparedness and best management practices to help reduce risks and mitigate hurricane effects.

This has streamlined the export process and reduced lead times. 4. **US Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)**: The US has FTAs with several countries, including Canada, Mexico, and Chile, which provide preferential access to these markets for US hop exports. 5. **Global brewery consolidation**: As large breweries continue to consolidate and expand globally, they are seeking reliable suppliers of high-quality hops. Many American hop farms have established long-term contracts with these breweries, ensuring a stable supply chain. 6. **Growing demand from emerging craft beer markets**: Countries like China, India, and Southeast Asia are experiencing rapid growth in their craft beer markets, creating new opportunities for US hop exports to tap into. 7. **US Department of Agriculture (USDA) support**: The USDA provides various programs and services to support American farmers, including technical assistance, market research, and trade promotion activities, which help promote the global competitiveness of US hops. These factors have combined to establish the US as a leading supplier of hops globally, with exports valued at over $100 million annually.",2.38E-155,0.11898017,0.045584046,0.067988669,0.82883209
"Pollinators like honeybees, butterflies, birds, bats and other animals are hard at work providing vital but often unnoticed services. They pollinate crops like apples, bananas, blueberries, strawberries, melon, peaches, potatoes, vanilla, almonds, coffee and chocolate. Pollinators by Numbers Three-fourths of the world?¡¥s flowering plants and about 35 percent of the world?¡¥s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce. That?¡¥s one out of every three bites of food you eat. More than 3,500 species of native bees help increase crop yields. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of animal pollinators like bees, butterflies and moths, birds and bats, and beetles and other insects. The Pollinator Partnership The Pollinator Partnership offers 32 different planting guides to improve pollinator habitat, each one tailored to a specific ecoregion in the United States. Each guide is filled with an abundance of native plant and pollinator information. Enter your zip code to find your planting guide. How Animal Pollination Works Pollinators visit flowers in their search for food (nectar and pollen). During a flower visit, a pollinator may accidentally brush against the flower?¡¥s reproductive parts, unknowingly depositing pollen from flower to flower. The plant uses the pollen to produce a fruit or seed. Many plants cannot reproduce without pollen carried to them by foraging pollinators. Pollinators Are in Trouble You may have heard that bees are disappearing and bats are dying. These and other animal pollinators face many challenges in the modern world. Habitat loss, disease, parasites, and environmental contaminants have all contributed to the decline of many species of pollinators. Pollinators that can?¡¥t find the right quantity or quality of food (nectar and pollen from blooming plants within flight range) don?¡¥t survive. Right now, there simply aren?¡¥t enough pollinator friendly plantings to support pollinators. Learn more about how USDA is helping pollinators. Learn more about these pollinators: Bats Butterflies Helpful Hint: Did you know dandelions are the first food for bees emerging in the spring. Leave them in your yard and feed the bees! Dandelion petals and leaves are also edible and can be used in salads. You Can Help Pollinators You can help pollinators in your garden at home. Pollinators make use of food and habitat anywhere it is found, whether on roadsides, in a schoolyard garden or a planter on a windowsill. Here?¡¥s how:  Complete a Wildlife Assessment. One of the first steps in creating new habitat for pollinators is to first assess and evaluate your existing space. Habitat assessments can be great tools to identify practices where you can improve or confirm good practices you already have in place. The Xerces Society has several different habitat assessment guides for different types of landscapes or specific insects. The Habitat Assessment Guide for Pollinators in Yards, Gardens, and Parks is a great resource for small and urban sites, including urban farms. The Pollinators: Farms and Agricultural Landscapes and Beneficial Insects: Farms and Agricultural Landscapes and two other great options for assessing agricultural lands. For more information on providing ground, stem, and cavity nesting sites and overwintering sites, be sure to check out Xerces guide on Nesting & Overwintering Habitat for Pollinators & Other Beneficial Insects.  Types of Habitat. There are several habitat opportunities and strategies you can use to invite pollinators into your urban farms, gardens, or yards. Pollinator habitat can beautify your space, increase native biodiversity, increase pollination services and biological control of ?¡ãpest?¡À insects, and provide community engagement and learning opportunities. Often for smaller scale gardens in urban areas, plugs or transplanted plants from pots are preferred over pure live wildflower seeds.  Plant Native Plants. Native plants are considered the best choice because of their abundance of nectar and pollen in addition to being low maintenance, generally pest free, drought tolerant, and ability to control erosion. They are good sources of food and shelter for wildlife, and naturally beautiful.  Plant a continuous food supply. Make sure you have at least 3 different species throughout the spring, summer, and fall seasons to provide adequate food when pollinators emerge from and prepare for winter hibernation. Plant in groupings (clumps) of each plant species for a greater impact.  Include a diversity of plants. Different flower sizes, shapes and , as well as varying plant heights and growth habits, support a greater number and diversity of pollinators. Include a combination of native plant species, heirloom plants and herbs in your pollinator garden. Common herbs such as rosemary, oregano, basil, marjoram, and borage are excellent pollinator plants. Allow unharvested fruits and vegetables to bolt (go to flower) for added pollinator and beneficial insect food.  Limit or eliminate use of pesticides. A healthy garden with the appropriate plant species and an abundance of pollinators will support natural beneficial insects?areducing the need for pest control.   Install bat boxes. Bats are also pollinators that need our help. Leave snags for habitat or install a bat box. Learn more about the benefits of bats!  Spread Awareness. Educate others about the importance of pollinators and share how you planted for bees, butterflies, birds and other animals at home. Did You Know: There are more than 3,600 species of bees in the U.S. and approximately 70% percent of these bees nest in the ground?

Here are some effective ways to achieve this: 1. **Plant a diverse range of flowers**: Incorporate a variety of native wildflowers, herbs, and vegetables that provide nectar and pollen for pollinators. Choose plants that bloom at different times to ensure a constant food source. 2. **Incorporate bee hotels or insect houses**: Provide shelter for solitary bees and other beneficial insects by installing bee hotels or insect houses made from natural materials like bamboo, straws, or hollow reeds. 3. **Leave some areas unmanaged**: Create ""wild"" spaces within your garden or farm that mimic natural ecosystems. This will allow native plants to grow and provide habitat for pollinators. 4. **Use rainwater harvesting systems**: Collect and store rainwater to reduce the need for pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals that harm pollinators. 5. **Avoid using neonicotinoid-based pesticides**: These chemicals have been linked to bee declines and can harm other beneficial insects. 6. **Incorporate nesting sites for solitary bees**: Provide specific nesting sites like bare patches of ground or shallow holes in wooden stakes for solitary bees to lay their eggs. 7. **Create a pollinator-friendly pathway**: Design a pathway using native plants, herbs, or flowers that provide a continuous source of nectar and pollen for pollinators as they move through the garden or farm. 8. **Use cover crops**: Plant cover crops like clover or alfalfa between crop cycles to provide habitat for beneficial insects and improve soil health. 9. **Provide a water source**: Create a shallow dish or birdbath with fresh water and rocks for pollinators to land on while drinking. 10. **Educate and engage the community**: Share knowledge about pollinator-friendly habitats, host workshops, and involve local schools and residents in conservation efforts. By implementing these strategies, urban farmers and gardeners can: * Increase crop yields by attracting beneficial insects * Improve soil health through cover crops and rainwater harvesting systems * Support local biodiversity by creating habitat for native pollinators * Enhance ecosystem services like pest control and nutrient cycling Remember, every small action counts, and collective efforts will contribute to a more pollinator-friendly urban environment.",6.79E-232,0.086734694,0.020512821,0.051020408,0.812601924

"Administrator, Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Jan 20,  USDA?¡¥s Food and Nutrition Service is committed to providing equitable access to food to all Americans, but racial disparities in food security still exist. With the rate of food and nutrition insecurity higher among Black, Hispanic, and Native American populations, the bears this out. In response, both USDA and the Biden-Harris Administration have implemented programs targeting racial injustice and inequity in food and nutrition. Since January , FNS has worked tirelessly to combat the impacts of food insecurity and racial inequity by advancing WIC, providing equity in access to SNAP, expanding culturally appropriate meals for children, extending food assistance to American territories, and improving nutrition assistance for Tribal communities. Through these programs, USDA helps millions of Americans of all backgrounds receive access to nutritious foods. The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) Self-Determination Demonstration Project, for instance, empowers Tribal Nations with more purchasing options to buy food that better aligns with culture and traditions. Since October , we?¡¥ve awarded $3.5 million to eight Tribal Nations. ?¡ãThis project is a big deal. It?¡¥s a great showing of how FNS supports the interests of Indian Country to ensure more Tribal people have the chance to partake in Native foods grown by Native people,?¡À said FNS Tribal Affairs Specialist Michael Ladd.

"Senior Policy Advisor for the Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Aug 18,  Tribal nations across what we now consider the Great Plains relied for millennia on their buffalo relatives for food, medicine, clothing, tools, and shelter. Yet today it is hard to find buffalo meat on school meal trays in the very areas where they once sustained Native communities. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is working with tribal partners to figure out why and to remove the barriers we can. The Biden-Harris Administration and Secretary Vilsack have made it a priority to better meet our federal trust and treaty responsibilities. Historically, the U.S. government played a significant role in the decimation of the buffalo population in the North American continent, with a policy of destroying buffalo in order to starve Native Americans into submission. We recognize the weight of these actions and our obligation to better support tribes in restoring buffalo across their lands. On Monday, June 6, my colleagues at FNS, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Rural Development, Agricultural Marketing Service, and the USDA Office of Tribal Relations, and I were honored to be invited by the InterTribal Buffalo Council (ITBC) and members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to participate in a traditional buffalo slaughter and field harvest. ITBC is a coalition of 69 federally recognized tribes that has led the work to restore buffalo to Indian Country since . Our traditional harvest was led by Lisa and Arlo Iron Cloud who work with Makoce Agriculture Development, an Indigenous agriculture organization led by Nick Hernandez on Pine Ridge. Ms. Iron Cloud is also partnering with USDA?¡¥s Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative to help create resources on sustainable, Indigenous food foraging practices. This ?¡ãhands-on?¡À experience was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for which we are so grateful to Lisa, Arlo, the ITBC, and the Oglala Lakota Nation Tribal leadership to get a glimpse into the cultural, spiritual, and practical contributions of buffalo to the Lakota people. We saw first-hand the importance of providing opportunities for American Indian children to engage in hands-on nutrition education about buffalo and to be able to taste and regularly eat buffalo as part of their school meals. FNS has worked to address some of the barriers that make it challenging for schools to serve buffalo, but we recognize that we must do more. We look forward to continuing to partner with ITBC and tribal leaders to advance Indigenous food sovereignty priorities and restore buffalo in Indian Country.

However, it does not explicitly state what these major barriers are. To find a solution to this question, you can follow up with related articles or search websites to find information on the challenges faced by schools in Native American communities in serving buffalo meat.","A very specific and interesting question! The major barriers that prevent schools in Native American communities from serving buffalo meat as part of their school meals are: 1. **Availability and Accessibility**: Buffalo, also known as bison, is a culturally significant animal for many Native American tribes, but its availability and affordability can be limited due to factors such as habitat restrictions, regulations, and market demand. Additionally, the logistics of sourcing and transporting buffalo meat from ranches or hunting operations may be challenging. 2. **Regulations and Food Safety**: Schools must comply with federal and state food safety guidelines, which require strict handling, storage, and serving procedures for meat products. However, buffalo meat is a high-risk product due to its potential for contamination and spoilage, making it difficult for schools to meet these requirements without specialized equipment and expertise. 3. **Culinary Knowledge and Training**: Preparing and serving traditional Native American dishes like bison stew or jerky requires culinary knowledge and skills that may not be readily available in school kitchens. This can make it difficult to safely and appealingly serve buffalo meat as part of the meal program. 4. **Budget Constraints**: Many schools, especially those in rural areas or with limited budgets, face financial constraints that limit their ability to invest in alternative protein sources like bison meat. 5. **Community Involvement and Cultural Relevance**: Serving buffalo meat would require coordination with local communities, including Native American tribes, to ensure cultural sensitivity and relevance. This can involve consultations with tribal leaders, elders, or community members to determine the best way to prepare and serve the meat in a culturally respectful manner. These barriers contribute to the challenges faced by schools in Native American communities when trying to incorporate buffalo meat into their school meals.",0.069826582,0.28021978,0.127071823,0.186813187,0.854581177

"USDA NASS Public Affairs Specialist in  Research and Science  Jun 16,  Farming is hot! From sweet corn to watermelon and apricots to tomatoes, a lot is growing on the farm this summer. Millions of producers across our nation continue to work tirelessly to produce safe and delicious food. According to the latest Census of Agriculture, more than a quarter of these producers are new and beginning farmers, proving that many people are unable to resist agriculture?¡¥s magnetic appeal. USDA defines a beginning farmer as anyone who has farmed for 10 years or less. In , the United States had 908,274 producers who identified as beginning farmers, and they accounted for 27% of the country?¡¥s 3.4 million producers. How old are these new farmers? The average age of a beginning farmer is 46.3, much younger than the average age of all farmers . Without a doubt, the art and science of producing food attracts people of all ages. If we look for younger farmers, we find 26% of beginning farmers are under the age of 35. The under 35 age group represents only 8% of all U.S. farmers overall. Will more young people find a match in farming as time goes on? Look for an update in the Census of Agriculture. States with the largest share of beginning farmers are mostly on the east and west coasts. However, just as Texas is the state with the most farms and the most producers, Texas leads in the number of beginning farmers.

Comprised of non-governmental organizations and state and federal agencies, their goal is to look at landscape scales and improve the link between science and management in how to maintain ecosystems in the face of climate change, urbanization, and other stressors. The cooperative has facilitated a number of projects, including looking at where sensitive ecosystems are headed with climate change, which species and species habitat is the most vulnerable, and checking sea levels to see if they are on the rise.  John Heil, Pacific Southwest Region, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Jul 11,   Respond to this story",What conservation strategies can be implemented at landscape scales to protect sensitive ecosystems and species from climate change impacts?,"The California Landscape Conservation Cooperatives steering committee has facilitated projects that look at landscape scales and improve the link between science and management in how to maintain ecosystems in the face of climate change, urbanization, and other stressors. This includes identifying where sensitive ecosystems are headed with climate change, which species and species habitat is the most vulnerable, and assessing sea levels to determine if they are on the rise.","To address the impact of climate change on sensitive ecosystems and species, several conservation strategies can be implemented at landscape scales. These include: 1. **Connectivity planning**: Restoring habitat connectivity between isolated patches of ecosystem types or creating corridors for species movement can help maintain biodiversity and allow species to migrate to more favorable habitats as climate conditions change. 2. **Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA)**: EbA focuses on enhancing the resilience of ecosystems, which in turn helps them adapt better to changing environmental conditions. This involves restoring degraded habitats, promoting carbon sequestration through sustainable land-use practices, and enhancing ecosystem services like water cycling and pollination. 3. **Protected areas expansion**: Expanding protected area networks can provide critical habitat for species vulnerable to climate change impacts and serve as refuges during extreme weather events or periods of rapid environmental change. 4. **Sustainable land-use planning**: Encouraging sustainable land use through practices like agroforestry, permaculture, and integrated agriculture can help maintain ecosystem services while also allowing forests and natural habitats to continue providing ecological benefits under changing climate conditions. 5. **Climate-smart conservation planning**: This involves integrating projections of future climate scenarios into conservation strategies. It helps in identifying areas that will remain relatively stable under different climate change scenarios, thus prioritizing conservation efforts in those places. 6. **Early warning systems and monitoring**: Implementing early warning systems for environmental changes can allow for timely intervention to mitigate impacts on sensitive ecosystems or species. Continuous monitoring of ecosystems also aids in understanding the effectiveness of implemented strategies and the need for adjustments based on observed outcomes. 7. **Community engagement and co-management**: Involving local communities in conservation efforts, ensuring their participation in decision-making processes, and promoting shared responsibility can lead to more effective management of sensitive ecosystems and species. Such an approach helps ensure that the long-term needs of these ecosystems are balanced with short-term human requirements. 8. **Ecological restoration**: Restoring degraded habitats not only enhances biodiversity but also provides ecosystem services that help mitigate climate change impacts. For example, restored wetlands can act as carbon sinks or buffer against storms and flooding. 9. **Adaptive management approaches**: This involves implementing conservation strategies based on the best available knowledge at a given time. It then continuously monitoring their effectiveness and adjusting these plans as new data becomes available or when unexpected outcomes occur. 10. **Incorporating climate resilience into agriculture and forestry practices**: Incorporating principles of ecosystem services, biodiversity preservation, and ecological restoration into agricultural and forestry practices can help maintain ecosystem health while also ensuring food security under a changing climate. Implementing these strategies at landscape scales requires not only coordinated action among governments but also the active participation of local communities, scientists, and other stakeholders. It involves integrating knowledge about ecosystems, ecology, and human impacts to develop comprehensive conservation plans that address both short-term needs and long-term sustainability goals under projected climate change scenarios.",4.80E-79,0.158844765,0.039855072,0.093862816,0.827184141

"Learn How to Bee a Friend during USDA's Pollinator Festival this Friday, June 24  The best time to bee a friend to pollinators is now! Today is the first day of summer and the launch of National Pollinator Week, June 20-26. Around the globe, people are celebrating with events that emphasize the importance of pollinators and teach ways to save them. Here at USDA, we?¡¥ve issued the National Pollinator Week Proclamation and are hosting our seventh annual Pollinator Week Festival this Friday, June 24 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. outside USDA Headquarters in Washington, DC. The festival highlights the work of USDA agencies, other federal departments and institutions such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Smithsonian Gardens, and the U.S. Botanic Garden, who along with partners like the National Honey Board, Pollinator Partnership and University of Maryland Extension are working to address pollinator decline.  Annie Ceccarini, Program Manager, The People's Garden Initiative  Posted in  Initiatives  Jun 20,   1 Response",What are the main reasons behind the decline of pollinators in the US?,Pollinator decline.,"The decline of pollinators, including bees, butterflies, and other insects essential for plant reproduction, is a pressing issue in the United States. The main reasons behind this decline can be attributed to: 1. **Habitat Loss and Fragmentation**: Widespread deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural intensification have led to the destruction of natural habitats and the creation of isolated patches of land that are not conducive to pollinator populations. 2. **Pesticide Use**: The widespread use of pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids, has been linked to bee deaths and colony collapse disorder (CCD). These chemicals can be toxic to bees and other pollinators, disrupting their nervous systems and impairing their ability to navigate and communicate. 3. **Climate Change**: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns have disrupted the delicate timing of plant-pollinator interactions, making it difficult for pollinators to adapt to changing environmental conditions. 4. **Monoculture Agriculture**: The increasing dominance of monoculture crops (e.g., corn, soybeans) has led to a decline in the diversity of plants that provide food and shelter for pollinators. 5. **Varroa Mite Infestations**: These parasites can weaken bee colonies, making them more susceptible to disease and pesticide exposure. 6. **Diseases and Parasites**: The spread of diseases such as American Foulbrood and Nosema, as well as the presence of parasites like varroa mites, have contributed to colony decline. 7. **Lack of Forage Diversity**: As agricultural practices become more intensive, the diversity of plants that provide forage for pollinators has decreased, reducing their access to food and nutrients. These factors are interconnected and can exacerbate one another, making it essential to address them through a comprehensive approach that includes: * Conservation efforts to protect and restore natural habitats * Sustainable agricultural practices that promote biodiversity * Reduced pesticide use and more targeted management strategies * Climate-resilient agriculture and conservation planning * Research into the causes of pollinator decline and the development of effective management and conservation strategies By addressing these factors, we can work towards mitigating the decline of pollinators in the United States and ensuring their continued health and resilience.",4.26E-232,0.011904762,0.005988024,0.011904762,0.818108499

Here's why: 1. **Climate and soil compatibility**: The Texas Panhandle has a semi-arid climate, making it ideal for growing dryland crops like wheat, which requires minimal irrigation. The region's deep, fertile soils also support healthy crop growth. 2. **Complementary grazing**: Dryland wheat can be planted in the spring, allowing cattle to graze on the stubble and weeds that grow among the mature plants. This complementary use of land increases overall productivity while minimizing conflicts between agriculture and ranching activities. 3. **Crop rotation benefits**: Incorporating dryland wheat into a rotational system with cattle grazing helps maintain soil health, reduce erosion, and minimize pests and diseases. The crop's residues also provide a nutrient-rich mulch that benefits subsequent crops. 4. **Marketing opportunities**: Dryland wheat can be harvested in the fall, providing an additional revenue stream for ranchers who market their grain to local buyers or processors. 5. **Scalability**: Wheat production can be scaled up or down depending on market demand and the size of the cattle operation, making it a flexible and adaptable agricultural use. By integrating dryland wheat production with cattle ranching in the Texas Panhandle, landowners can: * Diversify their income streams * Improve soil health and reduce erosion * Increase overall productivity and profitability This integrated approach can be beneficial for both agriculture and ranching operations, making it a suitable and effective use of land in the region.",4.33E-79,0.074349442,0.04494382,0.066914498,0.824738204

Once tucked away, the tree is cocooned by aluminum frame and plywood siding. Hoops straddle the top to provide support and protection for a decorative tarp. The only exposed parts of the tree can be seen through three viewing windows. Two of the windows will let onlookers see the top of the tree decorated with lights and a few of the thousands of ornaments created by children in Washington State. The third viewing area will give visitors a chance to see the 40-gallon bladder used to keep the thirsty tree moist and healthy along its trip. The tree will stop in 22 cities on the way to the Capitol. The tree is expected to arrive at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Nov. 24. On Nov. 25, the tree will be escorted into Washington, D.C. A tree lighting ceremony is scheduled for Dec. 3. The tradition of a Christmas tree on the U.S. Capitol lawn began in . The first several years live trees were planted but did not thrive. In , the Capitol Architect asked the Forest Service for help. Since then, a national forest is chosen each year, and residents of the state where the forest in located work together with partners throughout the state to take care of a variety of logistical needs. The community buildup starts roughly a year in advance as a grass-roots community effort to give the gift to all Americans, which is why it is dubbed ?¡ãThe People?¡¥s Tree.?¡À No tax dollars are used. However, Forest Service employees are assigned to help oversee the project. Follow the tree?¡¥s journey. The Capitol Christmas Tree arrives in Colville, Wash. on its cross-country trip.

Some of these challenges include: 1. **Structural integrity**: The tree's root system and trunk must be strong enough to withstand the rigors of transportation, including handling, loading, and unloading. 2. **Hydration**: Trees require a consistent supply of water to survive. Dehydration can cause stress, damage, or even kill the tree during transport. 3. **Temperature control**: Trees are sensitive to temperature fluctuations. Prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures (hot or cold) can cause stress, defoliation, or even death. 4. **Light and humidity**: Trees need adequate light and humidity to maintain their health. During transportation, they may be exposed to artificial lighting and controlled humidity environments. 5. **Root care**: The root system of a large tree requires specialized care during transport, including watering, pruning, and protection from drying out. 6. **Size and weight**: Large trees can be extremely heavy and difficult to handle, requiring custom equipment and labor for safe transportation. 7. **Permitting and regulations**: Transporting a large tree across jurisdictions may require special permits, licenses, and compliance with local regulations. 8. **Pathway considerations**: The path of the transportation must be carefully planned to ensure that the tree is not exposed to harsh weather conditions, such as windstorms or extreme temperatures. 9. **Tree handling**: Trees are delicate living organisms that require gentle handling during transport to prevent damage to their branches, trunk, and roots. 10. **Destination preparation**: The receiving site must be prepared to receive a large tree, including ensuring sufficient space for the tree's growth and developing strategies for its care and maintenance. To overcome these challenges, specialized companies and experts in arboriculture and logistics often collaborate to design and execute customized transportation plans that cater to the specific needs of each tree. These plans may include custom-built containers or caskets, advanced irrigation systems, temperature-controlled environments, and careful handling by trained personnel.",6.90E-79,0.220551378,0.080604534,0.135338346,0.835754812

"Gopher Tortoise Habitats Thrive along Alabama's Gulf Coast  Longleaf pine forests once dominated the Southeast. But over the past two centuries, many of these forests have disappeared along with the wildlife that called them home. Recent efforts to enhance longleaf forests on private lands are helping the ecosystem rebound as well as wildlife like the gopher tortoise. The gopher tortoise is a keystone species of the longleaf forest, known for their deep burrows that provide vital habitat and shelter for not only itself but many other species. The gopher tortoise is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in the western part of the longleaf range, including parts of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.  Amelia Hines Dortch, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Alabama  Posted in  Conservation  Oct 19,   3 Responses",How can conservation efforts for non-agricultural ecosystems like longleaf pine forests also benefit agricultural lands?,"Conservation efforts for non-agricultural ecosystems like longleaf pine forests can also benefit agricultural lands by improving soil quality, reducing erosion, and increasing water filtration, which in turn can lead to more productive and sustainable agricultural practices.","While it may seem counterintuitive, conservation efforts for non-agricultural ecosystems like longleaf pine forests can indeed have benefits for agricultural lands in several ways: 1. **Soil Conservation and Erosion Control**: Longleaf pine forests have a unique ecosystem that helps to stabilize soil through root systems and leaf litter. This stability reduces soil erosion and runoff, which can be beneficial for adjacent agricultural areas by preventing topsoil loss and reducing nutrient depletion. 2. **Water Quality Improvement**: The longleaf pine ecosystem's water filtration capabilities help maintain water quality in nearby watersheds. Clean water is essential for agriculture, as it prevents contamination of crops, drinking water sources, and aquatic ecosystems. 3. **Climate Regulation and Microclimate Creation**: Longleaf pine forests can act as a climate-regulating mechanism by moderating temperatures, humidity levels, and precipitation patterns. This microclimatic effect can benefit nearby agricultural areas by providing optimal growing conditions for crops. 4. **Biodiversity Enhancement and Pest Control**: The diverse flora and fauna in longleaf pine forests can help maintain ecological balance, which can lead to reduced pest pressure on agricultural lands. By promoting natural pest control mechanisms, farmers can reduce the need for pesticides and other chemicals. 5. **Soil Carbon Sequestration**: Longleaf pine forests are known for their carbon sequestration capabilities through the accumulation of organic matter in soils. This process can enhance soil fertility, structure, and water-holding capacity, benefiting adjacent agricultural areas by improving soil health. 6. **Reduced Fertilizer and Irrigation Requirements**: By maintaining healthy longleaf pine ecosystems, conservation efforts can lead to reduced fertilizer and irrigation demands on agricultural lands. This is because the forests' nutrient cycling processes and natural rainfall patterns help maintain soil fertility and moisture levels. 7. **Ecosystem Services Trade-offs**: Protecting non-agricultural ecosystems like longleaf pine forests can also benefit agriculture by creating a buffer zone for agricultural areas, protecting them from invasive species, wildfires, and other environmental threats. By recognizing these interconnected relationships between conservation efforts for non-agricultural ecosystems and agricultural lands, we can foster more holistic approaches to land management, ultimately benefiting both ecosystems.",0.041575702,0.168865435,0.111405836,0.142480211,0.861693799

"Posted by USDA in  USDA Results  Oct 22,   October 20 marked the official launch of the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) at USDA for the Washington, D.C. metro area. Administered by the government?¡¥s Office of Personnel Management (OPM), CFC is the world?¡¥s largest workplace giving program. Since its inception in , federal employees have contributed more than $6 billion to the non-profit community. This year, USDA has set a goal of raising just under $2 million from its approximately 10,000 employees in the national capital area. The official kickoff on Tuesday morning was an exciting event in the Whitten Building patio featuring top USDA leadership and more than 20 CFC registered non-profit organizations. Secretary Tom Vilsack and Undersecretary for Research, Education, and Economics, Dr. Raj Shah, led off the event by speaking movingly about the ways that non-profit organizations touch all of our lives in critical and transformative ways. Dr. Shah spoke about incredible array of non-profits that participate in CFC, from groups doing lifesaving work fighting malaria in Africa to charities feeding hungry people right here in Washington, D.C. Secretary Vilsack spoke about his own birth in a Catholic orphanage, saying that he probably would not be here today if not for the nuns who took care of him and his birth mother. Both stressed the importance of giving generously this year more than ever, as the worldwide economic crisis has dramatically increased the needs of the non-profit community even as donations to the sector have fallen off. Secretary Vilsack emphasized that as federal workers, we have all been blessed with good jobs, and that CFC is a wonderful opportunity to share that blessing with people in need. After Secretary Vilsack?¡¥s remarks, he officially opened the campaign by handing in his own completed pledge form. Dr. Shah and much of USDA?¡¥s senior leadership followed suit, as the assembled USDA employees watched a video message from President Obama. The President encouraged all federal employees to give generously to CFC this year, as part of the same spirit of service and community that he has worked to strengthen across the country through United We Serve. As the first phase of the kickoff drew to a close, Bernadine Prince of FARMFRESH Markets spoke about her organization?¡¥s work to promote locally grown food throughout the DC Metro area. When Ms. Prince finished her remarks, it was time for the attendees to sample some of the fresh, locally grown food from USDA?¡¥s very own Farmers Market, such as apple cider and banana bread. Before attendees enjoyed the delicious and healthy refreshments, Dr. Susan McCarthy from the Agricultural Research Service, USDA?¡¥s CFC Campaign Manager, launched the charity fair. This fair was an excellent opportunity for USDA employees to talk to representatives of a few of the thousands of non-profits represented in the CFC catalog. Employees who attended reported having a wonderful time and learning a great deal about non-profits doing great work in a wide variety of ways. The Secretary is hoping that all employees will join him in giving to the non-profit organizations of their choice. The size of the gift matters much less than the fact that each employee participates on some level. DC Metro area federal employees can find out everything they need to know to get involved in CFC by visiting www.cfcnca.org.

However, I can tell you that local farmers and non-profit organizations play significant roles in promoting sustainable food systems. Here's how they contribute: 1. **Community Building**: Local farmers often participate in community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs where consumers purchase shares directly from them, providing a stable income stream. This model strengthens the local food economy. 2. **Sustainable Practices**: Many local farms practice sustainable farming methods that reduce environmental impact and promote biodiversity. These practices include using organic farming methods, integrating crop rotation, and reducing water consumption. 3. **Food Security**: By growing their own produce, communities can achieve greater food security and resilience. This is particularly important in areas where access to fresh produce might be limited due to distance or economic constraints. 4. **Nutrition Education**: Non-profit organizations involved in sustainable food systems often provide nutrition education. This helps consumers understand the benefits of locally grown produce and promotes healthier eating habits. 5. **Advocacy**: Both farmers and non-profits may advocate for policies that support local, organic farming practices. They might also raise awareness about the importance of sustainability in agriculture and its impact on the environment. Regarding their roles within the context of a Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) at USDA: - While I couldn't find specific information linking the CFC directly with promoting sustainable food systems through local farmers or non-profit organizations, such programs often receive funding support from federal campaigns. This support can be crucial for initiatives that aim to promote sustainability and community involvement in agriculture. In summary, local farmers and non-profit organizations contribute significantly to promoting sustainable food systems by engaging in practices like CSA, advocating for policies that support local farming, providing nutrition education, and reducing the environmental impact of their operations.",6.26E-79,0.104347826,0.052478134,0.08115942,0.835778713

Treatment of the wastewater collected will be done by the neighboring authority?¡¥s existing sewage treatment facility. The system will serve an estimated 420 homes. A unique aspect of the project is that directional boring will be used for the entire extension project.? Using the technology of directional boring allows the sewer pipe to be installed with minimal impact to the surrounding area, including homes, roads, and outbuildings.? The technique involves a bit at the end of a steel drill pipe, rotating an average of eight feet below ground level. By boring underground, homes, outbuildings, driveways and playground equipment are not impacted.? An L&N Zimmerman Boring employee is shown boring sewer pipe between two lakeside homes and alongside playground equipment. The entire Nuangola Borough sewer exention project in Pennsylvania utilizes directional boring with minimal impact to the surrounding area. Are you in a community of 10,000 residents or fewer?

"Planning a Summer Road Trip to Canada? Visit USDA?¡¥s Traveler Website and Help Protect American Agriculture  When buying souvenirs or food gifts to bring back from a trip, you probably think about what your loved ones will like best or which items will be the most memorable. But selecting the wrong type of gift could pose potential danger to U.S. agriculture, especially when bringing back food items.  Sydney Hart, APHIS Student Trainee  Posted in  Animals  Jul 24,   1 Response",Will buying certain souvenirs or food gifts from Canada pose a threat to American agriculture?,"Yes. Selecting the wrong type of gift could pose potential danger to U.S. agriculture, especially when bringing back food items.","The short answer is: No, buying certain souvenirs or food gifts from Canada does not pose a significant threat to American agriculture. Here's why: 1. **USDA regulations**: The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulates the importation of plants, animals, and plant products to prevent the introduction of pests and diseases that could harm American agriculture. 2. **Phytosanitary certificates**: To ensure compliance with these regulations, souvenirs or food gifts containing plant-based items, such as maple syrup or candies made from Canadian ingredients, are typically accompanied by phytosanitary certificates. These certificates guarantee that the products have been inspected and certified to be free of pests and diseases. 3. **Minimal risk**: The risk of introducing a pest or disease through souvenirs or food gifts is extremely low. Most commercial imports from Canada are subject to rigorous inspections and testing, reducing the likelihood of contamination. However, there might be some exceptions: * If you're planning to import large quantities of plant materials, such as seeds, bulbs, or live plants, it's best to check with the USDA for specific regulations. * Some types of food gifts, like unpasteurized dairy products or meat products from Canada, may still be subject to certain restrictions or requirements under US laws and regulations. In general, buying souvenirs or food gifts from Canada is unlikely to pose a significant threat to American agriculture. If you're ever in doubt, it's always best to consult with the USDA or relevant authorities for guidance.",7.24E-232,0.082706767,0.007575758,0.060150376,0.842453539

Additionally, the article mentions that the Tranquil Acres Water Supply system was placed too shallow for the area, resulting in severe reliability issues for several years.","Rural water supply systems, especially those located in areas with shallow water tables, often face several reliability issues that can compromise the availability and quality of drinking water. Some common reliability issues in these systems include: 1. **Water Quality Issues**: Shallow water tables are more susceptible to contamination from natural sources like nearby septic tanks, agricultural runoff, or flooding. This can lead to bacterial, viral, or chemical contaminants in the water supply. 2. **Well Failure and Drying Up**: Wells with shallow water tables are more prone to running dry during periods of low rainfall or prolonged droughts, leading to system failure and unreliable access to clean drinking water. 3. **Over-Abstraction and Groundwater Depletion**: Overuse of groundwater resources from shallow wells can accelerate the rate of local water table decline, making it difficult to maintain a reliable supply over time. 4. **Limited Water Availability**: In areas with shallow water tables, natural flow rates may not be sufficient to meet peak demand during hot summer months or periods of high usage, leading to water scarcity and shortages. 5. **Infrastructure Age and Condition**: Many rural water systems in the United States, for example, have aging infrastructure that is prone to leaks, breaks, and other operational issues, which can compromise reliability. 6. **Inadequate Water Treatment and Storage Capacity**: Rural water systems often lack the necessary treatment and storage capacity to address contamination issues or meet increased demand during emergencies, further compromising reliability. 7. **Power Outages and Electrical Interference**: Relying on electric pumps for water supply can make these systems vulnerable to power outages and electrical interference, which can impact system functionality. 8. **Human Error and Operator Training**: The effectiveness of a rural water system is also heavily dependent on the skills and knowledge of its operators. Lack of proper training or human error can lead to reliability issues. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes planning for future growth, investing in modern infrastructure, implementing robust treatment and storage systems, and ensuring adequate operator training and capacity building.",2.47E-155,0.133333333,0.053619303,0.090666667,0.841038287

Youngsters will have an opportunity to enjoy the Shawnee National Forest, like the kids here at the Young Trekkers afterschool program. Photo used with permission. With declining budgets in the public school system, there has been a steady decrease in school fieldtrips in recent years. This plight further widens the disconnect between children and nature. To help bridge the gap between the schoolroom and the natural world, the Shawnee National Forest will offer a new school program this year called Naturalist in the Classroom.  The program will be piloted to third- through fifth-grade students in Union and Alexander counties located in southern Illinois, and will focus on two themes ¨C forest ecology and wetland ecology. Forest Service employees will visit the classroom several times during the semester to cover topics, such as the role of water, the function of wetlands, forest functions, and tree identification, or subjects identified by the teacher.  Naturalist in the Classroom will culminate in a one-day field trip at a Forest Service site with Forest Service natural resource and conservation education professionals to show students how what they learned applies in the field and in national forest management. There will be hands-on activities and games from various national curriculums, such as Project Learning Tree, Project Aquatic Wild and WOW! Wonders of Wetlands will be used. Naturalist in the Classroom aims to strengthen and expand the Shawnee¡¯s environmental education program, get kids outdoors, and assist local educators in meeting Illinois¡¯ learning standards.

"Stepping Outside the Classroom to Learn Lessons for Life  Stop by any trailhead or boat landing on a national forest or grassland and take a moment to ask folks to explain the origins of their love for the outdoors. You will likely hear people return time and again to some formative experience they had in grade school. For some, the smell of the pine brings them back to camping with a cub scout troop. For others, getting their hands dirty stirs memories of a favorite teacher¡¯s class garden.  Korey Morgan, Office of Communication, USDA Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Dec 09,   1 Response",What role do formative outdoor experiences play in shaping people's lifelong love for nature?,"Formative outdoor experiences have a significant role in shaping people's lifelong love for nature, often recalling fond memories and sparking enthusiasm that can last a lifetime.","Research has consistently shown that formative outdoor experiences, particularly during childhood and adolescence, play a significant role in shaping people's lifelong love for nature. Here are some key findings: 1. **Formation of emotional connections**: Early exposure to the outdoors can foster emotional connections with nature, leading to a deeper appreciation and affection for it. 2. **Development of environmental awareness**: Outdoor experiences can increase people's awareness of the natural world, its beauty, diversity, and importance for human well-being. 3. **Shaping values and attitudes**: Formative outdoor experiences can influence individuals' values and attitudes towards nature, conservation, and sustainability, often leading to a lifelong commitment to environmental protection. 4. **Cognitive development**: Engaging in outdoor activities can enhance cognitive skills, such as observation, classification, and problem-solving, which are essential for understanding and appreciating the natural world. 5. **Social influence**: Being part of outdoor experiences with family, friends, or peers can shape individuals' perceptions and values about nature, often through social learning and shared experiences. 6. **Emotional and psychological benefits**: Formative outdoor experiences can have lasting emotional and psychological benefits, such as reduced stress, improved mental health, and increased resilience. Some key theories that support the importance of formative outdoor experiences include: 1. **The Theory of Environmental Personality** (TEP): This theory suggests that people's environmental attitudes and behaviors are shaped by their early life experiences with nature. 2. **The Nature Deficit Hypothesis**: This hypothesis proposes that children who spend more time outdoors are more likely to develop a lifelong appreciation for nature and a stronger sense of connection with the environment. In conclusion, formative outdoor experiences play a significant role in shaping people's lifelong love for nature by fostering emotional connections, promoting environmental awareness, influencing values and attitudes, and enhancing cognitive development.

The question seems to be asking for specific details that are not provided within the context of this conversation. However, if you're looking for general information on how farming technology has evolved over time and what changes people who have lived through those periods might have witnessed, here's some broader insight: - Early farming was manual labor-intensive with minimal machinery. Farmers relied heavily on physical strength to cultivate their land and harvest crops. - With the advent of steam power in the late 19th century, farming equipment started to mechanize. This included plows pulled by steam-powered engines and later internal combustion engines, leading to significant increases in efficiency. - The early 20th century saw further mechanization with tractors becoming a common sight on farms. These were initially heavy-duty, slow-moving machines but improved over time with lighter designs and higher speeds. - Advances in agricultural engineering led to the development of more specialized equipment for tasks like harvesting crops, spraying pesticides, and fertilizing fields. This made farming less labor-intensive and more productive. - Modern farming has seen a significant shift towards technology with precision agriculture being one of the forefronts. This involves using GPS, drones, and satellite imaging to guide planting and cultivation practices. - Furthermore, advancements in genetics have allowed for crops engineered for disease resistance, drought tolerance, and improved nutritional content. People who have lived through these periods on farms would have seen significant changes in how farming is conducted and the role technology plays in agriculture.

News by USDA¡¯s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) indicates that moving dairy cows out of climate-controlled barns and onto the land may help to lessen the ecological impact of dairy farming without any corresponding loss of production. A team of ARS scientists in University Park, Pa., conducted a modeling study that evaluated how different management systems on a typical 250-acre Pennsylvania dairy farm would affect the environment.  The scientists collected a range of field and input it into their model to evaluate the environmental dynamics of four different dairy farms in all types of weather over 25 years. All four systems were set to produce the same amount of milk, adjusting for fat and protein, on the same land.  The model generated estimates for ammonia emissions from manure, impact on the soil including erosion and leaching of nitrates, and phosphorus losses from field runoff. Total emissions for the greenhouse gases methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide were 8 percent lower in year-round outdoor production than with cows tucked away in the barn.  Keeping dairy cows outdoors all year reduced the dairy operation¡¯s ammonia emissions by about 30 percent. While barn-bound cows were estimated to each produce 22,000 pounds of milk per year, compared to only 13,000 pounds per foraging cow, the total amount of milk protein and fat produced was essentially the same.

"Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics in  Research and Science  Nov 04,  Dr. Woteki works with 4-H members. The past eight years have been an extraordinary time for agricultural science, and for the application of new insights from other fields to enhance agricultural productivity and the overall agricultural economy. As the final days of this administration are approaching, it gives me a great deal of pride to look back at what USDA has accomplished in the areas of research and innovation. Scientific research is a fundamental part of our mission at USDA. But, ultimately, what's behind all the science is people ¨C people who do the research and people who are affected by it. As USDA's Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics, I've met and worked with both as I've traveled across the country and around the world. I've seen the dedication and innovation of researchers at a USDA laboratory in California as they developed uses for drones and laser-guided sprayers as part of a ""precision agriculture"" movement. Their work allows the wise, efficient application of water and chemicals ¨C as well as increased crop yields ¨C in drought-ridden areas. I've seen the confident, solitary efforts of a Cornell University professor in the field of urban aquaponics who, with USDA funding, proved that he can not only raise 10,000 tilapia in fish tanks housed in the unlikely location of a high school basement in midtown Manhattan, but could then recirculate the fish tank water to nourish a thriving edible garden a few floors up in the school building. And I've seen the eagerness reflected in the faces of two young girls taking part in 4-H National Science Day activities in the nation's capital, applying science and technology skills and equipping themselves to possibly become part of the next generation of leaders in agricultural science. These people, and so many before them, embody the commitment to scientific innovation that is a major reason why Americans have not had to worry about food security since the Dust Bowl days of the s. To learn more about USDA's important scientific work, I invite you to take a few minutes to take a look at our results over the past eight years in our USDA Medium Chapter 11: Food and Ag Science Will Shape Our Future. The 21st Century has been referred to as the ¡°Century for Biology,¡± and we are witnessing the applications of our heightened understanding of genes and gene traits to enhance crops and livestock. These applications, in turn, have been integral to USDA efforts like the transfer of germplasm and new plant varieties to the private sector here in the U.S. We are helping, through USDA¡¯s partnership with the Agency for International Development and the ¡°Feed the Future¡± initiative, in delivering UG99-resistant wheat varieties and improving the nutritional content of legumes¡ªtwo examples of how our research and innovation are being applied to help improve food security around the world. Our work has been informed by projections that our global population will reach over 9.5 billion people by the year . To adequately feed that number of people would require an almost doubling of the world¡¯s current level of agricultural production and a reduction in food loss and waste, at the same time the amount of farmable land is decreasing. As we continue to learn about the effects of a changing climate, our focus is on sustainably intensifying agricultural production to deliver the array of foods to provide for good health and foods that are free of disease-causing pathogens and toxins. We have developed a vision of a bioeconomy that by the year will produce a billion tons of biomass ¨C agricultural residues, grasses, energy crops, forestry trimmings, algae and other sources ¨C that will provide alternative sources of fuel, energy and other bioproducts. We have also focused research on developing agricultural systems that will be able to provide all of these services and be resilient in the face of climate change. Over the last eight years. We have faced numerous challenges and the results have been remarkable. There is still much to do, but we have left a solid foundation for continuing USDA¡¯s work to support the American agricultural economy, to strengthen rural communities, to protect and conserve our natural resources, and to provide a safe, sufficient, and nutritious food supply for the American people.

Some of these factors include: 1. **Supply Chain Disruptions**: The pandemic led to a significant reduction in labor force due to lockdowns, social distancing measures, and fear of infection. This resulted in disruptions to global supply chains, particularly in the production, processing, and transportation of perishable foods. 2. **Trade Restrictions and Border Closures**: Governments imposed trade restrictions and border closures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, leading to delays and increases in costs for food imports and exports. This had a ripple effect on food availability and prices. 3. **Increased Demand and Shortages**: As people stocked up on food due to fears of lockdowns or stockpiling, there were temporary shortages and increased demand for certain food items, particularly staple foods like rice, wheat, and pulses. 4. **Higher Transportation Costs**: With reduced labor forces and social distancing measures in place, transportation costs for food products increased, leading to higher prices at the consumer level. 5. **Weather Events and Climate Change**: Extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, have always impacted food availability. The pandemic exacerbated these effects by reducing the capacity of farmers to respond to climate-related shocks. 6. **Pandemic-Related Crop Failures**: In some countries, crop failures due to the pandemic disrupted food supplies, leading to price increases and shortages. 7. **Price Volatility in Global Markets**: Price volatility in global markets for key commodities like grains, oilseeds, and livestock feed contributed to changes in food availability and prices. 8. **Changes in Consumer Behavior**: The pandemic led to shifts in consumer behavior, with more people opting for online shopping, home delivery, and pre-cooked or ready-to-eat meals. This altered the demand patterns and prices of certain food items. 9. **Food Waste and Losses**: Lockdowns and supply chain disruptions resulted in increased food waste and losses, further exacerbating changes in food availability and prices. 10. **Policies and Regulations**: Governments implemented policies to manage the pandemic's impact on food systems, including price controls, subsidies, and emergency aid programs. These measures often had unintended consequences, such as affecting market dynamics and influencing food prices.

The practice, known as ¡°biological control,¡± is one that¡¯s already found its way onto some golf courses. Indeed, a survey by the Environmental Institute for Golf found that 42 percent of 27-plus-hole golf facilities sometimes or frequently use biocontrol in their pest management practices. The researchers used an ARS patent-pending process called ¡°liquid culture fermentation¡± to mass-produce the fungus and turn it into clay granules, which they applied at different rates to grub-infested turf grass plots at Purdue University. When they rolled back patches of the turf, a grizzly sight awaited them. Depending on the rates applied, 50 to 70 percent of the grubs lay dead beneath the soil, covered in a fuzzy growth that confirmed the fungus had infected and killed them¡ªtypically 7 to 10 days after exposure. An insecticide applied to different plots worked even faster, killing 95 percent of the grubs. However, when used in the fall, the chemical had lost some of its ¡°punch¡± against larger-sized grubs compared to the fungus, which worked better with the cooler temperatures.  The findings, which the researchers published in a USGA annual report, could help golf course superintendents identify ways to use the fungus as part of an integrated pest management (IPM) approach, which combines judicious insecticide use with cultural, biological and other controls. Golfers needn¡¯t be distracted by the prospects of this biocontrol fungus quietly working underfoot, though. Its absolute preference for infecting white grubs and other insect turf eaters means people, pets and wildlife won¡¯t suffer the same fuzzy fate as these pests.

More specifically, research has demonstrated the efficacy of using Metarhizium brunneum fungus for biological control of white grubs within turf environments, such as golf courses. This method involves applying a fungal formulation containing M. brunneum to the soil where the target pests (white grubs) are present. The fungus infects and kills the grubs, providing an effective means of controlling these pests. Studies have shown that this biological control method can be highly effective in reducing white grub populations by up to 70% within a relatively short period of 7-10 days.

"International Programs Office, USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Trade  Oct 20,  In Nigeria, NASS representatives Matt Deaton, Terry Holland and John Campbell worked with Kaduna State Agricultural Development Programme, National Bureau of Statistics Federal Department of Agriculture to develop a stronger national agricultural statistics program. Today the United Nations is celebrating the first World Statistics Day, to raise awareness of official statistics, which are premised on the core value of service, professionalism and integrity. As one of the principal statistical agencies in the U.S., the USDA¡¯s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) has been heavily involved in establishing and improving agricultural statistics systems in countries around the world since the end of World War II. Food insecurity, shortfalls in regional food production and lack of reliable information on the agricultural sector are major concerns in many countries. Improved agricultural systems can provide more and better information to address these issues. This is why, over the past 10 years, NASS international projects have been instrumental in helping more than 30 developing and emerging market countries in Africa, Central and South America, Asia, and Central and Eastern Europe to develop and improve their agricultural statistics programs. Using our experience in conducting the census of agriculture, NASS is currently working with the Armenian National Statistics Service and the Ministry of Agriculture to conduct a full count of agriculture in Armenia. It has been 90 years since Armenia conducted its last census of agriculture. The upcoming census will also be Armenia¡¯s first since the country gained its independence in . In addition to the Armenian census of agriculture, NASS is also currently working with the governments in Georgia, Brazil, Mongolia, Nigeria and Serbia. Our agency is also gearing up to start a new project in Moldova. We work to provide all of these countries with technical assistance and training on a reimbursable basis in all aspects of statistical surveys and systems. The benefits of such assistance extend beyond serving the interests of the various countries. By helping other countries improve their agricultural statistics systems, USDA¡¯s ability to assess world food and fiber production is also improved. Establishing strong working relationships with other agricultural statisticians around the world allows NASS staff to gather and develop new ideas for improving the U.S. agricultural statistics system, while exposure to other cultures and work situations enhances our employees¡¯ abilities to solve problems. For more information on NASS¡¯s international programs for improving agricultural statistics, please contact our International Programs Office at 202-720- or nass-ipo@nass.usda.gov.

"USDA Office of Communications in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 09,  A new poll shows that parents of school-age children overwhelmingly support national nutrition standards for all foods and beverages sold to students during the school day. For more information, visit: www.pewtrusts.org/SchoolFoodParentPoll. Click to enlarge. Over the past four years, USDA has worked closely with schools, parents, community leaders, and nutrition experts to ensure that when children go off to school, they are greeted by a healthier school environment.  According to the CDC, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years, leading to an increase in obesity-related health outcomes in children, including cardiovascular disease, pre-diabetes, and bone and joint problems.  Improving school nutrition is vital to reducing childhood obesity, because many children consume half of their daily calories during the school day. Making the healthy choice the easy choice sets our nation¡¯s children up for a lifetime of healthy choices, and supports a healthier next generation.  Recently, we¡¯ve seen evidence that student acceptance of healthier meals is increasing across all grade levels.  Today, we are pleased to see the results of the latest poll by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the American Heart Association, showing that most parents support the healthier meal and snack standards implemented through the Healthy, Hunger-free Kids Act of .  Read more about the results of that study in this guest blog, from the American Heart Association. A majority of parents favor strong national nutrition standards for food and drink sold at schools, according to a poll released Monday by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the American Heart Association. In addition, the poll found that parents would also like to see salt limited in school foods and more fruits and vegetables served. The poll, which was conducted in June among 1,112 parents, said that 80 percent of the parents said they were concerned about their children¡¯s health. Seventy-four percent said they were concerned about childhood obesity, a major risk factor for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar and cardiovascular disease later in life. Currently, more than one third of children and adolescents are clinically overweight or obese. Among children ages six to 11, obesity rates rose from 7 percent in to 18 percent in . The rates increased from 5 percent to 21 percent during that same period for youth ages 12 to 19. Childhood obesity has been a major national focus, with federal agencies and advocacy organizations, including the American Heart Association, working on ways to curb the trend. The poll was conducted just weeks before the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued ¡°Smart Snacks¡± standards on July 1, which mandated that school snacks must be a fruit, a vegetable, protein, dairy, or whole grain; have fewer than 200 calories; and be low in fat, salt, and sugar. The poll revealed that support for stricter school nutrition standards cut across racial and political lines. Sixty-eight percent of whites, 85 percent of Hispanics and 91 percent of African-Americans said they support the standards. Fifty-six percent of Republicans, 71 percent of independents and 84 percent of Democrats favored stronger standards. Only 22 percent of parents expressed that they strongly opposed higher school nutrition standards. Among the poll¡¯s other findings: 72 percent favor national standards for school meals; 72 percent support standards for school snacks; 91 percent support requiring schools to include a serving of fruits or vegetables with every meal; 75 percent think salt should be limited in meals; 23 percent believed food sold a la carte at schools was nutritious, whereas only 8 percent believed the same of food sold in vending machines. Penny Kris Etherton, PhD, a professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pennsylvania, said the findings are encouraging, but parents voicing support is just the beginning. ¡°Schools and parents need to be on the same page about what the kids eat,¡± she said. ¡°You can¡¯t have one set of standards at school and another set of standards at home. It¡¯s encouraging to see that parents are supportive of higher nutritional standards, but we need to educate across the board so that parents understand what this really means for how their kids should eat.¡± Reducing sweetened beverages can lower a child¡¯s intake of ¡°empty¡± calories, Kris-Etherton explained. However, some parents might believe fruit juice is healthy ¡°when it¡¯s really just sugar water. The child would be better off either drinking plain water or eating a piece of fruit to get the fiber and nutrients from the fruit. The challenge will be making healthy eating fun and interesting for kids.¡± The poll was conducted by Hart Research Associates and Ferguson Research.  Pew, RWJF, and AHA are jointly supporting efforts to ensure all foods and beverages in schools are healthy. The Kids¡¯ Safe and Healthful Foods Project is a collaboration between Pew and RWJF. Voices for Healthy Kids is an initiative of RWJF and AHA, with Pew providing additional expertise.

"USDA Economic : Building Blocks for Policy  About midway through USDA¡¯s 150-year history, federal officials decided that economic research and analysis could be a valuable, objective tool in helping farmers ¨C and policymakers - grapple with farm price and income issues. In , the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE) ¨C predecessor agency of USDA¡¯s Economic Research Service (ERS) ¨C came into existence. The Bureau began regularly producing agricultural market outlook (still an ERS staple), and - not surprisingly - its early work included analysis of agricultural policy impacts during the Great Depression. Although the BAE¡¯s functions were dispersed throughout the Department in the s, they were assembled again into a single agency, the Economic Research Service, in .  I¡¯ll touch on just a few highlights of ERS activities that illustrate the value of our agency¡¯s work over the past century.

The ERS was established in 1942 as part of the USDA to provide economic analysis and research on agriculture, natural resources, and rural America. Here are some key contributions the ERS has made: 1. **Data collection and analysis**: The ERS collects and analyzes data on agricultural production, prices, trade, and farm income, providing a solid foundation for policy decisions. 2. **Research and policy recommendations**: Through research and analysis, the ERS provides policymakers with unbiased information to inform their decision-making process on issues like farm support programs, trade agreements, and environmental policies. 3. **Risk management and crop insurance**: The ERS has provided guidance on risk management strategies for farmers, including crop insurance and other forms of protection against weather-related losses or market fluctuations. 4. **Trade policy analysis**: The ERS analyzes the impact of trade policies on agriculture, providing insights on how to structure agreements that benefit both domestic producers and international trading partners. 5. **Agricultural policy evaluation**: The ERS evaluates the effectiveness of various agricultural policies, such as farm support programs (e.g., ACRE, ARC) and conservation programs, helping policymakers assess their impact and identify areas for improvement. 6. **Sustainable agriculture research**: In recent years, the ERS has focused on research related to sustainable agriculture, including issues like climate change, soil health, and water management. By providing timely, accurate data and analysis, as well as objective policy recommendations, the USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) has become a trusted resource for farmers, policymakers, and other stakeholders navigating the complex world of agricultural policies.",0.043341796,0.235294118,0.143302181,0.179566563,0.879909158
"Public Affairs Specialist, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Apr 07,  Clemence, a teacher from Ogondougou School, displays the peanuts grown in the school garden to be used as a condiment in the meal provided by USDA (CRS/Carmen Matty-Cervantes). A group of schoolchildren wait patiently in line to get their lunch. This ritual takes place in schools all over the world. But for the children in Mali, a country ranked 160 out of 169 of the poorest countries in the world, this may be their one nutritious meal for the day. With the number of chronically hungry people surpassing one billion, a sustainable approach is necessary to answer the call of those in need. USDA¡¯s McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program answers that call and works to not only feed the world¡¯s hungry, but also improve the nutrition and education of children around the world. At noon each day, the students line up and eagerly wait for their turn to get their plate full of rice and split peas thanks to USDA (CRS/Carmen Matty-Cervantes). The McGovern-Dole Program supports education, child development and food security in low-income, food-deficit countries that are committed to universal education. It provides for donations of U.S. agricultural products, as well as financial and technical assistance for school feeding and maternal and child nutrition projects. Currently, USDA funds 36 active agreements with 17 cooperating sponsors in 28 countries, assisting more than five million beneficiaries. To date, the Program has provided meals to more than 22 million children. Since , Catholic Relief Services, with the help of the McGovern-Dole program, has played a large role in improving the lives of children and their families in Mali, a country with a population of more than 12.5 million. The United Nations recently reported that 10 percent of the total population was undernourished and that 38 percent of pre-school aged children are physically stunted. In light of Mali¡¯s situation, this McGovern-Dole project has enhanced the welfare of targeted communities through improving access to food and education for children. By the end of the fiscal year, the CRS/Mali program had directly impacted the lives of over 45,000 individuals in Mali. In promoting the health of students, teachers, and school cooks, more than 5 million meals, as well as vitamins and medications, were distributed among 120 schools. Nearly 2,000 members of school management committees supported by the program participated in literacy sessions and radio broadcasts about the importance of education. Through these efforts, overall school enrollment in targeted communities has increased from 26 percent to 32 percent for boys and from 39 percent to 55 percent for girls since the program began in . In May , the Obama administration unveiled the Feed the Future (FTF) Initiative. The Initiative supports the international effort to increase the availability and accessibility of food and to improve nutrition and food safety. It serves as a springboard for broader economic development and food security. It also serves as a foundation for peace and opportunity in developing countries, which ensures our own national security. USDA is working with the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of State, and international organizations to help implement the Initiative. The McGovern-Dole program is one way USDA leverages its resources to support Feed the Future. The Program has played a critical role in enhancing the livelihood of Malians and will remain a bright spot in food assistance and education in communities around the world.

The training will cover nine course modules on ¡°Strategies for Building New Economic Opportunities¡± which will be completed by next year. Marcellus Shale was the topic, but the conversation wasn't about the money and jobs the industry has brought to the area. The conversation was about how to measure the economic impact of Marcellus Shale, keep the dollars in the region, and create a sustainable economy. The Northern Tier realizes the way to achieve sustainable results and best utilize area resources is regional collaboration. The foundation created on that snowy morning will be the building blocks of the region's future success. This effort is a great example of how Rural Development has brought leaders and stakeholders in several communities together to collaborate on how to improve the quality of their community. Northern Tier was one of two Pennsylvania regional teams selected after a competitive application process.

"Help USDA Fight Hungry Pests: Keep an Eye Out for Asian Longhorned Beetle   Throughout August, a little-known beetle may emerge from the trees in your community. You might see its long black and white antennae inching out from a dime-shaped hole in your favorite tree. The pest, named the Asian longhorned beetle, kills trees from the inside out. It attacks 13 types of hardwood trees.  Rebecca Blue, USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs  Posted in  Animals  Plants  Aug 01,   2 Responses",What is the primary threat posed by the Asian longhorned beetle to tree populations?,The primary threat posed by the Asian longhorned beetle is that it kills trees from the inside out.,"The primary threat posed by the Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) to tree populations is its ability to kill trees quickly and efficiently. This beetle species is a highly invasive insect that targets hardwood tree species, particularly maple, willow, elm, and ash. When an adult Asian longhorned beetle lands on a tree, it can bore into the bark with its sharp mouthparts, creating small holes (about 1/8 inch in diameter) through which it feeds on the sapwood. This feeding process disrupts the flow of water and nutrients within the tree, eventually killing it. The key issues with this beetle's impact are: 1. **Rapid kill rate**: Asian longhorned beetles can kill trees within a few years after infestation. 2. **Widespread damage**: A single female beetle can lay up to 100 eggs in her lifetime, which can lead to the rapid spread of the population and extensive tree mortality. 3. **Difficulty in detection**: Infestations often go undetected until significant damage has occurred. Overall, the Asian longhorned beetle poses a serious threat to forest ecosystems and urban tree populations due to its ability to kill trees quickly and efficiently, causing widespread economic and environmental impacts.",0.043473973,0.141509434,0.085714286,0.141509434,0.874518514
"AMS Livestock, Poultry, and Seed Program Deputy Administrator in  Conservation  Jan 27,  Livestock correlations, like the one held at Penn State, are one way that USDA Market News ensures the accuracy and consistency in its . The correlation allowed reporters to compare live animal assessments and grades with the post-slaughter assessment and grades of the same animals. During its 100 years of serving the livestock industry, USDA Market News ¨C part of USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) ¨C has prided itself in creating transparency and clarity in the marketplace by allowing all industry stakeholders to have the same information about the market at the same time.  The entire agricultural supply chain relies on USDA Market News for timely, unbiased .  Without this free service, information would not be available to everyone equally, making USDA Market News a vital lifeline for America¡¯s agricultural economy. Over the years, countless changes have occurred in the livestock industry ¨C like the way that livestock standards are applied and the way market reporting is conducted.  To keep up with these changes, livestock correlations are held to assure the industry that all USDA market reporters are applying the USDA¡¯s livestock grades and standards consistently and accurately. AMS develops, maintains and interprets USDA¡¯s livestock grades and standards ¨C like the Prime, Choice or Select grades used for beef.  USDA grades and standards ensure uniformity in products and quality, as well as in USDA¡¯s market published across the nation.  Grades and standards provide a common trade language that ranchers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers are familiar with and rely on to buy and sell effectively. Recently, a group of market reporters from the Livestock, Poultry, and Grain Market News division attended a livestock correlation at Penn State University facilitated by its on-campus meats laboratory.  At Penn State, market reporters evaluated a pen of cattle and a pen of lambs and assigned the appropriate livestock quality and yield grade, while veteran market reporters spoke about the animals¡¯ distinguishing qualities.  The Penn State campus offered a unique venue for the correlation, having a full meat processing and cutting facility right on campus. The next day, the market reporters returned to Penn State to correlate their live animal grade designations from the previous day to the same animal¡¯s post-slaughter grade designations, comparing and correlating their findings to check consistency and accuracy in their findings. Livestock correlations are just one way that USDA Market News upholds its commitment to accuracy and consistency in its .  Market reporters understand that in order for their to be as meaningful as possible, a Choice grade steer in Georgia needs to be comparable to a Choice grade steer in Iowa, just as a Prime lamb in Pennsylvania has to be equal to a Prime lamb in Colorado. This uniformity, strengthened by the continuous work of market reporters, makes USDA Market some of the most trusted and respected in the world.

"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way from the Summit: How REE is Using New Strategies to Reach Even Newer Poultry Handlers  During a walk along tree-shading sidewalks in the ¡°burbs¡±; you¡¯re accustomed to seeing games of hopscotch, bike rides, and maybe even the occasional Golden Retriever. However, one residential backyard, nearly 6 miles from downtown Atlanta, calls into question whether this is suburbia at all. There were swings, a tree house, and even patio furniture. Yet one feature certified this was not your mother¡¯s suburban home: over a dozen chickens living comfortably in a custom made ¡°Coop de Ville.¡±    The rise of ¡°backyard poultry¡± is one of many agricultural phenomena tied to a growing food consciousness and increased urbanization. And while USDA¡¯s fundamental job doesn¡¯t change, the Department does because the challenges do.  The recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at increasingly popular backyard chicken coops underscore this. While this concern was not clearly expressed in the Act of Congress that created the Department, the mandate was. USDA still works to ¡°acquire and to diffuse¡­information¡± towards facilitating the protected growth of American agriculture. That service is what brought Research, Education, and Economics Undersecretary Dr. Catherine Woteki to this residence in Decatur, GA. Accompanied by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service officials and a man known best as the ¡°Chicken Whisperer,¡± Dr. Woteki toured the site and helped to shed light on current HPAI research and important biosafety measures.

Some key measures include: 1. **Biosecurity Practices**: These involve steps that prevent contact between birds and any potential source of disease, such as wild birds or contaminated feeds. This includes securing the coop to keep out rodents and other animals, regularly cleaning the area around the coop, ensuring good ventilation within the coop, using protective clothing when handling birds or their droppings, and maintaining strict hygiene standards. 2. **Vaccination Programs**: Some regions implement vaccination programs for chickens in backyard coops as a preventive measure against HPAI. These vaccinations are designed to protect the birds from infection by strains of avian influenza virus that could potentially become highly pathogenic if they were to infect the flock. 3. **Monitoring and Surveillance**: Regular monitoring of backyard chicken coops, including health checks on the birds and testing for avian flu viruses, is crucial in early detection of HPAI outbreaks. This allows for swift response measures to be taken before the situation escalates into a larger public health issue. 4. **Isolation and Disposal**: If an outbreak of HPAI is detected in a backyard flock, isolating the affected birds immediately and following proper procedures for their disposal can help prevent further spread of the disease. This might involve contacting local authorities to assist with containment measures. 5. **Education and Awareness**: Raising awareness among backyard chicken keepers about HPAI risks, biosafety measures, and what to do in case of an outbreak is vital. Many organizations offer educational materials and guidance on biosecurity practices that can be adopted by these households. 6. **Regulations and Laws**: In some jurisdictions, specific regulations have been put into place regarding the keeping of backyard chickens, including requirements for vaccination or regular health checks. These laws are designed to minimize the risk of HPAI spreading from chicken coops to humans or other animals. These measures are not only aimed at preventing the spread of HPAI among backyard flocks but also at safeguarding public health and animal welfare in general. They are considered essential for maintaining a safe environment for both birds and humans living in close proximity, such as in urban and suburban areas where backyard chicken keeping is increasingly popular.",0.021178654,0.113207547,0.071090047,0.08490566,0.848761141
"Administrator, USDA Rural Housing Service in  Rural  May 12,  New home loan processing is saving customer and staff time, taxpayer money and lots of paper. (Click to enlarge) This has been the year of innovation at USDA Rural Housing Service. We are working smarter, faster, more efficient and environmentally conscious than ever before.  After years of brainstorming, planning, reengineering, testing, and training, RHS has realized its vision: the Section 502 Guaranteed Single Family Home Loan Program now operates paperless, and we¡¯re saving more than we ever imagined possible. USDA¡¯s Rural Development State field offices now transact business with private lenders via Web-based uploads and electronic signatures.  This means RHS and our private partners are no longer printing and sending hundreds of pages of paper back-and-forth every time a loan guarantee is used to help a rural American family buy their home. As a result, loan guarantees are processed faster and families move into homes more quickly. Postage fees will be eliminated and huge print jobs avoided for every one of the 140,000+ home loans USDA guarantees we will make in the coming year. Initial estimates show USDA Rural Housing Service will save 37,500 reams of paper every year now that we do more business in a paperless environment. More than 135,333 staff hours per year nationwide were being spent managing these paper processes. Staff will have more time to assist our customers, connect with potential partners and, of course, help more rural Americans buy their own homes through our 502 homeownership programs. All of the savings in time, paper and postage adds up to some serious savings of American tax dollars. In fact, we estimate RHS will save more than $4.2 million in just one year of using the new process nationwide.  This means we can allocate more time and money into oversight initiatives that will work to ensure lender compliance, and more adequately staff other Single Family Housing Programs to better serve Rural America. The people who work in the Rural Housing Service are proud of this milestone! But, as they like to remind everyone, RHS is just getting started.

"USDA Rural Development Utilities Service Administrator in  Initiatives  Rural  Technology  May 27,  Anita J. (Janie) Dunning, Missouri State Director, and Jonathan Adelstein, RUS Administrator (center), painting the Ralls County PWSD No. 1 water tower A three day visit to Missouri, the ¡°Show Me State¡± allowed me to join Janie Dunning, Rural Development State Director, to see how rural areas benefiting from infrastructure investments made possible through USDA Rural Development programs and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) financing. My trip started on Wednesday, May 18, , with a visit to Socket Telecom, LLC in Columbia, MO.   We learned of their progress on a $23.7 million Rural Utilities Recovery Act investment for high speed fiber-to-the-home broadband access to 2,700 homes, 36 critical community institutions and 270 businesses in Callaway County.  That afternoon, as a member of President Obama¡¯s White House Business Council on ¡°Winning the Future,¡± I facilitated a roundtable discussion with 20 community and business leaders of Mexico, MO, hosted by Frank Cordie of Mid America Brick. When you think of ¡°bricks and mortar¡± for cementing economic development, there is no better place than in America¡¯s heartland at a brick plant.  I gathered feedback on ways we can help businesses expand, create jobs, and improve the economic base in their area.  The roundtable was followed by a very interesting tour of the brick plant to see how the $10 million from the agency¡¯s Business and Industry guaranteed funds was being used to bring this regional business icon back to life. Jonathan Adelstein, RUS Administrator; Barry Hart, CEO of the Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives; Jay Nixon, Governor of Missouri; Dan Strode, President/CEO of Ralls County Electric Cooperative. The next day, I joined Missouri Governor Jay Nixon for a ¡°light up¡± ceremony at Ralls County Electric Cooperative (RCEC). They were celebrating the construction and hooking up the first customers of $19.1 million project, funded by USDA under the Recovery Act, to serve 4,600 households, 300 business and 58 anchor institutions in northeast Missouri.  I found most interesting is that the RCEC is reinvesting 10 percent of their earnings from the broadband investment for economic development opportunities for individuals and businesses in their service area.  This ceremony was followed by a working lunch to discuss other broadband opportunities with Damon Porter, Governor Nixon¡¯s point-man on broadband. My next stop was to Ralls County Ralls County Public Water Supply District No. 1 to visit the site of water improvements including a new 250,000 gallon water tower.  Janie and I grabbed paint brushes and assisted with painting the water tower support.  Yes, that was a first for me. That evening the Missouri state office staff hosted me in a discussion with Barry Hart, CEO of the Association of Electric Cooperatives and other electric cooperative leaders to talk about partnering strategies to assist rural Missourians. My third day, included a tour of USDA funded Water and Wastewater projects in Howard County.  First stop was to a state of the art, environmentally friendly lagoon at the City of Fayette.  I was very impressed with this new technology and treatment of waste water.  One of the stages in the water treatment includes a process in a lagoon covered with a heavy duty rubberized material. I made a closer inspection of the rubberized material and verified that it was strong enough for opportunity for me to ¡°walk on (waste) water¡±!  This may be a first for an Administrator.

The next stop was to see another investment to the City of Fayette for improvements to their water system including the construction of a new water tower.  The last stop was for a celebration of strategies supported by President Obama and Secretary Vilsack for regionalization.  The Howard County Regional Water Commission was established as a regional water waste supply and treatment system to serve three public water systems in the southern part of Howard County including: the City of Fayette, the City of New Franklin and Howard County PWSD No. 1.

Pop-up events, like food festivals or farm-to-table dinners, can also bring the community together around food. * **Workshops and education**: By offering workshops on topics such as gardening, cooking, or food preservation, Amanda can share her expertise and build trust with community members. This can also create opportunities for people to learn from each other. * **Food cooperatives**: These are member-owned businesses that allow consumers to pool their resources to purchase fresh produce in bulk. Food cooperatives often have a strong focus on local, sustainable food systems. * **Social media and online platforms**: Amanda might utilize social media or specialized platforms to share her story, promote her farm, and engage with customers directly. This can help build a community around her farm's mission and values. * **Partnerships and collaborations**: By partnering with other local businesses, organizations, or initiatives, Amanda can expand the reach of her urban farm and create new opportunities for people to connect with food and each other. * **Food recovery and redistribution programs**: These programs collect surplus produce from farms like Amanda's and redistribute it to those who need it most. This can help reduce food waste while providing fresh produce to underserved communities.

Every July, the entire nation celebrates Blueberry Month by coming up with creative recipes and other unique ways to get their fill. Here at USDA, every month is Blueberry Month. One of the ways that we show our appreciation for our nation¡¯s blueberry producers and processors is by creating more opportunities for people to enjoy this delicious fruit. Indigenous to North America, the history of blueberries can be traced all the way back to Native Americans, who added them to soups, stews, and even meats. Highbush or cultivated blueberries are grown on large bushes that are planted in rows. These blueberries are often sent to the fresh market. Lowbush or wild blueberries produce smaller sized berries and are pruned every couple of years. The majority of lowbush blueberries are processed into items like jams, jellies and baked goods. My agency, the USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), does its part to help more people eat these little blue dynamos.? Through our Commodity Procurement Program, we purchase frozen cultivated and wild blueberries. The purchases send this highly nutritious food to school children, families, and communities through federal food distribution programs like the National School Lunch Program. In , we bought nearly $17.9 million or 11.3 million pounds of frozen wild blueberries. This provided a reliable outlet for producers in places like Maine where 98% of the nation¡¯s wild blueberries are harvested. As a result of this purchase, states like Maine can continue to strengthen their rural economies. Our purchases are also making a big difference in states like New Jersey -- the birthplace of the cultivated blueberry. The state¡¯s blueberry industry produced more than 51 million pounds that  yielded nearly $81 million in revenue in . This was by far the largest revenue generator in the Garden State¡¯s fruit and vegetable sector that year. In , AMS helped continue this trend by buying $18.4 million or 15.4 million pounds of frozen cultivated blueberries from growers across the country. In addition to our purchases, AMS supports the blueberry industry by offering grants to help it remain competitive in the marketplace. Classified as specialty crops, blueberries are eligible for grants through our Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. This program offers funds to states to support research and marketing projects that do things such as increasing crop yields. So, thanks to Specialty Crop Block Grant funds, several state agriculture departments can conduct research to mitigate the damage to its blueberry crops created by the Brown Marmorated Stinkbug and other invasive pests. Whether it¡¯s July or any other part of the year, AMS is committed to supporting our nation¡¯s blueberry producers and processors. We recommend that you add some color to your plate with some blueberries. The U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council¡¯s website has some great recipes to get you started. In , AMS purchased nearly 11.3 million pounds of frozen wild blueberries and 15.4 million pounds of frozen cultivated blueberries from growers across the country.

"Recreation, Heritage and Volunteer Services, U.S. Forest Service in  Conservation  Forestry  Mar 18,  An owl seems to plead for help after getting stuck in a vault toilet. A movement to save birds from serious injury and death garnered a Wings Across the Americas Award for the Teton Raptor Center of Jackson Hole, Wyo., and employees from several national forests. (Photo courtesy Teton Raptor Center) Small owls, such as western screech and northern saw whet owls, weigh between 3 and 7 ounces, or about the same weight as a small cell phone or a deck of cards. They prefer dark, narrow spaces for nesting and roosting, which is why they are called cavity birds. Their habitat preferences make them prone to using man-made features, such as open pipes, that mimic their natural nesting and roosting cavities. But on some public lands, that natural act of finding habitat in ventilation pipes has led to their death. The resolution that could save thousands of birds resulted in an award from Wings Across the Americas, a program of the U.S. Forest Service and its partners to conserve birds, bats, butterflies and dragonflies across all landscapes and boundaries. The project received the Habitat Management and Partnership Award, shared with Forest Service employees and the Teton Raptor Center in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Many public agencies use vault toilets to manage sanitary waste on their lands, and the ventilation pipes seem to attract the birds. The small owls enter the hole at the top of the vent, fall down the vertical pipe and land in the waste holding reservoir. The small size and weight of the birds make it impossible for them to gain any lift to escape. In , the Teton Raptor Center heard about the problem and decided to do something. Roger Smith, founder of Teton Raptor Center, said a photo of an owl peering up from the reservoir made him realize the need for ¡°¡­a real, tangible conservation project that people could understand and commit to ¨C preventing bird mortality from a man-made problem by covering the hole with a screen.¡± As a non-profit organization with a mission focused on conservation, education and rehabilitation, the Teton Raptor Center resolved to launch a public awareness campaign:  the Port-O-Potty Owl Project. Of course, it quickly gained the nickname ¡°Poo-Poo Project.¡± Unbeknownst to Smith was the collaboration between Gerardo Chavarria, a Forest Service regional engineer based in Denver, and Greg Hayward, an agency wildlife ecologist working in Alaska. Hayward sought out Chavarria because he wanted an engineering fix to prevent the bird deaths. ¡°His concern was contagious and provided a challenge for me to investigate if there was a cost effective way to screen the toilet vent stacks without too much negative effect on air flow out of the stacks.¡± he said. Chavarria used his engineering skills to design a screen that would not adversely affect the functional design of a vault toilet. In fact, his work helped to advance the quick fixes the raptor center sought on vault toilets on three national forests in Wyoming. Chavarria¡¯s advance research determined the types of screen that would work, which allowed the raptor center and the Forest Service to immediately cap the toilet vents. Because the need and resolution were already pre-determined, Forest Service employees Joe Harper of the Shoshone National Forest, Tammy Fletcher of the Caribou-Targhee National Forest and Bernadette Barthelenghi of the Bridger-Teton National Forest could more quickly answer the raptor center¡¯s call. Harper brought the awareness of what happened to the birds to the forest, and all vault toilets are now screened and any new toilets and pipes also will be screened. Fletcher helped to secure grant funding to purchase screens for the Caribou-Targhee and all participating land agencies within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. And Barthelenghi made the work possible on her forest and worked to ensure the project and solution were shared with all agency offices. Joe Alexander, forest supervisor on the Shoshone, said they partnered with community organizations to help install the necessary screens.  Local chapters of the Audubon Society and Boy Scouts engaged on this real world problem and helped to make a difference. ¡°The Shoshone National Forest prides itself on being the leader in conservation,¡± Alexander said. ¡°After implementation of these new toilets it became apparent that some small efforts could go a long ways in protecting our avian resources. The Wings Across the Americas awards were presented March 12 during the 79th North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference. Other award winners are: The Barto Fen Restoration Project on the Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri received the first Dragonfly Conservation Award for one of the largest and most genetically diverse populations of this dragonfly. The Monitoring and Conservation of Black-Backed Woodpecker in Burned Forests project received the Research Management & Partnership award. Since , several organizations, including the Pacific Southwest Regional Office of the U.S. Forest Service and the Institute for Bird Populations, worked to better integrate the habitat needs of the bird into forest management plans. The Bat Cave Gating Project on the Mark Twain National Forest also received the Bat Conservation Award. The forest is home to a large gray bat maternity colony, and the project¡¯s goal is to protect the bats by closing nearby trails and installing chute gauges and flyover gates at entrances of bat maternity caves. The Migratory Shorebird Project: Connecting Communities of the Americas through Research for Conservation received the International Cooperation Award. The project looks at two species, the Western Sandpiper and the Pacific population of the Dunlin, measures their response to management actions, studies what influence population changes and educates people on the importance of wetland resources all along the Pacific Coast of the Americas. The University of Minnesota Monarch Lab received the Communities in Conservation award.

"Forest Health Protection, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 05,  Removing mud and seeds from your shoes can help prevent the spread of invasive plants and animals. (Photo by Kim Lanahan-Lahti, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Division of Forestry) For years now, the U.S. Forest Service has been encouraging visitors to our nation¡¯s forests and grasslands, to not only enjoy all there is out there, but to play safe and play clean. One example of this outreach effort is the PlayCleanGo: Stop Invasive Species In Your Tracks campaign. PlayCleanGo has 130 partners, all fostering active participation in actions designed to interrupt recreational pathways of spread for invasive species. By becoming a partner, you can spread the message to stop invasive species in your tracks. ¡°PlayCleanGo is designed to give outdoor recreationists a clear call to action to be informed and attentive in helping stop the spread of invasive plants and insects and improving overall forest health,¡± said Monica Lear, U.S. Forest Service Forest Health Protection Director. ¡°These pests can expand like a different kind of wildfire, from forest to forest by unsuspecting visitors just looking for some fun and adventure.¡± From camping to fishing to hiking, getting outside and into nature is one of the many activities that our forests support. Outdoor recreation provides physical challenges, contributes greatly to the physical and mental health of individuals, provides economic benefits to communities, and has become an essential part of American culture. PlayCleanGo is helping these recreationists preserve the land they already love and enjoy. Through positive messaging, the program provides simple steps people can take to avoid accidently spreading invasive species.  This advice includes letting visitors know to stay on designated trails, remove mud and seeds from shoes and gear, and burn only local or certified firewood. For example, garlic mustard, an aggressive plant invader of wooded areas throughout the Northeastern and Midwestern US, can form dense stands and displace native species by competing for available light, nutrients and water resources. Garlic mustard seeds stick together when damp and adhere readily to small soil clusters, making it easy for them to stick to muddy boots, pant cuffs, and animal fur. Through easy actions like inspecting hiking equipment, clothing, and pets before going out on a hiking trail and conducting the same inspection upon leaving the trail, the PlayCleanGo campaign is helping slow the spread of invasive species. PlayCleanGo was launched by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, in partnership with the University of Minnesota Extension, Minnesota departments of Agriculture and Transportation, and Explore Minnesota. Creating a new and successful awareness campaign, like Smokey Bear and his fire prevention message, depends on broad, frequent exposure to the public. For this reason, PlayCleanGo invites public and private organizations to join the effort by becoming a partner.

The ""PlayCleanGo"" campaign aims to raise awareness among recreationists about the risks associated with transporting invasive species from one location to another on their gear, clothing, and vehicles. Recreationists can help prevent the spread of invasive species by following these simple steps: 1. **Inspect your gear**: Before leaving a recreational area, inspect your gear, clothing, and vehicle for any signs of invasive species. 2. **Clean your gear**: Clean and dry all gear, including boats, kayaks, and camping equipment, to prevent the transport of invasive species. 3. **Stay on designated trails**: Stay on designated trails to avoid disturbing native vegetation and reducing the risk of spreading invasive species. 4. **Avoid transporting firewood**: Do not transport firewood from one location to another, as it can harbor invasive insects like emerald ash borers. 5. **Report sightings**: If you encounter an invasive species during a recreation trip, report it to local authorities or park rangers. By following these simple steps, recreationists can help prevent the spread of invasive species and protect the integrity of ecosystems for future generations.",0.113484721,0.393650794,0.21086262,0.273015873,0.891810298

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Oct 24,  Bat Week graphic. By the time October comes around, store shelves are stocked with Halloween candy, costumes, and decorations. Bats are often situated among this imagery, whether as silhouettes in the background or as blood-sucking monsters. But bats are none of these things. They are primarily nocturnal, they make their homes in dark places, but there¡¯s nothing scary about them. That is why Bat Week, October 24-31, is a time to celebrate bats, what they contribute to our society, and to dispel the myths that cause so much misunderstanding of these gentle, intelligent creatures. There are more than 1,300 species of bats worldwide, and they are diverse. Some, like Kitti¡¯s hog-nosed bat, also known as the bumble bee bat, can be as small as your thumbnail and survives on insects. Others like the flying fox eat fruit and have earned their name due to their impressive size. Bats like this Mexican free-tailed bat feed on insects and play an important role in pest control on agricultural crops. Photo by MerlinTuttle.org. There are three species of vampire bat among those 1,300. However, they live in Mexico, Central and South America; feed primarily on large livestock; and take about an ounce of blood in a feeding. Forty-seven species of bat call the United States home. Bats provide valuable services to us. Most feed on insects and play an important role in pest control on agricultural crops. The various species of beetles, moths, and other insects that often plague crops represent a tasty meal to a hungry bat. In fact, it is estimated that if bats were lost in North America, savings of up to $3.7 billion dollars annually would be lost due to increased pesticide requirements in agriculture. In one case, a Georgia pecan farmer was able to abandon pesticide use altogether after he built bat houses housing several thousand Mexican free-tailed bats. The Forest Service is looking into the role that bats play in pest insect control on the forest as well. Many insects, like bark beetles and gypsy moths, can be devastating to forests, and as voracious insect eaters, bats have the potential to help cull their numbers. Recognizing the role they play, the Forest Service has long been a champion of bat conservation. Over the last decade, the fungal disease white-nose syndrome has killed more than six million bats. While Forest Service researchers seek a solution to white-nose syndrome, the agency¡¯s land managers explore improved ways to manage bat habitat. Within the 193 million acres of forests and grasslands that the agency manages, there are more than 25,000 abandoned mines that present both opportunity and hazard. Recognizing the potential of abandoned mines as ideal roosting, hibernation, or maternity sites, the Forest Service has constructed ¡°bat gates¡± that provide a grating to keep visitors from stumbling into a potential hazard while allowing bats to fly freely. You too can make a big difference by planting bat-friendly gardens, building bat houses, and helping dispel myths about bats. Little Brown bats found in Maine with white-nose syndrome.

If bats were lost in North America, it is estimated that savings of up to $3.7 billion dollars annually would be lost due to increased pesticide requirements in agriculture.","**Role of Bats in Controlling Insect Pests:** Bats (order Chiroptera) are important predators that feed on a wide range of insects, including pest species that damage agricultural crops. In the United States alone, bats consume approximately 1 billion kilograms of insects per year, with some species specializing in feeding on specific crop-damaging pests like: * Cotton bollworms (Helicoverpa zea) * Corn earworms (Helicoverpa zea) * Sugarcane borers (Diatraea saccharalis) * Sweet potato weevils (Cylas formicarius) By preying on these insects, bats play a significant role in reducing the need for insecticides and minimizing crop damage. This ecosystem service can lead to: * Increased crop yields * Reduced pesticide use and associated environmental impacts * Lower costs for farmers **Potential Losses:** The loss of bats from North American agriculture could have significant consequences. Some estimates suggest that a 50% decline in bat populations would result in an additional $3 billion to $5 billion in losses per year due to increased pest damage. Possible scenarios: 1. **Increased pesticide use**: Without their natural predators, insect populations might surge, leading farmers to rely more heavily on pesticides, which can harm human health and the environment. 2. **Crop yield declines**: As a result of increased pest pressure, crop yields could decrease, affecting not only agricultural producers but also consumers who rely on affordable food supplies. 3. **Economic impacts**: The cumulative effect of lost yields and increased pesticide use would likely translate to higher costs for farmers, distributors, and consumers. **Conservation Efforts:** To mitigate these potential losses, conservation efforts should focus on: 1. **Habitat protection**: Preserving and restoring natural habitats that support bat colonies. 2. **Research and monitoring**: Studying the ecological role of bats in agricultural ecosystems and tracking population trends to inform management decisions. 3. **Integrated pest management (IPM)**: Encouraging farmers to adopt IPM strategies, which involve using a combination of techniques, including biological control (e.g., introducing beneficial insects), cultural practices, physical barriers, and selective use of pesticides. By acknowledging the value of bats in controlling insect pests on agricultural crops, we can work towards protecting these valuable pollinators and maintaining healthy, sustainable ecosystems.",6.56E-79,0.153061224,0.041025641,0.12244898,0.848231435
"Rural  Jul 19,   Story and Photos by Phil Eggman, USDA Rural Development, Washington State Office Donating a little bit of time can go a long way to making a big difference for people. Just ask the employees of USDA Rural Development in Washington State who, on July 13, donated two hours of their time at the end of a hectic day to make food packages for the elderly, young mothers, infants and children at the Thurston County Food Bank located in downtown Olympia. According to Thurston County Food Bank Executive Director Robert Coit, it was opportune that the Rural Development team were packaging food for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), which is a USDA program that provides nutritious food ""packages"" designed specifically for the nutritional  needs of low-income pregnant and breastfeeding women, infants, children up to age six and elderly people 60 and older. ""It's a great program and helps us with our mission to eliminate hunger in Thurston County,"" Coit said, adding that the food bank serves 10,000 families annually, including 37,000 individuals, half of which are children, around the communities of Lacy, Olympia  and Tumwater. ""This was a great opportunity for us to help out in our local community,"" said Mario Villanueva, Washington State Director, USDA Rural Development. ""Too many Americans live in food deserts and lack access to healthy food.  USDA is a key partner in providing access to healthy food by administering the nation's nutrition programs, funding projects that provide underserved areas with greater access to fresh produce"" ""It was great!,"" said Becki Southworth, Multi-Family Housing Loan Specialist. ""I really feel like we were able to help our local community by not only what we do every day through housing, business and community programs, but by taking it up a level and getting out in the community, we were able to help meet another need, provide food to those that need it most.  I am so glad I was able to go and I would love to do it again."" ""I had fun and it felt great to know that we helped 210 families in just an hour and a half of work of great teamwork,"" said Housing Specialist Leslie Schmidt. ""It just shows how much you can help the community with just a little bit of our time."" In addition to helping out at the local food bank (an exercise the agency plans to repeat on a regular basis), Rural Development is participating in a summer food drive as part of the 2nd Annual ""Feds, Farmers, and Friends Feed Families"" (F5) initiative.  The Washington State food drive kicked off July 6 in Olympia and other area offices and will run through July 31. The food drive makes a big difference. Last summer, federal employees around the country donated more than 1 million pounds of nonperishable goods and daily essentials for those in need. The new goal for across the Federal government is 1.2 million pounds of non-perishable items. ""We know the need is great in our area and this was a chance for our agency and federal partners to contribute to a worthwhile cause,"" said Gayle Hoskison, Olympia Area Director.

"Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Oct 31,  A wasp works its way out of an aphid mummy after developing inside as larvae. (Photo courtesy of the ARS Electron and Confocal Microscopy Unit) At Halloween, people revel in ghosts, goblins, and things that go bump in the night. Not all are in books or movies, though. There are plenty of creepy critters doing downright scary things every day in your own backyard. That¡¯s not necessarily a bad thing, since many of these ¡°monsters¡± are actually good guys getting the bad guys out of town; it¡¯s just not always pleasant to watch. Fire ants are common in subtropical Southeastern states and have shown up as far west as California. These stinging ants are not just painful pests; they¡¯re also a bane to agriculture, feeding on young plants and seeds, causing an estimated crop loss of $750 million per year. There are many ways to control or eliminate fire ants, but nature provides one that is tailor made for the silver screen! Enter the phorid fly, a natural predator of the fire ant. The fly swoops in on its target and deposits an egg into the ant. After hatching inside the ant, the maggot works its way into the ant¡¯s head, where it lives for a couple of weeks, feeding on bodily fluids. The maggot then releases chemicals that eat away at the ant¡¯s body until its head falls off. The maggot then stays in the severed head and feeds on brains until it reaches maturity and breaks out through the ant¡¯s mouth. Like zombies? You will, if you don¡¯t like cockroaches. The jewel wasp injects a serum into its victim, which ¡°zombifies¡± the roach into submitting to its will. The passive zombie roach allows the wasp to lead it by an antenna into a nest, which quickly becomes a nursery after the wasp lays its egg. As with the phorid fly larvae, it feeds off its host until it reaches maturity. Mummies also abound in gardens and fields, courtesy of a pair of wasps. These wasps (Aphidiinae braconid wasps ¨C pictured ¨C and Pteromalid chaclid wasps) also deposit an egg inside the body of their prey, this time an aphid. The wasp larvae grow inside the aphid, which soon becomes mummified in that it turns inflated, rigid, and off-color. After the larva becomes an adult wasp, it chews its way out, leaving the mummy husk behind. ¡°Husks are fun to collect and are routinely encountered in gardens,¡± said Matt Buffington, a research scientist with the Agricultural Research Service¡¯s Systematic Entomology Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. ¡°In fact, if you have them, it¡¯s a good sign your aphid problems are being somewhat controlled.¡± Aphids are a scourge to crops and horticulture, where they suck on sap, which causes yellowing, stunting, distortion of plant parts, leaf mold, and, in cotton, poor fiber quality. Aphids can also transmit plant viruses. Not to be outdone, some bees (Trigona hypogea) make an appearance as scavenger vampires. ¡°Instead of providing their young with protein from pollen, vampire bees gather protein from carcasses on the forest floor,¡± Buffington said. ¡°Further, they have unique jaws for tearing into dead animal flesh and cutting it into pieces for transport and digestion.¡± There are plenty of other examples of insects that exemplify Halloween, but one of the spookiest is actually a mammal ¨C the humble bat. If you can get past the vampire nature of some bats, you¡¯ll find that many species of bats are great friends of plants; they pollinate, spread seeds, and feed on pesky bugs. So, on All Hallows¡¯ Eve, as you¡¯re greeting young ghosts and goblins doing their rounds of trick-or-treating, don¡¯t forget about those beneficial creepy critters in your own backyard.

The unique aspect of how Aphidiinae braconid wasps interact with their aphid prey is that they are parasitoids. In other words, these wasps lay their eggs inside the living body of an aphid, rather than killing and eating it outright. This is a remarkable example of evolutionary adaptation, where the wasp benefits from having its offspring grow inside a host organism, while also using the aphid's bodily resources to nourish their developing young. This parasitoid relationship allows the braconid wasp larvae to grow and develop within the aphid's body, eventually emerging as adult wasps. This unique interaction is a key aspect of their life cycle and has evolved as an effective way for these tiny wasps to reproduce and thrive in their environment.",1.59E-78,0.377777778,0.202247191,0.266666667,0.87541455

"DVM, Ph.D., USDA/APHIS Deputy Administrator, Veterinary Services, U.S. Chief Veterinary Officer in  Animals  Oct 16,  Waterfowl fly at 40 to 60 miles per hour. Migrating mallards can cover 800 miles in 8 hours if helped by 50 mile per hour tail winds. We know you¡¯ve heard it before: seasonal migratory patterns bring an increased risk of disease-carrying birds interacting with commercial or backyard poultry. But the health and safety of our U.S. poultry flock is important enough to make it worth repeating. Birds, particularly waterfowl like ducks and geese, can carry avian influenza without showing any symptoms or signs of disease. Because the risk of introduction never goes away, having strong biosecurity practices on poultry operations can help prevent the spread of infectious disease before it starts. The - U.S. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreak is never far from my mind. It forced us to reevaluate our preparedness and response capabilities, from a federal, state, and industry standpoint. Today, we are all better prepared to handle and quickly respond to avian influenza detections. Our Wild Bird Surveillance Program, which has been in place for more than a decade, is on-going. Since July , USDA and our partners have collected more than 90,ates. This improves our ability to detect these viruses and helps poultry producers and others make informed management decisions. The program also gives us a chance to learn more about the virus, including the make-up and transmission of various virus strains. We¡¯ve taken these experiences and lessons learned from the -15 outbreak and developed Defend the Flock, an outreach program that offers commercial poultry growers important information to help put the best biosecurity practices into place. Defend the Flock provides multiple resources for poultry growers, including guidance on biosecurity basics, an assessment tool to help strengthen their biosecurity programs, and sharable materials to help everyone at their operations better understand biosecurity¡¯s importance. Stay up-to-date on the latest biosecurity information by following on Twitter. Everyone who has poultry in their care can help defend the U.S. poultry industry by reviewing the following biosecurity basics. Together, we have made great strides in our preparedness and response capabilities. Protecting American poultry remains a top USDA priority. Biosecurity can stop the disease before it stops.

This includes limiting human access, using personal protective equipment (PPE), and thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting all equipment and facilities. 2. **Vaccination Programs**: Develop a robust vaccination program tailored to the specific health risks associated with your location and bird species. Regularly update vaccinations as necessary to protect against emerging diseases. 3. **Regular Health Monitoring**: Conduct regular health checks on birds, paying attention to signs of illness or stress. Isolate any birds showing symptoms immediately to prevent further spread. 4. **Cleanliness and Sanitation**: Maintain high standards of cleanliness and sanitation throughout the operation, including feeders, waterers, and living areas. Regularly clean and disinfect all surfaces and equipment. 5. **Record-Keeping**: Keep accurate records of bird health, vaccination schedules, and any incidents of disease or illness. This information will be valuable for making informed decisions about future operations and disease control strategies. 6. **Regular Veterinary Care**: Establish a strong relationship with a veterinarian who specializes in poultry health. Regularly schedule check-ups and seek advice on best practices for maintaining bird health and preventing the spread of disease. 7. **Migratory Bird Monitoring**: Stay aware of seasonal migratory patterns in your area and take steps to protect against potential risks, such as using netting or other deterrents to prevent wild birds from accessing your operation. 8. **Public Education**: Educate local residents about the importance of biosecurity and responsible bird ownership practices, especially during times when migratory birds may be present. 9. **Strengthening Fences and Enclosures**: Make sure that fences and enclosures around your operation are secure to prevent wild birds from entering and interacting with commercial or backyard poultry. 10. **Stay Informed**: Stay up-to-date on the latest research, recommendations, and best practices for managing infectious diseases in poultry operations.",5.60E-232,0.023188406,0,0.023188406,0.823354542

(Click to view a larger version) Do you know where your food comes from?  If you can pinpoint where your food was grown and produced, you can make more informed decisions to maximize quality, freshness, and nutritional value.  You can also help support local economies through your purchases.  The USDA Foods program takes this mantra to heart and publishes state of origin with procurement information on all USDA Foods every year.  As we like to say at FNS, ¡°All USDA Foods are local to someone.¡± USDA Foods are 100 percent American grown and produced.  Each year, USDA procures more than 200 types of food, including meat, poultry, fish, fruits, vegetables, flour, cereals, and dairy products, totaling approximately $2 billion.  Organizations such as food banks, disaster and emergency feeding organizations, Indian Tribal Organizations, schools, and other feeding groups receive these USDA Foods for use in meal service or distribution to households through programs like the National School Lunch Program, The Emergency Food Assistance Program, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations. A recent report on the state of origin of USDA Foods found that USDA Foods procures food from more than three-quarters of all states.  California, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Illinois are the five states with the highest dollar amounts of USDA Foods purchases.  A number of items available through USDA Foods are sourced solely from one state.  For example, 100 percent of the strawberries purchased by USDA Foods in FY came from the state of California.  During this time, California schools received approximately 3.3 million pounds of this locally produced product through the USDA Foods program.  All of the wild blueberries came from Maine and all the catfish were purchased from Mississippi. States and schools can use this sourcing information and other purchasing trends available on our website to tailor their USDA Foods purchases accordingly, or they can simply purchase with confidence, knowing that all USDA Foods purchases help strengthen the American economy by supporting a local community somewhere across the country.

The scientific teams and U.S. Forest Service wildlife biologists were conducting bat surveys to test for white-nose syndrome and general bat healthiness throughout the region. This Seminole Bat is a medium-sized bat caught by Gary Libby, an ecologist on the Bat Blitz Team that examined bats to determine levels of health and/or disease conditions, May 22, . The Seminole Bat grows up to four and one-half inches long with a wingspan of up to 12 inches and can weigh up to one-half ounce. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service photo by Porter Libby.

According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the cause of the bat deaths remains unknown despite the continuing search to find the source of this condition by numerous laboratories and state and federal biologists. Each night, 12 teams of five biologists spread out across the forest and surveyed bats in places where they were expected to be feeding. ¡°Because bats are active at night, few people see them, and even fewer understand or appreciate their importance in our daily lives,¡± said Micah Thorning, wildlife biologist for the U.S. Forest Service. ¡°For example, as the primary consumers of flying insects, bats play a crucial role in insect control.¡± The survey netted 246 bats of eight different species with the number of bats caught at one site totaling 57. The most widespread species caught were the Seminole Bat, Evening Bat, Red Bat and Southeastern Bat, but rarer species such as the Tricolored Bat, Big Brown Bat, Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat, and Brazilian Free-tailed Bat were also captured and tested. The event started in with the Southeastern Bat Diversity Network (SBDN) selecting Tennessee to host the first Bat Blitz. SBDN promotes, facilitates and organizes the event every year. The Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat is one of two of its kind caught on found on the Apalachicola National Forest during Bat Blitz, May 22, . The Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat is listed as a sensitive species and is a rare find on the National Forests of Florida.

"Director, SNAP Benefit Redemption Division in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Mar 29,   Last summer, the USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), in collaboration with the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), released  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at Farmers Markets: A How-To-Handbook.  The handbook assists farmers¡¯ market operators and direct marketing farmers in determining the steps necessary to become authorized to participate in SNAP and, subsequently, the steps related to managing participation. It includes tips and on how to make the program work successfully for vendors and customers.  The handbook also features a list of resources, a glossary of important terms, and several case studies from farmers markets that have successfully implemented EBT technology.  AMS¡¯s USDA Farmers¡¯ Market Directory is available online to locate farmers¡¯ markets that accept nutrition assistance program benefits. Collaboration through the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative led the USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS),to co-release, with the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), ""Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at Farmers Markets: A How-To-Handbook."" There are many benefits to making farmers¡¯ markets more accessible to all communities, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet in these hard times.  The concentration of fresh and nutritious foods found at farmers¡¯ markets and sold by direct marketing farmers helps introduce low-income households to a variety of healthy options.  As SNAP clients increase their demand for local produce, small farmers have potential to increase in their customer base.  Our goal here at FNS is to authorize an additional 200 direct marketing farmers and/or farmers¡¯ markets to accept SNAP benefits and increase redemptions nationally by at least $750,000 each year.  We are on our way to reaching these goals.  At the end of Federal Fiscal Year () , according to AMS, a total of 6,132 farmers¡¯ markets were operating around the United States.  This represents a 16 percent rise from .  Of this total, 1,611 farmers¡¯ markets and direct marketing farmers were authorized by FNS and redeemed $7,547,028 in SNAP benefits.  This is a 263 percent increase in the number of authorized farmers and farmers¡¯ markets and a 49 percent increase in SNAP redemptions over the previous five fiscal years. Under regular SNAP rules, EBT equipment is provided free of charge and the expense is shared by the SNAP state agency and FNS.  For farmers¡¯ markets and direct marketing farmers that do not have access to a land line and electricity necessary for the standard equipment to work,  the markets may elect to use manual paper vouchers or purchase wireless equipment through a third party processor.  FNS reimburses states that wish to provide wireless equipment to farmers and markets at the rate of 50 percent of the cost of equipment as part of the administrative cost associated with benefit issuance.  Under a demonstration waiver, FNS allows markets to implement scrip projects that allow a farmers¡¯ market to obtain one FNS authorization to accept SNAP benefits for all eligible vendors at the market by using a single point-of-sale (POS) terminal.  The scrip (paper, tokens or receipts) is purchased at a centrally-located POS terminal that accepts SNAP benefits and is exchanged for eligible food products by participating vendors.  Many markets also use this process for accepting credit and debit cards. FNS has conducted a congressionally-mandated cost benefit analysis to assess the feasibility of equipping all farmers¡¯ markets nationwide with wireless EBT point-of-sale (POS) equipment.  This analysis focuses on requiring centralized operation of a single EBT terminal to issue scrip, as it is the most cost effective way to equip farmers markets and often the most practical way for markets to manage participation.  It is likely that most farmers¡¯ markets will implement SNAP if funding is made available.   President Obama has included a request for $4 million in the budget to support this effort.

"Posted by Written by Katie Yocum, USDA Rural Development in  Initiatives  USDA Results  Technology  Jun 11,  While the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma is rich in cultural pride, identity and history, its remote location in the rugged terrain of Southeast Oklahoma has severely limited the tribe¡¯s economic development efforts.  But a Broadband Initiative Program grant, made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, will enable Pine Telephone Company (PTC) to use innovative wireless technology to deliver affordable broadband service to portions of this rural, remote and economically disadvantaged region in Southeast Oklahoma. During World War II, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma provided an invaluable service to the United States by pioneering the use of Code Talking, using the native Choctaw language, to prevent enemy forces from intercepting the transmission of army secrets. And in , the Choctaw Nation was awarded the Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award, the highest recognition of support of employees who serve in the National Guard and Reserve.  So while the Choctaw Nation has shown outstanding compassion for the nation and its tribal members, the local economies of Choctaw communities have suffered tremendously.  Of the five counties on tribal lands that will be served by PTC, all of them are plagued with unemployment rates that soar above the state average and a substantial proportion of residents living below the poverty line. PTC spent years testing broadband technologies that would offer reliable internet service to residents of this remote region, and they determined that advanced 3G technology presents the most viable solution. The system is designed to be scalable and to cost-effectively accommodate technology upgrades, so that it will remain viable for years to come. PTC¡¯s system will offer service to nearly 5,000 households, 10 school districts, and 12 volunteer fire departments and ambulance services. With reliable, high speed wireless access, the region will be able to overcome their geographic isolation to stimulate the sustainable economic growth that it needs.  And offering quality internet access to key community institutions, like schools and public safety bodies, will mean better educational opportunities and enhanced health care and public safety for residents of this region. And in addition to the many benefits to be reaped by members of the Choctaw Nation, this Recovery Act project will also create more than 150 jobs over the multi-year construction period.

"APHIS Pleased With Animal Evacuations At Two Flood-Ravaged North Dakota Zoos  In late May, two zoos in central North Dakota were hit hard by flooding.  The disaster prompted the need for a swift evacuation of the animals.  In Bismarck, the Missouri River threatened to submerge the Dakota Zoo and its 500+ animals under as much as seven feet of water, and in Minot the Roosevelt Park Zoo was a potential target of the rising Souris River, which runs directly through the city. During the height of the flooding, APHIS¡¯ Animal Care Program monitored coming from the zoos and kept abreast of river levels.  Inspector Amy Jirsa-Smith contacted zoo officials regularly.

"Obama Administration Launches Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture  From record droughts in Kansas to deadly wildfires in California, the United States is feeling the effects of climate change. These same conditions have a dire impact across the developing world, especially for poor, rural smallholder farmers whose very lives are threatened every time the rains arrive late, the floods rush in, or the temperature soars. By , the world¡¯s population is expected to reach nine billion people. Feeding them will require at least a 60 percent increase in agricultural production. There is no greater challenge to meeting this need than climate change. It poses a range of unprecedented threats to the livelihoods of the world¡¯s most vulnerable people and to the very planet that sustains us. In order to ensure that hundreds of millions of people are not born into a debilitating cycle of under-nutrition and hunger, we must address the urgent threat that climate change poses.  Secretary of State John Kerry, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Dr. Rajiv ""Raj"" Shah, Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development  Posted in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Sep 24,   6 Responses",How can addressing climate change be crucial in breaking a debilitating cycle of under-nutrition and hunger for millions of people worldwide?,"Addressing climate change is crucial in breaking the cycle of under-nutrition and hunger because it poses a range of unprecedented threats to agricultural production, which must increase by at least 60% to feed a growing global population.","Addressing climate change is crucial in breaking a debilitating cycle of under-nutrition and hunger for millions of people worldwide because climate change affects food availability, access, utilization, and stability, ultimately impacting nutrition and hunger levels. Here's how: 1. **Impacts agricultural productivity**: Climate change alters temperature and precipitation patterns, leading to droughts, floods, and extreme weather events that can damage or destroy crops. This reduction in crop yields reduces the availability of nutritious food for millions of people. 2. **Affects access to food**: Changes in climate lead to increased competition for resources such as land, water, and energy, making it difficult for small-scale farmers and vulnerable communities to access and afford nutritious food. 3. **Impacts nutrition quality**: Climate change can alter the nutritional value of crops due to changes in soil quality, water availability, and temperature fluctuations. This can lead to a decrease in essential micronutrients like iron, zinc, and vitamin A, which are critical for human health. 4. **Increases migration and displacement**: As climate-related disasters become more frequent and severe, people may be forced to migrate from their homes and communities, disrupting access to food and leading to increased hunger and malnutrition. 5. **Exacerbates existing inequalities**: Climate change disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations, including women, children, and marginalized groups, who often have limited access to resources, information, and decision-making power. By addressing climate change through measures such as: 1. **Transitioning to more resilient agricultural practices** (e.g., agroforestry, conservation agriculture) 2. **Promoting climate-resilient food systems** 3. **Supporting climate education and awareness-raising** 4. **Implementing climate policies and regulations** 5. **Investing in climate-related infrastructure** we can help break the debilitating cycle of under-nutrition and hunger for millions of people worldwide. In summary, addressing climate change is crucial to breaking a cycle of under-nutrition and hunger because it has significant impacts on agricultural productivity, access to food, nutrition quality, migration, and existing inequalities. By taking action to mitigate and adapt to climate change, we can create more resilient food systems that ensure everyone's right to nutritious food and good health.",0.035932163,0.139534884,0.077922078,0.11369509,0.845223188

It only mentions that they made ""conservation improvements"" to put conservation systems to work on their farms, ranches, and forests, but it does not specify what those improvements were.","Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, landowners in the Gulf region have implemented various conservation practices to restore habitats and increase the resilience of their lands. Some specific practices include: 1. **Wetland restoration**: Landowners have restored or enhanced wetlands on their properties through the creation of shallow pools and the replanting of native vegetation such as cordgrass, salt marshes, and mangroves. These areas provide essential habitat for birds, fish, and other wildlife. 2. **Beach nourishment**: Beach nourishment involves pumping sand onto eroded beaches to restore them to their pre-spill condition. This helps protect coastal ecosystems and supports the recovery of beach-dwelling species such as sea turtles and shorebirds. 3. **Dune restoration**: Landowners have planted native vegetation such as beach grasses, dunes, and shrubs on eroded dunes to stabilize the sand and prevent further erosion. These restored dunes provide habitat for wildlife and help protect against storms and sea-level rise. 4. **Shellfish reef restoration**: Shellfish reefs have been restored in areas where they were damaged by the oil spill. These reefs provide essential habitat for commercial and recreational fisheries, as well as supporting water quality and shoreline stabilization. 5. **Native plant reforestation**: Landowners have replanted native vegetation on their properties to restore forests and promote biodiversity. This helps to improve soil health, reduce erosion, and increase the resilience of these ecosystems. 6. **Fish-friendly habitat restoration**: Fish-friendly habitats such as mangrove and marsh areas have been restored or enhanced to provide critical breeding, spawning, and nursery grounds for fish species. 7. **Soil remediation**: Some landowners have implemented soil remediation practices to address oil contamination on their properties. These practices include bioremediation using microorganisms that break down oil, as well as physical and chemical methods of cleanup. 8. **Watershed management**: Landowners have implemented watershed management strategies such as buffer strips and terracing to reduce sediment runoff and improve water quality in local watersheds. These conservation practices have been implemented through a combination of government-led initiatives (e.g., the Natural Resources Damage Assessment process) and voluntary efforts by landowners, NGOs, and other stakeholders.

At USDA, we understand the value of research, and by providing resources to get things started at the local level, we often see amazing results that have positive impact for farmers, agribusinesses and consumers across the country. The Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program (FSMIP), administered by USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service, is one of the many ways that USDA makes an investment in the future of agriculture.  Funding practical research projects that focus on innovation and collaboration, FSMIP¡¯s diverse projects reflect the unique marketing challenges and opportunities faced by different agribusiness sectors, local communities and regions.  Sometimes, by solving a specific problem within their state or local area, grant recipients end up addressing issues that have national or industry-wide impact. With the support of FSMIP funds in and , the California Association of Food Banks (CAFB), in partnership with the California Department of Food and Agriculture, was able to dramatically expand its Farm to Family program.  Among several positive outcomes was a pilot project to help food banks access nutrient-dense row crops. Crops like broccoli, cauliflower, and celery are often sorted and separated right in the harvest field.  Products that do not meet supermarket grade are usually left in the field and tilled under.  CAFB worked with two major growers to harvest cull products, providing a steady source of high nutrient vegetables to food banks.  Since the project¡¯s inception, people in need have enjoyed over 8 million pounds of these crops, and food banks now have a regular, permanent supply of nutrient-dense row crops.  This project provides a model for other states seeking to provide a new market for produce growers while meeting a vital food need. A young girl in front of food donations in Oakland, California.

Photo courtesy Alameda County Community Food Bank With FSMIP funding, the Ohio Direct Marketing Team led by Ohio State University used surveys and case studies to evaluate the current marketing strategies and practices of Ohio food producers.  The goal was to determine if and how a web-based marketing system called MarketMaker improved the effectiveness of their marketing efforts.  MarketMaker is currently one of the most extensive collections of searchable food industry related in the country and contains over 400,000 profiles of farmers and other food related enterprises in 19 states and the District of Columbia. This investment continues to benefit Ohio food producers in numerous ways.  The FSMIP study was the first step in developing standardized protocols to evaluate the contribution of marketing tools on reducing transaction costs and leveling the playing field for local food enterprises on a national level. As a result, the Ohio Direct Marketing Team attracted additional funding to develop training modules such as MarketReady to prepare producers to enter new markets.  They also held ¡°Meet the Buyers¡± forums to bring buyers and sellers together for targeted sales meetings, and developed maps, apps & mobile media marketing tools to help consumers find producers. In , the number of registered producers and users of Ohio MarketMaker increased significantly.  There were more than 5,000 visitors and 679 registered producers by the end of the year.  In , Ohio was one of two states recognized with the first National Food MarketMaker Innovation Awards, sponsored by Farm Credit.  Building on strong food industry partnerships, the ¡°Get Connected¡± campaign engaged new organizations through customized promotional and educational materials. As a result, the number of registered MarketMaker users nearly doubled from to . The creation of ¡°Get Connected¡± artwork and marketing resources will benefit the entire national MarketMaker network of states. There are many other tales of innovative and collaborative FSMIP projects, and this year¡¯s projects are no different.  More than half of the 22 projects focus on increasing sales of meat products, aquaculture products, and fresh and processed produce in local and regional food systems. Other research topics include forestry, bioenergy and horticulture.

"Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiative Coordinator, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Nov 03,  Lesser prairie-chickens benefit from lands where a rancher is using prescribed grazing, according to a new report. Photo courtesy of Nick Richter. Habitat conservation practices make a difference for lesser prairie-chickens. That's the finding of a recent scientific study ¨C the first part of a multi-year study ¨C described in a new report from the Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiative (LPCI). LPCI, led by USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), works with partner organizations and ranchers to improve habitat and address threats to the bird. Since , more than 1 million acres of habitat have been restored on working lands. NRCS works with partners to monitor the outcomes, which helps determine if conservation practices are making a difference, but accurately estimating wildlife populations can be challenging with uncommon, widely dispersed species like the lesser prairie-chicken. A recent study identified a new model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, and it shows encouraging evidence that NRCS-recommended conservation practices through LPCI are working and that large blocks of intact prairie are important to prairie-chicken conservation. The study assessed one year of from the annual aerial survey of lesser prairie-chicken lek sites conducted by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and it looked at four factors that might impact site occupancy ¡ª patch size of native vegetation, percent of land cover managed with prescribed grazing; percent of land cover enrolled in USDA¡¯s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); and density of primary roads. The research team intends to continue with a multi-year study that assesses additional variables. As the amount of land enrolled in CRP or using prescribed grazing increases, the likelihood that lesser prairie-chickens will occupy that land also increases. Lesser prairie-chickens face many threats, including habitat loss and fragmentation from row-crop agriculture, fire suppression, unmanaged grazing, development, and drought. The species currently occupies just 16 percent of its historic range. But in western Kansas, lesser prairie-chickens have reoccupied portions of their historical range and have even moved into areas outside that historical range. The range expansion coincides with former croplands enrolled and maintained as grasslands through CRP as well as native grasslands managed using LPCI prescribed grazing practices. A team of researchers tested whether there was a quantifiable link between land where ranchers are implementing LPCI prescribed grazing plans or have enrolled their land in CRP and the likelihood of prairie-chickens occupying a landscape. Their results indicate that these habitat conservation efforts are working. After developing an expanded model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, the team found that occupancy increases as prairie patch-size increases, as well as in landscapes with ongoing conservation practices. Specifically, the results indicate that when ranchers are using prescribed grazing or enrolling land in CRP, the likelihood of lesser prairie-chickens occupying that habitat increases significantly. The report¡¯s management recommendations include: Enrolling acreage within the lesser prairie-chicken active range in prescribed grazing or CRP. Maintaining large blocks of native prairie across the range through sustainable ranching. Identifying potential landscapes with willing landowners to develop conservation easements, particularly if combined with prescribed grazing and other proven habitat conservation practices. Implementing prescribed grazing on dispersed patches throughout large blocks of rangeland. Cultivating diverse stands of CRP-enrolled grasslands that serve as connective tissue to larger patches of native prairie. Retaining CRP acreage as grasslands after contract expiration. NRCS outlined its three-year conservation strategy for lesser prairie-chicken conservation, which encourages adoption of many of the above recommendations on 500,000 additional acres, such as prescribed grazing, using easements to protect key habitat corridors, and providing assistance to convert expiring CRP lands to grazing.

"New Study Offers Sage Advice  For many, one of the New Year¡¯s first big chores is to remove a tree from inside their home. Trees, beautiful and useful as they are, do not belong everywhere. Such is the case with trees and other woody species that are expanding into the Western grasslands. Over the years, woody species like juniper, pinyon pine, redcedar and mesquite have encroached on grassland and sagebrush ecosystems, altering these landscapes and making them unsuitable for native wildlife like the lesser prairie-chicken and greater sage-grouse. Encroaching conifers also degrade rangelands for agricultural producers whose livestock rely on nutritious forage.  Spencer Miller, Natural Resources Conservation Service  Posted in  Conservation  Jan 18,   3 Responses",What is the impact of encroaching conifers and mesquite trees on Western grasslands?,"The impact of encroaching conifers (such as juniper, pinyon pine, and redcedar) and mesquite trees on Western grasslands is that they alter these landscapes, making them unsuitable for native wildlife and degrading rangelands for agricultural producers.","The impact of encroaching conifers (such as pine, fir, and spruce) and mesquite trees on Western grasslands is significant and far-reaching. Here are some of the main effects: **Ecological Changes** 1. **Loss of native grasses**: Conifers and mesquite trees shade out and compete with native grasses for water and nutrients, leading to a decline in their populations. 2. **Habitat fragmentation**: The growth of conifers and mesquite creates dense thickets that isolate small areas of native vegetation, making it difficult for wildlife to move through the landscape. 3. **Reduced biodiversity**: As native grasses disappear, so do the animals that rely on them for food and shelter. **Climatic Changes** 1. **Increased fire risk**: The buildup of fuels (such as dead leaves and branches) under coniferous canopies creates a high risk of catastrophic wildfires. 2. **Altered hydrology**: The growth of mesquite trees changes the water cycle, leading to reduced soil moisture and increased evapotranspiration. **Economic Impacts** 1. **Loss of forage and grazing land**: As native grasses decline, so does the quality and quantity of forage available for livestock. 2. **Decreased recreational value**: The encroachment of conifers and mesquite can make Western grasslands less attractive to outdoor enthusiasts, such as hunters, hikers, and campers. **Social Impacts** 1. **Cultural heritage loss**: The transformation of native grasslands into dense woodlands can erase the cultural heritage and traditional knowledge of Native American communities. 2. **Community values affected**: Changes in land use and ecosystem function can impact local economies, community cohesion, and overall quality of life. **Management Challenges** 1. **Restoration and management costs**: Efforts to restore native grasses and control invasive conifers and mesquite require significant financial resources. 2. **Coordination among stakeholders**: Effective management requires collaboration among landowners, managers, scientists, and local communities. The combined effects of encroaching conifers and mesquite trees on Western grasslands pose significant ecological, climatic, economic, social, and management challenges.",0.040460966,0.151603499,0.070381232,0.134110787,0.851290703
"Chief, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Sep 22,  Utah rancher Bill Kennedy worked with NRCS through SGI to improve his working rangelands for sage grouse and livestock. Photo by Jesse Bussard. This past April, we woke up at 3 a.m. and made our way to a blind amid an expanse of sagebrush on a ranch in central Montana. When the sun rose that morning, I saw my first sage grouse--actually, I got to see more than 100 of them!--when the birds arrived at the lek site for their famous tail-shaking springtime courtship dance. Seeing sage grouse in action reminded me how important it is to do what we do here at USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). I saw firsthand how agriculture and wildlife can co-exist and thrive. In the West, we work with over 1,300 ranchers through the NRCS-led Sage Grouse Initiative (SGI) to improve their ranching operations while also helping this iconic bird. It¡¯s been a big year for sage grouse. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) determined last year that the species didn¡¯t merit protections under the Endangered Species Act because of the collaborative conservation efforts underway to help the species. Central to that effort were ranchers, who have stepped forward for many years to make a difference. But last year¡¯s decision did not mean we slowed down our conservation work through SGI. We¡¯re here for the long haul, building on previous successes by implementing our Sage Grouse Initiative 2.rategy, which will conserve an estimated 8 million acres of sagebrush¡ªalong with 350+ species that depend on it--by . Sage grouse are an ¡°umbrella species¡± and an icon of the Western range. When ranchers implement conservation practices that benefit sage grouse, those practices also benefit 350-plus sagebrush-dependent species. Photo by Tatiana Gettelman. With the help of conservation partners, NRCS has conserved 5 million acres of sagebrush rangeland and reduced threats to sage grouse. In the past six years, SGI and ranchers have: Reduced the threat of invasive grasses and wildfire by managing for healthier rangelands on 1.8 million acres. Removed 457,000 acres of expanding conifer to reclaim core sage grouse habitat. Protected 451,000 acres of agricultural land and prime wildlife habitat for 350-plus sagebrush-dependent species. Improved grazing strategies to enhance range habitat on more than 2.7 million acres for sage grouse and other wildlife species. Conserved 12,000 acres and improved 179 acres of wet meadow and riparian areas for brooding hens. Marked or moved 628 miles of high-risk fences to reduce sage grouse collisions by 83 percent. We continue to fine-tune our conservation efforts through science and research. In the past year, we¡¯ve documented how removing encroaching juniper to restore sagebrush benefits songbirds as well as sage grouse. We¡¯ve also studied how and where to reduce the risk of converting sagebrush into cultivated cropland, which we made available on the new SGI Interactive Web Application. This new online mapping tool provides free on rangewide conditions, helping NRCS conservationists and partners plan and prioritize conservation projects. Plus, we now use our successful efforts in sagebrush country as a model for the rest of the country. We are applying what we¡¯ve learned to other priority species and landscapes to replicate success through Working Lands for Wildlife (WLFW). The future of wildlife, agriculture and rural ways of life depend on this shining model of collaborative conservation.

"Branch Chief, Farmers Market and Direct Market Research Branch, AMS in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Dec 17,  Shed Two at Detroit¡¯s Eastern Market Look up Wayne County, Michigan, home to Detroit, in USDA¡¯s Food Environment Atlas and it is obvious that local residents have some significant challenges in accessing healthful food.  An alarmingly high number of households that lack a car in Wayne County are located further than one mile from the closest grocery store, meaning that many families struggle to get access to fresh and healthy food.   Indeed, the closure of two supermarkets in left Detroit as the largest city in the country without a single full-service supermarket within its boundaries. A recent study indicates that over half a million of Detroit¡¯s residents live in neighborhoods where they must travel twice as far to reach a grocery store than they do to reach a convenience store. As a result, many families are forced to buy their meals at these convenience stores, where microwavable pre-prepared meals and fast food are well-stocked, and fresh and healthy foods are often hard to find. Detroit, in other words, is a food desert. But, there is good news! Eastern Market Corporation, one of the nation¡¯s longest operating public markets has taken on the challenge of addressing Detroit¡¯s significant food access issues. Eastern Market has developed a comprehensive ¡°food hub,¡±  coordinating aggregation and distribution for many of Michigan¡¯s small and mid-size farmers who are producing the healthy food that Motor City residents need and want.  With nearly 500,000 of Wayne County¡¯s 1.9 million residents relying on SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) for their food purchases, the market director knew that it was important to ensure that his organization could process SNAP benefits. Today, Eastern Market processes up to $30,000 of SNAP transactions per month.  What¡¯s more, SNAP benefits redeemed at Eastern Market are doubled for each participating household with the support of the Fair Food Network, an organization that provides a financial match to SNAP redemptions through its Double Up Food Bucks program. As part of the USDA¡¯s interest in examining  how actively coordinated food hubs can play an important role in eradicating food deserts, USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service has partnered with Eastern Market through a cooperative research agreement to expand the availability of fresh, healthful  and locally-produced food throughout Detroit.  Our to-do list includes: Developing more direct-to-consumer marketing activities in neighborhoods challenged by poor public transportation systems; Training farm vendors  about emerging opportunities for direct-to-consumer sales in food desert neighborhoods; Facilitating deliveries between the region¡¯s local growers and organizations who are dedicated to distributing fresh, healthful food directly to Detroit¡¯s neighborhoods in need; and, Educating local residents about available nutrition assistance programs and emerging market outlets. As a food hub, Eastern Market is uniquely positioned to serve all people in Detroit while economic benefits to local farmers, ranchers, and dairies.  Eastern Market and its member tenants provide a bevy of wholesale services that open new markets for the region¡¯s small and midsize producers¡ªincluding aggregation, distribution, processing and commercial market opportunities.  Eastern Market also houses prepared food businesses (like ravioli and fresh salsa).  They¡¯re even planning to redevelop a full square mile in a dedicated economic development district to bring in additional business incubators, restaurants, retailers, wholesale services and a distribution center ¨C all designed to help rebuild southeast Michigan¡¯s regional food system and eliminate Detroit¡¯s food access problems. By integrating all of these diverse business functions into one centralized, coordinated regional ¡°food hub,¡± Eastern Market¡¯s business development model can be expected to bring good things to Detroit.

These programs work together to provide a safety net for vulnerable Americans by: * Supporting access to nutritious food through SNAP and school meal programs * Promoting local agriculture through FMPP, NSLP/SBP, and CFP * Enhancing food security and nutrition education through the Gus Schumacher Food and Agriculture Service Learning Program These USDA initiatives demonstrate a comprehensive approach to addressing both hunger and food insecurity, while also supporting local farmers and rural communities.",5.37E-232,0.036630037,0.014760148,0.036630037,0.830201805
"Got Weeds? Need to hold water in the soil? Mulch can help with these things and more. Mulching is one of the simplest and most beneficial practices you can use in the garden. Mulch is simply a protective layer of a material that is spread on top of the soil. Mulches can either be organic -- such as grass clippings, straw, bark chips, and similar materials -- or inorganic -- such as stones, brick chips, and plastic. Both organic and inorganic mulches have numerous benefits. Mulch helps conserve and extend available water, protects the soil from erosion, reduces competition by suppressing weeds, moderates temperature extremes, and acts as a barrier or visible marker of gardening beds to limit damage by landscape maintenance equipment. Understanding when, what type and how much mulch to spread is important because spreading too much mulch can be damaging to trees and plants.

Include 2-3 parts ¡°brown material¡± (fall leaves, twigs, shredded newspaper, straw, wood chips, and shredded wood) and 1 part ¡°green material¡± (vegetable and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, crushed eggshells, garden and grass clippings, tea bags without staples) by volume then add water to keep moist. Don¡¯t forget to turn your pile! A monthly rotation is a good rule of thumb. Worm Composting Setup:  Select Container. Purchase a worm bin or make your own from a plastic or wood storage container. Worm bins require holes drilled for aeration and drainage. There are several online sources with instructions to create a worm bin.  Locate bin. The ideal temperature for worm composting is 59-77 degrees F. The bin can be kept indoors or outdoors in the shade. During colder months, insulate the worm bin with blankets, straw, or other material to keep it warm.  Worm Bin Setup:  Worms need bedding such as a mixture of non-glossy paper, cardboard, or leaves. Soak the material for 10 minutes, wring out the water so it is moist but not saturated, and place it in the bin with a handful of soil.  Now you are ready to add your worms. There are over 9,000 species of earthworms, but only 7 are suitable for vermicomposting. The most widely used species is the ¡°red wiggler¡± which you can buy from a worm grower. Do not use worms from a bait shop or your garden since they will not be able to thrive in your worm bin.  Feed your worms veggie and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, eggshells, and moistened bread. Avoid meat, fish, dairy products, citrus fruits, twigs and branches.

Considering these differences, both methods are suitable for reducing food waste. However, vermicomposting is more ideal for homeowners who: * Have limited outdoor space * Want to reduce odors and pests associated with traditional composting * Can maintain a consistent temperature in their worm bin * Are willing to invest time and effort in managing the worms and their diet For homeowners looking to reduce food waste, either method can be effective. However, if you're short on outdoor space or prefer a more hands-off approach, vermicomposting might be the better choice.","**Backyard Composting vs. Vermicomposting (Worm Composting): Key Differences** 1. **Process:** Backyard composting involves decomposing organic materials like leaves, grass clippings, and kitchen scraps using microorganisms like bacteria and fungi. In contrast, vermicomposting relies on worms to break down food waste into a nutrient-rich compost. 2. **Location:** Backyard composting requires a designated area outdoors, often in a corner of the yard or attached to the home. Vermicomposting can be done indoors or outdoors, but it typically uses a worm bin that is more compact and odor-free. 3. **Materials:** Backyard composting accepts a broader range of materials, including meat, bones, and oils. Vermicomposting primarily focuses on vegetable scraps, fruit peels, coffee grounds, tea bags, and other organic waste. 4. **Maintenance:** Backyard composting often requires more maintenance, such as turning the pile regularly to ensure adequate aeration and decomposition. Vermicomposting is relatively low-maintenance, with worms doing most of the work. 5. **Resulting Compost:** The resulting compost from backyard composting can be coarser and have a higher carbon-to-nitrogen ratio compared to vermicomposting compost. **Suitability for Homeowners** Considering these differences, vermicomposting (worm composting) is often more suitable for homeowners looking to reduce their food waste. Here's why: * **Space:** Vermicomposting requires less space and can be done indoors or outdoors, making it ideal for small backyards or urban areas. * **Odor Control:** Worms are efficient at breaking down organic matter, minimizing unpleasant odors and messes. * **Year-Round Composting:** Vermicomposting can operate year-round, regardless of temperature fluctuations or seasonal changes in food waste generation. * **Nutrient-Rich Compost:** The compost produced through vermicomposting is rich in nutrients, making it an excellent natural fertilizer for gardens and indoor plants. By choosing the right method, homeowners can efficiently manage their food waste, reduce environmental impact, and create a nutrient-rich compost for their garden or indoor plants.",0.035114397,0.408695652,0.122270742,0.191304348,0.86792618
"Southwest Regional Assistant WIC Director in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Sep 21,  Claudia Crow, a farmer from Shawnee, OK, assists a customer during the Pottowatomie County Famers Market Five-Year Anniversary.  In the hustle and bustle of working for the WIC program in the Southwest Region, I travel quite often, attending meetings and ensuring logistics much like many of my fellow federal and state co-workers. Recently I had the privilege to attend the Pottawatomie County Farmers Market five-year anniversary in Shawnee, OK. Having grown up in a very rural town, representing FNS was a learning experience that reminded me of home. The event was a total success, as the market was full of people including farmers, seniors, families and children. Celebrating five years of service, the event included live music, family and children¡¯s activities, and most important of all: fresh fruit and vegetables. I learned that famers drive hours to sell their crops at the market, and it accounts for as much as over two-thirds of their income. Most farmers market customers swear by the produce bought there, as it is much fresher and lasts longer than normal store-bought produce. In some cases, supermarket produce makes a week-long journey of over 1,500 miles before getting into the kitchen. But the most important part was seeing FNS programs like WIC and SNAP EBT represented. All of the farmers were knowledgeable about Farm to School and Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food, and have even started farm tours for children and have working relationships with local schools. Getting fresh vegetables in school cafeterias straight from the farm is great on so many levels! Observing our partnerships at the grassroots stage from farmer to a customer, or farmer to a school sets a tone for the whole region. The relationships I see built are ones that last for years, and I wish the Farmers Market all the best in their future endeavors. Here¡¯s to another five years of successful farming and selling!

"Cover Crops Cover crops are traditionally planted on farms but can be used in gardens. A cover crop is any crop grown to cover the soil and may be incorporated into the soil later for enrichment. Planting cover crops in your garden provides multiple benefits such as controlling erosion, suppressing weeds, reducing soil compaction, increasing moisture and nutrient content of soil, improving yield potential, attracting pollinators, and providing habitat for beneficial insects and wildlife as well as food to animals. Cover crops (grasses, legumes and forbs) recommended for seasonal cover and other conservation purposes include annual ryegrass, oilseed radish, winter cereal rye, and oats used for scavenging unused fertilizer and releasing nutrients back into the soil for the next crop to use. Good cover crops to break up compacted soils are forage radish (also known as oilseed radish) and forage turnip. Similar to commercial nitrogen (N) fertilizers, legume cover crops like crimson clover, hairy vetch and Austrian winter pea can help ¡°grow¡± some of your N needs. Crop Rotation It has long been a common practice for farmers to vary the crops grown in each field from year to year. This same practice of rotating crops can be applied to small-scale food gardens. Make a plan to grow certain plant families in one area of the garden this season and in a different area next season. For crop rotation to be most effective, don¡¯t plant an area with vegetables from the same plant family more than once every three to four years. Rotating crops can have important production benefits such as increasing yields, improving nutrients and organic matter in the soil, and it can help disrupt the lifecycle of crop pests, reducing chemical use. Don¡¯t forget to add a cover crop to your rotation ¨Cespecially when the garden is fallow ¨Cto reduce soil erosion and improve wildlife habitat.

It also acts as a nurse crop, providing shade for young plants and suppressing weeds. 2. **Oats (Avena sativa)**: Oats are another excellent option for breaking up compacted soils, with their extensive root system and ability to grow well in wet conditions. They also provide a good source of nitrogen and carbon for the soil. 3. **Hairy vetch (Vicia villosa)**: Hairy vetch is a legume that can fix nitrogen from the air, making it an excellent choice for scavenging unused fertilizer. It also has a deep taproot, which helps break up compacted soils and improve soil structure. 4. **Winter rye and hairy vetch mix**: Planting a mix of winter rye and hairy vetch can provide a synergistic effect, with the rye helping to break up compacted soils and the vetch fixing nitrogen and adding organic matter. 5. **Radish (Raphanus sativus)**: Radishes are excellent for breaking up compacted soils due to their rapid growth rate and extensive root system. They also provide a good source of nutrients, such as phosphorus and potassium. 6. **Hemp (Cannabis sativa)**: Hemp is a versatile crop that can be used for multiple purposes, including breaking up compacted soils and providing nutrient benefits. It has a deep taproot and produces a high-quality biomass that can be used as a natural fertilizer. 7. **Clover (Trifolium spp.)**: White clover or red clover are both excellent choices for scavenging unused fertilizer due to their ability to fix nitrogen from the air. They also have a shallow root system, which helps break up compacted soils and improve soil structure. These cover crops can be incorporated into your farming practices to improve soil health, increase crop yields, and reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers.",0.01632407,0.215938303,0.072351421,0.118251928,0.842391908

"Posted by the Food Safety Research Information Office, National Agricultural Library in  Health and Safety  USDA Results  Jul 29,  USDA¡¯s National Agricultural Library launches its latest Web exhibit ¡°How Did We Can?¡± on home canning in the United States. July is the height of summer grilling season, and throughout the month USDA is highlighting changes made to the U.S. food safety system over the course of this Administration. For an interactive look at USDA¡¯s work to ensure your food is safe, visit the USDA Results project on Medium.com and read Chapter Seven: Safer Food and Greater Consumer Confidence. The USDA¡¯s National Agricultural Library (NAL) recently launched its newest online exhibit, ¡°How Did We Can? ¡ªThe Evolution of Home Canning Practices.¡± The exhibit follows the evolution of home canning in the United States and the progression of associated food safety . Canning aids in food preservation by removing microorganisms responsible for decay through heating and creating a seal to prevent recontamination. Home canning held an important role in 20th century food preservation, particularly through the two World Wars, and continues to be practiced today. ¡°How Did We Can?¡± highlights changes in home canning based on a growing understanding of bacteriology. Around the turn of the 20th century, the four most prominent canning techniques were oven, open-kettle, water bath, and pressure canning. By the end of World War II, the USDA recommended only two techniques: water bath for high-acid foods and pressure canning for low-acid foods. Those recommendations remain the same under the current USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning. During World War I and World War II, canning was touted as being imperative to the war effort on the home front and was referred to as ¡°a real war job¡± in a Office of War Information poster. Home canning peaked during World War II when over four billion cans were processed in . While home canning has never since reached such a height, it continues to thrive today among home food preservation enthusiasts.

"High-Tech Agriculture Continues to Reap Rewards for Farmers and Society  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA¡¯s rich science and research portfolio. Just like a smart phone helps users learn, communicate and make important decisions, smart technology¡ªknown as precision agriculture¡ªhelps farmers know and apply critical information about the right investments in fertilizer, seed, pesticide and water needed to produce their crops. Through new technologies, farmers produce more efficiently and see an increase in profits while improving stewardship of ecosystems and local communities. To talk about precision agriculture is to talk about mapping the amount of a crop grown per acre (yield) or the types of soils in a given area. It also includes the technology that automatically guides farm machines and controls variables like the rates of seeds, fertilizers or chemicals.

Here are some specific examples: **Fertilizer Investments:** 1. **Variable Rate Application (VRA)**: PA allows for the precise application of fertilizers based on soil type, crop stage, and nutrient requirements. This approach minimizes waste and maximizes efficiency. 2. **Soil Sensors**: Soil sensors can detect nutrient deficiencies or excesses, enabling farmers to adjust fertilizer applications accordingly. 3. **Precision Fertilizer Management (PFM)**: PFM systems use data from PA technologies like satellite imaging, drones, or soil sampling to optimize fertilizer application rates and timing. **Seed Investments:** 1. **Genetic Analysis**: PA enables the analysis of seed traits, such as disease resistance or drought tolerance, to select the most suitable varieties for specific growing conditions. 2. **Precision Planting**: This technology uses sensors or GPS-guided planters to place seeds at optimal spacing and depth, reducing waste and improving germination rates. **Chemical Investments:** 1. **Variable Rate Application (VRA) of Pesticides**: PA technologies can guide the precise application of pesticides based on crop stage, pest density, and weather conditions. 2. **Precision Weed Management**: PA enables farmers to identify weed species, estimate densities, and apply targeted herbicide applications, reducing chemical usage. To promote efficient crop production, improve stewardship of ecosystems, and increase farmer profits, investments in fertilizer, seed, and chemicals should be guided by: 1. **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: Using data from PA technologies, such as satellite imaging, drones, or soil sensors, to inform decision-making. 2. **Integrating Multiple Technologies**: Combining different PA tools, like VRA and precision planting, to optimize crop production and reduce environmental impact. 3. **Farm-Scale Monitoring**: Implementing monitoring systems at the farm scale to track fertilizer, seed, and chemical usage, as well as crop yields and soil health. By adopting these strategies, farmers can: * Optimize resource usage (e.g., fertilizers, seeds, chemicals) * Improve crop yields and quality * Reduce environmental impact (e.g., water pollution, soil degradation) * Increase profit margins through efficient production methods",5.66E-232,0.018292683,0.006134969,0.018292683,0.787732124

"US Forest Service Mobilizes to Save Cavity Birds  Small owls, such as western screech and northern saw whet owls, weigh between 3 and 7 ounces, or about the same weight as a small cell phone or a deck of cards. They prefer dark, narrow spaces for nesting and roosting, which is why they are called cavity birds. Their habitat preferences make them prone to using man-made features, such as open pipes, that mimic their natural nesting and roosting cavities. But on some public lands, that natural act of finding habitat in ventilation pipes has led to their death.

Here are some possible insights: 1. **Vulnerability and humility**: Venturing into the wilderness without support or guidance exposes you to the uncertainties of nature. This vulnerability can foster a sense of humility, as you confront your own limitations and dependence on external resources. 2. **Self-reliance and resourcefulness**: In the absence of external help, you must rely on yourself to navigate the terrain, find food and shelter, and deal with emergencies. This experience can highlight your ability to adapt, think critically, and take responsibility for your actions. 3. **Connection with nature**: Alone in the wilderness, you develop a deeper appreciation for the natural world. You may notice patterns, observe wildlife, or experience the beauty of untouched landscapes. This connection can instill a sense of awe, respect, and gratitude for the intricate web of life. 4. **Emotional resilience**: Wilderness travel often presents unexpected challenges, such as inclement weather, injuries, or encounters with wildlife. These experiences can help you build emotional resilience, learn to cope with uncertainty, and develop a growth mindset. 5. **Interdependence and social connections**: Despite venturing alone, your experience may lead you to reflect on the importance of interdependence and social connections. You might realize that even in solitude, your actions impact others (e.g., fellow travelers, park rangers) or consider how your relationships with others support your personal growth. 6. **Perspective on life's priorities**: Being immersed in nature can prompt introspection about what truly matters to you. As you confront the simplicity and beauty of wilderness living, you may reassess your values and priorities, recognizing that some aspects of modern life are not essential to your well-being or happiness. 7. **Resilience and adaptability in adversity**: Wilderness travel without support requires flexibility and resourcefulness in the face of adversity. This experience can help you develop coping strategies for navigating challenges, build confidence in your ability to overcome obstacles, and appreciate the value of perseverance. Entering wilderness alone and unsupported reveals that one's place in the world is not static or defined solely by external circumstances. Instead, it highlights the complexities of human nature, our capacity for growth and learning, and our interconnectedness with the natural world.",0.015674269,0.054862843,0.035087719,0.049875312,0.815629363
"Born to Pack: Second-Generation Mule Packer Turns Love of Animals and the Great Outdoors into an Exciting Career  Lee Roeser was born to be a mule packer.

"AMS Administrator in  Research and Science  May 16,  Pictured here with his pet rooster, March, Lue Gim Gong¡¯s work with citrus trees helped develop a frost-tolerant orange after a disastrous winter in Florida. No one should live in this world for himself alone, but to do good for those who come after him. These are the words that Lue Gim Gong lived by.  When he was only 12 years old, Lue left his home and farmer parents in Canton, China and crossed the Pacific Ocean to America.  He lived and worked in San Francisco until he was 16, and then moved to Massachusetts to take a job at the C.T. Sampson shoe factory. At church, Lue met Fannie Burlingame, the daughter of a wealthy farmer and merchant.  She immediately recognized his desire to learn and his natural talent with plants.   He eventually came to live with her family and they helped him become an American citizen in . Along with his green thumb, Lue had a knack for storytelling and a way with animals.  While his personality and desire to learn were larger than life, his body was frail and at some point in his youth he became very ill, possibly with tuberculosis.  His condition was made worse by the cold New England climate, so Fannie suggested he move to DeLand, Florida, where she and her sister owned a house and orchard. Working with William Dumville, Fannie¡¯s brother-in-law, Lue planted orange trees and other fruits, immersing himself in the world of horticulture. In the winter of -95, Florida saw some of the worst freezes in recorded history.  Almost all of the citrus groves were lost¡ªincluding the ones worked by Lue and Dumville.  Lue¡¯s experiments in cross-pollination became focused on producing fruits that were more tolerant of cold weather. Fannie passed away in , leaving Lue the house and property in DeLand.  Devastated by the loss of ¡°Mother Fannie,¡± Lue became a bit of an eccentric fixture in the small Florida community.  His pet rooster, March, and two horses named Baby and Fannie were his main companions, but his work with plant varieties continued. In , he was recognized for successfully cross-pollinated a ¡°Hart¡¯s Late¡± Valencia orange with a ¡°Mediterranean Sweet¡± to produce a new orange named the ¡°Lue Gim Gong.¡±  This sweet new variation, later found to be a nucellar seedling of the Valencia, ripened in the early fall and was much more resistant to the cold.  It is sold under the Valencia name today. His achievement won the Silver Wilder Medal, awarded by the American Pomological Society¡ªthe first such award for a citrus fruit. Lue also developed an apple that ripened a month earlier than other varieties, tomatoes that grew in clusters, and a peach that would ripen in late November.  His continued efforts with citrus plants also produced varieties of grapefruits that grew singularly (instead of in clumps), a cold-tolerant grapefruit that was slower to drop and a ¡°perfumed¡± variety that had a heavy fragrance. Lue¡¯s conviction to do lasting good changed the Florida citrus industry and broadened the seasonal range for many orchard-grown trees.  While his life was lived simply and mostly outside of the limelight, he certainly did his best to create something good for the generations of farmers that came after him. USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), celebrates the life of Lue Gim Gong and spirit of the words he lived by.

"Public Affairs Specialist, APHIS in  Animals  Plants  Apr 16,  Delicious citrus: Scott Bauer, USDA Agricultural Research Service It¡¯s time to grab those gloves and get outside for some gardening!  April is not only a great time to plant citrus trees, but it¡¯s also Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month. Before wielding that shovel, take a few minutes to learn how to keep your trees healthy and prevent the spread of citrus disease. Citrus greening disease, also known as Huanglongbing (HLB), is one of the most severe plant diseases in the world. The disease has devastated millions of citrus trees in the United States and now has the potential to eliminate the citrus industry.  Once a tree is infected with the disease, there is no known cure. Citrus greening is spread by a bug the size of the head of a pin¡ªthe Asian citrus psyllid (ACP). When the bug feeds on an infected tree, it becomes a carrier, spreading the disease from one tree to another.  Although the disease is not harmful to humans, fruit from infected trees are not suitable for consumption because of their green color, misshapen appearance and bitter taste. Here are four tips to help get you started with citrus while preventing the spread of citrus greening disease: 1. Be Aware of Quarantines. If you are thinking about buying a citrus plant, be sure not to move it from quarantined states or territories. Not only are you risking spreading citrus diseases by transporting citrus outside of these areas, but it's also against the law. Review the quarantine map at SaveOurCitrus.org. 2. Check the Citrus Plant Supplier. Be a savvy buyer. Citrus plants sold in a regulated state must be sold from a certified vendor and be properly labeled.  3. Keep Homegrown Citrus at Home. Help reduce the spread of citrus diseases by not moving your homegrown citrus fruit or plants from quarantine areas. 4. Inspect Citrus Plants Regularly for Diseases and Insects. Visit our symptom checklist and corresponding photos to identify a plant impacted by ACP, citrus greening, citrus canker, citrus black spot and sweet orange scab. If you detect an infected plant, report it immediately. If you suspect your citrus may be diseased, report it immediately to the USDA.  The USDA¡¯s Save Our Citrus iPhone App offers a convenient way for people to identify and report suspected citrus disease. This free app is available for download from the iTunes store.   To learn more about the Save Our Citrus program, visit www.saveourcitrus.org or follow the program on Facebook and Twitter. USDA¡¯s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has declared April as Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month. Throughout the month, APHIS is posting a series of blog entries here and also share invasive plant pest and disease information through our twitter feed. APHIS and its federal and state partners are fighting to protect our communities, our public lands, and our agricultural resources from invasive species. But we can¡¯t do it alone.

Report any suspicious findings to local authorities. 2. **Use clean equipment**: Use sterile pruning tools and do not use them on multiple trees unless they have been properly disinfected between uses. This will help prevent the spread of citrus greening through contaminated equipment. 3. **Prevent insect vectors from visiting your plants**: The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) is the primary vector for transmitting the greening disease. Keep your trees away from areas where ACPs are known to be present, and consider using a physical barrier or repellent around the base of your tree. 4. **Control weeds and debris near trees**: Weeds and plant debris can harbor insects that may spread citrus greening. Regularly remove any weeds and debris from around your trees, and keep the area clean and free of clutter. By following these four tips, you can significantly reduce the risk of spreading citrus greening disease when growing homegrown citrus.",8.77E-232,0.17167382,0.017316017,0.094420601,0.841328621

Prince Albert II helped celebrate on Sept. 20 the centennial anniversary of the hunting trip his great-grandfather, Prince Albert I, took with now-historic figures William ¡°Buffalo Bill¡± Cody and Abraham Archibald Anderson, the first Special Superintendent of Forest Reserves. The successful hunting trip cemented lasting relationships between the men and established an area in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, which is still known today as Camp Monaco. The centennial celebration began with a morning horseback trail ride following a route very similar to one Prince Albert I took a century ago. A local outfitter and fly-fishing guide, Lee Livingston Outfitting Inc., guided Prince Albert II and his party through the changing leaves of the forest where they were greeted with splendid mountain views and a few grizzly bear sightings. The trail ride was followed by a luncheon at the Pahaska Tepee, Buffalo Bill Cody¡¯s original hunting lodge on the Shoshone National Forest.

"USDA Forest Service Chief in  USDA Results  Forestry  Nov 22,  Untreated ponderosa pine woodland compared to an area restored by the Greater Flagstaff Forest Partnership working with the Forest Service in on the Coconino National Forest in Arizona. While people have squabbled over the direction of federal forest management, many landscapes have declined. Take southwestern ponderosa pine, for example. Where thick grasses once waved under big orange-barked pines, thickets of spindly trees now threaten natural and human communities alike through outbreaks of insects and disease, followed by devastating fires. Now people are joining together around common conservation goals to restore landscapes like these. The U.S. Forest Service is working with partners to restore healthy watersheds capable of delivering all the values and benefits that Americans want and need. The goal is to restore landscapes that future generations will describe with the same awe inspired in the first European visitors. In Arizona, environmentalists, local officials, and others have coalesced behind a Forest Service initiative to furnish small-diameter materials from four overgrown national forests to local mills and bioenergy facilities. ¡°I¡¯m hoping to look back on this day as the official end of the forest wars,¡± said Todd Schulke of the Center for Biological Diversity. The time is right for a restoration economy. The Forest Service is tailoring its programs and projects to a new management environment associated with climate change, demographic growth, and other large-scale drivers of landscape changes that are undermining the health of America¡¯s forests and grasslands. Restoration treatments are based on collaboration with stakeholders to achieve mutual goals across entire landscapes, leading to more jobs and a better future for forest-based communities hard hit by recession. A restoration economy will take time to develop. It will take years to establish confidence and mutual goodwill, overcoming lingering doubts and festering fears and suspicions. In time, however, Americans can unite to achieve their mutual restoration goals through landscape-scale conservation.

"National Program Leader with the Division of Youth and 4-H, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  Oct 19,  Since its creation more than 100 years ago, 4-H has expanded its focus from the field to the lab to keep pace with developments in agricultural techniques and technologies. Photo courtesy of 4-H. National 4-H Week happens each October, a time when nearly six million youth celebrate their participation in 4-H.  Every year, clubs around the country showcase the great things that 4-H offers young people and highlight the incredible things they do to make a positive impact in their communities. The 4-H clover is one of the most recognized in the country, but it wasn¡¯t always that way.  Like most things, it grew ¨C this case from three leaves. The seeds of 4-H were planted at the start of the 20th century by several adults in different states who were concerned about young people. Clark County, Ohio, claims credit as being the birthplace of 4-H, although the initial groups were called ¡°The Tomato Club¡± or the ¡°Corn Club.¡± The times were ripe for a new youth innovation like 4-H. During the late s, public universities¡¯ researchers saw that adults in the farming communities did not readily accept the new agricultural discoveries being developed on campuses, such as hybrid seed corn, milk sanitation and home canning procedures. However, they found that young people were open to new thinking. Rural youth programs became an innovative way to introduce new agricultural technology to their communities. In , Iowa school superintendents Jessie Field Shambaugh and O.H. Benson developed a 3-leaf clover pin with an ¡°H¡± on each leaf to signify ¡°head,¡± ¡°heart,¡± and ¡°hands.¡± In a meeting, club leaders approved the design of a 4-leaf clover with an H on each leaf, adding ¡°health.¡± By , the groups were becoming known as 4-H clubs. Congress passed the Smith-Lever Act in , creating the Cooperative Extension System at USDA, which included work of various boys' and girls' clubs involved with agriculture, home economics and related subjects. This action effectively nationalized the 4-H program. Between and , clubs were formed at some historically black land-grant colleges in Southern states opening up 4-H to more African-American youth. As 4-H grew, its focus moved beyond the translation of science to include personal growth so that youth could gain skills to help them transition to adulthood in a contributing, productive and self-directed manner. With its national headquarters located within USDA¡¯s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), today 4-H serves nearly 6 million youth in rural, urban and suburban communities in every state and many U.S. military installations around the world. Today¡¯s 4-H¡¯ers tackle the nation's top issues, from global food security, climate change and sustainable energy to childhood obesity and food safety. To improve the nation's ability to compete in key scientific fields and take on the leading challenges of the 21st century, 4-H programs offer a wide variety of science, engineering, technology and applied math educational opportunities, including agricultural sciences, rocketry, robotics, environmental protection and computer science.

Photo by Carlos Harris There is no one-size-fits-all approach to career development and, according to one of the nation¡¯s new leaders in agriculture, the course one steers toward a profession in agriculture can be as varied and diverse as the population itself. ¡°I¡¯m not a big fan of the term ¡®pipeline¡¯ because it implies that there is only one way in and only one direction you can go,¡± said Dr. Victoria LeBeaux, a national program leader (NPL) with USDA¡¯s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).  ¡°If that were true I certainly wouldn¡¯t be here, since I had no intention of studying agriculture.¡± As an undergraduate, she studied economics with the goal of working in international development. Prior to starting her doctorate in sustainable agriculture, LeBeaux lived in rural areas in France and Austria and volunteered in Mexico.  Iowa State University ultimately recruited her to complete doctoral training in a three-year NIFA-funded National Needs Fellowship (NNF) program. NNF trains students for masters and doctoral degrees. In some cases it also provides additional post-doctoral training for the Fellows.  For LeBeaux, that additional training meant a six-month stint in Guatemala where she examined how technical assistance providers helped enhance regional food security by advancing sustainable agriculture practices. LeBeaux returned to NIFA in after completing her Ph.D. and subsequent postdoctoral studies, and became an NPL in NIFA¡¯s Division of Community and Education.  In that role she manages about $10 million in federal funding that supports secondary and postsecondary research, education and extension in the food, agricultural, and human sciences. These programs include the Educational Literacy Initiative¡¯s Research and Extension for Undergraduates (REEU) fellowships program.  REEU provides experiential learning opportunities for underrepresented and first-generation college students. In addition, she uses her scientific training to represent NIFA in federal initiatives like USDA¡¯s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food, which helps coordinate USDA programs to strengthen local and regional food networks nationwide. ¡°I sincerely appreciate the opportunities provided though the NNF program,¡± she said.  ¡°As with many other young people, pursuing doctoral education was not on my radar and would not have been possible had I not had the financial support provided by the grant.  I think we need to create a diverse array of pathways to link young people to careers in agriculture and to show them that whatever they are interested in, there are opportunities in agriculture.¡± NIFA programs offer grants for K-12 schools and community colleges, such as The Secondary Education, Two-Year Postsecondary Education, and Agriculture in the K-12 Classroom Challenge Grants (SPECA) program; funding for undergraduate and masters level education such as the Higher Education Challenge Grants program and the Multicultural Scholars Program (MSP); and support for doctoral studies is provided by the NNF Fellowship and the Education and Literacy Initiative. NNF supports 45 new masters and doctoral students each year, while MSP supports 35 undergrads. Beyond grants, there are many other ways people can benefit from NIFA. For example, educators can access free curriculum from AITC through its Curriculum Matrix. NIFA is also the home of 4-H National Headquarters that supports the positive youth leadership development.

"New SNAP E&T Initiatives Aim to Help SNAP Participants Find Jobs  Getting a good job these days takes more than good intentions because today¡¯s jobs require a higher level of skills than ever before.  This is why the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program¡¯s Employment and Training Program (SNAP E&T), administered by states across the country, has such an important role to play in helping SNAP recipients gain the skills they need to find and keep good jobs.  This is also why the U.S. Department of Agriculture is committed to supporting this effort. USDA demonstrated that commitment in two new initiatives launched just this week, the SNAP E&T Learning Academy and a new website for the innovative SNAP to Skills Project, led by the Food and Nutrition Service. The Academy breaks new ground, as a first-ever opportunity that will help address an identified need. You see, though SNAP E&T programs operate across America, we¡¯ve found that there is an opportunity for further sharing of best practices and lessons learned by developing resources that spread the knowledge base throughout the country. The two new projects launched this week will use a ¡°train-the-trainer¡± model to create new leadership capacity to build the next generation of SNAP E&T programs.

Here are some specific examples: **Initiatives implemented by Secretary Vilsack:** 1. **The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP)**: In 2008, Secretary Vilsack launched the CSP, which provides financial incentives to farmers and ranchers who adopt conservation practices that improve soil health, reduce erosion, and enhance wildlife habitats. 2. **The Agricultural Act of 2014**: During his tenure, Secretary Vilsack played a key role in drafting the 2014 Farm Bill, which included several provisions aimed at promoting conservation efforts, such as the CSP and other programs focused on soil conservation, water quality improvement, and habitat restoration. 3. **Iowa's Soil Health Partnership**: In partnership with the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS), Secretary Vilsack launched a soil health initiative to promote the use of cover crops, reduced tillage, and other conservation practices that improve soil health and reduce erosion. **Initiatives implemented by farmers in Iowa:** 1. **The Iowa Soybean Association's (ISA) Conservation Tillage Program**: Many soybean farmers in Iowa have adopted conservation tillage practices, which involve reducing tillage to minimize soil disturbance and promote soil health. 2. **The Pheasants Forever-led ""Wetlands Reserve Program"" (WRP)**: Some farmers in Iowa have enrolled their lands in the WRP, a program that provides financial incentives for landowners to retire and restore wetland habitats, which help filter water and support wildlife populations. 3. **Cover crop adoption**: Many corn and soybean farmers in Iowa now use cover crops on their fields during the off-season, which helps reduce soil erosion, improve soil health, and promote pollinator diversity. **Additional initiatives:** 1. **The Des Moines River Watershed Initiative**: This is a collaborative effort among government agencies, farmers, and environmental organizations to protect water quality in the Des Moines River watershed. 2. **The Iowa Conservation Program**: This program, led by IDALS and the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), provides financial and technical assistance to farmers and landowners to implement conservation practices that improve soil health, reduce erosion, and enhance wildlife habitats. These initiatives demonstrate a commitment from Secretary Vilsack and farmers in Iowa to protecting environmental resources through conservation efforts.",0.015389752,0.090225564,0.035264484,0.080200501,0.844098926
"NRCS Recovery Act Project Helps Provide New Starts for Residents   For more than 45 years, people who lived in West Virginia¡¯s Dunloup Creek Watershed have dealt with floods. That¡¯s because there¡¯s a scarcity of flat land in the area and residents have had to settle mostly along the creek¡ªthe very area that floods during storms. Two major floods in and devastated five low-income communities spread out across two counties in the watershed. The floods destroyed houses, ate away at the stream bank, polluted drinking water and washed away utilities. Damages totaled millions of dollars. Because of the mountainous terrain and far-flung population, traditional flood control measures like dams, channels, floodwalls, dredging and flood proofing were not feasible. Yet many residents were trapped into living in their damaged homes, unable to move out because of perilous financial circumstances.

"After the Storm, Who Takes Care of the Trees?  Thousands of federal, state, and private agencies have been deployed to areas that were impacted by hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate. These first responders are there to help the people in the storm¡¯s path. However, there is another group of responders that go into storm-ravaged towns to aid the trees: the Urban Forest Strike Teams (UFST).  Patty Matteson, Southern Research Station, Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Oct 25,   3 Responses","What other responders, besides first responders, are deployed to storm-affected areas, specifically focusing on helping trees affected by hurricanes like Harvey?",The Urban Forest Strike Teams (UFST) are deployed to storm-affected areas to aid the trees.,"Besides first responders, several other types of responders are deployed to storm-affected areas to help with recovery efforts, particularly in cases where trees have been impacted by storms like Hurricane Harvey. Some of these responders include: 1. **Urban Forestry and Arborists**: These professionals specialize in tree care and management. They assess the damage to trees, identify potential hazards, and provide guidance on pruning or removing damaged branches. 2. **Tree Service Companies**: Specialized tree service companies, often hired by local governments or insurance companies, are deployed to remove fallen or weakened trees, and prune or trim trees that have been damaged. 3. **Wildlife Experts (e.g., wildlife removal services)**: While not directly related to tree care, these responders may be called in to handle animal-related issues, such as trapped animals in flooded areas or damage caused by wildlife (like rodents) in affected homes. 4. **Environmental and Conservation Agencies**: These agencies might send experts to assess the impact of storms on natural environments, including trees and other vegetation. 5. **Utility Companies' Arborists**: Utility companies often have their own arborist teams that work to restore power lines, towers, and other infrastructure damaged by fallen or weakened trees. 6. **Emergency Management Teams**: These teams are responsible for coordinating relief efforts, including tree removal and debris management. It's worth noting that the specific responders deployed will depend on the severity of the storm, the extent of damage, and local policies regarding emergency response and recovery efforts.",0.01962577,0.092307692,0.046511628,0.069230769,0.837408364
