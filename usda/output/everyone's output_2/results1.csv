"National WIC Breastfeeding Week 2016  World Breastfeeding Week is celebrated around the world each year during the first week of August to promote breastfeeding and highlight its importance to the health of mothers and babies. This year’s theme is “Breastfeeding: A Key to Sustainable Development.”  USDA’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) joins the celebration as WIC promotes breastfeeding all year long as the optimal choice for moms who are medically able.  We support breastfeeding WIC moms through counseling and educational materials, peer counselors, a specially-tailored food package, and breastfeeding aids like breast pumps.  USDA’s successful national breastfeeding promotion campaign, Loving Support Makes Breastfeeding Work, serves as the foundation of our breastfeeding activities.  It emphasizes the importance of support from family and friends, from the health care system, and from the community. All have key roles to play in providing the support a breastfeeding mother needs.

"Deputy Under Secretary of Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  Feb 11, 2014  USDA Deputy Undersecretary Ann Mills (ninth from left) visits with Leopold Conservation Award winners at USDA last week. USDA photo. “Water conservation begins where the first drop of rain falls…most likely on private working lands.” This is a favorite saying of Tom Vandivier, a Texas cattle rancher and 2008 recipient of the Sand County Foundation’s Leopold Conservation Award (LCA). Tom was one of more than two dozen recipients of the LCA – which recognized landowners for achievement in environmental improvement on agricultural land – in Washington, D.C. last week.  I was fortunate to meet with them here at USDA headquarters to talk about the importance of conservation and the need to spread the message that investing in conservation practices on our farm and ranch lands not only protects water, air and wildlife – it also makes economic sense. Jill Giacomini Basch is a 2013 LCA recipient who, with her father and three sisters, owns a family dairy in Marin County, Calif.  I had a chance to meet with the Giacomini family during my tour of several California farms last month. Jill explained that conservation improves the way they run their business. Partnerships with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and others have helped them protect their land and water resources, and ensure their dairy will be prosperous for the next generation. “We have very close ties with NRCS and other programs,” Jill said. “They have helped us with our water allocation -- above ground storage pond facilities and spring well drilling.  With the USDA we were able to utilize new technology to install a methane digester to help mitigate waste run off into the nearby lagoon, but also eventually the Point Reyes National Seashore.  Because of the methane digester, we generate about 65 percent of our on farm energy needs.” “Much of the work we’ve done has been through NRCS programs,” Tom added. “NRCS is very important to us.  We’re very much about conservation. The stewardship practices that we’ve accomplished on our property have enhanced water resources in the state of Texas.  I think it’s a message that needs to be spread so others can take similar stewardship practices and hopefully have the same results in their perspective states.” Jon Bednarski, 2013 LCA recipient, shared his story as well.  He started farming 12 years ago outside of Louisville, Ky.  After meeting with NRCS, he discovered he was farming a “sensitive” piece of land, upstream of Louisville’s drinking water source. Since then he has managed his operation to help protect water quality. The group discussed the need for conservation in the face of extreme weather – including the significant drought conditions in 11 western states.  As we were meeting, the U.S. Senate was in the process of voting on the Agricultural Act of 2014. I talked about how important this legislation is to providing the tools and programs necessary for USDA to help farmers, ranchers and forestland owners manage the risk and uncertainty associated with extreme weather and climate change.  Conservation programs will be streamlined to better target limited resources to areas of highest need, while building on record conservation and stewardship efforts already underway.  I also previewed Secretary Tom Vilsack’s announcement of USDA’s new regional hubs to help agriculture and forestry mitigate the impacts of a changing climate. The group also discussed the importance of passing on to the next generation the passion for agriculture and land stewardship.  There is a new energy in America around opportunities in agriculture. The Agricultural Act of 2014 will provide our communities with additional support to attract new economic opportunity and create jobs.  We all agreed that outreach and education is crucial.  USDA will continue to work with the LCA recipients and other partners to make that happen.  To view a video about the meeting click here.

Photo courtesy of Anniston Downtown Farmers Market. June is Small Cities Month, an opportunity to celebrate the unique and important role our smaller communities play in our rural economy and making our nation a great place to live and work.  Leaders in innovation and entrepreneurship often hail from small cities and their residents are proud of their hometowns. USDA partners with communities across the country to create greater economic impact as the strong rural economies of our small, vibrant cities benefit the whole nation. Secretary Vilsack identified strengthening local food systems as one of the four pillars of USDA's commitment to rural economic development, and USDA efforts in this area have made a big difference in small cities.  My agency, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has a long history of supporting local and regional food systems through grants, research and technical assistance.  Across the country, city leaders are recognizing that farmers markets are at the heart of many towns and cities. Cities like Anniston, Ala., are focusing on farmers markets as key tools to revitalize their economies.  As part of a larger strategic plan to create economic development, the City of Anniston decided to boost its farmers market by creating a permanent community gathering place where local food producers could build successful businesses and bring fresh, local food to market. In 2014, city leaders received a grant from the AMS Farmers Market Promotion Program, which supports farmers markets and other direct producer-to-consumer activities. The City of Anniston will use the grant to establish and promote a year-round farmers market.  Helping bring people into town, the market will also incorporate numerous events and activities throughout the summer, from live music to health screenings to chef demonstrations from local restaurants. Anniston is just one example of city leaders using USDA grants and resources to strengthen their local food economy.  Many cities, large and small, are working with USDA to benefit farmers, ranchers and other local food producers. USDA also partners with stakeholders and communities to leverage resources for greater impact. Recently, we met with National League of Cities CEO & Executive Director Clarence Anthony and members of his staff.  The NLC is dedicated to helping city leaders build better communities by serving as a resource to and an advocate for the more than 19,000 cities, villages, and towns it represents.  Together, AMS and NLC will highlight the success stories of cities using USDA tools and resources to build stronger economies and communities. These investments and partnerships are part of USDA's commitment to strengthening local and regional food systems through projects that recruit and train farmers, expand economic opportunities, and increase access to healthy foods.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. 0098.23  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@usda.gov  WASHINGTON, May 3, 2023 – Today the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced the creation of 12 new USDA Regional Food Business Centers that will provide national coverage coordination, technical assistance, and capacity building to help farmers, ranchers, and other food businesses access new markets and navigate federal, state, and local resources, thereby closing the gaps to success. In addition, USDA also announced a $420 million Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure Program (RFSI) to fund innovative projects designed to invest in processing and distribution capacity to build resilience across the middle of the supply chain and strengthen local and regional food systems. USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) will partner with state and territories’ departments of agriculture for this program. “The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to transforming our food system to one that offers new market opportunities to small and mid-sized farming operations through a strengthened local and regional food system,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. “The Regional Food Business Centers, along with investments through the Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure Program will create new and expanded local market opportunities which will improve farm income, create good paying jobs and build greater resilience in our overall food system.” “USDA recognizes that local and regional food systems are essential to the overall food supply chain and the new Regional Food Business Centers are the cornerstone of our efforts to support them,” said Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs Jenny Lester Moffitt. “The resources and diverse knowledge offered through the Centers will make the opportunities available through dozens of USDA programs more accessible to small and mid-sized producers and food and farm businesses. The Centers technical assistance coupled with the additional funding for processing capacity and infrastructure improvements through the Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure program is bringing us many steps closer to reaching the goals of the Food System Transformation framework.” USDA Regional Food Business Centers In September 2022, USDA announced $400 million to fund this initiative and 12 organizations were selected to lead efforts in their region and together serve all areas of the country. The Regional Food Business Centers will support producers by providing localized assistance to access a variety of markets, including linking producers to wholesalers and distributors. By strengthening connections between rural and urban areas, the Regional Food Business Centers will drive economic opportunities across the region, creating a more diversified and resilient food system. Collectively, the organizations selected to lead each Center reflect an impressive cross-section of the varied institutions, organizations, and associations that must cooperate to achieve genuinely strong and distributed food systems. These organizations are engaging with grassroots food and farm organizations and employing a range of creative strategies to build food system resiliency. Regional Food Centers will target their work to historically underinvested communities in their region.

"Administrator, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Research and Science  Apr 26, 2011   This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA's rich science and research portfolio. Proving that agriculture does indeed count, Director of the Statistics Division at USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Joe Prusacki, was selected as ProFarmer’s 2010 Ag Person of the Year. This award is a great honor for Prusacki and is shared by all of USDA as it exemplifies the department’s continued commitment to actively listen and be responsive to the needs of its stakeholders.  Previous notable recipients include Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley and Nebraska Sen. Mike Johanns , a former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. In announcing Prusacki as the award recipient, editors noted that he had “what was probably the toughest job in all of agriculture in 2010” due to 2009-2010 crop reporting challenges and the resulting scrutiny of NASS’s crop estimate reports. Prusacki’s unwavering leadership and confidence in NASS’s programs and procedures helped the agency persevere during the unusual 2009 and 2010 growing seasons. During that time, growers faced unprecedented growing conditions, causing market volatility. This provided challenges for NASS and its crop estimates program, resulting in the agency resurveying several corn and small grains-growing states. With Prusacki at the helm of NASS’s Statistics Division, the agency overcame extraordinary challenges and maintained trust within the agricultural community through open communication and dialogue. Prusacki’s integrity and professionalism throughout this time earned him great respect from some of USDA’s toughest critics. Pro-Farmer went on to say, “Let’s face it... NASS can be an ‘easy target’ because the data it collects is closely followed, open to many opinions (pre-report trade expectations) and it moves the markets. And this year, its data moved the markets violently with regularity! Despite all these ‘spotlight moments,’ Prusacki’s message never wavered. … Prusacki handled the challenges and conflicts with professionalism.” In addition to managing NASS’s Statistics Division, Prusacki also serves as Executive Director of the Agricultural Statistics Board and is responsible for leading USDA’s crops and livestock statistics estimating program. He is a leading expert and spokesperson on USDA’s official estimates of all major crop and livestock commodities in the United States. Joseph J. Prusacki, National Agricultural Statistics Service.

"Energy Stakeholders Comment on USDA Energy Roadmap  During the previous 18 months, a team of USDA multidisciplinary experts reviewed, analyzed, and synthesized almost 1,000 responses from stakeholders about its June 2010 report (, 771 ) that put forth a roadmap for the United States to produce advanced biofuels.  The roadmap report provided a basis for continued conversations about moving forward with producing more domestically grown fuels and reducing our dependence on foreign fossil fuels, improving the environment, and revitalizing rural communities. Following the roadmap report, USDA held ates and Puerto Rico.   The workshops succeeded in gathering numerous and helpful comments from farmers, industry groups, biorefinery executives, and academia.   Stakeholder comments, as a whole, successfully broadened the view of the roadmap by providing additional information and insights.  The majority of comments echoed USDA’s conclusion that this nation has the natural resources to produce enough domestically grown biofuels.  The key to success, according to the comments, lies in a few critical areas that include: consistent policy support from the public sector, greater consumer awareness, utilization of a wide variety of feedstocks, sustainable conservation and cropping practices, and more recognition and use of forestry and wood products.

"Pooling Resources for Scientific Breakthroughs  American farmers know about planting seeds—both in the ground and in groundbreaking research. While the seeds they plant as individual farmers feed and clothe the rest of us, the seeds they sow collectively through participation in research and promotion (R&P) programs are vitally important, too. Funded entirely by industry, agricultural R&P programs are a way for producers and businesses across a commodity industry to pool their resources to help market and improve their products. With oversight provided by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), one of the most important seeds these programs sow is the foundational research that paves the way for breakthroughs that once seemed unimaginable.

"Energy  Rural  May 06, 2010   Administrator-USDA Rural Utilities Service If you lived in a rural area 75 years ago, you probably didn’t have electricity. Water for livestock, cooking, cleaning and bathing had to be hand pumped from a well. Farmers risked milk spoilage in the summer, and people often got sick from lack of refrigeration of their food.  On May 11, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an executive order to create the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) to bring power to rural areas. It was a resounding success.  Nothing before or since has transformed rural America like the REA.  Today’s Rural Utilities Service (RUS), part of the USDA Rural Development mission area, continues the work of REA. Just this week, four former REA and RUS administrators gathered in USDA’s radio studio, reflecting on their roles from 1993 to the present. Their observations will soon be available via podcast.  Rural Development, through RUS, is aggressively building a program to finance renewable energy, and rural America is rapidly becoming a greater energy producer for the nation. Not only is this part of President Obama’s clean energy economy, but it will also create quality jobs in rural America.  Working with other federal agencies, rural electric cooperatives and other utilities, we are taking steps to modernize the electric grid and improve energy efficiency.  While working to improve electric transmission services we are also meeting a new challenge: Delivering broadband to rural communities.  Without broadband, rural businesses are placed at a disadvantage and our children face diminished educational opportunities. Our next great achievement will be to build a system that will connect even the most remote places in America to the web.   Rural America’s future is bright, thanks to the thousands of men and women who have worked in or with the REA and now the RUS over the past three-quarters of a century.  Chances are, if you live in rural America, some of those people are your neighbors, as close as your local electric cooperative.  They achieved a modern miracle, lighting rural America. This week, take a minute and think about all the good they’ve done.  They’ve achieved the greatest success in a government technology program of all time.     (Left to right) Christopher McLean, Administrator,  2000-2001; Wally Beyer 1993-1999; James Andrew 2005-2009;  Glenn English (CEO-NRECA);  Hilda Gay Legg 2001-2005; Jonathan Adelstein 2009 – present; Dallas Tonsager (Undersecretary, USDA Rural Development); gathered on May 4 at the U.S. Capitol for an event marking the beginnings of the effort to bring electricity to rural America.

The diversity of the issues discussed was reflective of the diversity of the attendees of the forum.  Representatives from institutions of higher education believed that a job creation and economic growth plan must offer ways to evolve or expand education and training systems to address the current needs of individuals wishing to return to the workforce.  In addition, investments must be made to expand education opportunities to growing sectors of the employment market; they reported that currently the growth is in health careers. Representatives of youth organizations shared their belief that investing time and resources in the development of youth, especially through programs such as 4-H, FFA, and Junior Achievement type programs, has proven to be beneficial in fostering a good work ethic and developing essential skills to succeed.  Small business owners and technical assistance providers shared their concerns regarding resources available to small businesses as well as infrastructure requirements and availability of technology required to make rural areas competitive.   Representatives of the agriculture industry echoed the need to stimulate job creation stating that agriculture is dependent on off-farm income and on the support of viable communities.  Several elected officials expressed concerns and offered suggestion from their legislative perspectives. We were very pleased with the group’s participation.  The sincere commitment to work together as Oklahomans to seek solutions to the current economic challenges was evident throughout the forum.  We plan to submit Oklahoma’s answers to the President’s seven questions, as gleaned from the discussion, to US Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack for inclusion in his final report to the White House.

Monmouth, Ill., residents Vicki and Ted Briscoe want to know when their access to the Internet will no longer be hampered by a slow dial up connection. The answer—12 to 18 months—came from Noah Campbell, vice president of community relations for Utopian Wireless Corp, at a talk show-style forum held at the Briscoes’ alma mater Monmouth College Wednesday, Sept. 22. The forum was held to discuss the new broadband service made possible with Recovery Act funding offered through USDA Rural Development’s Broadband Initiatives Program. Campbell travelled from Maryland to participate in the forum.  Utopian Wireless, based in Maryland, was recently selected for a loan and grant from USDA Rural Development to make high speed Internet available to 4,000 homes, 290 businesses and 100 community institutions in the area. The company will use WiMAX technology to bring advanced, upgradable wireless broadband communications to the area.  It is particularly well suited for economically delivering high speed 4G service to areas like Monmouth where the terrain is relatively flat. “Without connectivity, we can’t move forward,” said Illinois Rural Development State Director Colleen Callahan, who hosted the meeting.  “Broadband is the great equalizer and critical for future of rural communities.”  Vicki Briscoe concurred.  She is concerned young people won’t stay in rural communities unless we provide the structures, like broadband, that young people expect. Monmouth College history professor Fred Witzig, co-coordinator of the college’s new Midwest Matters initiative, said students are pleasantly surprised by the opportunities available in smaller communities, especially when they realize they don’t have to leave behind some of the amenities of the city. Witzig added that broadband is absolutely crucial to rural areas as were the railroads and mail order catalogs of the past.  “To survive, regions need to connect to the rest of the world,” he said.  “It takes public private coordination to make those connections.” Callahan concluded the talk show with the admonition that we need to provide the infrastructure necessary to help us move forward and to chart whatever comes next.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Sep 19, 2012   Growing up, all Michelle Cox could think about was being a teacher. She envisioned herself in a classroom making a lasting impact on young lives, becoming one of those teachers students would remember forever. Today, Cox is making a significant contribution as a teacher, but her students are not in the classroom. They are her colleagues within the Food Safety and Inspection Service’s Office of Field Operations. Cox is a Supervisory Consumer Safety Inspector (SCSI), and her job involves supervising and training new meat, poultry and egg products inspectors. A SCSI also performs a variety of food inspection activities, but it is the instruction aspect that has most captured Cox’s heart. “This is one of the most rewarding jobs I have ever had,” Cox said. FSIS was not Cox’s first choice of employment. Or tenth. She majored in animal husbandry and is an honest-to-goodness cowgirl, having competed in professional rodeo competitions and paying her way through college on a rodeo scholarship “Not too many people can claim that,” she joked. Michelle Cox, Supervisory Consumer Safety Inspector for the Food Safety and Inspection Service Cox found her way to FSIS in 2002. “I was a single mom, and my job had been downsized. The only job I could find at the time was at a cold storage facility”—a facility that dealt with FSIS-inspected products. An FSIS inspector she met on the job encouraged her to apply to become a food inspector. Cox got the job and was first assigned to a beef plant. She quickly rose to a supervisory position and was awarded the 2011Administrator’s Award for Excellence for creating an informal training program for newly promoted CSIs. The program provides an overview of what new inspectors will encounter on the job and what they need to know to be successful. “There is no wiggle room when it comes to protecting the public health. It has to be right the first time,” She said. Cox said it was persistence, patience and a drive to succeed that has fueled her rise within FSIS. “Success is what you make of it. If you sit back and take the easy route, success will pass you by. If you jump in with both feet and do all that you can, you will be rewarded both professionally and personally,” she said.

"Recreation and Heritage, USDA Forest Service in  Forestry  Jan 06, 2020  Azul Aguayo, observes the wonders of nature in a new way during a Forest therapy activity. USDA Photo/Tamberly Conway In September 2017, Hurricane Maria, a deadly category 5 hurricane devastated Dominica, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Amidst the devastation was the El Yunque National Forest, the only tropical rainforest among the USDA Forest Service’s 193 million acres. Reliably lush and green, the forest was left denuded and nearly unrecognizable. Today, El Yunque is bouncing back and many places like the Quedabra Grande Recreation Area are being reopened, thanks to the work of more than 100 volunteers on National Public Lands Day 2019. National Public Lands Day is celebrated every September and is the nation’s largest single-day volunteer event in support of America’s public lands. Volunteers helped to clear trails and remove overgrown vegetation, debris and trash from the area to extend, and improve recreation opportunities to communities in the forest’s southwestern region. The joint effort was made possible through Forest Service partnerships with Fundacion Amigos de El Yunque and Corazon Latino. In addition to the service work, volunteers were also able to take part in the first-ever citizen science project on the El Yunque. Called “Redescubre el Yunque,” or “Rediscover El Yunque,” and led by Amigos de El Yunque, participants collected data to monitor forest health, composition and recovery. One of the most unique aspects of this day of service, was “Forest Bathing,” or Forest Therapy, an activity in which participants embrace their surroundings using all of their senses to connect more deeply with nature. A Forest Service representative, serving as an Association of Nature and Forest Therapy Certified Guide, offered a two-hour session, in which participants slowed down, took in their surroundings and reflected on the “more-than-human-world” around them. “Seeing this experience transform people first hand is simply amazing,” said Tamberly Conway, partnerships, diversity and inclusion specialist with the Forest Service, who also serves as a certified guide for the Association of Nature and Forest Therapy. “Witnessing people take in the sights, sounds and sensations of the forest around them and then listening to how it impacted them was extremely powerful.” Participant evaluations revealed their experience connected them more deeply to the land and built a sense of community among strangers. Many said that the experience evoked an intense appreciation for the natural world and created a stronger desire to take care of the forest, which is sacred to the Puerto Rican people. Ricardo Burke, Forest Therapy participant, communes with the more-than-human-world. USDA Photo/Tamberly Conway “Nature is our true home, it provides us with everything we need,” said Ricardo Burke, one of the participants. “Forest Therapy connects us with our most natural selves in which we realize an opening, contact and visualization, guided in a safe environment.” The good news is that you don’t need a certified guide to seek a similar experience when visiting your national forests. Get out to experience your national forests by slowing down and focusing on your sensory connections. It can unite you with your forests in profound ways that can’t be measured, and the experience can also drive a desire to lend a hand in caring for these lands. You can visit our volunteer page to find those opportunities or call a forest or grassland near you to learn how to connect to your national forests.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  May 01, 2015  Dr. Carolyn Brooks had little exposure to agriculture while growing up in the city but, thanks to a love for biology nurtured at a 1890’s Land Grant University, she knows plenty now and even served as dean of the School of Agricultural and Natural Sciences at the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore, MD. Like many city kids growing up in Richmond, Va., Carolyn Brooks didn’t know much about agriculture and had never heard of 4-H. That changed quickly, however, as she was the first in her family to graduate from college—earning a B.S. and then a M.S. in biology from one of the foremost agricultural schools in the country, Tuskegee University, where she said, many people “helped me, guided me, and cared about my success.” Brooks said that before moving to Tuskegee, Ala., she “knew nothing about the South. I had never been in that kind of environment – in a predominantly black community.” Today, Brooks has a Ph.D. in microbiology and is a leader in the 1890 Land-Grant University (LGU) System as the Executive Director of the Association of 1890 Research Directors.  Prior to this position, Brooks served as the dean of the School of Agricultural and Natural Sciences and the 1890 Research Director at the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore (UMES). The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) provides major funding and program leadership to the LGU system—including historically black, tribal, and Hispanic-serving institutions—which are NIFA’s chief partners in research, education, and extension activities. Brooks was inspired to study microbiology after listening to a speaker at a high school summer program. As freshman at Tuskegee, she learned about the life of George Washington Carver. Carver, a former slave and first head of the Tuskegee Agriculture Department, promoted alternative crops to cotton, such as peanuts and sweet potatoes. “Every freshman knew about agriculture because we all know about Carver and what he did for the South,” she said. In her sophomore year at Tuskegee, Brooks married an agricultural education major who later became a cooperative extensive agent. Brooks was impressed that “the university did so much for the community.” Not only that, but “the rural communities my husband served took us in as their own. It was then that I came to understand how land-grant universities are so important.” To date, Brooks has either studied or taught at four land-grant universities, three of which are 1890 institutions. In celebration of 125th anniversary of the Second Morrill Act, Brooks reflected on the 1890 Land-Grant University System and what it has done for her and our nation. “My 1890 university colleagues are a close community of dear friends who believe—as I do—in giving back and finding ways to not just sustain, but to enhance the universities’ mission of advancing all” she said. After the liberation of about four million slaves in 1865, Senator Justin Morrill—author of 1862 Morrill Act that created land-grant universities—furthered the vision for democracy in higher education by introducing the Second Morrill Act of 1890. Of the hardworking, but primarily illiterate blacks, Morrill said, “They are members of the American family, and their advancement concerns us all.” African-Americans were to be included in the U.S. land-grant university higher education system without discrimination. However, the 17 southern and border states would not consent. As a result, the new law allowed for those states to establish a second land-grant institution—then known as the Negro land-grant institutions and today as the 1890 land-grant universities and Tuskegee University. Today there are a total of 19 1890 land-grant universities, which are ladders to opportunity, especially for students with limited access to education. Each institution offers classes, research, and extension programs in the food, agricultural, and related sciences. NIFA’s mission: Invest in and advance agricultural research, education, and extension to solve societal challenges. NIFA’s vision: Catalyze transformative discoveries, education, and engagement to address agricultural challenges.  For more information, visit http://nifa.usda.gov/.

"Director of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  May 16, 2014   As an entomologist, the notion of eating insects isn’t new to me. However, for most Americans, the thought can make their stomachs churn. And yet, maybe seeing insects on their dinner plates is something Americans should get used to seeing. Yesterday, I delivered the keynote address at the Insects as Food Conference, which was hosted by the FAO and Wageningen University in the Netherlands. As director of USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), my goal is to ensure that the science we invest in leads to solutions to today’s most pressing challenges. One of those challenges relates to our world’s growing population, which is expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050. We need to find new ways to feed all people while minimally impacting the environment. This “9 Billion Problem” has implications for how we grow and view food now and in the future. Insects have served as a human food source for tens of thousands of years and may be part of our toolkit in the future in helping solve global food security challenges. Today, insect eating is rare in the developed world but remains a source of food for people in developing countries in Central and South America, Africa and Asia. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, 1,900 different insect species are consumed by 2 billion people in more than 80 countries across Asia, Africa and the Americas. There are many advantages to having insects as food. Insects contain more protein and are lower in fat than traditional meats, and contain a number of micronutrients critical for human well-being. Because of their incredible physiological efficiency, insects require significantly less food to develop on. Insects save a substantial amount of energy and natural resources by their ability to get their heat from the surrounding environment. The environmental impact of insects is also significantly minimal. Finally, their reproduction rate is much higher, making them much easier to raise. However, for all the advantages of eating insects, there are still many unanswered questions. Little is known about the nutritional quality and safety of eating certain insects. What would it look like to “farm” insects at a mass scale and are there any constraints that need to be considered? There are many unanswered questions about regulation and policy decisions. And of course, as I mentioned above, would eating insects be culturally acceptable to Americans? As we work toward addressing issues such as food security, climate change, food safety, sustainable energy and childhood obesity, we might have to start thinking outside the box to find viable solutions. Incorporating insects on the dinner plate is just one small step in this direction, but it might lead to big outcomes around the world.

These challenges highlight the need for further research, discussion, and consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks of incorporating insects into human diets."

"Communications Coordinator, USDA Office of Communications in  Equity  Initiatives  Rural  Jul 23, 2024  “It’s been great to have a team that’s not afraid to let me share my opinion, share my identity. I feel like in this space, I’ve been proud of who I am.” So remarked Celeste Lucero, a USDA Tribal Policy Intern working with USDA Rural Development’s Tribal Relations team this summer. Lucero is one of 14 undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students participating in this historic new program that aims to develop a new generation of agricultural professionals with a better understanding of Tribal food and agriculture issues. Through the Future Leaders in Public Service Internship Program, students are working on USDA agriculture, food, and nutrition programs that benefit Indian Country. The program is sponsored by USDA’s Office of Tribal Relations. This spring, Lucero graduated from the University of New Mexico with degrees in environmental science and economics. She will continue her studies with a master’s in economics. She is a member of the Pueblo of Isleta in New Mexico, as well as Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in North Dakota. Before she even started her 10-week internship at Rural Development, “my boss [Tedd Buelow] and the team asked “what do you want to get out of this internship?” With her team’s guidance, Lucero is writing a white paper for the Water and Environmental Program on water rights and accessibility for the Miccosukee Tribe near Miami, Florida. Lucero’s Pueblo of Isleta affiliation gives her a unique perspective on her project. “The protection of our rights and recognition of our sovereignty can be traced back to Queen Isabella I of Castile’s will of 1504. Our sovereignty was protected throughout the Spanish reign through laws within the Recopilación de Indias. When New Mexico became part of the United States, our rights [including water rights] were preserved. Our rights are much different than other Tribes.” she remarked. A big takeaway from this summer is the importance of representation. “Diversity in these fields is important,” she stated. “For example, I’ve taken some [Tribal] trainings, and suggested to my teammates that they could be improved with more regional Tribal information.” Learning about the breadth of USDA resources was also an eye opener. “I’ve also learned how Tribes like mine are able to get USDA funding for projects, Lucero noted. There is a whole new world of resources that hopefully I'll be able to bring that back to my own people.” Lucero’s advice for other interns? “Find your community, whether in or outside of the workplace. And get to know your colleagues and supervisor. They know these policies and programs front to back. USDA has a lot to offer.” Learn more about USDA internship programs at www.usda.gov/youth/career.

"Who will provide information for the swine contract library (SCL)? Packers, as defined in 9 CFR 206.1, provide source information for the library. The library contains information for about 55 plants. Approximately 33 packers own or use these plants. We expect the overall number of plants and firms to remain relatively constant. However, the specific firms required to report will vary. These variations will depend on consolidation and construction in the industry. These packers provide example contracts. They must also provide monthly reports. In the monthly report, a packer reports the projected number of swine committed and the maximum number of swine it expects to receive over the next 12 months by contract type. What information from the SCL will AMS make available to the public? AMS uses the submitted example contracts as our source of information. We summarize the information by region and contract type. Then we make the summarized information available to producers and other interested persons. The Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act contains confidentiality restrictions. As a result, we cannot make either the example contracts or other proprietary information available. We will present the information we receive in four categories:  base price determination  premiums and discounts  application of ledger  other provisions In addition, AMS will provide a monthly report. This report summarizes estimated deliveries, as reported by packers, by contract type. It will be released to the on the first business day of each month. We will make both reports available for viewing, download and printing. How will information from the SCL help producers?  Producers may use the library to investigate what contract terms packers offer. A producer could identify contract provisions of interest. Producers would not know which packers are offering any of the provisions listed in the summarized information. Nor would they know how a packer would combine those provisions in any contract. However, it is valuable to know that those provisions exist in the marketplace. A producer could use that knowledge to negotiate what may result in a more favorable contract with a packer. Producers may use the monthly report on swine contracted for future delivery in several ways. A producer may use this report to decide how many sows to breed. A producer may also use it to decide whether to contract with packers in regions where packers have fewer numbers of swine committed for delivery. How will AMS make reports from the SCL available to the public? The information is available on this web site and in the Packers and Stockyards Regional Office in Des Moines, Iowa Do I need to provide swine contract information? If you are a packer, as defined in 9 CFR 206.1, and you meet the conditions in either paragraph (1) or (2) below, you must submit example contracts and monthly reports. 1) You purchase at least 100,000 head of swine per year and slaughter the swine at a federally inspected swine processing plant at which you:  Slaughtered an average of at least 100,000 head of swine per year during the immediately preceding five calendar years, with the average based on those periods in which the plant slaughtered swine; or  Have the capacity to slaughter at least 100,000 swine per year, based on plant capacity information. 2) You purchased an average of at least 200,000 sows, boars, or any combination thereof, per year. You also slaughtered at least 200,000 sows, boars, or any combination thereof at one or more federally inspected swine processing plants during the immediately preceding five calendar years, with the average based on those periods in which the plants slaughtered swine. Review the Code of Federal Regulations for further details. What existing or available contracts do I need to provide?  If you meet the definition of a packer in 9 CFR 206.1, you must provide an example of each contract that you currently have with a producer  available at each plant that you operate, or  available at each plant where you have swine slaughtered. Submit these example contracts to AMS. Your submission is due on the first business day of the month following the determination that your plant has the slaughtering capacity specified in the definition of packer in 9 CFR 206.1. After the initial submission, submit an example of each subsequent new contract you make available to a producer or producers. Submit these latter example contracts to AMS within one business day of you making the contract available at each plant that you operate, or at which you have swine slaughtered that meets the definition of packer in 9 CFR 206.1. Use the following guidelines to determine when you must make another submission or notify us of a change.  Required submission of contract made available: When you make a contract available that represents an example contract, submit it as an example contract (for discussion purposes, Example contract A).  Potential subsequent submission due to contract changes: When a contract changes, submit a new example contract. Specify whether it replaces the previously submitted example contract. If not, indicate that it is an additional new example contract (for discussion purposes, Example contract B). You do not have to submit example contracts continuously during negotiations. Rather, submit an example contract when you make it available. When necessary, submit another when the negotiation results in a new contract, or when an existing example contract changes.  New additional example contract example: If the packer and the producer agree to a contract with a change that results in a different example contract (Example contract B) and the packer continues to make Example contract A available to other producers, the negotiated contract will be submitted as a new example contract (Example contract B).  Replacement example: If, however, in that scenario, the packer no longer makes the original Example contract A available to any other producer, and Example contract A is no longer used, then the negotiated contract would be submitted as an example contract to replace the previously submitted Example contract A.  Notification of example contracts that have expired or you have withdrawn: When a previously submitted example contract no longer represents any contracts, notify us that the example contract has expired. When a previously submitted example contract did not result in any contracts, and it no longer represents any available contracts, notify us that you have withdrawn the example contract. What criteria do I use to select example contracts?  Use the following information to select example contracts. At AMS, we consider contracts to be the same if they are identical with respect to all of the following four example-contract criteria.  Base price or determination of base price. Base price is defined in 9 CFR 206.1 as ""The price paid for swine before the application of any premiums or discounts, expressed in dollars per unit.""  Application of a ledger or accrual account (including the terms and conditions of the ledger or accrual account provision). The terms ledger and accrual account are defined in 9 CFR 206.1 as meaning the same thing. That is ""An account held by a packer on behalf of a producer that accrues a running positive or negative balance as a result of a pricing determination included in a contract that establishes a minimum and/or maximum level of base price paid. Credits and/or debits for amounts beyond these minimum and/or maximum levels are entered into the account. Further, the contract specifies how the balance in the account affects producer and packer rights and obligations under the contract.""  Carcass merit premiums and discount schedules (including the determination of the lean percent or other merits of the carcass that are used to determine the amount of the premiums and discounts and how those premiums and discounts are applied).  Use and amount of noncarcass merit premiums and discounts. A noncarcass merit premium or discount is defined in 9 CFR 206.1 as ""An increase or decrease in the price for the purchase of swine offered by an individual packer or packing plant, based on any factor other than the characteristics of the carcass, if the actual amount of the premium or discount is known before the purchase and delivery of the swine."" How do I document verbal contracts?  Verbal contracts must be documented with written descriptions for all terms. See Verbal Contract Optional Documentation Sheet Form PSP-343 (pdf) and PSP-343 Instructions (pdf). This form outlines a basic set of contract terms. When is the monthly report due?  AMS must receive your reports by the close of business (4:30 p.m. Central Time) on the fifteenth of each month. If due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, submit your monthly report no later than the close of the next business day following the fifteenth. What information do I need to provide in the monthly report?  You must complete a separate monthly report for each plant that meets the definition of a packer in 9 CFR 206.1. You classify each example contract when you submit it. Classify each existing contract you list in the monthly report the same way you classified the example contract that represents it. In this report, provide estimates of the number of swine committed for delivery. Include all existing contracts, aggregated by contract type. Additionally, you must project the maximum possible number of swine that producers could deliver during each of the 12 months following the report date. Include all existing contracts, aggregated by contract type. The contract types are:  Swine or pork market formula purchases with a ledger.  Swine or pork market formula purchases without a ledger.  Other market formula purchases with a ledger.  Other market formula purchases without a ledger.  Other purchase arrangement with a ledger.  Other purchase arrangement without a ledger. Every existing contract must be represented by an example contract. If an existing contract is not represented by an example contract, contact AMS for information on submitting contracts. What if a contract does not specify the number of swine committed?  Estimate expected and potential deliveries based on the best information available to you. For example, it might include the producer's current and projected swine inventories, as well as the producer’s planned production. When do I change previously reported estimates? Do not change previously reported estimates. Base current estimates of deliveries on the most accurate information available at the time you prepare the report. Where and how do I file a waiver request?  If you do not use marketing agreements to procure swine, you may obtain a waiver from the monthly report requirement. Otherwise, your monthly report would consist of zero estimate deliveries under existing contracts. Submit a waiver request in writing. Include a statement that you do not procure swine using marketing agreements. Send the waiver request to address listed below. If AMS approves the request, we will inform you in writing that we granted you a waiver for 12 months. If you begin using marketing agreements during the waiver period, the waiver becomes void, and you must begin submitting monthly reports. Where and how do I submit contracts and monthly reports?  Submit example contracts, notification of expired or withdrawn contracts, and monthly reports to: Hardcopy USDA-AMS , Suite 317 Des Moines, Iowa 50309 Fax Email SwineContractLibrary@usda.gov What are the penalties for not complying? Willfully failing or refusing to provide accurate information constitutes a violation of the P&S Act (Section 222e). See Section 203 for the authorized procedures and maximum penalty that the Secretary may assess against any packer that violated or is violating a provision of Title II of the P&S Act.

"Organic Sound and Sensible Initiative: Spanish Resources  The Agricultural Marketing Service’s (AMS) National Organic Program (NOP) works every day to ensure that products with the USDA organic seal meet consistent, uniform standards. In addition to its rigorous certification process and oversight to protect the integrity of the organic seal, the program also connects organic farmers and businesses with resources to help them understand and comply with the standards. In recent years, increasing numbers of Spanish speaking farmers and businesses have entered the organic sector. For example, among all operations located outside of the United States that are certified under the USDA organic regulations, 42 percent are in Spanish speaking countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Meanwhile, within the United States, the number of Hispanic producers, many of whom speak Spanish as their primary language, increased 21 percent between 2007 and 2012.

"Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services in  Food and Nutrition  Trade  May 11, 2012   USDA’s food assistance and development programs serve a dual purpose: to meet the immediate needs of hungry people, and to show their countries how to rejuvenate their agricultural sectors and increase their capacity to trade. We accomplish these goals in cooperation with other U.S. government agencies and with private-sector partners ranging from non-governmental organizations to research institutions to agribusinesses. And we are always looking for ways to be more effective. So this week, at the International Food Aid and Development Conference (IFADC) in Kansas City, we got back to basics, discussing steps we are taking to operate our international aid programs more efficiently to ensure that program dollars go directly to eliminating hunger and poverty. We focused on how USDA can strengthen our partnerships with academia and international relief and development groups, as well as with local and international companies. After all, these organizations have the know-how and expertise that allows USDA to leverage limited funding to make a broad and enduring impact. Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Services Michael Scuse at 2012 International Food Aid and Development Conference. (Photo Credit: Epi Yanez, USDA/Farm Service Agency/Kansas City) Food for Progress is just one of the programs through which USDA is successfully partnering with the private sector. Among the efforts currently underway as part of that program: This year, East African Breweries, a subsidiary of the Diageo Corporation, will buy sorghum from Ugandan farmers for its in-country processing facility. Thanks to a USDA grant, Mercy Corps is providing the farmers with technical assistance and training to help them access financial services, increase their yields and market their crops. We joined with TechnoServe and Cargill to strengthen Mozambique’s poultry and feed industries, creating a successful model that TechnoServe is now replicating in Kenya with additional USDA support. In Tanzania, USDA and Catholic Relief Services are working with maize farmers to introduce soybean intercropping and also connect the farmers with private buyers. With technical support from USDA, U.S. trade associations, and non-profit charitable organizations, Imperial Foods Company in Cameroon is manufacturing affordable and nutritious noodles for the commercial market and for food aid, using imported U.S. commodities and other ingredients. The IFADC is the only annual event to bring together U.S. interests involved in providing international food assistance from farm to table. About 450 people from 20 countries attended this year’s event, where I was honored to deliver keynote remarks.

"USDA FNS SWRO Public Affairs Specialist in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 10, 2011   On May 26, I got to go back home to the Rio Grande Valley – the southernmost region in the continental United States – to help promote new sites for the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). The SFSP provides free, nutritious meals and snacks to help children in low-income neighborhoods get the nutrition they need to learn, play, and grow, throughout the summer months when they are out of school. My agency, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service, along with our state partner, the Texas Department of Agriculture, collaborated with local leaders from the Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley to bring SFSP feeding sites to the area, where unemployment figures are the highest in Texas and many families struggle to make ends meet. Local San Juan area children sample the nutritious meals that will be distributed to more than 1,500 children at feeding sites this summer. Along with Catholic leaders and local elected officials, we held a press conference in the historic national shrine of the Basilica of Our Lady of San Juan Del Valle. The shrine located in San Juan is the most visited site in the Rio Grande Valley, where parishioners visit in times of crisis or to give thanks for prayers answered.  We felt it was appropriate to launch our new feeding initiative at the shrine since so many see it as a symbol of hope. Catholic Bishop Daniel Flores opened the press conference with a blessing to more than 100 people in attendance. Local school children from the San Juan area were invited to sample food that will be served by the SFSP’s vendor, Chapita’s, and participate in special games – which would be similar to the feeding site activities. My agency is grateful that Catholic Charities has agreed to sponsor 25 feeding locations this summer. Sites are located throughout Cameron, Hidalgo and Willacy counties. An estimated 1,500 children will be served snacks and/or lunches. We appreciate Catholic Charities for going above and beyond with the SFSP. The agency partnered with other communities to set up sites in rural areas and colonias (unincorporated areas outside of cities where there is no running water or sewage system). Those residents have a hard time getting access to assistance. We at the USDA Food and Nutrition Service are committed to President Barack Obama’s goal of ending childhood hunger, and Catholic Charities will help us reach that goal by providing the staff to administer these meals to children. Last year in Texas 2.3 million children qualified for free and reduced-price meals in the National School Lunch Program, which makes the neighborhoods they live in eligible to participate in SFSP. Only 162,636 Texas children (less than 7 percent) took part in SFSP in 2010. Our agency would like to thank representatives from the Texas Department of Agriculture, Texas Health and Human Services Commission, the office of U.S. Representative Blake Farenthold (R-Brownsville) and the office of U.S. Representative Ruben Hinojosa (D-McAllen) for joining us that afternoon and underscoring the need to support this program. We also got a nice proclamation from the City of San Juan, which honored Catholic Charities for stepping up to feed children in the area.

"USDA Director of Communications in  Conservation  Sep 04, 2015  Across our 175 national forests and grasslands, we provide American people and visitors from across the world opportunities for both adventure and solitude. Conservation of our nation’s natural resources is at the heart of USDA’s mission.  Our work on public and private lands supports clean air, clean water, and thriving wildlife habitat.  These conservation efforts strengthen rural economies by providing farmers and ranchers the resources they need to thrive and feed our nation. And this conservation allows us to support gateway communities and a robust recreation economy.   USDA's management of our national forests and our support for farmers’ and ranchers’ stewardship of private working lands helps us meet our moral obligation to the next generation to leave our land, water, and wildlife better than we found it. It’s an exciting time for conservation, and this month, we’ll focus our story on our collaborative efforts that will ensure our national forests and private working lands are conserved, restored, and made more resilient to climate change. Today, USDA is focused more than ever before on partner-based solutions to drive our conservation efforts.  NRCS is calling on farmers, ranchers, partner organizations, and local government to drive our Farm Bill investments through the innovative Regional Conservation Partnership Program, or RCPP.  Earlier this year, we announced 115 partner-driven projects in which we’ll invest more than $370 million, which is being matched by our partners.  These projects enable tribes, landowners, and an array of conservation partners improve soil health, water quality and efficiency, wildlife habitat, and other resource concerns.  We’ve just finished reviewing our second round of preproposals, and are excited by our partners’ continued commitment to leading the way. These partnership efforts are helping USDA drive solutions that work for sportsmen, producers, wildlife, and local communities.  NRCS and the Forest Service are leading the way in efforts to foster landscape-level conservation, and our sage-grouse efforts are a great example.  Last month, Secretary Vilsack announced a long-term strategy for NRCS’s investments in sage-grouse efforts on private lands through the Sage Grouse Initiatives; efforts that have already helped 1,129 ranchers conserve and restore 4.4 million acres of sage-grouse habitat.  At the same time, the Forest Service has been developing forest plans that support healthy sagebrush ecosystems as part of its multiple-use mandate. Our legacy will be to restore lands stressed by climate change, drought and fire.  Climate change has led to fire seasons that are longer and more severe. The cost of fighting these fires, largely borne by the Forest Service, is straining its budget and dramatically impacting its ability to devote resources to restoration, recreation and watershed protection efforts, many of which can actually help mitigate the stresses of climate change, drought and fire.  The devastating impacts of short- and long-term drought are hampering agricultural operations and threatening habitat.  In the face of these challenges, we are working with farmers and ranchers to make their operations more resilient through soil health and water conservation practices, and working with communities to restore their forest and meadows to ensure downstream water quality and quantity. Across our 175 national forests and grasslands, we provide American people and visitors from across the world opportunities for both adventure and solitude, laboratories to teach children about the wonders of nature and the campgrounds for families to bond.  Our national forests support a vibrant recreation economy that supports hundreds of thousands of jobs across urban and rural America and enhancing access to these lands is a priority that will ensure that generations to come can experience the great outdoors. In addition, this year we are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).  This federally-funded voluntary program contracts with agricultural producers so that environmentally-sensitive land is not farmed or ranched, but instead used for conservation benefits.  The program reached a major milestone this year when USDA announced that the number of acres conserved by the CRP State Acres for Wildlife reached the one million mark. There are currently 24 million acres enrolled in CRP overall. The efforts produced by CRP partners prevents more than 8 billion tons of soil from eroding, reduces nitrogen and phosphorous runoff relative to cropland by 95 and 85 percent respectively, and even sequesters 43 million tons of greenhouse gases annually, equal to taking 8 million cars off the road. And through our work in quantifying the environmental benefits of conservation--like clean water and air, flood prevention, healthy soils, and wildlife habitat--we're leading the way in supporting environmental markets that can sell or trade those benefits, providing yet another opportunity for people to put conservation on the ground.  These markets are proof positive that the conservation efforts we support make financial sense, and through innovative efforts like the NRCS Conservation Innovation Grant program, we're helping develop of many of the nation’s leading environmental markets for water quality and carbon. USDA has a significant role to play in protecting our air and water, restoring and conserving habitat for wildlife, fostering strong and resilient farming and ranching operations, and supporting thriving recreation and agricultural economies.  We take this responsibility seriously, and in the face of climate change and urbanization, are committed to conserving our resources to support thriving landscapes and robust agriculture for present and future generations.  We look forward to sharing some of these stories with you this month. Today, USDA is focused more than ever before on partner-based solutions to drive our conservation efforts.

"Posted by acampbell in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Sep 17, 2009   On an early fall day when the rain refused to pass farmers and producers from the DC-metropolitan region gathered for the opening of the FRESHFARM Market by the White House on Vermont Ave. Federal employees, area workers and out-of-town visitors gathered for the festivities despite the weather and were excited for the new program. In response to a lively crowd, First Lady Michelle Obama admitted, “I’ve never seen so many people excited about fruits and vegetables!” At the event, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced 86 awardees of the 2009 Farmers Market Promotion Program totaling more than $4.5 million to help continue the spread of farmer’s markets across the nation. “Fifteen years ago there were only 1,700 farmer’s markets and today we have more than 4,700,” said Secretary Vilsack. Since 1996 USDA has hosted a farmer’s market at 12th and Jefferson Avenue, and Deputy Secretary Merrigan’s announcement yesterday of a pilot program to serve healthy and nutritious foods offers yet another opportunity to eat local for federal employees. Farmer’s markets provide more than an opportunity to purchase healthy, local products and goods; they also allow you to connect with the community. Walking through the vendors, I recognized a familiar face that was the mother of a great childhood friend. It’s so easy to become distracted with busy schedules and to-do lists; why not take an hour to shop for local goods and become reacquainted with your community, new or old. Beyond food, there was plenty for crafters and casual passerby. Loudoun County’s Solitude Yarns will be at the FRESHFARM Market through October selling yarns made and dyed locally. Bonus – they offered to help with my latest knitting project should I have any issues! Beautiful locally grown flowers lined the market, sure to catch anyone’s eye. Secretary Vilsack acknowledged the Obama Administration’s commitment to health and agricultural issues but closed in saying “ With all do respect to my President, I love the commitment of the First Lady as she helped break ground at our People’s Garden and continues the message.” Farmer’s markets allow local food to become a part of a community’s culture. Secretary Vilsack noted that many people know the importance of local and regional food systems, others simply like having a fresh and healthy alternative. We’re hearing a lot of great stories from people visiting the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food YouTube playlist. There have been a number of announcements this week and we’re looking ahead to a new web site to educate consumers and connect people more closely with the farmers.

"Listening to Business Leaders from York, PA  On Friday afternoon, I sat down with business leaders from York County, Pennsylvania to get their input on how the Federal government can work with them to improve economic conditions and create jobs.  Among the participants were members of the York Area Chamber of Commerce, as well as representatives from marketing, computer technology, and renewable energy manufacturing industries. The session, the most recent in an ongoing series of White House Business Council meetings, was hosted by Alan Shortall, CEO of Unilife Corporation, a manufacturer and supplier of advanced safety medical syringes.   Have you heard people talk about companies moving off-shore to China?  Well, Alan told the reverse tale, as he kicked off our meeting.  His company moved their manufacturing operation from China to the United States because of our high-end engineering expertise, which Alan argued, is an unmatched core competency of the United States.   Since it set up shop in Pennsylvania in 2006, Unilife has employed 200 people and this number is expected to double by 2015.  Not only are these good jobs and critical to the economy of York, but Alan said he will be spending at least $40 million on US purchases of equipment in the next year.  Now, that’s stimulus!

"Food and Nutrition  Research and Science  Jul 07, 2010   Director, National Institute of Food and Agriculture Yesterday’s Science Tuesday post about growing tomatoes that last longer on the shelf in the store or on the kitchen counter has generated much really useful discussion about the role of science in growing our food supply.  Science in the U.S. is a social enterprise, and the decisions about what technologies are appropriate and acceptable are societal, not purely scientific decisions, so this conversation is critically important to us all. This particular research – though it was conducted using state-of-the-art genetic technologies – gives  us a  window into the genetic make-up of tomatoes that we can then use to breed tomatoes that are tasteful and nutritious, and are in every way like the home-grown tomatoes we grow and love in our own gardens but that don’t rot as quickly.  The science is agnostic – you can breed these kinds of tomatoes the conventional way, or you can use genetic engineering to achieve the same ends.  It will take longer using traditional plant breeding, but you’ll still get a flavorful, colorful tomato that just happens to last longer, the same way that generations of plant breeders and home gardeners have selected tomato varieties that are purple, or yellow, or weigh a pound apiece. Genetic engineering can speed up the process with the same outcomes. I recognize the benefits of a local food supply – in fact, last week’s Science Tuesday post described a program in Sacramento that my agency, NIFA, funded to expand the local marketplace for immigrant strawberry farmers. However, I also realize that not everyone has access to fresh, local produce at prices they can afford. One of the many benefits of research like this is that it makes it feasible and economical to make fresh food more widely available to many more people. One of my goals as director of NIFA is to invest in science that will help us boost U.S. agricultural production and improve our capacity to meet the growing food demand – here in the United States and around the world. Science, such as applied in this research on tomatoes, is the only way we can hope to solve the world’s current food needs, let alone the food challenges of the future:  We don’t have the luxury of not using every tool in our toolkit with people’s lives and well being at stake.

"NRCS Virginia in  Conservation  Oct 06, 2011   Like the mythical phoenix, the very real longleaf pine is rising from the ashes of near-extinction to reclaim its native range in Virginia with the help of committed partners and landowners like Bill Owen. A musician by profession, Owen is a conservationist at heart who still lives in the family home in Yale, Va. By working with a team of six agencies, including USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, he hopes to realize his dream of planting 1,000 contiguous acres of longleaf pine in his lifetime. Bill Owen has completed several controlled burns on his longleaf pine stands through a burn contract with NRCS. Longleaf pine forests once covered approximately 1 million acres in Virginia south of the James River, stretching southward through nine states. But by 2007, only about 2,000 of the trees were left in the entire state, on less than 400 acres. This decline can be attributed to many factors, including the clearing of land for early settlement and the harvesting of trees for turpentine, pitch and pine tar used in shipbuilding. With assistance from NRCS through its Longleaf Pine Initiative (LLPI), Owen has already planted just over 300 acres of this formerly abundant tree in Sussex County and 100 acres in Surry County. These new stands help to restore the rich longleaf ecosystem, which is home to at least 122 endangered or threatened plant and animal species across the Southeast, including the fox squirrel, northern bobwhite, red-cockaded woodpecker and gopher tortoise. Longleaf pine is a fire-dependent ecosystem, and controlled burning is preferred for the trees to thrive. The Virginia Departments of Forestry (VDOF), Conservation and Recreation and Game and Inland Fisheries have stepped in to assist with controlled burns on Owen’s plantings. VDOF has also assisted with aerial herbicide applications and funding through its Pine Bark Beetle Prevention Program. Bill Owen (left) confers with Smithfield District Conservationist Mike Faulk on the site of his Surry County plantings.  Owen has a vision for the future of longleaf pine. In 2007, he worked with The Nature Conservancy to place 1,400 acres of his property in a conservation easement. The easement allows Owen to retain ownership of the land while protecting it from future development. The Nature Conservancy helps manage this protected land, which forms the core of the Raccoon Creek Pinelands Conservation Area, one of Virginia’s premier longleaf pine restoration sites. “I just think longleaf pines are magnificent trees,” says the 57-year-old church and choral music director. “They’re like the Sequoias of the East Coast, living up to 400 years or more, and are at the very center of a complex ecosystem which we are trying to re-establish.” Find out more information about NRCS’ Healthy Forest Reserve Program Check out more conservation stories on the USDA blog Follow NRCS on Twitter  Category/Topic:  Conservation  Tags:  Conservation  Healthy Forest Reserve Program  Longleaf Pine Initiative  NRCS  Pine Bark Beetle Prevention Program  Virginia  Yale","Here is a concise question related to the content: What key species, such as the red-cockaded woodpecker and gopher tortoise, benefit from conservation efforts that restore longleaf pine forests in Virginia?","At least 122 endangered or threatened plant and animal species, including the fox squirrel, northern bobwhite, red-cockaded woodpecker, and gopher tortoise."

"Chief of Public Affairs, USDA Farm Service Agency in  Energy  Apr 09, 2012  Giant miscanthus in early stages of growth. The sterile grass plant will grow to heights of 8-12 feet. When harvested, giant miscanthus can be compacted into pellets for a durable, safe and environmentally friendly renewable energy source. There’s a lot that a farmer can grow in northeast Arkansas.  Most producers choose rice and cotton.  Some plant soybeans, corn and sorghum; row crops, mostly, according to Charles Glover, manager, Ritter Agribusiness. Glover works with landowners, their tenants and producers who farm 40,000 acres between Jonesboro, Ark., and Memphis, Tenn., much of it in Poinsett County. Poinsett County, says Glover, is the second leading rice producing county in the United States. So why is Glover participating in the USDA Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA)?  And why is he considering converting some of that farmland to giant miscanthus, a non-food crop that is becoming a popular biomass energy source? “For our landowners right now, it’s pure economics.  We have an asset in our land, and miscanthus has an opportunity to be the best use of that part of our land,” says Glover. The farm manager says many of the acres producing rice and cotton are irrigated.  There are fields where irrigation doesn’t work.  Land that lies near power lines, for instance.  Other crops won’t produce well on non-irrigated soil.  Giant miscanthus might.  That’s what Glover and the landowners are hoping. “I visited with folks from MFA, then talked to our landowners and told them what the program was and they just agreed to try.” MFA Oil Biomass, LLC, is the BCAP project area sponsor in Arkansas.  A BCAP project area is a designated geographic area or a set of counties in this case where a specific amount of acreage is approved for producing a biomass crop.  The biomass crop in this BCAP project area is giant miscanthus, a sterile, thick grass that grows up to 12 feet tall.  When harvested, dried and compressed into pellets, it burns efficiently and is far friendlier to the climate than fossil fuels. “The Obama Administration is committed to finding alternatives to oil that we have to buy from foreign nations,” says Arkansas FSA State Executive Director Linda Newkirk. “We are proud of the BCAP efforts taking place in our state.  We know we are making a significant contribution when we are encouraging production of a non-food, renewable energy crop that science tells us burns cleaner than fossil fuels.  And in the meantime, BCAP helps Arkansas add jobs and new sources of income for our farmers.” FSA granted Arkansas’s sponsor, MFA Oil Biomass, LLC, 6,588 acres to grow miscanthus. Glover says it wasn’t hard to sell BCAP to the landowners and farmers because they weren’t making much money on their marginal land anyway.  “Input costs are so high.  Without irrigation, we weren’t making much on the land.”  He says with miscanthus, there’s not much outlay of capital, so BCAP becomes a win-win for everybody. Glover admits he doesn’t know if the crop will succeed.  The farmers were prepared to plant the miscanthus rhizomes in the first week of April if weather conditions remained suitable.  After that, it will be at least two years before they expect to harvest their first crop, and that one won’t be as good as the next one and the one after that if the predictions are right. The major benefit of giant miscanthus growing on the farmers’ marginal soil is that it produces a crop for up to 20 years without replanting.  “Those are low capital inputs to produce a profit,” says Glover.  That’s what excites him and the others about the crop.  “If it works, there will be a lot of acres that we can put into miscanthus.” Glover says the farms that he manages have committed 260 acres to the BCAP project area.  And, no, he and the producers wouldn’t have committed the acres without the support of FSA and its BCAP program. The knowledge that MFA Oil Biomass, LLC, was building a conversion facility in the area made the difference, Glover says.  Otherwise, without the facility there wouldn’t be a market for their giant miscanthus.  It’s a partnership. Newkirk concurs.  The project area sponsor and FSA have an important business stake in BCAP.  Energy independence is going to take work and incentives to plant renewable crops, says Newkirk. “There is no short-term solution to our energy needs.  We need to invest in longer term solutions that assure our children and our children’s children that there will be adequate, affordable and safe energy for their future.” About the future with giant miscanthus, Glover says, “I’d like you to call me back in two years and let me tell you a glowing story.”  Category/Topic:  Energy  Tags:  Arkansas  Biomass Crop Assistance Program  Energy  FSA","Here is a concise question based on the content: What is the primary economic motivation for Charles Glover, manager of Ritter Agribusiness, to consider converting marginal farmland into giant miscanthus production under the USDA Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP)?","The primary economic motivation for Charles Glover to consider converting marginal farmland into giant miscanthus production is ""pure economics"", specifically due to low capital inputs and potential profit without irrigation, making it a better use of that part of their land."

"in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 01, 2015  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack listens to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) supervisory plant physiologist Dr. Jerry Hatfield explain the equipment to gather information on climate changes and impacts on corn and soybean plants in Iowa. As world leaders gather in Paris this week to negotiate a new global climate agreement, it is important to recognize the contributions of farmers, ranchers and foresters in the United States towards achieving a more food secure world while adapting to climate change, increasing carbon sequestration, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.   Over the course of my tenure as Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture, U.S. producers have faced a record drought, which the University of California estimates has cost farmers in California alone an estimated $3 billion in 2015. We’ve seen increasing incursions of invasive pests and diseases and extreme weather, everything from bark beetle to severe droughts, which have cost billions in lost productivity. We’ve faced a series of record wildfire seasons in the western United States—the worst decade in U.S. history for wildfire. The growing El Nino weather pattern in the Pacific has created the perfect storm for disasters to strike the already damaged and weakened western landscape. Tomorrow in Paris at COP 21, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will release a new report, titled Climate Change, Global Food Security, and the U.S. Food System. This report will outline the impacts of climate change on global food security, including food availability, access, utilization, and stability. Never before has agriculture faced challenges of this magnitude. We’ve all seen the statistics: Nine billion people by 2050. Feeding these new citizens will require at least a 60 percent increase in agricultural productivity. We must do all of this in the face of climate change that is threatening the productivity and profitability of our farms, ranches and forests. As we embark on our efforts, we have found that one of the first steps is to educate and inform our farmers, ranchers, and forest land managers – and our own USDA professional staff in the field – about climate change and the threats posed to our resources and the opportunities to contribute to solutions. For example, earlier this year, USDA announced our 10 Building Blocks for Climate Smart Agriculture, a comprehensive set of voluntary programs and initiatives that we expect to reduce net emissions and enhance carbon sequestration by over 120 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent by 2025 - about 2 percent of economy-wide emissions, building upon a U.S. government-wide commitment to emission reduction. And through efforts by the federal government and a broad coalition of partners, the United States has restored more than 9 million hectares of lost or degraded forest since 2011 – more than half way to our Bonn Challenge commitment of restoring 15 million hectares by 2020. We are promoting the building blocks strategy through our extension and technical service providers. To support our efforts, we have established a network of regional climate hubs to analyze risks and deliver localized information to help farmers adapt to climate change. We continue to support research into technologies and practices that will reduce climate risks. We are moving rapidly to integrate climate change into our domestic conservation and renewable energy programs. Collectively, these efforts make U.S. agriculture and forestry a more publicly visible part of the climate change solution in the United States and abroad. They demonstrate to the world that these sectors can provide solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while simultaneously boosting productivity to meet growing demands for food and fiber, stimulating the rural economy, and offering compatible environmental and economic benefits. We don’t face these challenges in a vacuum. These same conditions have dire effects across the world, especially for poor, rural smallholder farmers in developing nations. Drought in the western United States and drought in Central America threaten farmers and livelihoods, disrupt communities, and strain food systems. Increasing climate threats, whether it is drought, high temperatures, increases in pests, or wildfire, are separate symptoms of the same problem. That is why the United States is committed to sharing information globally. The lessons we learn, we want to share through the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture. Through our collective efforts, agriculture can make meaningful contributions to the effort to limit global temperature increases to less than two degrees Celsius. We are also proud of our efforts through the Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition initiative, which supports efforts to make data available, accessible, and usable for unrestricted use worldwide. USDA also directly supports international cooperation and development projects to help promote climate-smart agriculture. For example, last year we supported 11 Borlaug Fellows to work on climate change topics. This program allows agricultural scientists from around the world to work side-by-side with U.S. scientists on finding ways to increase food production while mitigating the effects of climate change. In order to address climate change, we have to get ahead of it, and I’m convinced that no one innovates in the face of challenge better than agriculture. This will not be an easy task, but I am confident that working together and building on a legacy of partnership, efficiency and innovation, the Alliance members and other interested parties will continue to strive to achieve the three important goals of climate-smart agriculture: achieving food security, sustainably increasing agricultural productivity, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, where possible. Food security has implications far beyond what’s on our plates. A more food-secure, nourished world, able to feed itself and the future, is essential to the long-term prosperity and security of individuals, communities, economies, and nations.

"USDA Iowa Public Information Officer in  Initiatives  Rural  Aug 30, 2010  Secretary Vilsack meets USDA Intern and Drake student Jessie Scott during a recent visit to Iowa.  It's hard to beat a summertime filled with spending time with family and friends, traveling to new places, enjoying the outdoors and sometimes just relaxing. For college students, the summer is also a great time to gain valuable professional experiences. Jessie Scott, a 2008 graduate of Iowa Valley High School (Marengo, Iowa) and junior this fall at Drake University in Des Moines, has been gaining valuable professional experiences as a communications intern with USDA Rural Development. A highlight of Scott's internship occurred earlier this month when she received a personalized coin medallion from Agriculture Secretary and former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack as a token of USDA's appreciation for her time with the agency. ""We really appreciate the impact of young people on USDA and hope we can keep talented people like Jessie in our agency,"" Vilsack said. During the summer Scott has worked at USDA Rural Development's State Office in Des Moines.  She has helped coordinate public events, write news releases, develop feature stories, create newsletters, update agency brochures, as well as complete numerous other communications assignments. ""Internships are tremendous opportunities for students to receive hands-on learning,"" said Bill Menner, USDA Rural Development State Director in Iowa.  ""It has been a pleasure working with Jessie this summer. She has excelled as a communications specialist with our agency and has a tremendous future ahead of her."" The USDA is always looking for new ways to encourage the younger generation to take an active role in federal government.  This is why the USDA offers internships to give college students, like Jessie, a chance to learn and benefit from an employee's guidance and knowledge, and to use their skills to help strengthen the USDA. High school students also have the opportunity to assist the USDA through a cub reporter program where they research and write about important projects and programs. ""USDA recognizes the importance of youth and the great contribution their ideas and actions will have on this country,"" said Vilsack.  ""We are pleased that we are able to brighten their futures and to know that they will strengthen ours.""  To find out more about a career at USDA click here.

"Food and Nutrition  Trade  May 20, 2010   Today marks the release of the Feed the Future Initiative Guide during the Chicago Council of Global Affairs’ Symposium on Global Agriculture and Food Security. This guide lays out the implementation strategy for the U.S. government’s global hunger and food security initiative. USDA has been actively engaged in the development of the Feed the Future strategy from its inception and created an inter-departmental food security council that has contributed to the Feed the Future strategy and provided reviews of country investment plans. In Washington, DC today, Secretary Vilsack gave a speech on the importance of global food security during the symposium. During the symposium, Secretary Vilsack joined leaders of various U.S. Government agencies and world development groups to discuss U.S. food security and agricultural development policy in conjunction with this initiative. Secretary Vilsack touched on how many of USDA’s strengths would contribute immensely to this initiative, specifically the Department’s capacity to conduct and promote research, as well as contribute in the area of institutional capacity building. Vilsack emphasized that USDA’s global food security strategy focuses on a number of interventions needed to increase global food production and increase the incomes of the poor. His speech focused on two of these areas: 1) research and extension, and 2) building capacity through assistance, sound public policies and institutions.  USDA have been working with U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to develop a global agricultural research agenda that addresses some of the fundamental constraints that contribute to food insecurity, such as pests, disease and weather in major food crops and livestock products. The strategy will also focus on increasing agricultural productivity and improving soil and water use efficiency. Ensuring food security goes beyond just producing food—it also involves providing access to food, through trade, private investment in the agri-food sector, improving food safety and nutrition, and developing and deploying new technologies. USDA also offers fellowships to train scientists and faculty exchange programs to train agricultural faculty and develop adult education programs.  Creating a vibrant global food system, where all people have enough to eat, where farmers, wherever they are located, are profitable and are sustainable, is an important goal for USDA. USDA sees our engagement in Feed the Future as central to achieving that goal, and we believe that our unique capacities in research, extension, and institutional capacity building can make an important contribution to this initiative.  Learn more about the Feed the Future Initiative at FeedtheFuture.gov.

"Spotting of Rare Snake in Georgia Shows Conservation Works  A recent sighting of a threatened snake in Georgia by partners of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) shows how conservation work helps wildlife. The Orianne Society and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, two key NRCS partners, spotted an Eastern indigo snake in an area where NRCS and landowners have worked together to restore wetlands, an ecosystem where the species typically spends several months of the year. The Eastern indigo snake is a large nonvenomous snake found in Georgia and Florida. Its historic range also included Mississippi, Alabama and South Carolina, and it’s the nation’s longest native snake. The snake was listed as threatened in 1978 because of a lack of habitat and people capturing for pets or killing them.

"U.S. Agricultural Production Systems of the Future: What Research is Needed Now?  Depending on where you live in the United States, the first thing that likely comes to mind for agriculture production systems are the large fields of corn, soybeans, wheat or cotton seen growing each summer. But spend a few minutes looking at CropScape, a color-coded map that charts where almost a hundred different types of U.S. crops are grown currently, and you begin to appreciate the diversity and regionality of production systems. This map shows that although there are U.S. regions where crop production is dominated by a few commodity crops, there are others where U.S. farmers are growing a wide array of fruit, vegetables, and other “specialty” crops. Agricultural Atlas maps produced by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service show similar diversity in livestock production, including land in pasture and range production.

"Secretary Announces Pilot Program to Provide More Water for Haying and Grazing, Memorandum to Improve Drought Weather Forecasting  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. 0358.12  Contact:Office of Communications   WASHINGTON, Dec. 13, 2012—Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's measures to open conservation land to emergency haying and grazing during the 2012 drought freed up a record 2.8 million acres and provided as much as $200 million in forage for producers facing critical feed shortages. Vilsack made the announcement during the national drought forum in Washington, D.C. co-sponsored by numerous federal agencies, governors' associations and academic partners.""The Obama Administration remains committed to doing everything it can to help farmers, ranchers, businesses, and local and county governments meet drought-related challenges,"" said Vilsack. ""Now we know that the actions taken by USDA and other federal agencies at the height of the drought provided much-needed flexibility during a difficult time. We also know that drought recovery is a long-term proposition, and we will continue to partner with producers to see it through.""At the height of the 2012 drought, the Secretary announced expanded use of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres for haying and grazing including a two-month extension for emergency grazing on CRP acres without incurring an additional CRP rental payment reduction. By providing this flexibility, USDA freed up forage and feed to benefit all livestock producers during a critical period, on top of additional USDA actions, including lowering the interest rate for emergency loans and working with crop insurance companies to provide flexibility to farmers.USDA's Farm Service Agency reported to the Secretary today that roughly 2.8 million acres under 57,000 CRP contracts utilized the emergency haying and grazing option, compared to just over 1 million acres in 2011. In 2005, producers utilized roughly 1.7 million CRP acres for emergency haying and grazing, the previous record. USDA estimates of the gross value of forage provided in 2012 run from $140 million to $200 million.Additionally, Secretary Vilsack noted that over the period of the recently expired Farm Bill, conservation systems installed with support from NRCS programs reduced water withdrawn from the Ogallala Aquifer by at least 860,000 acre feet. This is more than enough water to cover the area of Washington D.C. nearly 20 feet deep and is equivalent to the domestic water use of approximately 9.6 million individuals for a year (based on USGS estimated use of 80 gallons per person per day). The quantity represents about 1.1 percent of the total groundwater irrigation withdrawals from the aquifer over the same period. At the agricultural sales level from the 2007 Census of Agriculture, an extension of aquifer life of 1.1 percent would transfer into sales ""today"" of about $82 million. These reduced water withdrawals have also resulted in a related energy savings of the equivalent of at least 18 million gallons of diesel fuel.The NRCS Ogallala Aquifer Initiative supported over one-quarter of these reduced withdrawals, approximately 238,000 acre feet, and achieved these reductions in the most sensitive areas of States in the Ogallala region. Funding through the initiative is targeted to areas where there has been a significant (over 25 foot) decline in the level of the aquifer or where there is a significant vulnerability for contamination of the aquifer through groundwater recharge.The Secretary also announced today a new pilot program administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Kansas and Colorado to remove sediments from ponds to restore their water holding to previous capacities. This will allow livestock producers and irrigators to store water longer allowing better management of their resources. Part of the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), the pilot provides an additional conservation option for producers who face drought-related issues on their agricultural operations. Also, for the current fiscal year, NRCS has made available over $16 million through the EQIP program to farmers and ranchers for water conservation, practices, and wildlife habitat that have been affected by the drought. Those funds are in addition to the over $27 million provided to farmers ranchers in 22 states for drought mitigation during fiscal year 2012.While USDA's efforts during the drought have delivered assistance to those who need it most, Vilsack noted that the Department is hampered in its efforts by lack of a Farm Bill and he urged Congress to take action so that programs that could assist affected producers could be used to help them. Vilsack also announced that, in the wake of a series of regional drought conferences with farmers, ranchers, business owners and other stakeholders, a memorandum of understanding is being entered into with the Department of Commerce, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), to improve sharing of data and expertise, monitoring networks, and drought forecasting efforts. The MOU is a direct outcome of the regional conferences, Vilsack said. In recent months, USDA has partnered with local governments, colleges, state and federal partners to conduct a series of regional drought workshops. Hundreds of producers met with government officials to discuss needs, and programs available to them. Vilsack kicked off the first meeting in Nebraska, and additional meetings were held in Colorado, Arkansas, and Ohio.In addition, nearly 2,000 producers have taken advantage of funding from NRCS. So far, these drought recovery efforts have impacted over a million acres of farmland.In recent months, USDA has also announced: Purchased approximately $170 million of pork, lamb, chicken, and catfish for federal food nutrition assistance programs, including food banks, to help relieve pressure on American livestock producers and bring the nation's meat supply in line with demand. Updated the emergency loans application process to allow these loans to be made earlier in the season. Filed special provisions with the federal crop insurance program to allow haying or grazing of cover crops without impacting the insurability of planted 2013 spring crops. Authorized up to $5 million in grants to evaluate and demonstrate agricultural practices that help farmers and ranchers adapt to drought. Granted a temporary variance from the National Organic Program's pasture practice standards for organic ruminant livestock producers in drought impacted states in 2012. Authorized $16 million in existing funds from its Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program (WHIP) and Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) to target states experiencing exceptional and extreme drought. Transferred $14 million in unobligated program funds into the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) to help farmers and ranchers rehabilitate farmland damaged by natural disasters and for carrying out emergency water conservation measures in periods of severe drought. USDA worked with crop insurance companies to provide flexibility to farmers, and one-third of all policyholders took advantage of the extended payment period. Authorized haying and grazing of Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) easement areas in drought-affected areas where haying and grazing is consistent with conservation of wildlife habitat and wetlands. Lowered the reduction in the annual rental payment to producers on CRP acres used for emergency haying or grazing from 25 percent to 10 percent in 2012. Simplified the Secretarial disaster designation process and reduced the time it takes to designate counties affected by disasters by 40 percent.The National Drought Forum is co-sponsored by: NOAA, USDA, EPA, DOI, FEMA, National Drought Mitigation Center, National Integrated Drought Information System, Western Governors' Association, Southern Governors' Association, Midwestern Governors' Association, and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research.The Obama Administration, with Agriculture Secretary Vilsack's leadership, has worked tirelessly to strengthen rural America, maintain a strong farm safety net, and create opportunities for America's farmers and ranchers. U.S. agriculture is currently experiencing one of its most productive periods in American history thanks to the productivity, resiliency, and resourcefulness of our producers. A strong farm safety net is important to sustain the success of American agriculture. USDA's crop insurance program currently insures 264 million acres, 1.14 million policies, and $110 billion worth of liability on about 500,000 farms. In response to tighter financial markets, USDA has expanded the availability of farm credit, helping struggling farmers refinance loans. Since 2009, USDA has provided more than 128,000 loans to family farmers totaling more than $18 billion. Over 50 percent of the loans went to beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers.#USDA is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

Photo courtesy of Food Donation Connection. Thirty-one percent of food that is available at supermarkets, restaurants, and in households goes uneaten – food that was nurtured and harvested in the fields and ends up in a landfill.  Increasingly food processing facilities, food service companies, supermarkets, and restaurants are recognizing the need to reduce, recover, and recycle all of this wasted food.  The momentum is building as more and more address the problem and take action to keep good food from entering landfills. A week from today - on September 24, Wednesday at 2:00 pm – 3:00 pm Eastern – you can join us for a webinar on “Supermarkets and Restaurants Fighting Food Waste and Saving Money” that will feature industry representatives discussing how they are leading the fight against food waste.  There will also be time devoted to dialogue, Q&As, and the sharing of resources. Register for the webinar here: https://www4.gotomeeting.com/register/241692455. Why is there so much waste at the retail level?  Consumers naturally tend to choose only the shiniest looking apple and freshest milk at the store.  So what happens to “ugly,” misshapen, or slightly out of proportion fruits and vegetables that might have looked similar to the ones in your garden?  What happens to that carton of milk or loaf of bread that is nearing its expiration or sell-by date? Across the country, supermarkets and restaurants are coming up with innovative approaches to keep that apple and that carton of milk out of landfills or sewage drains.  They are adopting innovative new approaches to reduce the amount of food that goes unsold, recover more wholesome unsold food to donate to people who need it, and recycle food discards to energy generation or composting. Here in the U.S., the Grocery Manufacturers Association (representing food and beverage companies), the Food Marketing Institute (representing food retailers/grocery stores), and the National Restaurant Association (representing the foodservice industry) have formed the Food Waste Reduction Alliance.  By improving food labeling, ordering and inventory management, marketing of “ugly” produce, partnerships with food banks and gleaning organizations, and compost and bioenergy production, supermarkets and retailers are doing their part to reduce, recover, and recycle food waste.  There are numerous ways to fight food waste and many of these ideas will be shared on the “Supermarkets and Restaurants Fighting Food Waste and Saving Money” webinar.

"Date  Thursday, June 30, 2022 - 1:00pm  Contact Info Public Affairs  PA@usda.gov  Release No.  079-22  WASHINGTON, June 30, 2022 -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) today announced it has signed a cooperative agreement with Puerto Rico under the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program (LFPA). The Department of Agriculture of Puerto Rico will use LFPA funding to increase the island’s food system’s resilience and promote economic opportunities for underserved producers. “USDA is excited to partner with Puerto Rico to promote economic opportunities for farmers and producers and to increase access to locally sourced, fresh, healthy, and nutritious food in underserved communities,” said USDA Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs Jenny Lester Moffitt. “The Local Food Purchase Cooperative Agreement Program will improve food and agricultural supply-chain resiliency and increase local food consumption around the country.” LFPA funds will be distributed to nonprofit organizations to procure local foods from small and underserved producers. Puerto Rico’s program aims to promote economic growth for local producers without access to sales in supermarket chains or lack the marketing capacity. Puerto Rico’s Department of Agriculture expects that over 800 underserved Puerto Rican farmers will benefit from the program. “We are thrilled to have been awarded with this grant that will boost our agricultural economy by promoting fresh local purchase directly from our small farmers to the nonprofit organizations. This will help enormously the communities in need,” said Puerto Rico Agricultural Department Secretary Ramón González Beiró. The department has selected 68 nonprofit organizations to distribute 250,000 food boxes with an assortment of seasonal fruit. The goal is to provide healthy, locally grown food to rural and underserved communities throughout the island. The LFPA program is authorized by the American Rescue Plan to maintain and improve food and agricultural supply chain resiliency. Through this program, USDA will award up to $400 million through non-competitive cooperative agreements with state and tribal governments to support local, regional, and underserved producers through the purchase of food produced within the state or within 400 miles of delivery destination. AMS looks forward to continuing to sign agreements under this innovative program that allows state and tribal governments to procure and distribute local and regional foods and beverages that are healthy, nutritious, and unique to their geographic area. More information about the program is available on AMS’s Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program webpage. # USDA touches the lives of all Americans each day in so many positive ways. In the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA is transforming America’s food system with a greater focus on more resilient local and regional food production, fairer markets for all producers, ensuring access to safe, healthy and nutritious food in all communities, building new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate smart food and forestry practices, making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America, and committing to equity across the Department by removing systemic barriers and building a workforce more representative of America.

"AMS Livestock, Poultry, and Seed Program Deputy Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 07, 2015  An infographic highlighting example process points and the steps taken to create a Process Verified Program. Click for a larger version. Product labeling is a contract of trust between consumers and producers.  This is especially true for the foods we eat and the companies that sell them.  The responsibility of regulating and monitoring food labels is shared between many federal agencies including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and USDA, and we recognize that there must be transparency and accountability before there can be public trust and understanding of product labels. While my own agency, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), does not approve many product labels directly, we do provide a service where AMS auditors provide an objective, third-party verification on any food product that a company’s labeling claims are backed by plain language standards.  Transparency and accountability are the cornerstones of this service, and we are continuously working to improve both for all of our auditing programs, with our most recent efforts focusing on USDA’s Process Verified Program (PVP). USDA’s PVP is designed to provide verification of specific product standards that a company has committed themselves to meet.  The backbone of USDA’s PVP is the International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) guidelines for quality management systems auditing—an internationally-recognized set of guidelines used for evaluating program documentation and determining how on-site audits should be conducted. The guidelines are designed to ensure that a production system is operating within the parameters that a company has set for itself. AMS auditors undergo extensive training in ISO requirements and audit principles, as well as specific training for the standards they are auditing, which helps ensure the consistency, objectivity, and validity of our auditing services. Here is how the process works: Step 1 - Development: A company calls AMS and presents the standard they want to meet.  This standard could be an international standard, an industry-wide standard, or a standard a company developed itself.  The applicant’s quality management system describes how they will adhere to requirements and the scope of their program–including all phases of production and marketing, and can include retail distribution.  Their quality manual documents and defines the process verified points, procedures, records, policies and objectives, along with any additional required components. AMS then works with that company to develop an auditing solution that will verify the company’s adherence to the standard and how they plan to add the USDA PVP information to their product packaging.  The standard must be verifiable, repeatable, auditable, feasible, and factual. Step 2 - Review: Once all required documentation is submitted, AMS auditors conduct a desk audit to ensure all program requirements are accounted for & documented in their Quality Manual. The complete application is submitted to a Program Review Committee, which reviews all process points & approves the application. Step 3 – On-site audit: The on-site audit process can last anywhere from a day to a week depending on the number and scope of process points, and the size and complexity of the operation. Audit example: If a company wants to verify they are raising poultry without antibiotics, AMS auditors would follow the flock from the time of hatching to the marketplace.  Hatching: Auditors visit the hatcheries to ensure process points are being met.  For a “no antibiotic” claim, AMS would verify that poultry are not administered antibiotics, before hatching (in ovo, in the egg) or after hatching.  Feed: Auditors visit the feed mills to ensure that feed does not include antibiotics, review ration & testing records & ensure that requirements included in their Quality Manual are followed. Farm: Auditors visit the farm where the poultry are raised to determine if there are any antibiotics on-hand or in use. Sick poultry must be treated for any illness, but poultry treated with antibiotics must be removed from the program to ensure the integrity of products being produced without antibiotics. Processing: Finally, auditors visit the processing plant to ensure there is proper segregation of product and accurate labeling of USDA PVP products. Throughout the process, company employees are interviewed to ensure the company as a whole is familiar with and adhering to the program requirements. Step 4 - Approval: If all goes well with the desk & on-site audits, the company is approved to and may use the “USDA Process Verified” shield on their products. For new programs, approval lasts for one year but a surveillance audit is conducted within six months of the initial on-site audit. After the first year, on-site audits are conducted annually. To ensure transparency, we post a list of all companies with approved PVPs, their audited process points, the standards behind those processing points, marketing claims, and labeling information on our website. USDA and AMS are committed to the transparency and accountability of our auditing services, so that consumers and buyers can make informed decisions about the products they purchase.  From farm to market, USDA labels—like the USDA Process Verified shield—will continue to represent the quality, objectivity, and integrity that consumers rely on and trust. The new USDA Process Verified shield. The improved label helps connect buyers with product information and definitions, giving them insight into the process points their food went through from farm to market.

"U.S. Forest Service in  USDA Results  May 24, 2016  Drought damage on the Fresno Harlen Ranch in Fresno, CA. USDA photo by Cynthia Mendoza All this month we will be taking a look at what a changing climate means to Agriculture. The ten regional USDA Climate Hubs were established to synthesize and translate climate science and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers that are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA's Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate. At a recent meeting in Kennewick, WA, panelists representing agricultural industries in the Pacific Northwest addressed the need for climate change adaptation and mitigation.  A wheat farmer representative said that farmers are flexible and can change how and when they plant as changes in weather occur.  An irrigation association representative indicated that after several years of long dry seasons and low snowpack, members were interested in re-thinking how water rights are administered.  The grape growers were worried about the changing climate and thinking about new strategies—mostly planting more heat-tolerant varieties.  The shellfish representative seemed astounded that anyone would question climate change.  He indicated that shellfish growers were already sending their “crops” to Hawaii where the water is less acidic, and were planning new strategies for raising shellfish.  The lesson here is what affects people directly gets their attention. Farm producers everywhere are experiencing changes to what has been their norm for generations.  The question is ‘how’ do we get ahead of these changes to make sure our food production and distribution systems function in the future? To help land managers answer these tough questions the Northwest Regional Climate Hub is supporting the development of the AgBiz Logic tool, which offers a suite of economic, financial, and environmental decisions tools for businesses that grow, harvest, package, add value, and sell agricultural products.  This suite of tools helps land managers understand the implications of different short, medium, and long term decisions in a variable climate.  The Northwest Hub is also working closely with the Regional Approaches to Climate Change (REACCH) Project, funded by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. Impact of drought damage on the Fresno Harlen Ranch in Fresno, CA leaves lake cracked, jeopardizing the health of marine life. USDA photo by Cynthia Mendoza This project supports research to understand how we can adapt to a rapidly changing “new norm.”  REACCH scientists have studied irrigation, cover cropping, crop rotations, crop varieties, pest and disease resistance, soil amendments, and tillage techniques in an effort to get ahead of changes that are coming to the weather the farmers see, and must respond to.  Much of their information is provided at AgClimate.net.  The Northwest Regional Hub has also developed regional factsheets on drought and adaptation opportunities to help farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners as they face more complex threats that affect their bottom line.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Food and Nutrition  Research and Science  Dec 28, 2010   This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA's rich science and research portfolio If there is one thing you can count on during the holidays, it is food – and in large quantities! While you may not be able to avoid the endless stream of Christmas treats, our eating habits the rest of the year are really important. Especially those we teach our children. With funding from USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Sheryl Hughes, assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine, identified three common feeding styles among parents of young children and determined which one is the most successful in building healthy eating habits in children. Of the three feeding styles identified (overcontrolling, indulgent and responsive), the responsive style leads to children leading the healthiest lifestyles. Did you parents ever tell you to “clean your plate”? This phrase is used by many overcontrolling parents who try to control what and how much their children eat in an attempt to ensure their kids are eating the right kinds of foods. However, this approach doesn’t allow children to decide how much to eat based on how hungry they are, and it puts them at risk for obesity because they ignore their internal cues of fullness. Indulgent parents try to keep their children happy and make sure they have enough to eat by giving them whatever and as much as they want. Food is used to comfort the child, but this may lead to children eating large portions of high-calorie foods and weight gain. Hughes found that responsive parents provide their children with healthy choices, but allow them to decide how much they want to eat. This parenting style teaches children to be aware of internal clues of fullness, which makes them less likely to overeat. And these parents also have more success in getting children to try new foods. The video below, produced by Hughes, shows how the responsive parenting style works in the home. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCtGBP-E7Og As a parent, it may take some time to become comfortable with the responsive style, but the payoff will be worth it as your children learn to pay attention to when they are full and start making healthy eating choices – choices that will last a lifetime.

Cecilia Hernandez, Designated Federal Officer, USDA Equity Commission  Posted in  Equity  Initiatives  Aug 28, 2023  Respond to this story","What are some key strategies that Ron Rainey, as a USDA officer and agriculture economist, would recommend to farmers to improve their financial outcomes amidst environmental macroeconomic trends?","Ron Rainey would likely recommend the following key strategies for farmers to improve their financial outcomes: 1. **Embracing innovations**: Stay up-to-date with latest technological advancements in agriculture to enhance productivity and efficiency. 2. **Diversifying income streams**: Explore alternative revenue sources, such as value-added products or renewable energy, to reduce dependence on a single crop or market. 3. **Managing risk**: Implement strategies like crop insurance, weather-based micro-insurance, or other financial instruments to mitigate the impact of climate variability and market fluctuations. These recommendations are likely based on Rainey's experience as an agriculture economist and his understanding of the sector's needs in light of changing macroeconomic trends."
"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way from the Summit: How REE is Using New Strategies to Reach Even Newer Poultry Handlers  During a walk along tree-shading sidewalks in the “burbs”; you’re accustomed to seeing games of hopscotch, bike rides, and maybe even the occasional Golden Retriever. However, one residential backyard, nearly 6 miles from downtown Atlanta, calls into question whether this is suburbia at all. There were swings, a tree house, and even patio furniture. Yet one feature certified this was not your mother’s suburban home: over a dozen chickens living comfortably in a custom made “Coop de Ville.”    The rise of “backyard poultry” is one of many agricultural phenomena tied to a growing food consciousness and increased urbanization. And while USDA’s fundamental job doesn’t change, the Department does because the challenges do.  The recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at increasingly popular backyard chicken coops underscore this. While this concern was not clearly expressed in the 1862 Act of Congress that created the Department, the mandate was. USDA still works to “acquire and to diffuse…information” towards facilitating the protected growth of American agriculture. That service is what brought Research, Education, and Economics Undersecretary Dr. Catherine Woteki to this residence in Decatur, GA. Accompanied by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service officials and a man known best as the “Chicken Whisperer,” Dr. Woteki toured the site and helped to shed light on current HPAI research and important biosafety measures.  Melvin Washington, Confidential Assistant, Research, Education and Economics Mission Area  Posted in  Initiatives  Animals  Plants  Apr 29, 2015  1 Response","Here's a concise question focused on the key concepts: What are some essential biosafety measures that need to be taken into consideration for backyard poultry farming, particularly in light of recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)?",The essential biosafety measures that need to be considered for backyard poultry farming include: * Implementation of proper biosecurity protocols to prevent the spread of diseases * Regular veterinary check-ups and vaccination programs for birds * Proper disposal of bird waste and dead birds * Maintenance of clean and secure living quarters for birds
"Exporter Registration - Who Needs to Register?  The United States Grain Standards Act (USGSA) requires anyone whose business buys, handles, weighs or transports 15,000, or more, metric tons of grain for sale in foreign commerce to be registered with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service’s (AMS) Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) before they ship grain overseas. Those required to register are also required to provide information on any person considered to have an ownership interest of 10 percent or more in the business.  See 7.U.S.C. 87f-1. Those who are registered by December 15 will be included in the FGIS Registered Grain Exporters Directory, which is generally released in early January.  Registrations completed after December 15 may not appear in the January release of the directory but will be added upon FGIS approval. Special Note for Exporters of Grain to China Under Decree 177, all grain exporters, regardless of the volume they ship, must be registered and listed on the General Administration of Customs China’s (GACC) website to export grain to China. FGIS provides the Registered Grain Exporters Directory to GACC through the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS). The directory is typically published on GACC’s website as the “List of registered companies exporting grain from the United States to China” and is commonly referred to as “the GACC List.” The Chinese government may refuse entry to any grain shipment from an exporter that does not appear on the GACC List. If you plan to export grain to China, register as instructed below and be thorough and accurate in how you register your export operations and locations, whether you are the main entity (person), a subsidiary, a DBA, or operating under a type of inspection and weighing waiver.  Exporting Grain to China Under Waiver Entities planning to operate under an authorized waiver must register with FGIS to be included on the annual listing provided to GACC. FGIS has determined this to be the best course of action to mitigate importation challenges for companies that do not appear in the FGIS Registered Grain Exporters Directory. Entry Challenges Entry challenges within China should be referred to USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS). Please contact AgBeijing@usda.gov for assistance. For importation challenges with other foreign countries please contact FAS -Overseas Offices. Voluntary Registration of Grain Exporters Grain exporters who are not required to register with FGIS may still choose to do so by following the same instructions as an entity that is required to register (See “How to Register”). Publication  FGIS will publish the list of U.S. entities registered to buy, handle, weigh, or transport grain for sale in foreign commerce on the AMS website. The list will include entity name, business address, phone number, and any other facilities or addresses marked for public release. The inclusion of other facilities or addresses that are marked for publication is a new service to support the international marketing of grain.    Update to application In response to requests to have more than the business address listed in the published directory, FGIS has added a feature to the registration application that allows applicants to identify which locations should be published. FGIS anticipates this change is beneficial for those who need additional facilities listed on the list provided to GACC. Entities that need to identify multiple locations in their registration submission, should consider the company name(s) and address(es) that will be used on export documents to ensure they will match what is included on the FGIS Registered Grain Exporters Directory.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Agricultural Research Service Information Staff in  Research and Science  Jan 18, 2011   This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. 1935:  It was the year when baseball legend Babe Ruth hung up his spikes, and New Deal programs like the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps extended a helping hand to a nation devastated by the Dust Bowl and gripped by the Great Depression. On the leafy campus of Alabama Polytechnic Institute (now Auburn University),  a handful of USDA scientists were busy establishing a research facility that would eventually play a role in such diverse ventures as creating a new scientific discipline called “soil dynamics” and helping develop a moon vehicle for astronauts. Originally known as the Farm Tillage Machinery Laboratory, the facility today is called the National Soil Dynamics Laboratory (NSDL).  But just as a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet, the laboratory has been world-famous from the beginning for its 13 historic soil bins, each about the length of a football field, used for testing the impact of farm equipment on various soil types from sand to clay.  Operated since 1953 by USDA’s Agricultural Research Service, this lab’s findings have influenced the design of almost all modern agricultural equipment. And this lab’s place in history extends beyond farm equipment:  During World War II, the facility was shared with the U.S. Army, which conducted research there on traction of military equipment.  During the 1960s, the lab’s scientists helped design a “sea plow” used to bury trans-Atlantic communication cables. Today’s NSDL research includes studies on how different farm management practices can affect the soil’s ability to store carbon from the atmosphere, thereby slowing increases in greenhouse gases and helping reduce global warming. From celebrating the Sultan of Swat to helping save the planet:  That’s a big chunk of history encompassed in one laboratory where scientists spend their days “digging the real dirt.” Aerial view of the National Soil Dynamics Laboratory’s 13 historic soil bins, where studies of the effects of machinery on different soil types have influenced the design of almost all modern agricultural equipment.

"Utah State Statistician, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Research and Science  Nov 01, 2019  Nearly 6 percent of farms in Utah have solar panels. According to the 2017 Census of Agriculture, Utah had more than 18,400 farms encompassing more than 10.8 million acres. This is an increase of 2 percent in the number of farms and a decrease of 1 percent in total acres compared to the 2012 Census of Agriculture. Just under 80 percent of Utah’s farmland is permanent pasture and rangeland –– but a significant amount is cropland, of which most is irrigated. The total value of agricultural sales is $1.84 billion, of which 31 percent are from crop sales and 69 percent are from livestock and their products! The top crops by value of sales are hay and other crops at over $275 million, nursery at over $135 million, and grains and oilseeds at more than $90 million. Cattle sales of about $380 million, milk at $355 million, and hogs around $230 million round out the top three livestock items by value of sales. Utah is the second largest producer of tart cherries in the country! A majority of the 8,419 fruit acres in the state are devoted to tart cherries (4,732 acres), followed by peaches (1,582 acres), and apples (1,211 acres). While not a state with a lot of vegetable acreage, Utah’s top three vegetables are dry onions (1,616 acres), pumpkins (1,415 acres), and sweet corn (1,075 acres). The number of farms with renewable energy systems more than doubled since the 2012 Census of Agriculture. The increase was seen in the number of farms with solar panel arrays at 1,081 up from 425 in 2012 and geothermal systems at 115 farms up from 40 in 2012. We want to thank all the farmers and ranchers who willingly shared their data so we could produce the 2017 Census of Agriculture in Utah. We appreciate your cooperation and help!

"Foreign Agricultural Service Public Affairs Specialist in  USDA Results  Trade  Feb 24, 2012   The USDA Agricultural Trade Office (ATO) in Seoul recently launched a Web page to showcase potential opportunities to be created by the soon-to-be-implemented U.S.-Korea Trade Agreement (KORUS). KORUS will take effect on March 15, 2012. The Foreign Agricultural Service recommends that U.S. agricultural exporters and those interested in expanding sales to international markets visit the page, called What U.S. Exporters Need to Know about the KORUS Agreement, to learn about the agreement, understand new tariff schedules, and gain valuable information about the fifth-largest market for U.S. farm products. Information available on the Web page includes a list of South Korea’s top-imported commodities, a detailed view of the population, and analysis of the United States’ trade competitors. Exporters can also download the latest import statistics, which are updated monthly, to accurately evaluate market trends. ATO Seoul routinely updates reports to showcase market trends and changes and to notify exporters in advance of the competition. Once KORUS is fully implemented, American agriculture will gain improved access to South Korea’s $1 trillion economy and 49 million consumers. KORUS benefits nearly every sector of U.S. agriculture—including beef, poultry, pork, wheat, corn, soybeans, cotton, and many other commodities. More than half of U.S. agricultural products will gain immediate, duty-free access to the South Korean market as soon as the agreement is implemented. The new trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama signed by President Obama in October will support tens of thousands of American jobs and open new opportunities for American businesses. When implemented, these three agreements will increase farm exports by an additional $2.3 billion—supporting nearly 20,000 American jobs and delivering higher incomes for farmers and ranchers, more opportunities for small businesses owners, and jobs for folks who package, ship, and market agricultural products. U.S. agricultural products are booming in popularity worldwide. Farm exports in fiscal year 2011 reached a record high of $137.4 billion – exceeding the past record by $22.5 billion – and supported 1.15 million U.S. jobs.

"Eastern Regional Director, APHIS Veterinary Services, Raleigh, NC in  Animals  Plants  Nov 10, 2011   Hello, I’m Dr. Jack Shere, the Eastern Regional Director for USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Veterinary Services program. As a kid, we had a German Shepherd mix puppy. My dad brought her home from a shelter and we took her to the veterinarian for shots. After a time, she got sick, displaying a series of symptoms that turned out to be distemper. She’d contracted it when she was too young for the puppy shots. The symptoms got worse until one Friday when she had a seizure in the kitchen. We called the vet to ask about bringing her in to be humanely put to sleep and the vet said he would. Watching this puppy die was heartbreaking for my entire family. I decided then to become a vet and to never turn down emergency calls so no one had to go through what my family did with this puppy. I’ve kept that vow in years since I graduated vet school. I started out in private practice and quickly learned there were good vets to work for and others that were not good to work for. I was lucky that I found a mentor at the second practice I joined out of school. The owner helped me to learn a lot more than what they teach in vet school – including aspects about business and working with people. After four years, I left for regulatory medicine. I’ve spent the last 21 years in APHIS. During that time, I served as a field vet, epidemiologist, area veterinarian in charge, associate regional director, and now in my current position as Eastern Regional Director for Veterinary Services. I also spent most of 2003 as the Area Commander for the Exotic Newcastle Disease (END) outbreak response. The END response was a great experience because of all the people I was able to work with and the great effort everyone gave, supporting each other. A lot of the work we do in regulatory medicine can be difficult; however, it is our job to maintain the health of our national herds and flocks. Doing this well is the fulfilling part of our jobs.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. 0204.19  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@oc.usda.gov  FLANDREAU, S.D., Dec. 12, 2019 – Today, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development South Dakota State Director Julie Gross announced USDA has invested $9.5 million in high-speed broadband infrastructure that will create or improve e-Connectivity for more than 1,750 homes in rural South Dakota. This is one of many funding announcements in the first round of USDA’s ReConnect Pilot Program investments. “Reliable, high-speed broadband internet e-Connectivity is essential to increasing access to specialized health care and education, connecting with friends and family, building or starting a business, or increasing productivity at your agricultural operation,” Gross said. “Under the leadership of President Trump and Agriculture Secretary Perdue, USDA is committed to being a strong partner in deploying this essential infrastructure in rural communities, because when rural America thrives, all of America thrives.” Valley Telecommunications Cooperative will use $9.5 million in ReConnect grant funding to deploy a fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network in Brookings, Kingsbury and Moody counties in South Dakota. This investment is anticipated to reach 1,750 rural households, 27 farms, 17 businesses and one critical community facility. Background: In March 2018, Congress provided $600 million to USDA to expand broadband infrastructure and services in rural America. On Dec. 13, 2018, Secretary Perdue announced the rules of the program, called “ReConnect,” including how the loans and grants will be awarded to help build broadband infrastructure in rural America. USDA received 146 applications between May 31, 2019, and July 12, 2019, requesting $1.4 billion in funding across all three ReConnect Program funding products: 100 percent loan, 100 percent grant, and loan-grant combinations. USDA is reviewing applications and announcing approved projects on a rolling basis. Additional investments in all three categories will be made in the coming weeks. These grants, loans and combination funds enable the federal government to partner with the private sector and rural communities to build modern broadband infrastructure in areas with insufficient internet service. Insufficient service is defined as connection speeds of less than 10 megabits per second (Mbps) download and 1 Mbps upload. In April 2017, President Donald J. Trump established the Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity to identify legislative, regulatory and policy changes that could promote agriculture and prosperity in rural communities. In January 2018, Secretary Perdue presented the Task Force’s findings to President Trump. These findings included 31 recommendations to align the federal government with state, local and tribal governments to take advantage of opportunities that exist in rural America. Increasing investments in rural infrastructure is a key recommendation of the task force.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Nov 03, 2011  A picture of one the U.S. Forest Service's 89 experimental forests. (Photo courtesy of the US Forest Service) A 12-year study on the U.S. Forest Service’s Harshaw Experimental Forest near Rhinelander, WI is challenging long-held assumptions about how future forests will respond to the rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It appears from the Rhinelander study that North American forests have a greater capacity to soak up heat-trapping carbon dioxide gas than many scientists had thought. The implications are huge because this means forested lands could help mitigate the effects of a warming climate beyond what was always assumed by scientists. Scientists that worked on the report including Mark Kubiske of the U.S. Forest Service Northern Research Station feel that some initial assumptions about ecosystem response are not correct and will need to be revised. The studies team, lead by University of Michigan microbial ecologist Donald Zak, simulated atmospheric conditions that are expected in the latter half of this century. They did this by continuously pumped extra carbon dioxide into the canopies trees on the experimental forest. Another aspect of the research included soaking some of the study trees in elevated levels of ground-level ozone (the primary element in smog) to simulate what many scientists believe will be the increasingly polluted air of the future. Both parts of the experiment which are the carbon dioxide and the ozone treatments produced unexpected results. Aside from trapping heat, carbon dioxide is known to have a fast-growth effect on trees similar to common fertilizer. Climate researchers and ecosystem modelers assume that in coming decades, carbon dioxide's fertilizing effect will temporarily boost the growth rate in North America’s forested lands. Previous studies have concluded that this growth spurt would be short-lived, grinding to a halt when the trees can no longer extract the essential nutrient nitrogen from the soil. But in the Rhinelander study, the trees soaked in elevated carbon dioxide continued to grow at an accelerated rate throughout the 12-year experiment. The research suggests that the extra carbon dioxide allowed trees to grow additional small roots and ""forage"" more successfully for nitrogen in the soil. But, according to the scientist in the study, the growth-enhancing effects of CO2 in forests will eventually ""hit the wall"" and come to a halt. The trees' roots will eventually exhaust their ability to soak up the soil's nitrogen resources, but the researchers of the study do not know how long it will take for the trees to reach their limit.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. 0201.21  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@usda.gov  WASHINGTON, September 13, 2021 - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reminds communities, farmers and ranchers, families and small businesses in the path of Tropical Storm Nicholas that USDA has programs that provide assistance in the wake of disasters. USDA staff in the regional, state and county offices stand ready and are eager to help. USDA partnered with FEMA and other disaster-focused organizations and created the Disaster Resource Center. This central source of information utilizes a searchable knowledge base of disaster-related resources powered by agents with subject matter expertise. The Disaster Resource Center website and web tool now provide an easy access point to find USDA disaster information and assistance. USDA also developed a disaster assistance discovery tool specifically targeted to rural and agricultural issues. The tool walks producers through five questions that generate personalized results identifying which USDA disaster assistance programs can help them recover from a natural disaster. USDA also encourages residents and small businesses in impact zones to contact a local USDA office to determine which assistance programs might meet their individual needs. Food safety guidance: Severe weather forecasts often present the possibility of power outages that could compromise the safety of stored food. USDA encourages those in the path of the storm to take the following precautions:  Place appliance thermometers in both the refrigerator and the freezer to ensure temperatures remain food safe during a power outage. Safe temperatures are 40°F or below in the refrigerator and 0°F or below in the freezer.  Freeze water in small plastic storage bags or containers prior to a storm. These containers are small enough to fit around the food in the refrigerator and freezer to help keep food cold.  Freeze refrigerated items, such as leftovers, milk and fresh meat and poultry that you may not need immediately—this helps keep them at a safe temperature longer.  Consider getting 50 pounds of dry or block ice if a lengthy power outage is possible. This amount of ice should keep a fully-stocked 18-cubic-feet freezer cold for two days.  Group foods together in the freezer—this ‘igloo’ effect helps the food stay cold longer.  Keep a few days’ worth of ready-to-eat foods that do not require cooking or cooling. Owners of meat and poultry producing businesses who have questions or concerns may contact the FSIS Small Plant Help Desk by phone at 1-877-FSIS-HELP (1-), by email at infosource@fsis.usda.gov, or 24/7 online at www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/regulatory-compliance/svsp/sphelpdesk. Protecting pets and livestock: USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is urging everyone in the potential path of the storm to prepare now – not just for yourselves, but also for your pets and your livestock:  Plan for evacuation – know how you will evacuate and where you will go. If it is not feasible to evacuate your livestock, be sure to provide a strong shelter, and adequate food and water that will last them until you can return.  If you are planning to move livestock out of state, make sure to contact the State Veterinarian’s Office in the receiving state before you move any animals. You also may contact APHIS Veterinary Services state offices for information and assistance about protecting and moving livestock.  Listen to emergency officials and evacuate if asked to do so. Risk management and disaster assistance for agricultural operations: USDA offers several risk management and disaster assistance options to help producers recover after disasters. Producers who suffer losses and whose crops are covered for the 2021 crop year by the Federal Crop Insurance Program or the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) are asked to report crop damage to their crop insurance agent or local FSA office, respectively, within 72 hours of discovering damage and follow up in writing within 15 days. Livestock and perennial crop producers often have more limited risk management options available, so there are several disaster programs for them. Key programs offered by USDA’s Farm Service Agency include:  The Livestock Indemnity Program and the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybee and Farm-raised Fish Program reimburses producers for a portion of the value of livestock, poultry and other animals that were killed or severely injured by a natural disaster or loss of feed and grazing acres.  The Tree Assistance Program provides cost share assistance to rehabilitate or replant orchards and vineyards when storms kill or damage the trees, vines or bushes. NAP or Federal Crop Insurance often only covers the crop and not the plant.  The Emergency Conservation Program and Emergency Forest Restoration Program can assist landowners and forest stewards with financial and technical assistance to restore damaged farmland or forests. It is also critical that producers keep accurate records to document damage or loss and to report losses to their local USDA Service Center as soon as possible. Additionally, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service can provide financial resources through its Environmental Quality Incentives Program to help with immediate needs and long-term support to help recover from natural disasters and conserve water resources. USDA can also assist local government sponsors with the cost of recovery efforts like debris removal and streambank stabilization to address natural resource concerns and hazards through the Emergency Watershed Protection Program. On farmers.gov, the Disaster Assistance Discovery Tool, Disaster-at-a-Glance fact sheet (, 1.5 MB) and Farm Loan Discovery Tool can help producers and landowners determine program or loan options. For assistance with a crop insurance claim, producers and landowners should contact their crop insurance agent. For FSA and NRCS programs, they should contact their local USDA Service Center. USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is also standing by to work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as well as requesting states and local authorities, to provide emergency nutrition assistance and other nutrition program flexibilities to assist people in need. USDA touches the lives of all Americans each day in so many positive ways. In the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA is transforming America’s food system with a greater focus on more resilient local and regional food production, fairer markets for all producers, ensuring access to safe, healthy and nutritious food in all communities, building new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate smart food and forestry practices, making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America, and committing to equity across the Department by removing systemic barriers and building a workforce more representative of America.

"USDA Office of Tribal Relations in  Energy  Rural  May 09, 2011   On Wednesday May 4th, Secretary Tom Vilsack joined tribal leaders to discuss energy opportunities across Indian Country at the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Tribal Energy Summit here in Washington, DC. The event was a culmination of Energy Roundtables that had taken place across the country over the past few months and provided an opportunity for tribal leaders to hear from cabinet officials about energy programs across the United States Government. The Secretary also discussed the importance of consultation and collaboration as we move forward with energy programs in Indian Country. One program in particular that was recently improved by Consultation with tribal leaders is the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). The program helps rural businesses improve their energy efficiency, save money, and improve their bottom lines by paying to install energy efficiency and renewable energy production capacity. Through consultation we learned the REAP Program was difficult to use in Indian Country–only two successful Tribal applicants in nearly 10 years- because the definition for rural small business limited Tribes from accessing the program. We have since clarified this requirement to better work with Tribal enterprises and remain hopeful we can turn around our record with the current round of REAP funding.  REAP is currently open for applications through June 15th or June 30th, depending on the type of project for which funding is requested. The summit challenged people to think about how Departments can help provide assistance to Tribal energy projects across multiple Agency programs in centralized locations and drove home the importance of working together at all levels to build a nationwide renewable energy industry.

Gary Locke, U.S. ambassador to China, also shared this childhood dream. What makes Jana Desrocher different is that she is living this dream. Since May, Desrocher of Hemet, Calif. has been doing many of the duties of a forest ranger on the San Bernardino National Forest. In fact, she loves it so much that she does it for free. Desrocher is a volunteer ranger. Many people may not realize the volunteer opportunities available on national forests. Desrocher is one of about 75 members of the Forest Service Volunteer Association which assists the U.S. Forest Service in protecting and preserving the San Bernardino National Forest. On any given day, Desrocher patrols trails, assists visiting hikers and saws fallen trees that may be blocking trails. As a volunteer wilderness ranger, she is part of the team that acts as the eyes and ears of the Forest Service that may even occasionally involve overnight stays on the forest. Constructing trails, surveying wildlife with Forest Service scientists and working at visitor centers as the true face of the forest are just some of the duties this team of nature enthusiasts does in its spare time. In order to qualify to become a volunteer ranger, Desrocher trekked arduous eight-hour hikes five times.

"NASS National Operations Division Director in  Trade  Nov 12, 2014  NASS Associate Administrator Renee Picanso visits with Mike Adams of AgriTalk for an in-studio interview to help reach farmers and ranchers during the 2012 Census of Agriculture. Working with farm broadcasters like Adams helps NASS deliver vital information and statistics to America’s 3.2 million agricultural producers. Growing up on a small crop and hog farm in Perry County, Illinois, I have memories as a child listening to the radio with my father or uncle to hear the latest agriculture news. As farmers, they relied on and trusted receiving weather, farm, and market updates from the local radio station, WDQN. Some days my father would nod in agreement liking what he heard on the radio and other days my uncle would shake his head and turn the volume down. But the important thing was they always tuned in and listened. As a child, I never guessed that I would grow up to be on the receiving end of interviews to report the crop, livestock, and agriculture census numbers that we listened for.  Having worked for USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) for 30 years, I have had the pleasure to talk with a great number of farm broadcasters. Folks who are dedicated to delivering the information and stories to farmers, ranchers, and rural America. Now on the eve of NAFB Trade Talk as I prepare to gather with farm broadcasters from around the country, I have a simple message to share with them, “Thank you for everything you do.” The role of farm broadcasting, ag radio, and television is just as important today as it was when I was a child listening on my family farm in Illinois. Even with advances in technology, farm broadcasting remains a vital tool for communicating with producers today. Whether tuning in on their radio, streaming on their computer, downloading a podcast, watching the television, or listening on an app with their smartphone – producers still seek out news from their trusted and knowledgeable farm broadcasters. Just recently, I saw the tremendous value we received by working with the farm broadcaster community during the 2012 Census of Agriculture. You helped us take our news and information to the airwaves and reached producers when they were tuned in and ready to listen. We were able to encourage response and thanks to your help it was a success. The most recent census of agriculture represents America’s 3.2 million farmers and ranchers and the new trends in agriculture. And with your help today, we continue to tell the story of U.S. agriculture production – the who, what, how, and where of America’s food, fiber, and fuel system. You help deliver the data back to those who provide the facts by filling out NASS surveys throughout the year. And, you help keep agriculture in the news and relevant. We could not reach America’s farmers, ranchers, and rural America the way we do, everyday, without you – America’s farm broadcaster. For that, we thank you! There are still many more stories to tell. From the more than 6 million pieces of data in the Census of Agriculture, to the hundreds of surveys conducted each year, and the reports issued from those surveys covering virtually every aspect of U.S. agriculture, the opportunities to continue to bring agriculture to the forefront of our news are endless. Working together, we can continue to reach America’s 3.2 million farmers and ranchers and show with facts that Agriculture Counts!

"USDA Under Secretary for Food Safety in  Health and Safety  May 02, 2013   Cross posted from Food Safety News:  My passion for public health stems from my career as an infectious disease doctor, watching families cope with the heartbreak caused by preventable diseases, including foodborne illness.  I know what it feels like to explain to a husband in shock that the reason his wife is on life support is because of something she ate that was contaminated with a deadly pathogen. Now, I am the Under Secretary for Food Safety at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  In my current role, I oversee dedicated USDA inspectors, scientists, veterinarians, and numerous other personnel who protect food that we eat every day.  There is nothing more fundamental than being able to feed your own family a meal that will not make you sick, or worse, put you in the hospital. I understand that there has been a lot of confusion about a proposal by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to modernize inspection at poultry slaughter plants. I would like to try to eliminate that confusion. First and most importantly, we put forward this modernization proposal because we have data demonstrating that the system it embodies will prevent foodborne illnesses – approximately 5,000 per year.  It will prevent illnesses by making commonsense, scientifically-verified changes in the way inspection personnel do their work in plants. This is significant because for the past 10 years, the food safety community hasn’t been able to make any headway in the fight against two dangerous strains of bacteria that are commonly found in poultry products – Salmonella and Campylobacter. While poultry only accounts for a fraction of the illnesses attributable to Salmonella and Campylobacter illnesses, the numbers from these pathogens are still significant—together, these two bacteria cause an approximate 344,000 poultry-associated foodborne illnesses every year.  The most troubling aspect of these data is that, despite all our efforts, rates of illness caused by these two foodborne pathogens have been stagnant, even showing occasional rises, in recent years. We need to find a way to reverse the trend, and if we are to do so, one thing is clear: we cannot continue regulating the poultry industry as we have.  FSIS can’t keep focusing on food quality assurance tasks – work that our food safety inspectors are currently doing – and simply cross our fingers, hoping that checking for extra feathers and bruises in chickens will make a dent in the rates of illnesses caused by Salmonella and Campylobacter.   We need all of our employees to be focused on a single purpose: to protect public health through food safety.   Our inspectors shouldn’t be doing a company’s quality assurance work.  They should be making sure that a company produces safe food. Under our newly proposed inspection system, most inspectors who have performed quality control checks under our old system would perform food safety tasks that have been demonstrated to make your food safer, like making sure a company’s food safety plan is effective and conducting tests for the harmful pathogens which actually cause foodborne illness. We started testing a new type of inspection system in a pilot program that began in 1999.  In these plants, Salmonella and Campylobacter contamination rates actually decreased quite quickly.  This refocused inspection works. If we were to finalize our proposal and implement this new type of inspection system broadly, we would be enabling our employees to do more, and we as an Agency would be doing a better job, to fulfill our mission. We would still be in every poultry slaughter plant every day, inspecting every chicken that enters the food supply.  We would just be doing it better. I understand that in the course of this discussion, some have raised concerns for the workers in poultry plants.  They ask – if this new inspection system causes changes in the way that plants operate – will it make poultry plants more dangerous for the people who work there? Let me be clear: USDA would never put forward a rule that would put anyone in harm’s way.  This is not a choice between food safety and worker safety.  The data that we have to date does not show any link between this new type of inspection system and increased risk for poultry industry employees or our own inspection personnel.  And as we evaluate next steps for this proposal, we are working with our federal partners to ensure that worker health isn’t harmed – and is in fact improved. I don’t want to minimize the discussion about worker health.  We do need to have a discussion on the health of workers in the industry.  That discussion is underway.  While we as a food safety agency do not have the ability or expertise to regulate worker safety, we have been working closely with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health on important efforts to strengthen the federal government’s data collection and enforcement activities in this space.  These two federal agencies have the regulatory authority and expertise to improve worker safety. As a result of these efforts – and the discussion started by this proposed rule – we as a federal government are talking about worker health in the poultry industry in a way that we never have before. Most importantly, our data show that we can make progress in meeting our mission and ensuring a safer food supply.  We have a major tool at our disposal to reduce foodborne illness, and this is but one of many ways that USDA is working hard to keep you safe from foodborne illness.  If you had the opportunity to save a life, to spare a mother or father from the agony of having a child in the hospital, wouldn’t you jump at the chance?

In December 2014, I visited with groups of people whose families and businesses will benefit from a $1,771,035 USDA Rural Development Community Connect Broadband Grant awarded to North Central Telephone Cooperative (NCTC) in Lafayette, Tennessee. This rural area bordering the Tennessee/Kentucky state line has seen their share of businesses closing and families moving “closer to town.”  Many of the longtime residents understand why their children and grandchildren feel isolated and have decided to move away, but they, along with community and business leaders, hope the improvements that NCTC is making with the help of Rural Development funds will turn the tide and draw businesses and people back into the area. Upon completion, NCTC service area residents will have access to internet speeds ranging from 5 Megabits per second (Mbps) to a full 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps). This means businesses will be able to capitalize off of e-commerce business strategies and offer teleworking options to their employees; community members will have more efficient and reliable access to commercial and emergency services. I was reminded by a young father that shared how much he enjoyed raising his family on the same road as his parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, and uncles while also describing the challenge of not being able to work at home because he did not have access to high-speed internet service, that building a stronger rural America is not only vital to our nation economically, but as an underpinning to strong families. Breaking ground on this project felt more like USDA Rural Development and NCTC were breaking antiquated barriers that have prevented America’s rural businesses, services and families from accessing the world. USDA Rural Development’s Community Connect Grant Program is designed for communities like Lafayette. These grants enable access to broadband technology that will sustain existing and attract new businesses to rural communities. Broadband makes the world accessible even in rural America. If your rural community needs financial assistance to make broadband access a reality, USDA Rural Development is accepting applications* from state or town governments, cooperatives, incorporated organizations, Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations for Community Connect Grants. Together let’s break down the barriers and make the world accessible. For more information contact your local USDA Rural Development team.

"USDA Results  Jan 13, 2010   Over ate Director, Jim Isgar and Farm Services State Executive Director Trudy Kareus for a Presidential Forum on job creation and economic growth at the State Office in Lakewood, CO. “Several job forums have been occurring across the state, put on both by the Governor and members of our Congressional delegation, but we in Colorado felt one needed to be held focusing primarily on the agricultural sector,” said Isgar. Colorado Agricultural Commissioner John Stulp chaired the roundtable discussion.  In addition to the Commissioner, panelists included Taryn Edwards, Executive Director of the Governor’s Job Cabinet, Don Marostica, Director of the Office of Economic Development and International Trade, and Steve Johnson, representing Colorado Housing and Finance Authority. Discussion was held on a vast array of topics, but primarily focused on four topics: regulatory environment – whether they are hampering progress; infrastructure - broadband opportunities, transmission lines and environmental concerns, renewable energy, and clean and waste water; community infrastructure - the importance of having access to health care in rural areas – a strength for a community is having a critical access hospital, providing post K12 education opportunities in rural communities; and credit opportunities for both AG and rural businesses. Attendees were very thankful for the opportunity to have their issues and concerns forwarded to Secretary Vilsack.  USDA hoped that this event would not be the end of discussion but rather a launching point for further involvement and strategic planning between all parties.

"U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Feb 11, 2016  Forest Service scientists use a greenhouse in Washington State to grow bluebunch wheatgrass as part of their current reciprocal transplant project. It is one of the largest and most intensive projects of its kind ever attempted. Wildfires in sagebrush and other range ecosystems are increasing in frequency and severity, often in relation to drought conditions and intrusive species like cheatgrass, a non-native, highly flammable invasive species that establishes itself as a monoculture and crowds out native grasses and forbs. “What’s preferable to a monoculture is a diverse plant community that includes native grasses, forbs and shrubs,” said Francis Kilkenny, leader for the Great Basin Native Plant Project, a joint effort of the U.S. Forest Service and the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management, or BLM. Restoring a disturbed ecosystem back to health has positive practical consequences as well. A district manager with BLM can easily obtain and plant several seed types to optimize a restoration project. Preliminary research helps the manager identify which seed varieties have the best chance of succeeding in a given region of the country at a particular elevation, at particular time of the year and under current climate conditions. But, those findings do not come easily. It takes decades to develop successful new seed varieties for grasses. Research on forbs (broad-leaved non-woody plants) and shrubs still has a long way to go. What they’ve learned so far is that in addition to the right climate conditions, timing of seed planting makes a big difference. Method of planting also matters. Tamping seeds into the soil is better than blowing them from a plane, for instance. Keeping livestock off newly seeded rangeland for at least three years really improves the likelihood of a successful restoration effort. And, long-term monitoring is critical to our understanding of what seed mixes and restoration techniques yield long-term restoration success. Delivering this kind of knowledge to land managers is the other side of the coin. Collecting existing research results into a single digital library, holding webinars, producing an annual report of new findings, establishing a National Seed Strategy, and trading information with groups like the Great Basin Fire Exchange have all advanced national restoration efforts. “We’ve learned an awful lot about what doesn’t work, but our knowledge has advanced considerably since the Dust Bowl,” Kilkenny said. NOTE: A new report by the U.S. Forest Service, Effects of Drought on Forests and Rangelands in the United States: A Comprehensive Science Synthesis, provides a national assessment by 77 scientists of peer-reviewed research on the impacts of drought on U.S. forests and rangelands. This report will help the Forest Service better manage grasslands and forests impacted by drought, wildfire, invasive plants and other challenges made worse by climate change. “Our forests and rangelands are national treasures, and because they are threatened, we are threatened,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. “This report confirms what we are seeing, that every region of the country is impacted by the direct and indirect effects of drought conditions and volatile weather patterns. Sixty million Americans rely on drinking water that originates on our 193 million acres of national forest and grasslands. They support 200,000 jobs and contribute over $13 billion to local economies every year.” The report establishes a comprehensive baseline of available data that land managers can use to test how well their efforts to improve drought resilience and adaptation practices are working nationwide.

"Research and Development, USDA Forest Service in  Forestry  Jan 05, 2018  The T3 Building in Minneapolis was constructed using cross-laminated timber, or CLT. Made from layers of wood crisscrossed and held together by fire-resistant glue, CLT is as strong as structural steel and greatly speeds up construction. (Photo credit: MGA | Michael Green Architecture, DLR Group; photo by Ema Peter; winner of a WoodWorks Wood Design Award) Some people are just way ahead of their time. In the mid-20th century, when most people thought of wood as an archaic and low-tech material, Egon Glesinger foresaw the revolutionary role it would play in our future, described in his book The Coming Age of Wood. Scientists in the Northern Research Station’s new Strategic Foresight Group developed a horizon scanning system to identify emerging issues and trends that could be game-changers. A theme that has emerged is the wave of amazing innovations in wood products that could prove Mr. Glesinger right. For example, wood-based nanomaterials have been produced at the Forest Products Lab (FPL) for more than five years. This renewable, biodegradable material can be used to make computer chips, flexible computer displays, car panels, replacement tendons - for humans - and coatings that keep food fresh longer. Tall wood buildings, or plyscrapers, are sprouting up across the globe today, built with cross-laminated timber (CLT) and based on research from the FPL and elsewhere. CLT is made from layers of wood crisscrossed and held together by fire-resistant glue. It is as strong as structural steel, greatly speeds up construction, and has a much lower carbon footprint than steel and concrete buildings. Power-generating wood flooring is being tested at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, a collaboration between the University’s College of Engineering and the FPL. Made mostly from recycled wood pulp, the flooring is chemically treated to produce an electrostatic charge as people walk across it. The charge can power lights and smart building sensor networks, and charge batteries. Students generate electricity while they walk the floors of the student union building at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Made mostly from recycled wood pulp, the flooring captures the energy of footsteps and turns it into usable electricity. (Photo by Adrienne Nienow) The list of high-tech innovations in wood products goes on. Cellulose from wood pulp could be cheaper and stronger than petroleum-based polymers currently used for 3-D printing. Fabric made from wood fibers could revolutionize both the textile and forest industry. Wood nails can be driven into solid structural timber without drilling pilot holes. A new process chemically removes lignin from natural wood fibers to produce a transparent wood substitute for glass windows and solar cells. And biodegradable electronics could someday help curb the problem of e-waste. These and many other marvels of wood product innovation could make the 21st century the century of wood, increasing demand for wood, leading to increased tree planting to meet demand, and the development of markets for wood currently lacking market value. Importantly, thinning overgrown forests with high fuel loads to supply these markets may also decrease wildfire risk. Wood-based nanomaterials can be used to make electronic components like this one pictured, computer chips, car panels, replacement tendons, and coatings that keep food fresh longer.

"Taking Broadband to the Next Level  Getting broadband to unserved rural areas is one of the toughest challenges we face.

"in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Feb 14, 2011  Agriculture Deputy Secretary Dr. Kathleen Merrigan meets with local producers at the North Carolina University's student run Farmer's Market in Raleigh, NC, on Feb. 9, 2011. Before kicking off this year’s ‘Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food’ college tour in North Carolina, I took a moment to reflect on why these college visits are so important. As President Obama said in his State of the Union address, we must out-educate the world in order to win the future.  Indeed, during the eight years that I spent as a college professor, I was constantly reminded that investing in our nation’s young minds is investing in our nation’s future. With this in mind, this year, members of USDA leadership will join the Secretary and myself in engaging America’s youth in a critical dialogue about our food system, our rural economy, and the economic opportunities associated with local and regional markets. I began this year’s college tour with stops at North Carolina A & T University and North Carolina State University for an important reason. Students at both of these universities have been working with the Center for Environmental Farming Systems (CEFS), on an incredible campaign--North Carolina’s 10% Campaign. The 10% Campaign challenges North Carolinians to spend just 10 percent of their existing food dollars on goods produced by North Carolina’s own farmers and ranchers. By doing this, North Carolinians would infuse approximately $3.5 billion dollars annually into the local state economy.  This effort represents exactly the kind of exciting innovation that the Secretary and I think is key to rural revitalization. While on campus, I gave a lecture to students on why agricultural policy mattered to their lives and helped them to understand how they could get involved. I explained the myriad opportunities for internships and employment at USDA, and encouraged them to look into careers as agricultural economists, agricultural journalists, agricultural engineers, and, of course, as farmers and ranchers. During the tour, I utilized polling technology that allowed audience members to use hand-held remotes, called i-clickers, to vote on multiple choice questions that I asked. On every college campus I visit, participants are shocked to find out that nutrition assistance—not farm subsidies—makes up the majority of the USDA budget (almost 4.5 times the amount of any other expenditure). In fact, I’ve never had an audience correctly answer my question of what makes up the largest share of the USDA budget. This, to me, underscores the necessity of this national conversation. The next generation needs to better understand agricultural policy if they hope to provide solutions to the challenges of our future. But the excitement didn’t end there. We also brought the good news with us that USDA is supplying North Carolina State University (NCSU) with a grant to develop an obesity prevention program that increases access to healthy food and safe places for physical activity. This announcement was delivered as part of the first anniversary celebration of First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! initiative. This commitment to research will help prevent obesity, as well as create a healthier environment not only in North Carolina, but across the country. This year, along with Secretary Vilsack and other subcabinet members, we intend to travel to over forty campuses. It will be a fun and informative tour, so check back to the USDA blog or read our twitter to find out where we’re headed next!

This summer, USDA is highlighting partnerships to invest in the future of rural America. Our partners work with us year after year to leverage resources and grow economic opportunities. They are the key to ensuring our rural communities thrive. Follow more of our stories at #RuralPartners. My passion and commitment for conservation started on the farm learning from our first and finest conservationists:  American farmers. Our nation’s farmers and ranchers care deeply about the land, which is why they are incredible environmental stewards. Earlier this month, I visited the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area, a popular wildlife refuge just minutes from downtown Sacramento. Here, farmers like the DeWit family are growing rice and providing some of the best wildlife habitat in North America. Mike DeWit and his father, Jack, brought me right into the middle of the Sacramento Valley rice fields, where more than a half million acres are used as a source of America’s sushi rice. Equally valuable is the role these rice fields play as a habitat for nearly 230 wildlife species, including providing nearly sixty percent of the winter diet for millions of migrating ducks and geese. It was a thrill to walk on the levee of a shallow-flooded, brilliantly green field and observe several pairs of nesting American Avocets all around. When I noticed a nest with four small eggs, I knew that it represented a part of the future generation of wildlife. It’s partnerships like those modeled by the DeWit family and others –working alongside organizations like Audubon California, Point Blue Conservation Science, The Nature Conservancy and Ducks Unlimited – that truly showcase the great conservation work that our farmers and ranchers do every single day. These partnerships are the key to identifying important resource issues in different areas and the key to successful conservation. USDA recently launched a new conservation initiative, the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), a program that goes beyond traditional government support for conservation and allows businesses and other for-profit partners to invest in regional conservation projects. RCPP will help fund local conservation programs through a $1.2 billion investment from USDA over the life of the Farm Bill and leverage an additional $1.2 billion from private partners for a total of $2.4 billion. These conservation projects will help improve soil health, water quality and water use efficiency, wildlife habitat, and other related natural resources on private lands. In addition to conservation, the projects create economic growth in agriculture, hunting and fishing, outdoor recreation, and tourism. The DeWit’s rice field in the Sacramento Valley is one of eight critical conservation areas designated nationwide. Established through the RCPP and designated by the Secretary of Agriculture, USDA works with Critical Conservation Areas to build on existing, strong partnerships in these regions to accelerate conservation needs and target federal funds. This allows farmers to conserve the natural resources we depend on, while at the same time boosting their operations for the long-term. The caretakers of our land are growing more than food; they’re providing a home for an amazing array of wildlife. Through RCPP we’re hoping to lead a new venture conservationist movement that empowers and launches new, high-opportunity start-up partnerships that deliver locally-led conservation solutions. By employing the most innovative conservation practices around, farmers and ranchers like the DeWits will continue to build on their role as the most prominent stewards of the environment which will benefit all Americans for generations to come.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Mississippi in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Jan 27, 2015  Priscilla Williamson, NRCS supervisory district conservationist, (left), enjoys seeing all the varieties of tomatoes ripening in the newly constructed seasonal high tunnel. Hattie Thompson has a heart for growing healthy food for her community thanks to the help of her new seasonal high tunnel. “My mission is to network throughout the local community with other growers who might be interested in doing the same thing, and to teach children and mothers about nutrition,” said Thompson, who farms in Leake County, Mississippi. After 50 years of city life in Wisconsin, Thompson and her husband moved to the country near Carthage, Mississippi, when they inherited some land 10 years ago. The small six-acre farm is landscaped with fruit trees and an abundance of beautiful flowers. Chickens, guineas and turkeys also call the farm home. It was Thompson’s neighbors who told her about USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), who could help her with conservation practices on her farm. When she visited with Priscilla Williamson, NRCS supervisory district conservationist, she learned about the agency’s Seasonal High Tunnel Initiative available through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Seasonal high tunnels are plastic-covered structures that enable farmers to have crops ready earlier or later in the season. Plants are grown directly in the ground, and the sun’s heat regulates the temperature inside. High tunnels are a cornerstone of USDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative, which coordinates USDA’s work on local and regional food systems. Thompson immediately realized that a high tunnel was a perfect fit for her small acreage farm. It would also fulfill her desire to produce healthy food. Working with Williamson, Thompson was approved to receive financial assistance through EQIP on a high tunnel and construction soon began. It was a family project with one of her five sons, Kevin, helping construct the high tunnel, also helping Thompson save some money. Hattie Thompson of Carthage, Mississippi, shows the huge crop of string beans she produced in her new seasonal high tunnel on her small farm. “She is a very energetic lady and one who gets things done quickly,” Williamson said. An amazing variety of tomatoes, string beans, cucumbers, peppers, watermelons, squash and herbs are grown and ready for farmer’s markets, as well as the entire Thompson family. Pollinator-friendly plants, such as huge sunflowers, surround the tunnel helping to attract bees to aid in pollination. “Using the high tunnel enables me to grow healthy food almost all year long,” Thompson said. She does her own composting of chicken litter, wood chips and other organic material and uses it for fertilizing the naturally grown vegetables and fruits in the high tunnel. Through EQIP, a micro-irrigation system was also installed inside the high tunnel. This irrigation system allows water to be delivered near the roots of plants, ensuring water is used wisely. “A lot of hard work goes into all this, but it’s worth it to give something to the community,” Thompson said. Thompson planted rows of sunflowers and cut flowers along the outer edges of the high tunnel to serve as pollinators for all the plants inside.

USDA Photo.  After a great event yesterday morning on the Obama Administration’s efforts to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, Secretary Vilsack headed to RFD-TV for a live show titled, “Homegrown Energy, Fueling America’s Future.” With an in-studio audience of about 275 people and others watching live, the Secretary kicked it off by talking with RFD-TV host Mark Oppold about how we need America to be a country that makes, creates and innovates.  He talked about USDA programs and rural America’s ability to meet our country's energy needs through renewable energy. Specifically, the Secretary highlighted USDA’s recently announced REAP rule changes that provide fuel station owners with incentives to install flexible fuel pumps that will offer Americans more renewable energy options. But, the majority of the show was just the Secretary taking questions from the audience and the phone on a range of topics, from cellulosic ethanol, to CAFOs to USDA disaster assistance. The Tennessee Future Farmers of America (FFA) President asked a pointed question about what young people can do to support domestically produced fuels.  The Secretary took that opportunity to speak directly to the 4-H, FFA and Whites Creek High School students in the audience to encourage them to pursue jobs in the farming business and to study the ag sciences. Secretary Vilsack wrapped up by telling people to remember to thank a farmer or rancher for all that they do for us. They represent only 1% of our U.S. population, but supply 85% of what we consume.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area in  Research and Science  Apr 28, 2021  The Economic Research Service estimates that in 2010, America wasted approximately 133 billion pounds of food. That’s the equivalent of every American discarding three average-sized apples every day. Not the “apple a day” advice we’re used to hearing. Today, on Stop Food Waste Day, we’re sharing five examples of how USDA is using scientific ingenuity to curb food loss and waste.  Preserving Produce Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists developed a clamshell container for fresh-fruit storage that maintains superior freshness, including preventing the softening and shriveling of strawberries, blueberries, and cherry tomatoes.  Applying Automation Automated sorting separates low-quality fruit from fresh-market, higher-quality fruit. ARS researchers designed and constructed an in-orchard apple sorting system that is compact, reliable, and capable of sorting 11 or more apples per second.  Upcycling “Unwanted” Fruit Many manufacturers and consumers overlook produce that is undersized or blemished. Using food scraps, ARS scientists created the world’s first 100% fruit bar by forming dried fruit into a bar.  Strengthening Safe Foods Reducing pathogen spread helps minimize food loss and waste. In fiscal year 2020, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) invested a total of $40 million in food safety research such as developing new methods to ensure food processing systems can effectively control salmonella.  Championing Consumers NIFA-invested researchers are examining how consumer behavior affects food waste. Community-based nutrition education programs, like the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program, help individuals, families, and communities determine how to use their resources to purchase and prepare healthy food while minimizing waste.

"Improving the Quality of Life for Rural Maine Cancer Patients though Telemedicine  Maine has one of the highest per capita rates of cancer in the United States, and for many cancer patients living in rural areas of the state, a long drive into a bigger city to receive necessary medical treatment can be daunting.  Snowy Maine winters, the high cost of gasoline, relying on family or friends to drive when a patient is not feeling well, and the sheer exhaustion that comes with traveling 140 miles round trip or longer can take its toll on a cancer patient. Now, thanks in part to a USDA Rural Development Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grant, many patients will be able to receive the highest quality care and treatment without having to leave their own rural communities.

"USDA Graded Cage-Free Eggs: All They're Cracked Up To Be  When it comes to purchasing eggs, consumers have interests that go well beyond what they see in the carton.  For many buyers, where that egg came from and how it was produced are just as important as the finished product.  Organic, locally produced, cage-free, and free range are just a few of the marketing claims consumers will find on the carton, as producers try to communicate the attributes of their product.  To provide additional assurance to their customers of the validity of marketing claims, shell egg producers often enlist the services of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). In recent months, a long list of large volume food buyers – including restaurants, grocers, distributors and more – have announced they will transition to sourcing eggs and egg products only from cage-free production systems.  You can learn more about this trend in a recent USDA Blog post.  Many shell egg suppliers have already found a way to assure customers that products marketed as cage-free are indeed sourced from such systems: when USDA Graded eggs are also identified as cage-free, they must undergo a review process to verify the claim is truthful.

"Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Initiatives  Apr 26,  Students from Rockrimmon Elementry School dance with Forest Supervisor during Kids4Trees event on Pike National Forest Cross posted from the Let’s Move! blog: More than 1,200 students, teachers and Scouts recently planted 4,500 trees at the Monument Fire Center on the Pike National Forest in Celebration of the International Year of Forests and as part of an ongoing restoration project in the area. The event brought elementary school students from Rockrimmon and Discovery Canyon Campus schools in Colorado Springs, Colo., to learn about forests, the role of fire in the ecosystem and how forests protect water. Another 1,500 trees were planted by Boy and Girl Scouts from the area. “The kids learned about wildlife, soils, and how the forest operates and what part they play in it,” said Brent Botts of the Pikes Peak District Ranger. Each day, 500 children gathered at the Fire Center eager to learn and, of course, plant a tree.  “I like planting trees because it helps the forest,” said Justin Ballard, 8. “Trees help clean the air, and they are pretty.” The trees were planted in the Berry Fire burn area as part of the long-term rehabilitation plan.  Volunteers and forest service staff “predug” 2,200 holes to make the planting easier but many of the children wanted to dig the holes themselves. Armed with plastic shovels, the kids scratched at the rocky soil until they had enough space to plant their 2-year-old ponderosa pines. “I like digging . . . but my favorite part of planting is putting the dirt back in the hole,” said Connor Callussy, 7. Projects like the tree planting are in line with First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! initiative that is about putting children on a path to a healthy future. An aspect of the initiative, Let’s Move Outside, is aimed at getting kids active outdoors not just to exercise but as a fun way to explore the great outdoors. Students from Discovery Campus Elementry School compare trees during the kids4Trees Event on the Pike National Forest. After lunch and a concert of conservation songs the kids headed back to school. For their work, they each received a tree they could plant at home. But their work will be a lasting legacy as the trees they planted during the project will become the forest of tomorrow.  “These kids went home knowing that trees are an important part of the environment and that the ones they planted will be around a lot longer then they will,” said Botts. The event was sponsored by the Coalition for the Upper South Platte, Kids4Trees and the U.S. Forest Service. The trees were grown by the Colorado State Forest Service and transported to the Forest Service’s Monument Fire Center, which ironically used to be a nursery until it became a fire center and home to the Pike Hot Shots and Monument Helitac. The United Nations General Assembly has declared as the International Year of Forests to bolster efforts to promote sustainable management, conservation and development of forests worldwide.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Nov 09,  Retirement – for many – is a time for reconnecting with what you love and who you love. Laura Cristobal-Andersland and David Andersland have spiced up retirement with their seasoning business, Salty Wahine Gourmet Hawaiian Sea Salts. A seasonings business was a natural decision for Laura Andersland – she began making sea salts at the age of 11 with her Hawaiian-born grandmother, and later gained experience in the finance world that would make opening the business an easy transition. For David Andersland, he retired from the U.S. Navy as a surface warfare officer. His leadership skills and global expertise gained in the Navy now play an integral role in coordinating Salty Wahine’s international business plans and export sales. People around the world can taste the eruption of flavor that is Kaua’i Island from Salty Wahine exporting its handmade, gourmet sea salts, including Hot Lava, Island Volcano, or Passion Fruit Chili Pepper. Salty Wahine uses the Foreign Agricultural Service’s (FAS) Market Access Program (MAP) funding to enter and grow international sales of its luxury commodity. MAP funds allow American small-business owners expand their exports and open new markets in other countries. Salty Wahine is a seasoned exporter – winning Hawaii’s Small Business Administration’s Exporter of the Year award in and . Growing exports allowed Salty Wahine to create new jobs. “We have quadruped our staff since starting to export our products,” according to Laura Andersland. Furthermore, David Andersland’s diverse career in the Navy helped prepare him for collaborating with foreign partners and the worldwide travel that are crucial to running an international business. “Doing contracting and recruiting with a lot of public speaking equipped me to be ready with an elevator pitch all the time,” said David Andersland. The Navy veteran knows how to market to some of the different foreign partners based on his previous experiences being in that country during his service. “The market is unlimited because everyone uses salt,” David Andersland told FAS when asked about what Salty Wahine is looking forward to during the next five years. It is growing back its export opportunities as it looks to reconnect with pre-Covid customers. Salty Wahine feels like there are sweet things in store for its growing international business. Laura Andersland is prepping her son and daughter-in-law, Sean and Jessika, to take over the family business someday – continuing their devotion to serving the community and service members around the world. The Navy Exchange in Pearl Harbor and the commissaries are the cheapest place to get Salty Wahine’s seasoning products, “because that’s one of our ways of giving back,” said Laura Andersland. And during the holidays, Salty Wahine sends care-packages to different Army and Fleet Post Offices across the world to share its appreciation and spread cheer. In honor of Veterans Day, FAS would like to salute David Andersland and recognize Salty Wahine, a veteran- and women-owned business that supports active-duty and former military personnel every day.

"Rocky Mountain Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jul 20,  Tom Brown hiking Chasm Lake, Rocky Mountain National Park. Photo credit: Tom Brown In cycling the Continental Divide in Colorado, you get a vivid picture of where much of our water comes from. During my long bike rides up there, I commonly find snow still melting in June. This snowmelt adds to streamflow that becomes our renewable water supply and my drinking water supply. The part of rain and snowfall that does not naturally go back into the atmosphere becomes our water supply and it varies greatly across the United States. In the wettest regions, such as New England, precipitation is plentiful and about half of it ends up in streams or replenishes ground water supplies. At the other extreme—that is, in much of the Southwest—precipitation is scarce and only about five percent of it becomes part of the water supply. The rest evaporates or is used by natural vegetation. Across the Interior West, a region from Arizona and New Mexico to Montana and North Dakota, about 13 percent of precipitation goes into the water supply in an average year. In the west, most precipitation falls in the high country, where temperatures and evaporation are lowest, meaning it is the source of the majority of the renewable water supply. And that is lucky for the people who live in the west, because much of the high country mountains are forested or protected, so that the quality of the resulting streamflow tends to be very good. For the United States as a whole, about 55 percent of our drinking water comes from diverting surface flows. The rest is obtained by pumping ground water. The quality of that water is vitally important. When it comes to diverting surface water, what happens on the watershed upstream is essential, because it determines the downstream financial cost of bringing the water up to drinking water quality standards. In general, the closer you live to protected land or to forested land, the better is the water quality of the streamflow. Across the west, nearly 50 percent of the renewable water supply in an average year originates on or adjacent to National Forest land, with another 6 percent coming from National Park lands. And across the west, depending on how forests are defined, 58 to 77 percent of the renewable water supply originates on forests, with some additional water flowing from high-elevation alpine areas. In the northeast 60 percent of the renewable water supply originates in forests. It is not an exaggeration to say that forests and protected lands play an extremely important role in the provision of water in the United States. As I play in and around our forests in the west, I am always aware of where my water comes from. An outdoors enthusiast cross-country skiing near Cameron Pass, Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest.

"Counselor for Agricultural Affairs-Vietnam, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Nov 18,  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack (right) speaking at Hanoi University of Agriculture, Hanoi, Vietnam on Wednesday, November 16, . There are many things that Americans are known for, including dreaming big, working hard to turn those dreams into a reality, and reaching out to help others who are also trying to make their dreams come true. During his trip to Hanoi, Vietnam, earlier this week, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack—whose own personal story and history of public service epitomizes these very characteristics—challenged a packed auditorium of more than 600 students and faculty at the Hanoi University of Agriculture (HUA) to be the generation whose dreams transform their communities, their country and their world. HUA, Vietnam’s oldest and largest agricultural university, was the perfect setting for this message, as many of its alumni have been instrumental in helping Vietnam transform in just 25 years from a food aid recipient to one of the world’s top agricultural producers and exporters. In fact, Vietnam is one of the world’s fastest growing economies and an important market for U.S. agricultural products. In the past decade, Vietnam jumped from the fiftieth to fifteenth position as a market for U.S. farm exports. At the same time, the United States has become a growing market for Vietnamese goods such as rice, coffee, cashew, spices and seafood. Two-way trade between the United States and Vietnam is strong for each partner. Although Vietnam no longer faces the problem of chronic food shortages, Secretary Vilsack reminded the students that new threats to the country’s food supply—whether from the impact of climate change to the decimation of crops and livestock through disease—needed to be anticipated, countered and controlled. “What is the best way to do that?” asked the Secretary. Embrace science—just like Dr. Norman Borlaug. When Secretary Vilsack told the capacity crowd about Dr. Borlaug’s green revolution, the estimated 1 billion lives he saved, and the World Food Prize he established, you could almost feel the dreams taking flight from the eager students. Secretary Vilsack closed his remarks by challenging the audience to aspire to make a difference, not by dreaming of things as they are, but as they should be. I know that somewhere in that auditorium, someone is going to do just that. Note: Vilsack is visiting with Asian Pacific partners in Vietnam and China to help strengthen trade relations and support the American brand throughout the region.

"Partnership Protects Public Access in a Landscape Fit for a King  A stunning landscape called Castle Valley, near Lake Tahoe, is the heart of one of the most heavily-used backcountry recreation areas in the northern Sierra Nevada region of California. The 400-plus acre valley is also a primary access point to the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail that winds its way through the Sierra’s, providing picturesque vistas and some solitude. Because of its key location, many felt Castle Valley was a perfect fit to be added to the Tahoe National Forest, an area known for world class skiing, outdoor recreation and natural beauty that attracts millions of visitors a year.

"Public Affairs and Michelle Zweede, Brazil Program Manager, Forest Service in  Forestry  Trade  Jan 19,  Fire brigades in the Brazilian Amazon listen to Scott Dehnisch, a U.S. Forest Service employee. Photo courtesy of Forrest Behm. Since , the U.S. Forest Service has worked to develop a program focusing on improving sustainable forest management and administration, fire management and prevention and special uses in protected areas in Brazil.  The emphasis has been on exchanging experiences with a focus on critical issues such as curbing illegal logging and preserving public forests. The Forest Service’s International Programs and support from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), has generated a partnership with Alianca da Terra, a Brazilian non-governmental organization that works with ranchers and farmers to get their goods to market in a sustainable way.  They also help landowners preserve forestland.  The current law requires maintaining 80 percent of forestland.  While this seems straightforward, the reality on the ground is complex. Alianca da Terra is challenged by squatters who use fire to clear land for crops.  Doing so threatens the forest. For the past two years, smoke jumpers and fire managers from the U.S. Forest Service have been working with Brazilian representatives to improve understanding of fire management and build leadership within local fire brigades. Training participants work out a detailed scenario. Photo courtesy of Forrest Behm Practices are improving partly due to training of more than 250 indigenous leaders and community members in basic fire prevention, management and safety in the last two years.  Smoke jumpers and fire management officers sent from the U.S. Forest Service to Brazil have been able to build local capacity to combat fires safely and effectively as well as build leadership within local fire brigades. Recently, representatives from the Payette National Forest trained over 80 community and fire brigade members.  As a result, the landholders and tribes in Mato Grosso are better prepared to control, manage and prevent fires from destroying farms, ranches, and the remaining tropical Amazon forests in the region.  The work preserves livelihoods and conserves biodiversity and tropical forests. Continued work with the fire brigades will evaluate their methods, actions and offer recommendations for improving their firefighting skills.  The program will continue to build and support leadership in the fire community.

"Administrator, USDA Rural Development Rural Utilities Service in  Initiatives  Rural  Jan 18,   This fall USDA’s Rural Utilities Service (RUS) successfully completed its final round of grant awards under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act).  In the last year and a half, we’ve done more to bridge the digital divide for rural Americans than many ever thought possible.  The Recovery Act has unleashed an historic level of investment in rural high speed telecommunications infrastructure that will create new jobs, new services and new opportunities across the countryside. The Recovery Act Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) consisted of two rounds of funding.  In those two rounds the RUS broadband team reviewed more than 3,000 applications and selected 320 projects for awards across 46 states and one territory.  This amazing accomplishment will help transform rural communities and lead to new economic opportunities that we can only begin to imagine. I’m pleased to announce that we have just published an 84-page report, entitled “Advancing Broadband,” that details all the projects that won BIP awards.  The selection process was rigorous and the competition was intense.  The Advancing Broadband report explains the exciting new services which will soon be made available in hundreds of rural communities.   Let me give you a quick overview of the report. By leveraging the original $2.5 billion authorized by Congress to fund loans as well as grants, USDA was able to invest almost $3.53 billion in rural broadband infrastructure.  In addition, $285 million of non-federal funds were committed to be invested in BIP projects.  This funding will enable around 7 million rural Americans to connect to one of 285 last-mile, 12 middle-mile, or four satellite projects funded by the BIP program.  On top of that, over 360,000 businesses and 30,000 community service organizations such as hospitals, schools and public safety agencies will be connected to a high-speed digital future. Broadband access is one of the pillars of rural economic development identified by Secretary Vilsack and President Obama.  “Advancing Broadband” provides a foundation for strong rural communities.  Products, services and ideas originated in rural communities can find a global market.  Life-long learning, government services and quality medical advice can be brought right into your community and home.  Jobs and economic opportunity will be created as successful applicants build out BIP funded systems and as rural farms, businesses and communities find new ways to build on this exciting new infrastructure.  Approximately 25,000 jobs will be created immediately and many thousands more will be created in the future based on these new networks. Bill and Shelley Nondorf of Hoxie, KS, are great examples of the potential to build out and build on broadband.  Thanks to new services deployed by a BIP award recipient, Bill and Shelley have been able to grow their business and provide more services to customers. I am very proud of the work of the RUS team to successfully complete record breaking investments in telecommunications, electric and water infrastructure.  Our work is far from done.  Our field staff, accountants and agency experts will be working to ensure that taxpayer dollars are well spent and projects are kept on track.  Another BIP funded initiative provided nineteen technical assistance grants to encourage regional economic development planning based on expanding broadband access.  Soon, we will be opening our regular broadband loan and grant programs to new applications.  We are encouraging those who did not get funded in the highly competitive BIP program to consider applying to our broadband loan and community connect programs.  I hope you’ll take a close look at this report.  To see it, click here.

"Affordable Care Act provides incentives to encourage doctors to serve in rural America, funds rural health centers, helps rural Americans get access to care  USDA awarding more than $10 million in grants to support telemedicine and rural health research  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .14  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  Washington, D.C., Nov. 20, – Today, on National Rural Health Day, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced more than $10 million in grants through two U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs to improve access to health care for rural Americans across the nation. The Secretary also highlighted initiatives created by the Affordable Care Act that specifically address critical health needs in rural communities.""Delivering these programs to rural communities that often do not have access to quality, affordable medical and educational services has tremendous economic and social benefits,"" Vilsack said. ""They also mean that people who live and work in rural areas will not have to travel long distances for specialized health care services. These investments mean that students in rural high schools will have educational opportunities often not available outside urban areas.""Through the Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) program, USDA has helped hundreds of rural communities deliver care in remote areas since it began two decades ago. Today, USDA's Rural Development is awarding $20.4 million in grants that will provide rural Americans access to medical services, improve educational opportunities, and support Native American communities. Fiscal Year Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grant recipientsRural residents are more likely to report a fair to poor health status and have higher rates of health complications, morbidity and mortality due to challenges associated with low levels of employment and education, geographic barriers and isolation, lack of quality nutrition and health education, and lack of access to health care.USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is awarding 12 grants totaling more than $1.4 million to universities aimed at enhancing the quality of life in rural areas through improved health and safety education efforts. NIFA funded the grants through the Rural Health and Safety Education program which addresses these challenges by developing programs that provide the necessary health information to rural residents. The program has three main focus areas: 1) individual and family nutrition and health education; 2) farm safety education; and 3) rural health leadership development education.Projects funded in fiscal year focus on a diversity of rural health and safety issues, from diabetes education, obesity prevention, and physical activity and healthy nutrition education, to eco-healthy child care promotion, and rural expansion of 4-H Healthy Living program. Fiscal Year Rural Health and Safety Education Grant recipientsIn addition to today's announcements, Secretary Vilsack encouraged rural Americans to take advantage of the Health Insurance Marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act and discussed the health care reform law's specific benefits for rural communities.""Rural residents have higher rates of chronic conditions. This can be exacerbated by a lack of doctors or clinics in rural communities,"" Secretary Vilsack continued. ""The Affordable Care Act is improving the health of rural communities and giving all families the security they deserve. No one should go without healthcare because of where they live, or be forced to leave the communities they love to get the coverage they need.""Rural Americans suffer from higher rates of chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. The Affordable Care Act has taken steps to address the unique challenges rural communities face when it comes to getting the health care they need.One in five uninsured Americans lives in a rural area, and yet on average only 10 percent of the nation's physicians practice in these communities. The Affordable Care Act has significantly increased the size of the National Health Service Corps, which offers scholarships and loan repayment to health practitioners in return for practicing in rural communities and other underserved areas. More than 3,500 Corps members now serve in rural areas, and an average of 86 percent of them will remain in their communities even after completing their service.The Affordable Care Act also invests significantly in expanding services at community health centers, where 7.5 million rural Americans get access to primary and preventive care. That comes on top of the more than $3 billion USDA has invested since to strengthen health infrastructure in rural areas, building rural hospitals and health clinics and expanding access to health care in remote rural areas through telemedicine.Not only can a lack of health insurance coverage help lead to high rates of chronic conditions, it threatens rural families economic health as well. Before the Affordable Care Act passed, the average rural family paid nearly 50% of all health costs out of pocket. One in five farmers is in debt because of medical bills. Uninsured individuals living in rural areas are able to use the Marketplaces to compare qualified health plan insurance options based on price, benefits, quality, and other factors with a clear picture of premiums and cost-sharing amounts to help them choose the qualified health insurance plan that best fits their needs.Open Enrollment for the Health Insurance Marketplace began Nov. 15, , and runs through Feb. 15, . Those who have plans can continue them without re-enrolling. However, consumers are encouraged to visit HealthCare.gov to review and compare health plan options and find out if they are eligible for financial assistance, which can help pay monthly premiums and reduce out-of-pocket costs when receiving services.

"Are You Ready? Do You Know How USDA's Nutrition Assistance Programs can Play a Vital Role in Helping Those Most in Need Following a Disaster?  Twice a year, as part of America’s PrepareAthon!, USDA works closely with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as well as with other Federal, state and local partners to promote emergency preparedness.  When disasters strike, it’s not only important for you and your family to be prepared, it’s also critical that your community be prepared.  USDA supports local communities by providing access to healthy meals in emergency situations. USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) ensures people have access to nutritious food when they find themselves suddenly in need of assistance following a storm, earthquake, flood or other disaster emergency.  Oftentimes after a disaster, retail food stores are closed making it impossible for families to get the food they need.  Even after stores reopen, disaster survivors often still are recovering financially which makes buying food difficult.  FNS programs are there to help in those circumstances.

"FSA Outreach Marketing Specialist in  Conservation  Aug 26,  Elsa Torres’ father, Jose, inspired her to buy an orchard and farm on her own. For Elsa Torres, farming is more than just a job or a livelihood. It’s an inspiration. Ever since she was a young girl, Elsa can remember working in orchard fields with her father, Jose Torres. It was something she loved and cherished. “My father is the person I admire the most,” said Elsa. “He came from Mexico with nothing and for 25 years he worked on an orchard that he now owns. He didn’t start out with a formal education.  But now he’s a business owner.  He’s an example of the American dream and how someone who works hard can become a success.” In , when the opportunity came to purchase that orchard Jose bought the land. Elsa knew she could do the same someday so that her two children could experience the joy she had growing up on a farm. “I love working out in the fields and the smell of fresh cut grass while trees are blooming,” said Elsa, who now has her own family and works a full-time job but still helps her father by managing the financial side of his orchard business. “It’s busy, but you gain a sense of appreciation for growing things.” So a year ago, when she stumbled across a 50-acre corner lot loaded with fruit trees and wine grapes she knew it was her chance to become an entrepreneur. But she couldn’t tell if that particular Wapato, Washington property was up for sale. She went home and called a realtor to see if any farm property in the area was available. “The realtor said he had one going on the market and it had everything we wanted, fruit trees, grape vines and room for expansion. He told me the name of the road and it was the same 50-acre corner lot,” said Elsa. “That’s when I knew it was meant to be.” Like many beginning farmers, Elsa found it difficult to obtain financing to buy the land. After being turned down for a loan by five different banks, she contacted the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) for help. “Elsa was unable to secure financing from a private agricultural lender because she lacked the capital needed for the down payment,” said Scott Smith, farm loan officer with the Yakima County FSA office in Washington State. “Through the FSA direct farm ownership loan program, we were able to provide the needed financing to allow her to purchase a farm.” The direct farm ownership loan program provides farmers and ranchers the opportunity to purchase farmland, construct and repair buildings and make farm improvements with no down payment and a maximum loan amount of $300,000. In fiscal year , FSA obligated 2,563 direct farm ownership loans totaling more than $448 million. Elsa also received help from the Northwest Farm Credit Service’s Jumpstart program. Now, she owns her own farm, is selling grapes to a local winery and thinking about expanding her operation. For now, Elsa is happy to grow into her own and continue the family orchard business. “It’s a total family operation. My husband, dad, brother, nephew and sister all help out,” said Elsa. “It’s busy, but we will be just fine.” To learn more about how USDA helps new farmers, visit www.usda.gov/newfarmers.   For more information on FSA farm loans, visit www.fsa.usda.gov/farmloans or find your local FSA county office at  Elsa named her farm B&J Orchards & Vineyard after her children.

"U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 31,  The Bogus Creek Fire burns in the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge in southwest Alaska, June 7, . Photo credit: Matt Snyder-Alaska Division of Forestry You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to know that wildfires are more common during hot, dry summers. The area burned in the United States in , over 10 million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, occurred during a record temperature year for the Earth, plus record low snowpack and rainfall in some areas of the West. The sizzling weather of was similar to what global climate models project for the year . Last year’s weather and fire may become the new normal later in the 21st century. A warmer climate is expected to increase the frequency and severity of fires.  Historically, fires most often occur in the western U.S., as well as the boreal forest and tundra of Alaska. Current models predict that two to three times more area will burn annually in the West by .  This is a significant change in how wildfire will affect ecological systems and human communities in the future. A longer fire season and bigger fires in Alaska would have a significant effect on the global carbon cycle. Organic soils in boreal forests and tundra contain up to 30 percent of the Earth’s terrestrial carbon, which can be released to the atmosphere by intense wildfires that burn deep into the soil. Temperature is increasing fastest at northern latitudes, thus increasing opportunities for wildfire to occur. Foresters manage fuels to reduce fire intensity, vegetation mortality and damage to structures. In the Southeastern U.S., most pine forests are treated with prescribed fire every few years, keeping surface fuels and tree densities low to reduce the risk of fire.  Forest thinning, prescribed fire and other means of fuel removal reduce fire intensity in dry forests in the western U.S. Increasing temperatures coupled with increased wildfire will create new ecological and social challenges for federal resource managers. Warmer temperatures increase the complexity of conservation in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, threaten homes in the wildland-urban interface, and make the task of fire suppression even more costly. By identifying “hot spots” where future wildfire may be especially pervasive and damaging to resources, the U.S. Forest Service and other federal agencies are developing adaptation options and locations where fuel treatments can be prioritized.  They are also working with local communities to ensure that residents are prepared to live in areas where fire hazard is high.

"in  Initiatives  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Nov 22,   Cross posted from the Dairy Good blog:  Across the nation, Americans from all walks of life are taking steps to reduce the amount of food that goes to waste. Part of the solution lies in finding innovative new ways to use food that would otherwise by wasted. That’s where the Cleveland Browns, Ohio State University, the City of Cleveland, the Dairy Innovation Center and other partners are stepping in to help. On Sunday, November 24, this new partnership will begin taking waste from FirstEnergy Stadium and turning it into clean, renewable energy. Anaerobic digesters like the one in Cleveland are being built in greater numbers across the nation.  In fact, working together with the dairy industry, USDA has provided more than 240 awards since to construct anaerobic digesters. Food waste is a big challenge for our nation for many reasons. First, it’s a food security issue. Wholesome food that’s wasted could help feed needy families through donations to food pantries and soup kitchens. In , the amount of uneaten food in homes and restaurants was valued at roughly $390 per U.S. consumer – more than an average month’s worth of food expenditures. Second, food waste is a natural resource issue. In , 133 billion pounds of food in U.S. retail food stores, restaurants, and homes never made it into peoples’ stomachs. It takes about 22 million acres of land to produce that much food – in other words, enough land to cover more than three-fourths of Ohio. Third, food waste is a climate change issue.  Food is the single largest component of municipal solid waste going to landfills – and those landfills are the third largest source of methane.  By reducing the amount of food we toss into the trash, we can help reduce these potent greenhouse gas emissions. In partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency and a range of private and non-profit partners, USDA has created a new Food Waste Challenge to fight this problem. The Food Waste Challenge encourages folks to do three simple things. First, to find new ways to reduce food loss and waste. Second, to recover unneeded, wholesome food that can help feed those in need. And third, to recycle wasted food as much as possible. When it comes to reducing food waste, all of us are in this together. I’m proud of the effort being made in Cleveland, and I appreciate the hard work that’s gone into this new project at the FirstEnergy Stadium. At USDA, we’re committed to combating food waste and making our nation stronger in the process.

"Recreation, Heritage and Wilderness Resources, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 14,  This campground is on the Cascade Ranger District of the Boise National Forest. As the weather begins to get warmer and the sun stays high in the sky longer, we hope your thoughts turn to camping and outdoor activities on your national forests and grasslands. Whether you are camping on the ground, in a tent or in a recreational vehicle, whether it’s your first time or you’re a seasoned recreationist, there are ways to prepare before heading outdoors to create an unforgettable experience. Much of your preparation depends on the type of camp setting you choose. Options range from primitive – meaning no amenities such as toilets, potable water or electricity – to highly developed sites with running water, showers, full electrical hook-ups and other modern conveniences. You should also be aware of your own outdoors skills when selecting a site or activity. That could mean the difference between relaxing by a solitary campfire roasting marshmallows as you listen for a coyote howling in the distance or a more social setting with a sense of safety and security in a large developed site with creature comforts. For any recreationist, planning is the key to ensure an outing with lasting memories. Whatever outdoor recreation setting you choose, the U.S. Forest Service has the variety.  The agency has more than 10,000 developed sites across the nation, it hosts millions of acres that allow camping in less developed or primitive sites and it manages 36 million acres of designated wilderness but with more restrictions on how you use the land. Before your trip, research which forest or grassland has the setting you seek. You also should be highly aware of weather conditions for the time of year and elevation of your destination, and prepare accordingly. In Colorado’s Pike National Forest for example, it’s not unusual for snow to fall in spring or summer nor is it unusual for a hail storm to pelt unsuspecting recreationists, so dressing in layers and carrying extra clothing is a must. Recreation.gov is a smart starting place. This website is a one-stop shop for trip planning, information sharing and reservations; it’s the federal government gateway to discover America’s outdoors. The site offers advance reservations at 2,500 federal areas for more than 60,000 facilities. Once you have your destination in mind and have made appropriate reservations, it’s time to check your equipment. You should know exactly what to bring and the condition of your equipment before leaving home. Are your clothes, tent and sleeping bag suitable for the elements? Does any of your equipment need to be repaired? Have you put fresh batteries in your flashlights and do you have a backup? Does your first-aid kit need to be replenished or refreshed? The Coconino National Forest in Arizona has published the Safety and Outdoor Ethics checklists to help people prepare for outdoor adventures. Limited or no equipment?  That may not be a problem. Cabins are a great way to experience camping without a huge investment in tents, travel trailers or motorhomes. Rental cabins are available in some locations. Check with the supervisor’s office of your preferred forest or grassland or go online at recreation.gov to see if there are cabins available for rent. Plan a menu then buy groceries. There’s nothing better than the taste of food cooked over a camp stove or open campfire. Make a grocery list so you will remember to bring all that you’ll need. In remote areas stores may be a long distance or may not stock the items you want. Many developed campsites provide a grill and fire ring, but you might also want to bring a camping stove. Check on any restrictions before bringing fire wood.  On longer trips, ice coolers are a necessity to keep perishable foods fresh. A very important item to include on your list is any medication you need. There’s no better experience than sleeping under the stars on a cool spring or summer night to renew your body, mind and spirit. Your national forests and grasslands are waiting for you to make your own experience.

"Agricultural Marketing Service Administrator in  Trade  Jul 08,  This partnership will streamline access to the growing Korean organic market for American producers and businesses, benefiting the thriving organic industry and supporting jobs and businesses on a global scale. USDA Photo Courtesy of Miles McEvoy. Last week, we celebrated another victory for the global organic community – the announcement of an organic equivalency agreement between the U.S. and the Republic of Korea. We are thrilled with the outcome! Beginning July 1, , processed organic products certified in Korea or in the U.S. may be sold as organic in either country, eliminating significant barriers and creating opportunities for American businesses across the organic supply chain as well as setting the foundation for additional organic agricultural trade agreements. Consumers in Korea will now be able to enjoy a wide range of U.S. organic exports including condiments, cereal, baby food, frozen meals, milk, and other processed products. Under this Administration, the United States has also established organic trade arrangements with Canada, the European Union, and Japan. The Korean arrangement will streamline access to the growing Korean organic market for American producers and businesses, benefiting the thriving organic sector and supporting jobs and businesses on a global scale. The new arrangement also reflects the strength of the USDA organic standards – the U.S. organic program sets the gold standard, which is one reason that Korea chose to work with the U.S. on its “first” organic equivalency arrangement.  It also serves as an example of how closely the U.S. and Korea are working together to address emerging issues and strengthen our trade relationship. In , Korea was the 6th largest market for U.S. agricultural exports—providing about one quarter of Korea’s agricultural imports and purchasing more than $5 billion of U.S. food and agricultural products. According to U.S. industry estimates, the U.S. exported around $35 million of processed organic products to Korea in .  These exports came to a virtual standstill in January , when Korea implemented mandatory organic certification requirements that U.S. organic exports to be certified to Korean standards.  U.S. operations wanting to access the Korean organic market were faced with a double set of fees, inspections, and paperwork. The U.S. negotiating team – led by representatives from the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), and the Agricultural Marketing Service’s (AMS) National Organic Program (NOP) led by Deputy Administrator Miles McEvoy – worked expeditiously to reestablish access to Korea’s organic market while protecting the integrity of USDA’s organic standards. Negotiations encompassed a side-by-side comparison of the USDA organic regulations and the Korean organic standards to determine if an equivalency arrangement would work. We also sent an audit team to Korea to evaluate their organic certification and enforcement provisions.  After the thorough review, U.S. and Korean officials finalized the organic equivalency arrangement. Both the U.S. and Korea are committed to ensuring that all traded products retain their organic integrity from farm to market. Through the NOP, USDA has helped organic farmers and businesses achieve $35 billion annually in U.S. retail sales.  The organic community includes over 25,000 organic businesses in more than 120 different countries around the world, and the combined organic markets of the countries with which we have equivalency arrangements are valued at more than $50 billion.  AMS and NOP are proud of USDA organic integrity, which helps propel strong growth in consumer demand for certified organic products and creates opportunities worldwide for American organic businesses.

"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way from the Summit: How REE is Using New Strategies to Reach Even Newer Poultry Handlers  During a walk along tree-shading sidewalks in the “burbs”; you’re accustomed to seeing games of hopscotch, bike rides, and maybe even the occasional Golden Retriever. However, one residential backyard, nearly 6 miles from downtown Atlanta, calls into question whether this is suburbia at all. There were swings, a tree house, and even patio furniture. Yet one feature certified this was not your mother’s suburban home: over a dozen chickens living comfortably in a custom made “Coop de Ville.”    The rise of “backyard poultry” is one of many agricultural phenomena tied to a growing food consciousness and increased urbanization. And while USDA’s fundamental job doesn’t change, the Department does because the challenges do.  The recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at increasingly popular backyard chicken coops underscore this. While this concern was not clearly expressed in the Act of Congress that created the Department, the mandate was. USDA still works to “acquire and to diffuse…information” towards facilitating the protected growth of American agriculture. That service is what brought Research, Education, and Economics Undersecretary Dr. Catherine Woteki to this residence in Decatur, GA. Accompanied by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service officials and a man known best as the “Chicken Whisperer,” Dr. Woteki toured the site and helped to shed light on current HPAI research and important biosafety measures.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, California in  Conservation  Dec 02,  The riparian brush rabbit is state and federally endangered, with all known populations in the northern San Joaquin Valley facing significant threat of extinction. Declines of brush rabbits have largely been attributed to loss of habitat. Photo courtesy USFWS Pacific Southwest Region. Some exciting news recently came from a large wetlands restoration project now underway in Central California. River Partners, a nonprofit conservation organization, documented the first occurrence of a state and federally endangered rabbit on its habitat preserve at Dos Rios Ranch, a key piece of riverfront habitat located at the confluence of the Tuolumne and San Joaquin rivers in Stanislaus County. Thanks to a generous loan of wildlife cameras from a professor at the University of California, Davis, River Partners’ summer interns captured images of riparian brush rabbits at Dos Rios Ranch in July in remnant riparian habitat along the Tuolumne River. Riparian brush rabbits are a critically endangered subspecies of rabbit that was thought to be extinct following catastrophic flooding in . “This rabbit was photographed over a mile away and across the river from known populations,” said Julie Rentner of River Partners. “The nearby San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge hosts a thriving population of reintroduced riparian brush rabbits, but there has been no proof that the rabbits were at Dos Rios Ranch since . The camera is still set up and is capturing additional images, so we’ll certainly turn up more if there are more rabbits out there.” The multi-million dollar wetlands restoration efforts on Dos Rios Ranch began in . The land was enrolled in the former Wetlands Reserve Program, or WRP, a conservation easement program offered by USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, (NRCS). Easement programs offer landowners the means to restore, enhance and protect wetlands on their property through easements. The Farm Bill merged WRP with other easement programs to form a new one: the Agricultural Conservation Easements Program, (ACEP), which continues to further wetlands restoration. The project’s main objectives include restoring the riparian corridor, providing a critical link between this easement and other USDA easements, establishing self-sustaining native plant communities, and providing riparian habitat for wildlife. The property had been used for agricultural production for over a century. This project transforms it back into its former glory as a wetland. NRCS is working with the landowner, River Partners, to design and implement the project and is actively managing and monitoring the restoration process. The 1,150-acre project area contains remnant floodplain habitats that include wetlands, riparian woodlands and agricultural lands. The 1,600-acre Dos Rios Ranch property was purchased by River Partners in with funding from seven local, state and federal funding partners for use as a flood management and wildlife habitat project. “Restoration work is progressing using a phased approach,” said NRCS wildlife biologist Karl Kraft. Currently, about 500 acres are being restored. Work on 137 acres began in spring . The second phase began in fall on 384 more acres, and the third phase will begin in , Kraft said. “More than 944 acres will be retired from production and restored to riparian habitat when the work is complete,” he said. “Numerous wildlife species should benefit from the restoration, including the federally endangered riparian brush rabbit, riparian woodrat, least bell’s vireo, and threatened valley elderberry longhorn beetle,” Kraft said. Trees, such as black willow, and other native woody species are being planted in rows, much like an orchard, with planting berms and space between the rows for native grasses and forbs. Furrow irrigation between the planted rows is used to apply water to plantings in the initial growing seasons. Rabbit foraging areas of low herbaceous plants such as Spanish clover, gumplant and native grasses have been established adjacent to patches of clover near the tree plantings. Dense thickets of California wildrose and blackberry established away from trees will offer protection against hawks and other predators. Some areas of dense, low growing vegetation have been established on elevated ground, known as “bunny mounds,” to provide rabbits cover and flood protection. Kraft said that five of these bunny mounds have been constructed so far. “The riparian brush rabbit was a primary reason for protecting and restoring the ranch,” said Dean Kwasny, easement programs specialist with NRCS. “It’s encouraging to see that our conservation efforts are having tangible benefits for this focal species.”  Category/Topic:  Conservation  Tags:  ACEP  California  Conservation  endangered species  Farm Bill  Food Farm and Jobs Bill  NRCS  wetlands  Wetlands Reserve Program","Here is a concise question related to the content: What conservation effort, involving a multi-million dollar restoration project on Dos Rios Ranch in Central California, was undertaken to restore riparian habitat for endangered species such as the federally listed riparian brush rabbit and riparian woodrat?","The conservation effort undertaken was the wetlands restoration project at Dos Rios Ranch, which involved a multi-million dollar investment to restore 944 acres of riparian habitat, including planting native trees and vegetation, creating ""bunny mounds"" for flood protection and predator avoidance, and establishing rabbit foraging areas."

Okay, yes it’s Maple Syrup Day, an unofficial holiday, but the day allows us to celebrate and recognize this often underrated commodity. So in honor of this lovely product, here are some interesting tidbits that you may not know. I use maple syrup on many things; not just pancakes, waffles and French toast, but also in recipes like soups and casseroles, to sweeten granola or oatmeal, even coffee. I’ve used it on ice cream and even snow, on salads and in salad dressings. My own step-father is known to take a shot of maple syrup every now-and-then. It is delightful on its own. Maple syrup can also be used to make maple cream, maple sugar, and maple candy. Maple syrup being poured over pancakes. Did you know that sugaring dates back to the s? By the s both Native Americans and European settlers were making syrup. It wasn’t until the Civil War when tin cans and metal spouts were introduced that the maple syrup industry was born. The University of Vermont offers more on the history of Maple syrup online, but in the northeastern region alone, maple syrup production totaled almost 3 million gallons in . According to a report by the National Agriculture Statistics Service, Vermont remained the top “Maple State” in the region and in the nation. Actually, on my way back home from spending Thanksgiving weekend in Vermont, I picked up a booklet about maple syrup created by the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers’ Association and I learned that: Maple syrup has more antioxidants than raw tomatoes, cabbage or cantaloupe; It has a lot more nutritional value than honey, brown sugar, white sugar, and corn syrup; And all the grades of maple syrup can be of equal quality; it’s just matter of taste. I prefer the very dark color syrup as this has the strongest flavor, but you can start with the lighter varieties and work your way to more robust flavors. In March the USDA introduced a new grading system, United States Standards for Grades of Maple Syrup, to make it easier for producers to market their syrup and clear up any confusion for consumers. So find which grade is right for you and enjoy! And since I work for APHIS and I am originally from Vermont, I would be remiss if I didn’t ask you to check your trees for signs of the Asian longhorned beetle because this non-native insect threatens all of our nation’s maple trees.

"U.S. Forest Service National Botanist, Washington D.C. in  Forestry  Oct 09,  Amongst the falling leaves, you might discover the frost flowers of dittany (Cunila origanoides). Its former light blue flowers have come and gone, its seed cast to the wind, but from the base of their stems you may be lucky enough to see what looks like curling ribbons of ice, one last gem of their blooming glory, a frost flower. Courtesy of Kathy Phelps. Fall is a wonderful time to find an amazing array of wildflowers on your national forests and grasslands. But before you venture out, take a moment for a sneak preview on the U.S. Forest Service’s Fall web site for a few ideas to plan your visit Early morning hikers who are out and about in the hardwood forests of the south-central and eastern United States may be lucky enough to observe the second flowering of dittany (Cunila origanoides). Also known as frost flowers, they are found in late autumn on crisp, frosty mornings. Though they are not true flowers, they are just as beautiful. An herbaceous perennial wildflower, dittany is a member of the mint (Lamiaceae) family. It gives off an aromatic odor when the leaves are crushed, which explains its other common name—false oregano.  The flower is small and lavender blue.  It is found from late spring into early summer, generally in dry, mesic hardwood forests—a habitat with moderate or well-balanced moisture. For frost flowers to form, the air temperature needs to be below freezing while the soil is still warm enough to allow for the transport of sap up into the plant’s stem.  When the air temperature reaches the freezing point, the sap in the stem begins to freeze and expand. Tiny slits form in the stem, and thin ribbons of frozen sap emerge near the plant’s base. Occasionally, several slits form and multiple ribbons of frozen sap push out from the stem resembling flower petals, thus the name frost flower. Amongst the falling leaves, you might discover the frost flowers of dittany (Cunila origanoides). Its former light blue flowers have come and gone, its seed cast to the wind, but from the base of their stems you may be lucky enough to see what looks like curling ribbons of ice, one last gem of their blooming glory, a frost flower. Courtesy of Kathy Phelps. Only a few species of wildflowers have been identified as forming frost flowers.  Besides dittany, frostweed (Verbesina virginica), yellow ironweed (Verbesina alternifolia), and longbranch frostweed (Helianthemum canadense) are known to produce frost flowers under the right conditions. The right time of year for frost flowers to form is fast approaching. Now is the time to hit your favorite hiking trail and discover this wildflower.  Here’s a hint: on a day when a frost is predicted, wake up extra early, bundle up, pack a camera and go back to the spot where you found a patch of these wildflowers and see if any frost flowers have “bloomed.” But be sure to go early as these frost flowers only last until the sun begins to rise in the East and air temperatures climb above freezing. Happy trails on your frost flower search!

"USDA Louisiana Public Information Officer in  Rural  Feb 14,   USDA Rural Development Housing Administrator Tammye Trevino and Rural Development Louisiana State Director Clarence Hawkins kick-started the new year by holding a White House Business Council Stakeholder’s meeting in Luling, Louisiana, located in St. Charles Parish near New Orleans.  The focus of the stakeholder’s meeting was rural housing.  The focus fit perfectly in line with Administrator Trevino’s primary reason for visiting Louisiana. Administrator Trevino, along with Bryan Hooper, Deputy Administrator of USDA’s Multi-Family Housing Division each served as presenters on the Council for Affordable and Rural Housing (CARH) mid-year meeting in New Orleans.  CARH is a national nonprofit trade organization focusing on issues affecting rural housing.  The theme for this year’s meeting was “Transforming Rural Housing: Innovative Tools and Dynamic Initiatives for Tomorrow.” Administrator Trevino served as the opening speaker.  Following her address, she joined State Director Hawkins and Deputy Administrator Hooper for a tour of two Rural Development projects located in Boutte and Waggaman, Louisiana. The administrator had an opportunity to tour the Boutte Estates Subdivision, where a collection of 12 homes have either been built, or are in the process of being built through the USDA Rural Development Self-Help Housing Program.  The USDA Rural Development Area Office in Amite worked with the grantee, Family Resources of New Orleans (FRNO) to provide the assistance these homeowners needed to realize their dream of homeownership. That’s where they met new homeowner Lester Bailey. After retiring from the Avondale Shipyard with 38 years of service, Bailey believed that his fixed retirement income would only allow him to rent an apartment for the rest of his life and that homeownership at the age of 65 would be impossible.  He worked with FRNO, and with their guidance he was able to obtain a USDA Rural Development Direct Home Loan.  Lester was able to provide hands-on assistance in building his home and assist others with the construction of their new homes.  He also qualified for payment assistance so his monthly payment would be more affordable.  In a particularly heart-warming moment, Mr. Bailey had the unique opportunity to directly express his appreciation and give his testimony to Administrator Trevino. Family Resources of New Orleans was praised for its role in helping low-income families realize the dream of homeownership.  “Your job as counselors and housing advocates working directly with families is an extremely important part of helping rural citizens become successful homeowners.  The Mutual Self-Help programs are available to assist applicants with the construction of their homes under the guidance of a non-profit organization,” said State Director Hawkins.  “Working in Washington, it is rare we get an opportunity to see the fruits of our labor.  This organization and these homeowners are doing a fabulous job,” said Administrator Trevino. After touring Boutte Estates, they collectively ventured east to Waggaman, Louisiana where two USDA Rural Development financed Multi-Family Housing complexes are currently under rehabilitation. The following morning, approximately 30 local developers, lenders, business, and community leaders gathered to participate in the White House Business Council Stakeholder’s meeting at the St. Charles Parish West Branch Library in Luling, Louisiana.  The objective of the meeting was to obtain input from community leaders on how the Obama Administration can partner with local groups and governments to improve housing opportunities, economic conditions, and job creation in rural areas.

"District Conservationist, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Illinois in  Conservation  Jun 10,  Tim Malone, center, is a NRCS district conservationist in Tazewell County, Ill. Here he leads a watershed tour. (NRCS photo) Rivers are special places, and for me, the Illinois and Macinaw rivers in central Illinois are my special places. Both rivers eventually send their waters to the Mississippi River, and the area provides habitat for wildlife as well as recreational opportunities like hunting and fishing. But the rivers suffer from streambank erosion, soil erosion, sedimentation and nutrient runoff. We all hear about the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico at the mouth of the Mississippi, which is caused by high levels of nutrients in the water. Water quality is important to me as a conservationist and motivates me as a conservationist. I am interested in conservation and wildlife habitat – both as a citizen that enjoys the outdoors as well as my job as a district conservationist in Tazewell County, Ill. with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). At NRCS, I work with local landowners, farmers, levee and drainage districts, and local highway departments to address resource concerns on their property, including erosion, and keeping sediment and nutrients on the land and out of waterways. Nutrients include nitrogen and phosphorous, common fertilizers as well as animal waste. Sediment is eroded soil, and it often carries nutrients with it. Conservation practices, such as grassed waterways, grade stabilization structures and terraces, can help prevent runoff. Conservation programs provide technical and financial assistance to help put these practices on the ground. These conservation practices not only help the environment but the agricultural operation, too. For example, we work with farmers on comprehensive nutrient management plans, which is an all-inclusive strategy that looks at all aspects of a livestock operation from the amount of manure generated to the amount of waste storage available on the farm. A nutrient management plan identifies cropland acres where this manure can safely be spread and utilized. When we first started promoting these plans in , we reached out to livestock producers that we may not have worked with in the past. I remember a swine operation that had trouble controlling animal waste near the Mackinaw. I approached them to see if they were interested in a comprehensive nutrient management plan. At that time, he was not interested. A short time later, his brother-in-law and business partner, decided it would help their farm and protect the nearby river. They put in a number of practices that managed the waste and kept it from washing downstream. It is neat to have new conservation opportunities come about to help people make positive improvements to the land. And the good news, those opportunities continue to grow. The Farm Bill created a new program, called the Regional Conservation Partnership Program. This program brings in assistance from partners to help get more conservation on the ground. The program focuses part of its funding on eight critical conservation areas, including the Mississippi River basin. I am happy to hear of the continued investment in the basin, as the river – and the many rivers that form it – are an important ecosystem. The Mississippi River’s tributaries in Illinois, including the Illinois and Mackinaw rivers, are an important part of my life. It is a flyway for migrating waterfowl and an opportunity for duck and goose hunting. I take my 15-year-old son, Kole, hunting for duck and squirrels in the wetlands and forests along the Mackinaw and Illinois. It is great to have a job that makes a difference working with these farmers who help protect the waterways in the Mississippi River basin. They are eager to practice conservation on their land and willing to listen to technical advice when they have me out on their farms.

"APHIS Aquaculture Program Manager, Riverdale, MD in  Animals  Plants  Jun 06,   If someone told you there were simple things you could do to keep fish from dying and protect our waters, you’d want to know more, right? Well, if you’re a boater or angler in the Great Lakes region, there’s a lot you can do to stop the spread of a fish disease called viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS). VHS kills freshwater and marine fish, including some species of bass, trout and perch. The good news is you can help fight the disease by remembering to clean boats and fishing equipment. It’s also important not to transfer bait, water and mud from one waterway to another. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) created a Focus On Fish Health campaign to let boaters and anglers know that they’re on the front lines of slowing the spread of VHS. Find out more at www.FocusOnFishHealth.org. The Focus On Fish website has some great information on the disease--such as how to recognize signs of VHS--and advice on how to dispose of dead fish and unused bait. If you belong to a boating or angling group, the APHIS website tells you how to get free materials, including palm cards and Power Point tools, so you can get the word out to others. And while you are out on the water having fun, be sure to bring your camera!  Enter our photo contest, where you can submit pictures of the biggest fish you ever caught or share memories of good times on the water. There are two categories: Your Best Catch and Family Fun on the Water. Winning photos get posted on the Focus On Fish Health website. If you win, you get a free tee-shirt, duffle bag and hat. You can submit up to three photos each month and winners will be announced at the end of June, July and August. For more information on contest rules and , visit www.FocusOnFishHealth.org. Joining the effort to fight VHS is one way to make sure that future generations will have the same great photos to pass down to their children--and more wonderful stories to share.

"Posted by Workabeba (Abby) Yigzaw, Public Affairs Specialist, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in  Animals  Plants  Jan 24,  If you are sending citrus gifts, learn how to do it responsibly by visiting www.saveourcitrus.org Out with the snake, in with horse! January 31 marks the start of the Chinese New Year. Many people will be enjoying the rich cultural traditions of this holiday such as food, parades and exchanging gifts. One traditional Chinese New Year gift is citrus fruit, such as mandarin oranges and tangerines. This fruit is said to bring luck, wealth and prosperity. However, without proper precautions citrus can also bring something else that may not be so favorable—the Asian citrus psyllid. This pest carries citrus greening disease, also known as Huanglongbing (HLB), a disease threatening the commercial citrus industry and homegrown citrus trees alike. Although it is not harmful to humans or animals, the disease is fatal for citrus trees and has no known cure. The Asian citrus psyllid likes to feed on leaves and stems of citrus, and can travel on them when citrus is moved from place to place. Because the pest is so small, it often goes unnoticed as it spreads the disease to healthy trees. The Asian citrus psyllid and citrus greening have caused devastation all over the world, and citrus greening is now spreading in the United States. Citrus greening disease has been detected in California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, and South Carolina, as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Millions of acres of citrus trees have already been destroyed and millions more are at risk. The threat of this pest does not mean that the tradition of giving citrus must end. What it does mean is certain precautions should be considered while gifting citrus. The first thing to do is always be aware of quarantines in your state. Do not move citrus trees, fruit or trimmings from these areas. Not only are you risking spreading citrus diseases by transporting citrus outside of these areas, but it's also against the law. Review the quarantine map for more information. If you grow citrus yourself, you may wish to share your harvest. However, homegrown citrus should be kept at home. Help reduce the spread of citrus diseases by not moving your homegrown citrus fruit or plants from quarantine areas or across state lines. If you are buying citrus fruits, or even a citrus tree, be sure to only buy from a certified vendor. Citrus plants sold in a regulated state must be sold from a certified vendor and be accompanied by a USDA certificate. Commercial fruit packers, internet shippers and roadside vendors within regulated states should be able to prove they are in compliance with the federal quarantine. Before you buy, ask the vendor if their product is in compliance. If you buy a plant that is disease-free, you'll have a much healthier and more productive tree.

"Writer/Editor, Farm Service Agency in  Conservation  Apr 08,  Jeff and Kim Essig gave their blueberry farm a boost with a microloan to help purchase equipment that will further expand their operation. This post is part of a Microloan Success feature series on the USDA blog.  Check back every Tuesday and Thursday as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s Farm Service Agency. USDA’s Microloan program allows beginning, small and mid-sized farmers to access up to $35,000 in loans using a simplified application process, and up to seven years to repay. Through the Farm Service Agency (FSA) USDA is focused on increasing opportunities for farmers and ranchers and has made several modifications to farm loan programs, including making Microloans to beginning farmers and veterans exempt from direct loan term limits. Producers have more flexible access to credit for initial start-up expenses, family living expenses, minor farm improvements and hoop houses to extend the growing season. Kentucky couple Kim and Jeff Essig, owners of Middlebridge Blueberry Farm, know about the benefits of the Microloan program first-hand. Kim shares their story: I married a man who was already in love — with Kentucky.  Although we were both born and raised in Orange County, Calif., he grew up visiting his grandpa Martin’s farm in Oakland, Ky. during summer breaks. So it was no surprise that six months after our wedding, we packed up our things and blazed the trail from Southern California to Smiths Grove, Ky., to live on the land. The first several years we had limited land and dabbled in growing food for ourselves and trading produce with neighbors. In , we were able to purchase a few acres in Bowling Green, Ky.  It was then we started thinking large scale. We chose blueberries as our main crop.  Between and we installed an acre of blueberries and also started beekeeping. By , we added blackberries, raspberries and strawberries. As our berries grew, the customers came as did the idea of branching out into blueberry plant propagation for selling, expanding our bees and maximizing what we could do with our little piece of earth. One day I saw an announcement for the Kentucky Farm Service Agency (FSA) Microloan program.  I contacted the FSA office for an application. The application process informative, organized, helpful and painless. And Farm Loan Officer Tracy Bailey called and met with us right away. Looking back over these past two years, we find ourselves very grateful to God for the opportunity to expand our farm and take hold of opportunities that we most likely would have had to pass up if not for the FSA’s Microloan program. What we found most helpful were the people behind the program. Tracy Bailey, as well as others in the office, really made the process friendly and smooth. The interest rate and payment terms have been key in helping us to grow into our farm vision.  Kim and Jeff Essig USDA is proud to see the progress that farmers and ranchers are making in their daily operations with the help of the Microloan program. To date, USDA has issued more than 4,900 Microloans totaling $97 million. The microloan program is part of USDA’s StrikeForce for Rural Growth and Opportunity Initiative, our commitment to growing economies, increasing investments and creating opportunities in poverty-stricken rural Kentucky and 19 other states. The Essig family started with blueberries and later expanded to include blackberries, raspberries and strawberries.

"AMS Fruit and Vegetable Program Deputy Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 31,  An infographic highlighting facts and figures about Fall harvests and Halloween trends. Click to see a larger version. Whether its an abundance of fresh farm crops at the local grocery store, farmers market or fall festival, the fruits (and vegetables) of the growing season are all around us. About 158 million Americans will get into the Halloween spirit this year, spending an estimated $7 billion to celebrate Halloween. Just over 44 percent will carve pumpkins for the holiday, but that won’t be the only starring role the big orange squash will play this season. To meet the demand for all things pumpkin, U. S. farmers produced more than one billion pounds of pumpkins last year. That’s a lot of pumpkin pies, flavored coffee drinks and Jack-O-Lanterns. While less than half of American adults will dress up in costumes, 13.8 percent plan to dress up their pets. Apples are another fall staple.  Whether you like them candied, caramelized or bobbed-for, a visit to your local farmers market is a great way to find fresh apples. From Gala to Red Delicious to Granny Smith, American farmers produced $3 billion worth of apples in . Here at the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), we’re happy to do our part to help American farmers and businesses reap the benefits of their harvests. Whether tracking down key market news pricing information to help operations of all sizes compete in the marketplace or providing grading services that ensure the quality of food available to American consumers, AMS is committed to supporting American agriculture.

"Renewable Energy on Farms Study Released - First to Look at Role of State-Level Policies  USDA has published a study examining states’ adoption rates of distributed generation for solar and wind energy on U.S. farms. The results show that states with higher energy prices, more organic acres per farm, and more Internet connectivity adopt renewable electricity at higher rates.  For solar systems, full-farm ownership and solar resources were also significant factors.  Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) targets were found to increase state level renewable electricity adoption at the distributed-generation scale while electric cooperative prevalence in the state was found to have a negative relationship to renewable electricity adoption share.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jul 24,   Through the end of August, you will get the chance to be entertained as sockeye salmon swim along Alaska’s Steep Creek as the adults spawn before swimming to their final deaths. The Forest Service has placed the salmon cam in the creek on the Tongass National Forest so viewers world-wide have the opportunity to view fish in their natural setting. The ability to watch salmon in the wild is a treat for many people, but the underwater camera gives you a more intimate, unique look. “The overall escapement, or numbers of fish that reach the spawning grounds, for Steep Creek sockeye varies from year to year,” said Pete Schneider, a fisheries biologist on the Tongass. “An average run would be considered 1,000 fish. We have seen it as low as 350 and as high as 4,000. So many factors can contribute to run size. It’s difficult to predict. So keep watching.” The male sockeye salmon has a larger head with elongated jaws, hooked snouts and strongly developed teeth. (U.S. Forest Service photo) Early in the spring sockeye fry emerge from the gravels and move into Mendenhall Lake and Mendenhall River sloughs and ponds, where they feed for 1-3 years before migrating to the ocean. After spending several years at sea, the adult sockeye return to Steep Creek to spawn, their last act before they die. But all is not lost. The dead sockeye are still good meals for a variety of forest critters, including their own fry and as their nitrogen-rich carcasses decompose they provide valuable nutrients into the ecosystem. If you see the view clouded, it could be because a female salmon is building her redd (gravel nest) by agitating the bottom of the creek bed with her fins and tail. She then bends her body back and forth to make a depression where she deposits her eggs. A male then moves in and deposits his milt, or sperm, over the eggs after an often lengthy courtship. The female uses her tail fin to cover the redd then moves upstream to do it again. Female salmon will often build multiple redds in the same general vicinity and then guard them as long as they can before eventually dying. Sockeye salmon guarding their redd, or gravel nest. (U.S. Forest Service photo) “I typically leave the camera in place until the end of September. Often the water quality becomes too poor by October due to the amount of rainfall,” Schneider said. “The sockeye run will dwindle by the end of August. After a short lull for a week or two the coho salmon will arrive.” Schneider said the coho run will not be as large as the sockeye. However, more Dolly Varden char enter the stream, too. Many Dollies arrive “early” to feed on loose eggs during sockeye spawning, but many more arrive in early fall to spawn. They spawn about the same time as the coho in different locations along the creek so they do not overlap with the coho, a process refined over years of evolution. As the fish are making their way along the creek, Schneider and other Forest Service employees make daily counts. The third week of July they counted about 30 sockeye milling about in the beaver pond downstream from the camera. “They are in full spawning , but are likely waiting until a rain event occurs. This lowers water temps and raises water levels, which often will trigger the movement of fish upstream to the actual spawning grounds and into camera view,” he said. “Unfortunately, I can’t move the camera downstream any further than I have to see them.” View .

"USDA Rural Development student employee and Portland State University graduate student in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Mar 07,   On March 3rd, Deputy Agriculture Secretary Kathleen Merrigan gave an informative speech about USDA’s ‘Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food’ initiative to a packed crowd of Portland State University (PSU) students and faculty.  As both a PSU graduate student of Public Administration and a new employee with USDA Rural Development in Oregon, I was impressed by USDA’s active role in creating solutions to some of our most pressing national and global issues. After hearing her speak, I find myself not only motivated by the Department of Agriculture’s efforts, but also encouraged that the Obama Administration has recruited a Deputy Secretary who clearly has extensive expertise, including an educational foundation in science, as well as an obvious commitment to finding solutions for the agricultural issues our nation faces. Deputy Merrigan began her talk by emphasizing to students that no matter what their interests, there is a relevant connection to be made in addressing the challenges of their generation. As she spoke about the food system in the United States, it was clear that improvements and innovation are vital in order to address national trends, such as childhood obesity and increased rates of diabetes.  Deputy Secretary Merrigan also emphasized trends in the agricultural sector and American farmers, who account for less than 2 percent of our population today.  With one American farmer feeding 155 people today, it is alarming to consider the rate of those leaving agriculture without a new generation coming in to fill their shoes. The presentation highlighted efforts by the USDA to combat these trends through areas such as natural resource conservation, production, aggregation, processing and distribution, marketing, consumption and waste management.  The Deputy provided snapshots of some of these USDA efforts, including: Nutrition assistance helping 1 in 7 Americans purchase healthy food while making ends meet every month; Cost-share for hoop-houses and other conservation practices that improve agricultural production while protecting soil, water and other natural resources; Crop insurance to protect American farmers from drought and other natural forces that compromise their economic stability; Various loan and grant programs for new and seasoned farmers to preserve the future of family farms, make farming a viable economic endeavor and promote the health of rural communities; and USDA’s support for the development of local and regional food hubs to bridge the gap between local farmers and consumers, market local foods, improve local economies, and ensure a supply of fresh, nutritious foods to American communities; The food hub concept, along with USDA’s many other programs, aligns with the ‘Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food’ initiative by further encouraging Americans to connect with local farmers and buy locally produced food.  The incentive for buying local was made obvious when Deputy Secretary Merrigan explained that only 19 cents of every food dollar in America goes directly to the farmer.  Buying local not only puts more of each food dollar into our farmers’ pockets, but it ensures that more of the money consumers spend will remain in their local community. In fact, buying local can keep $73 out of every $100 spent in the local economy, as compared to only $43 for non-local purchases. As a new employee to USDA Rural Development and a native Montanan with family currently farming in Hysham, I am grateful to be a part of an agency that is focusing so much energy on improving the conditions of American farmers and rural communities.  As an individual aspiring for a career in public administration, I am incredibly encouraged to see such efforts to improve the livelihoods of so many Americans that, at the same time, contribute to solutions to our global challenges.

"Risk Management Agency Administrator in  Rural  Jul 21,   USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA) and Farm Service Agency (FSA) working together have made great strides in making acreage reporting simpler for farmers and ranchers.  The Acreage and Crop Reporting Streamlining Initiative (ACRSI), seeks to reduce the reporting burden on producers submitting to USDA. In listening sessions with producers last year, FSA and the Office of the Chief Information Officer found some common themes emerged: 1) Producers want to provide their information such as acreage reporting , just once, and expect USDA agencies to share the internally -‘one-stop’ reporting; 2)  Producers currently provide the same information multiple times; and 3)  Acreage reporting is inefficient and is not always accurate ACRSI will standardize requirements and automate the reporting process.  It is a huge step toward one-stop reporting and permits easier identification of discrepancies and misreporting. Ultimately, ACRSI could allow for automated reporting from a producer’s GPS monitoring equipment. Another big benefit:  Reduced USDA operating costs and improved integrity and accuracy Now we want more input. We believe the public, especially producers, ranchers, and the crop insurance industry may have suggestions to help further reduce the reporting burden. If you have ideas on how to streamline collection, we’d like to hear from you. We are continuing the discussion on the USDA Open gov policy gateway website at:  www.usda.gov/open.  Please provide your suggestions or otherwise participate in the discussion there through the discuss tab.  Or see our recently published Federal Register Notice on the RMA website which provides a 60-day comment period for public input regarding ACRSI.

"Senior Advisor to the Secretary of Agriculture in  Energy  Mar 13,   America needs and is developing a reliable, sustainable, fuel supply. If we are able to produce more of it here at home – rather than relying on foreign oil – we’ll generate good, middle-class jobs and strengthen our economy in the long run.  That is why USDA and the Obama administration are working with private industry to pursue an ‘all-of-the-above’ energy strategy to promote American-produced renewable energy coupled with oil production. Today, biofuels are being developed using not just corn, but corn stover, soybeans, switchgrass, wood, camelina, energy cane, municipal solid waste, yellow oils, algae, and a host of other non-food feedstocks growing across the country. In fact, USDA set up virtual research consortia across this nation to help further the use of a variety of feedstocks to produce fuel. This is giving American businesses opportunities to expand, giving farmers ways to be part of the energy solution, and giving American consumers the choice to buy domestically produced, homegrown energy. Today, these choices are already providing Americans with cheaper gas at the pump because it is mixed with ethanol. Agriculture Senior Advisor to the Secretary and session moderator Sarah Bittleman (left), refers a question to Clean Fuels Development Coalition Executive Director Douglas Durante (second from right), during the Renewable Energy session on “Moving Renewable Energy Forward,” at the Agricultural Outlook Forum But it is not just biofuels that will help rebuild our nation’s manufacturing sector. The bio-chemical industry also has the potential to be an important driver of American economic growth and rural jobs in the years to come. Just as oil companies use petroleum to produce chemicals and other products, we can use materials grown in America to produce chemicals, construction materials, and even cleaning products to use in your home. This industry employs 100,000 Americans today and is expanding the important intersection of agriculture and manufacturing. Additionally, we are working with other federal departments and the military to develop sources of aviation and transportation biofuels that will reduce the length of supply lines in times of conflict and also reduce reliance on politically questionable sources of crude. Recently, my colleague Harry Baumes, head of the USDA Office of Energy Policy and New Uses, hosted back to back panels to explore renewable energy issues at the Agricultural Outlook Forum in suburban Virginia.  To read the presentations from the distinguished panelists we hosted click here.  To learn more about USDA’s support for sustainable renewable energy and how you can participate click here. This Administration has helped bring our nation’s reliance on foreign oil to a 13-year low, with domestic oil and gas production that has increased each year since .  And we are also tackling the long-term problem of building an American energy economy that will make sure that families don’t fall victim to skyrocketing gas prices over the long term while creating jobs to strengthen the middle class.

"Research and Development, USDA Forest Service in  Forestry  Sep 07,  While we wouldn’t measure the economy in board feet, lumber demand and economic growth are closely linked. (Photo by Bryan Alexander) “Lumber and economic growth are tightly connected,” says USDA Forest Service scientist Jeffrey Prestemon. “At a certain rate of GDP growth, you get a certain path of lumber consumption.” Prestemon recently led a study that projects softwood lumber demand under different economic growth scenarios represented by real gross domestic product. Softwood lumber – much of it imported – is used for new homes and apartment buildings. (Photo by Bart Everson) Housing demand is a key factor. A third of all U.S. lumber is used to build new homes or apartment buildings. Prestemon’s model uses three variables to predict the number of housing starts: the rate of economic growth, the number of houses built in the past, and mortgage delinquency rates. Mortgage delinquencies spike during recessions but otherwise occur at fairly stable rates. According to the study, those three variables can predict 90 percent of the quarter-to-quarter variation in the national total number of housing starts. The scientists tested several future economic growth scenarios represented by real GDP through the year . For the past 15 years, GDP has grown by an average of 2.4 percent each year. In the future, if real GDP grows by two percent, the model suggests 1.1 million new homes will be started. In that scenario, lumber demand would stay roughly the same as today, neither increasing nor decreasing substantially. If GDP grows faster than 2 percent, lumber demand will increase. But if GDP grows more slowly than 2 percent, demand for lumber will likely fall. People would be more likely to repair old houses, use less new wood, and become more efficient in how much wood they use in new houses. Since the inflation-adjusted rate of economic growth in the U.S. has slowed by an average of 0.04 to 0.05 percent of GDP each year. The U.S. population is also growing more slowly, down from 1.8% per year in the s to less than 0.9% per year in the last ten years. The U.S. housing sector is a key driver of demand for wood products, and it’s also important for the broader economy. “We didn’t set out to model a shrinking population,” said Prestemon. “We modeled forest sectors under different economic scenarios. One of those was low economic growth, which could be caused by low population growth.” A third of all U.S. lumber is used to build new homes or apartment buildings.

"in  Initiatives  Rural  Jan 08,   The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has had a profound impact on the American people. Investments were made to create and save jobs, spurring economic activity and long-term growth. As a result, communities and families had access to resources to help lay a stronger foundation for the future of our country. In fact, through USDA’s Single Family Housing Guaranteed Program, over 80,000 American families were able to purchase or maintain a home. The Recovery Act was implemented with unprecedented levels of accountability and transparency to ensure taxpayer dollars were being used as intended. I was concerned by the findings of the recent audit of our Guaranteed Housing Program, because using government resources effectively and prudently is important to those of us at USDA. While our review of the program shows significantly higher adherence to standards, we take these audits seriously and our Rural Development agency has already taken important steps to address the findings, including: 1. Improving, updating and clarifying loan program requirements and regulations to reflect the current economic climate; 2. Implementing additional quality control procedures to ensure loan rules are followed by those who utilize the program; 3. Finalizing a new rule to require lenders who utilize the program to ensure the soundness of the loan, and; 4. Providing additional training to staff and lenders. In the months ahead, we’ll continue to implement these and other improvements recommended by our auditors to make sure the program is working as intended and in a manner the American taxpayers demand. Despite these challenges, I am confident that the overall objective and integrity of the Recovery Act was met by stimulating new home construction and home sales in rural America during a time when the housing market was struggling. Not only did the agency’s loan guarantees provide home ownership opportunities to thousands of low and very-low income households, as the law intended, but also created jobs and economic activity in real estate, construction, and other affected businesses.

USDA photo by Preston Keres People and families in need often visit food banks and pantries to get basic provisions free of charge. Unfortunately, donations often decrease during the summer months. The nationwide campaign Feds Feed Families was created to help food banks and pantries stay stocked. This summer’s campaign, Feds Unite Against Hunger, offers several easy ways federal employees can help ease the burden on food banks across the nation. This year’s multi-faceted approach focuses on the practice of gleaning – clearing fields of unused produce. Many farmers and growers generously open their fields to allow federal employee volunteers to glean fresh fruits and vegetables to donate to food banks, churches and other partners. While gleaning, the early morning weather may heat up, but one soon notices the volunteers are united in purpose—and noticeably smiling—as they take stock of the crops gathering as the result of their efforts. USDA Rural Development employee Mark Stout who grew up farming, volunteers a few hours of his time almost every week to help pick fresh produce. “I challenge all federal employees to volunteer to glean, to donate a can, and to participate in any activity that allows us to give to a food bank or pantry this summer. These organizations help people in need get a good meal or put food on the table for their family.” This year, employees are especially encouraged to participate in gleaning activities as they consider the Feds Feed Families program.

They know, like we do, that cleaner air, water, soil and habitat are not only good for our planet, but also contribute to healthy and productive working farmlands. At USDA we have a wide range of tools and support available to help farmers voluntarily implement conservation practices to improve the health and productivity of private and Tribal working lands. Since , the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) has provided more than $4 billion in assistance to farmers, ranchers and forest managers to enhance conservation on more than 70 million acres. And this year, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) plans to add an estimated 10 million acres to the rolls. Today, we announced that $150 million in funding is available for agricultural producers through CSP in to help producers maintain and improve their existing conservation systems and adopt additional conservation activities to address priority resources concerns. And if you’re interested in seeing how it works, here’s a look back at five stories that show the that can be achieved by farmers and ranchers through participation in CSP. These stories help to showcase some of the many ways our nation’s producers are putting conservation to work on their operation and for their communities. 1. Wisconsin Farm Serves as an Example for How Conservation Benefits Agricultural Operations Greg and Karon are passionate about what they do, and they take care of the land, making sure the operation stays productive while also conserving natural resources. To do this, they use a suite of conservation practices, which improve soil health on the farm and water quality downstream.

Through Conservation, an Iowa Farmer Keeps Water Clean Downstream Majestic Manor, run by David and Amy Peterson, has been in the family for four generations. They milk about 120 Holstein dairy cows twice daily and  grow corn, alfalfa, oats, triticale and soybeans on about 320 acres. Petersen likes to refer to his operation as “closed-loop” where the soil feeds the crops, the crops feed the cattle, and the cattle feed the soil. Iowa farmer David Petersen uses a variety of conservation practices to prevent nutrients from washing off his dairy farm into the nearby Cedar, IA and Mississippi Rivers. USDA NRCS photo. 3. Better Quality Beef Starts with Improving the Quality of the Land Healthier grass means healthier forage, or food for the cattle. Jake Shadowen aims to constantly improve the quality of his cattle by improving forage. Through the Conservation Stewardship Program(CSP) and other Farm Bill conservation programs, he received technical and financial assistance to put in cross fencing and to implement other conservation activities, or enhancements. Jake and Jondra Shadowen and family use conservation programs to improve their Benton, KY ranch. USDA NRCS photo. 4. Powered by Diversity and Healthy Soil, an Organic Iowa Farm Flourishes In many respects, Ron and Maria Vakulskas Rosmann’s “Farm Sweet Farm” is a typical Iowa farm. The Rosmann’s grow corn, soybeans, cattle and hogs. But that’s where the similarities with traditional farming operations end. The Rosmann’s have a retail store on the farm where they sell a wide variety of goods to visiting consumers. NRCS photo. 5. Conservation Programs Help Nebraska Farmer Install, Improve Irrigation System As a little girl, Mary Kay Lyon followed her father around their south central Nebraska farm always dreaming of one day owning the operation herself. Lyon left the farm to attend college, but eventually made it back home when her father retired, determined to run the family farm. Center pivot irrigation systems use less water and are more efficient at uniformly distributing water across a field. USDA NRCS photo by Jacob Robison. Overall, since , USDA has invested more than $29 billion to help producers make all kinds of conservation improvements, working with as many as 500,000 farmers, ranchers and landowners to protect over 400 million acres nationwide, boosting soil and air quality, cleaning and conserving water and enhancing wildlife habitat.

"Agricultural Attaché, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  May 04,  Consul General Ricardo Zuniga displays U.S. beef ready for Brazilian customers representing more than a decade of work. U.S. fresh beef exports are back in Brazil! Following a 13-year hiatus, the first shipment of U.S. fresh beef has arrived in Brazil, ushering in promising long-term market opportunities for the U.S. beef industry. In , the United States exported $6.3 billion in beef and beef products globally. With Brazil’s large market reopened to the United States, U.S. beef exports are poised for new growth. Brazil closed its market to imports of U.S. fresh beef in over concerns about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Since then, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service worked continuously with Brazilian officials to regain market access. Additionally, USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has provided documentation and information on the U.S. food safety requirements and standards for beef. Following numerous technical discussions and meetings, Brazil officially reopened the market in August based on the United States’ classification by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as a negligible risk country for BSE. As the U.S. agriculture industry witnesses this first shipment of fresh beef arriving in Brazil, it’s the ideal time for U.S. exporters to re-engage in marketing efforts in the country. Currently, Brazil’s main suppliers of fresh/chilled beef are Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina – both because of their proximity to Brazil and because they enjoy duty-free access as a result of the Mercosur customs union. From -, Brazil imported an average of $296 million of fresh/frozen beef, or 50,000 metric tons, annually. Despite the competition from Mercosur countries and a 10-percent tariff differential for countries outside the customs union, the United States is in a great position to compete in the Brazilian market thanks to the ability to target high-end consumers. The FAS Agricultural Trade Office in Sao Paulo recently launched the – a market promotion campaign to support the branding and promotion of U.S. food and beverage products in Brazil, including U.S. beef.  Brazil boasts a population of more than 206 million people, with more than 40 percent of the population in the middle class and 16 million high-end consumers.  Despite the country’s current economic crisis, it is a promising market for U.S. high-value products, like fresh beef. Brazilians are familiar with the quality and diversity of U.S. food products and there is a demand for high-quality cuts of beef in both the foodservice and high-end retail sectors. Since Brazil first announced the reopening of its market to U.S. fresh beef, USDA has worked with Brazil’s Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Food Supply on the food safety protocols and label approval process for U.S. firms wanting to ship to Brazil. An agreement was reached in December that met Brazil’s product labelling approval requirements. Visit the FSIS Export Library for updated information on Brazil’s export requirements for U.S. meat, poultry and processed egg products, including detailed instructions for shipping U.S. fresh beef and beef products to Brazil.

"USDA Rural Development Public Affairs Specialist in  Rural  Jul 01,   While on a recent visit to Oregon, USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development Victor Vasquez visited the Canyon East farm worker housing complex currently under construction in Madras. The USDA-supported facility is scheduled for completion in August, with families moving in shortly thereafter. Vasquez was joined by Oregon Rural Development State Director  Vicki Walker. The community of Madras in Central Oregon is surrounded by numerous farming and ranching operations that provide fresh foods and products for regional markets. Many of these operations, including irrigated seed crops, potatoes and mint as well as the numerous hay and livestock operations, can be labor intensive, and rely on an infusion of farm workers. Yet, housing options in the Madras area have been limited for farm workers and their families, despite the integral and valued role they play in local agriculture as well as the overall community. Deputy Undersecretary Vasquez tours the Canyon East farmworker housing facility, which will be completed in August. For the Canyon East facility, USDA Rural Development is providing financial support and will also provide rental assistance to qualified, low-income farm laborers and their families.  To address the issue, a partnership of local officials, state agencies, non-profits, advocacy groups, farmers and ranchers began roughly six years ago to look for a way to build new, affordable multi-family community in the area. Despite the number of proactive, invested partners, the group could not secure adequate funding for the project. Last year, however, Rural Development was able to access funds in addition to regular program resources through the USDA Multi-Family Housing Program to assist the effort. In addition, Rural Development will provide rental assistance to help low income families. The Canyon East complex will offer 24 units of housing for farm workers and their families.  The design includes two, three and four bedroom units, along with a playground, basketball court and community building featuring meeting space, laundry facility and on-site management offices.

"Taking Charge: How Rural Residents Are Switching from Employees to Business Owners  The retirement of the baby boom generation of business proprietors is predicted to result in a major turnover in ownership. Developing an ownership succession plan is especially challenging in rural areas where many small businesses are at risk of closing from the lack of locally available financing to keep them in operation. Rural Development’s Business and Industry (B&I) Guaranteed Loan Program now has new capabilities as of this August that specifically accommodate the needs of financing ownership succession. B&I guarantee borrowers can now apply to loans for financing the transfer of business ownership within a family, usually involving a sale from parents to children. Prior to recent changes in the rules it was assumed that within families the transfer of ownership was always a seller-financed transaction. Yet, some retiring business owners may need to immediately take the sales revenue out to finance their retirement.

"Deputy Administrator of the AMS Livestock, Poultry, and Seed Program in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 13,  AMS verifies cage-free claims for shell eggs by visiting the farms twice each year to ensure that the eggs are in fact coming from a cage-free flock. (Click to view a larger version) When it comes to purchasing eggs, consumers have interests that go well beyond what they see in the carton.  For many buyers, where that egg came from and how it was produced are just as important as the finished product.  Organic, locally produced, cage-free, and free range are just a few of the marketing claims consumers will find on the carton, as producers try to communicate the attributes of their product.  To provide additional assurance to their customers of the validity of marketing claims, shell egg producers often enlist the services of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). In recent months, a long list of large volume food buyers – including restaurants, grocers, distributors and more – have announced they will transition to sourcing eggs and egg products only from cage-free production systems.  You can learn more about this trend in a recent USDA Blog post.  Many shell egg suppliers have already found a way to assure customers that products marketed as cage-free are indeed sourced from such systems: when USDA Graded eggs are also identified as cage-free, they must undergo a review process to verify the claim is truthful. Through its Livestock, Poultry, and Seed Program, AMS provides shell egg quality grading and certification services to businesses on a voluntary, fee-for-service basis.  Egg cartons bearing the USDA Grade Shield – usually either “USDA Grade AA” or “USDA Grade A” – must meet strict U.S. quality standards.  In addition to verifying that eggs meet the stated grade, USDA’s highly-trained graders inspect processing facilities for proper sanitation and refrigeration, and verify proper identification and traceability methods such as code dating and plant numbers.  Further, packaging materials that bear a USDA Grade Shield must be pre-approved by USDA to ensure the labeling is truthful and not misleading.  This includes claims regarding the method of production (cage-free, free range, etc.), making the USDA Grade Shield a symbol of quality and integrity. Not all USDA graded eggs are cage-free, and not all cage-free eggs are graded by USDA.  But, eggs packed under a USDA Grade Shield and marketed as cage-free – or with any other production claim – must be source-verified by USDA through onsite farm visits, at least twice annually, to check that the laying hens are housed in the appropriate production system.  For AMS approval, cage-free eggs must be produced by hens housed in a way that allows for not only unlimited access to food and water, but, unlike eggs from caged hens, also provides them the freedom to roam during the laying cycle. We also know some consumers prefer their eggs to come from “free range” hens.  For those eggs, we verify they are produced by hens that are not only housed in a way that allows for unlimited access to food and water and provides the freedom to roam within the area like cage-free hens but also gives the hens continuous access to the outdoors during their laying cycle. At the processing facility, it’s not uncommon for cage-free eggs to be received alongside literally millions of non-cage-free eggs.  So, AMS requires a written and implemented segregation and traceability plan detailing how the company maintains the identity of the eggs from production through storage, transport, processing, and packaging.  Then, during packing, AMS verifies that only eggs sourced from the appropriate flocks are packaged into cartons bearing a USDA Grade Shield. Whether you are an agricultural business wanting to differentiate your product in the marketplace or a consumer looking for quality eggs, AMS grading and certification services ensure that quality and marketing claims are verified from farm to table.

"Montana State Director, USDA Rural Development in  Coronavirus  Rural  Apr 10,  With a track record of making exemplary protective gear, Simms Fishing Products was ideally suited to help healthcare workers challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic. Photo by Simms Fishing Products. “You get one life, fish it well.” The slogan of Simms Fishing Products in Bozeman, Mont. reflects their passion for making outstanding fishing gear. Not only is Simms the only wader manufacturer in the country today, they are also proud to offer an entire collection of “Made in the USA” products, designed and constructed by expert anglers in Bozeman. Simms has earned award-winning recognition for its technology advancements, as well as for its drive to protect fishery resources through enhanced environmental safety and education standards. Known for its technical fishing gear and apparel, Simms makes products that protect its users from the elements. So, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit Montana, the company began receiving requests for a different type of personal protective equipment—medical masks and gowns. Simms employees first rose to the occasion by volunteering to make 200 masks in one week for Montana’s healthcare professionals. After that, the company put its technical sewing resources to work and started producing medical gowns. Simms delivered almost 300 gowns to the Bozeman Health Deaconess Hospital, with the first delivery on April 3, and has continued production to fill confirmed orders totaling 4,000 more. Casey Sheahan, Simms CEO, told me that with the shortage of protective gowns, it was critical for the brand to play a part in assisting the American people during this difficult time. Casey has been inspired to see all the brands in the outdoor industry repurposing their facilities, equipment, and skills to help those in need. The team at Simms was thrilled to deliver the first run of gowns to the Bozeman Health Group and hope their efforts of support can extend beyond the local community to help others around the entire country. Simms Fishing Products received USDA Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) grants in and , allowing the company to install solar panels on its production facility and make energy efficiency upgrades. USDA Rural Development invests in rural affordable housing, community facilities, and small businesses around the country to promote rural prosperity and improve the quality of life for rural Americans. RD is armed with financial resources that can help business owners retain and even create jobs during this difficult time, whether you’re creating fishing waders or sewing medical gowns.

"Manager, USDA Meat & Poultry Hotline in  Health and Safety  Jun 14,   The Hurricane Season officially began June 1. If you live in a coastal area, it’s important to be prepared, particularly when it comes to safe food and water. The best strategy for you and your family is to always have a plan in place that everyone knows and that includes these food and water safety precautions. Steps to Follow to Prepare for a Possible Weather Emergency: Use appliance thermometers in your refrigerator and freezer to help determine if food is safe during power outages. Refrigerator temperature should be 40° F or lower and the freezer should be 0° F or lower. Freeze refrigerated items such as leftovers, fresh meat, and poultry that you may not need immediately—this helps keep them at a safe temperature longer. Freeze containers of water for ice to help keep food cold in freezer, refrigerator, or coolers in case of power outage. You can also use melted ice for drinking water. Purchase or make ice cubes and freeze gel packs in advance. Plan ahead and know where to purchase block ice and dry ice, just in case. Have coolers on hand to keep the refrigerator food cold in case the power is out for more than 4 hours If the Power Goes Out: Keep the refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible. A refrigerator will keep food cold for about 4 hours if you keep the door closed. A full freezer will keep its temperature for about 48 hours  If the power is out for an extended period of time, buy dry or block ice to keep the refrigerator as cold as possible. Fifty pounds of dry ice should keep a fully-stocked 18-cubic-feet freezer cold for two days. When the Power Is Restored: Check the temperature in the refrigerator and freezer. If the thermometer reads 40° F or below, the food is safe. If no thermometer was used in the freezer, check each package. If food still contains ice crystals, it’s safe. Discard any perishable food (such as meat, poultry, fish, soft cheeses, milk, eggs, leftovers and deli items) that have been kept in a refrigerator or freezer above 40° F for two hours or more. Never taste food to determine its safety! When in Doubt, throw it Out!

"in  Conservation  Mar 30,   America’s farmers are among our first and finest conservationists. At USDA, we support their work to protect natural landscapes, improve water and air quality, and preserve wildlife habitat, forests and soil. In addition to environmental benefits, this work helps drive economic growth and creates good, middle class jobs – particularly in rural communities. Farmers who help the environment improve their bottom line. Fishing, hunting, hiking, boating and other outdoor recreation adds $730 billion to our nation’s economy each year and supports millions of jobs. That is why President Barack Obama launched his America’s Great Outdoors initiative to help re-connect Americans with the outdoors and create local partnerships focused on the long-term health of our nation’s landscapes. In the past months, as part of that effort, USDA took steps to work with landowners, farmers and ranchers conserving these lands while promoting outdoor recreation opportunities that create jobs and drive economic growth. First, along with the Department of the Interior, USDA recently announced a new $33 million plan to use innovative approaches to restore and protect habitats for wildlife, including seven at-risk species and other vulnerable game species. Working with sportsmen, this Working Lands for Wildlife partnership will help the economy by promoting abundant wildlife habitat that offers great opportunities for hunting, fishing, wildlife viewing and other types of outdoor recreation. To help raise a generation of Americans who are excited about spending time outdoors, USDA’s Forest Service provided funding to enhance outdoor children’s programs in 18 states. Second, we are improving and strengthening the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which currently enrolls 30 million acres of idled farmland to support farmer income, clean our water and preserve soil. In the past months, USDA announced the opportunity for producers to enroll a total of 1.75 million acres of land in new CRP initiatives to preserve grasslands, wetlands and wildlife habitat. As crop prices remain strong and an estimated 6.5 million CRP acres expire later this year, this effort will help us target our resources to the most environmentally sensitive lands. It will improve farm income and job-creating recreation opportunities, encouraging producers to enroll in practices benefitting pollinators, ducks, upland birds and critical ecosystems, with an increased signing incentive. With this effort – alongside a broader ‘general’ sign-up for the program – we’ll continue to add to CRP’s 25-year legacy of addressing our nation’s most critical resource issues. In the years to come, USDA will continue to build partnerships and strengthen our conservation programs to promote good farmer incomes, as well as opportunities for sportsman and outdoor recreation. Our nation’s lands provide us with abundant food, fiber and fuel. They are an essential piece of vibrant and diverse rural economies. Best of all, conserving farms, ranches, and forests also means a healthier environment for the next generation and a stronger economy in the decades to come.

"Delivering Along the Food Value Chain  A recent trip back home to Louisiana sparked memories of a simpler time when old trucks full of fresh produce rumbled down dusty roads to deliver goods to the local market. The Census of Agriculture tells us that 50,000 farmers and ranchers nationwide are now selling to local retailers and that 150,000 of them are selling their products directly to consumers. Although these farmers and ranchers are still using this direct approach, the agricultural industry is certainly more dynamic today.  This means that producers need to follow a strategic business model. The reality is that food can go through a lot of steps to reach the consumer. Before it is served on the table, food travels from the field to the truck to the packing house to the store. My agency, the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has many programs that support business entities involved in the food chain, including farmers markets and food hubs. For example, we invest in projects that help farmers and businesses understand emerging trends, create new markets, and stimulate our nation’s rural economies.

"Communications Director, Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement in  Equity  Initiatives  Nov 30,  Since , FEED 7 Generations has worked to improve the health and wellness of Native people in the Pacific Northwest. Based in King County, Washington, FEED 7 Generations creates environmental health through land management strategies, community health projects, and direct food access projects. “We are a tribal-led food sovereignty organization,” said Executive Director Romajean Thomas. “We want to help Native people in our area be as healthy as possible while ensuring that our dollars stay within the local food system and within Native communities.” To further these efforts, the organization was able to secure a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) grant, designed to help underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters. The organization is using this grant to strengthen local businesses and enhance food security and community connections. They began by conducting a needs analysis. “We’ve been out traveling to these farms, some of them really far out there, to meet with producers and understand their needs.” said Thomas. “We’ve had great success in building relationships.” Using the collected, the organization created a Native Grown and Gathered resource directory featuring Native farms and food producers in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. “We want to make it easy for Native people to eat food grown, harvested, made and produced by other Native people,” said Thomas. “This will help catalyze food sovereignty efforts and strengthen Native food systems nationwide.” The needs analysis also revealed that Native producers would benefit from additional training opportunities. With that, the organization hosted an annual food sovereignty symposium to showcase regional Native agricultural production and producers.

"Public Affairs Officer & Community Development Coordinator for USDA Florida Rural Development in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Feb 02,  Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan meets with members of the at Fifth Generation Farms fresh market in Lake City, Florida on Friday, Jan. 27, . USDA Photo by Ellen Boukari. Last week, Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan visited Fifth Generation Farms fresh market in Lake City, Fla., a farm family owned market selling local meats and produce.  When Fifth Generation Farms market opened in August , it was the realization of a dream not only for Delvey and Cindy Dicks, but for their entire family as well.  For five generations, the Dicks family has been involved in farming and ranching in the North Central Florida area.  The Dicks knew that if the family farm was to remain productive for future generations, they would have to offset rising production input costs and the loss of summer tobacco crops. Delvey and Cindy Dicks were awarded a USDA Rural Development Value Added Producers Grant to help them create a branded product named “North Florida Natural Black Angus.” The beef is raised on natural grains and fed on the Dicks farm pastures with no added hormones, antibiotics or animal by-products.  It is slaughtered locally under USDA inspection and then made available for direct purchase at the Fifth Generation Farms fresh foods market in Lake City. The development of “North Florida Natural Black Angus” and “Fifth Generation Farms” has already had a positive impact on the community with over 50 local businesses benefiting either directly or indirectly in the process.  Twelve new jobs have been created and educational events have been conducted with more than 100 adults and children participating.  While the storefront market opened only months ago, it is already promoting products from 25 local producers, and the list continues to grow. While at the market, Deputy Secretary Merrigan met with three generations of the Dicks farming family, representing not only fourth and fifth generation farmers, but looking to the future, the up-and-coming sixth generation as well.  The Deputy’s visit helped launch the Fifth Generation Farms month long “Celebrate Fresh from Florida” campaign.  Each Saturday in February, local farmers and producers will be on site at the market meeting customers and providing food demonstrations using their farm fresh products.   Talk about knowing your farmer! The visit to Fifth Generation Farms fresh market was part of the Deputy Secretary’s two-day trip to Florida.  During her visit, she discussed the vision laid out in President Obama's State of the Union address to help grow Florida’s economy.  She spoke to over 200 students, faculty and community leaders at the University of Florida, Gainesville and highlighted how local and regional food systems can stimulate community economic development and ensure equitable access to affordable fresh and local food.  The Deputy Secretary met with USDA employees based in our Gainesville field offices to answer questions about USDA’s Blueprint for Stronger Service.  She also met with Jacksonville business leaders for a roundtable about the economy and what this Administration’s vision is for an America built to last.  And finally, she concluded her trip by visiting the Jacksonville Farmers Market, tasting some Cajun boiled peanuts before heading back home.

"in  USDA Results  Aug 30,   Each year on Labor Day, we take time to reflect on the productivity of America’s workers and our responsibility as a nation to support their efforts. This year, as we gather to celebrate, Congress has a timely opportunity to create an even stronger American workforce for generations to come. They can do so by fixing America’s broken immigration system. The broad impacts that immigration reform would have for our economy are well documented. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office and Social Security Office of the Chief Actuary, the bipartisan Senate immigration reform bill would boost our economy by 3.3 percent, reduce the deficit by a projected $850 billion and add nearly $300 billion to our Social Security system by the end of the decade. But immigration reform would also address critical labor issues. Today’s broken system leaves millions of workers in the shadows – a dangerous situation for these workers and their families – and provides no clarity for U.S. employers, the majority of whom want to do the right thing. At a time when we should be providing rules that empower American productivity, today’s broken immigration system only furthers uncertainty. This is especially true for agriculture. Farmworkers drive an industry that is directly related to one in 12 American jobs. They’re in the fields as crops are planted, cared for and harvested. They’re in packing houses and processing facilities.  They help get food to markets and stores that ends up on kitchen tables across the country. About half of these workers are unauthorized, and many more are employed under a temporary worker program that is difficult for farmers and farmworkers alike to understand. In the years to come, the resulting instability in our agricultural workforce threatens productivity on farms and ranches, and impacts rural communities where agriculture is a thriving part of their economies. The commonsense immigration reform measure passed in June by the U.S. Senate, with bipartisan support, would provide a comprehensive set of rules to ensure a stable and adequate workforce for agriculture. It expands and reforms the temporary worker program to allow a three-year visa for agricultural workers, while enacting a pathway to citizenship for temporary workers who are committed to continue working in agriculture. And it provides a fair opportunity to earn U.S. citizenship for those who are in our country without authorization – a process that will require going to the back of the line, settling taxes and paying fines for those who want to earn citizenship. The result would be a modern system that makes sense. It would bring millions of farmworkers out of the shadows and give them a fair chance to strive for the American dream. It would help farmers and ranchers focus on growing more and expanding their business. It would give agriculture the people power to keep driving economic growth and creating jobs. This Labor Day, I’m hopeful that Congress can find a way to solve this modern labor challenge facing our nation. We have a long history in America of supporting those who work hard – and Congress has the chance to make even more progress by passing commonsense immigration reform.

"Heritage Program Manager, Shawnee National Forest and Deidra L. McGee, U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication in  Forestry  Jun 04,   A recent archaeology project shed light on the history of the Shawnee National Forest, uncovering the remains of a 19th Century home and an ancient cemetery. Archaeologists Mary McCorvie and Heather Carey, and AmeriCorps VISTA team member Eraina Nossa worked with 23 volunteers from across the country on this five-day project to inventory 140-acres of the Illinois Iron Furnace Historic Site and to create a more complete picture of what life was like there. Built around , the Illinois Iron Furnace is the only remaining iron furnace structure in the state. The Passport in Time volunteers used a compass to walk in transects through the woods, digging and screening for artifacts, producing scaled maps of new archaeological sites and exploring the hills and valleys within the study area. .  A Illinois Iron Furnace taken by Forest Service photographers in . Land was acquired by the Forest Service in and the furnace was completely rebuilt by young men from the Golconda Job Corps in . US Forest Service photo The remains of a half-dovetail log cabin found by Passport-in-Time volunteers and Forest Service archaeologists during a survey project appearing to have been constructed during the mid-nineteenth century. Possibly the home of a worker at the nearby Illinois Iron Furnace and the land is now included in the Kaskaskia Experimental Forest. US Forest Service photo Discoveries included an early to mid-19th century home with a cistern and cellar, remains of a log house, and iron prospecting and mining pits. Cisterns don’t usually sound very exciting, but on the Shawnee National Forest, they are a thing of beauty. Each cistern was hand dug in the shape of a bee hive or straight sided, using only a shovel. All are lined with hand-cut sandstone blocks that were quarried nearby. House foundations and cellar walls are also lined with sandstone. There is never a problem finding sandstone in the Shawnee Hills.  You will find it scattered along the ridge tops and along the many picturesque creeks and streams in this area. The team also discovered a cemetery thought to be associated with the 175-year-old Iron Furnace village. Several rough sandstone grave markers were present in the cemetery, but no formal store-bought tombstones.  Most of the people living in the hills could not afford fancy carved markers, but had to settle instead for plain or hand-carved markers. They may have remembered where their loved ones were buried, but as people left the hills, this information was lost forever. “When you walk in the woods and discover a site, you begin to wonder: ‘Who did this? Why did they pick this place to build a house or bury their family? Where did they come from?  Why did they leave? ”said McCorvie. “It is so intriguing learning about people who have passed this way before, learning how wealthy they were based on items they discarded or left behind or by finding fragments of plates and serving dishes which brings images of what their kitchen table looked like at dinnertime,”  she said. Here are a few outdoor ethics for heritage sites: Respect the past, as heritage sites hold clues to what life was like long ago. Educate others never to dig at sites or collect artifacts. Graffiti is vandalism and it damages rock art, ruins, cliff walls, trees and historic structures; while attempting to remove graffiti can cause further damage.

"Mississippi PIC in  USDA Results  Rural  Jul 12,   One of Mississippi’s largest USDA Rural Development awards was recently celebrated in Lowndes County, where local leaders expect the improvements made by this award to lead to hundreds of jobs. USDA Rural Development State Director Trina George was joined by U.S. Senator Roger Wicker and numerous state and local officials to commemorate a USDA Rural Development loan of $13 million to the Columbus-Lowndes County Development Link, which will help the entity expand the regional industrial park with a special focus on attracting aerospace industries. This award compliments a previous USDA Rural Development loan-grant combination of $17.5 million awarded last year to expand and improve the water and sewer infrastructure of the industrial park. “I know that you are marketing your industrial park toward the aerospace industry,” George remarked to the gathering. “The Global Industrial Aerospace Park will be appealing to the many companies, both domestic and foreign, that work in this industry. This will be a growing and important source of jobs for Mississippi in the future.” George noted that these projects, in an area known as “the Golden Triangle” will have a positive impact on five counties. “This award is a cornerstone for attracting hundreds of good jobs to this area, including the prospect of overseas companies locating here. This region and this county will see the benefits for years to come.” George cited the back-to-back grants and loans for the region as an illustration of the commitment of the Obama Administration to rural America. She noted that the partnership between the private sector and government is a strong tool to help grow private sector jobs and to help the region compete internationally. “On behalf of President Obama and USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, let me say how nice it is for USDA Rural Development to be a part of this success,” said George. Mississippi’s State Director of USDA Rural Development Trina George addresses a crown of hundreds to mark an award of $13 million to expand an industrial park in Lowndes County in Mississippi. After complimenting the leadership of the Golden Triangle, Senator Wicker complimented USDA Rural Development. “The good work that you do in the rural areas of our state is well-known. Countless individuals and communities have been uplifted by your programs and the resources that your agency provides. Two key elements to any success are good leadership and a talented work force, and your agency is blessed with both of these in abundance.  Thank you for the good work that you do and the great things that you bring to rural Mississippi.” Senator Wicker called the Lowndes County initiative “a major project” and said the work “will lay the groundwork for hundreds of jobs” in that area. Mabel Murphree, district director for U.S. Congressman Alan Nunnelee, also spoke at the event, which was attended by hundreds of high school and college students.

"Designated Federal Officer, USDA Equity Commission in  Equity  Apr 15,  With a legal lens and knack for paying attention to detail, Equity Commission Member Charles (Charlie) Rawls has been the go-to source to help capture the essence of the Equity Commission’s intentions. With his firsthand experience working on civil rights reforms at the Department of Agriculture as General Counsel and his visionary collaboration and advocacy skills, Rawls contribution to the Final Report (, 2.0 ), released in February , was an asset to the Equity Commission. For Rawls, the Equity Commission’s work has come full circle. His career was influenced by his time spent at USDA in the s, serving in various roles which provided a foundation for his lifelong efforts addressing civil rights issues within the agricultural sector. Following his time at USDA, Rawls served 18 years as general counsel at the Farm Credit Administration, underscoring his deep understanding of agricultural credit and regulatory intricacies and his vast knowledge and commitment to credit access for farmers and ranchers. With its mission to provide ideas for change that would address equity issues in USDA’s programs and services and strengthen accountability within the Department, Rawls felt called to serve on the Equity Commission. Since the start, Rawls supported the Commission’s interest in advancing equitable outcomes for farmers and communities that previously faced historical barriers to the benefits of USDA programs. Touched by his experience inside and outside the USDA, Rawls embraces the unique challenge of fostering systemic change. In reflecting on what makes the Equity Commission different he remarks, “This is a group of individuals, many of whom are highly experienced and dedicated to the work. They have been invited to review the programs and policies of USDA and make recommendations so the Department can better serve the American people.” In his leadership role as co-captain of the Equity Commission’s writing team, Rawls demonstrated his commitment to incorporating and amplifying diverse voices in the process of writing the Interim and Final . Often chiming in at public meetings in response to member presentations of the recommendations with a question or two, Rawls is known for his holistic and thorough approach in analyzing how the recommendations will impact those served by USDA. Rawls artfully collaborated with the other 40 distinguished members of the Equity Commission and its two specialized subcommittees, who represent the diversity of the United States and its territories and encompass a wide range of backgrounds and expertise, to craft impactful solutions for all of its diverse stakeholders. After two years of dedicated work, including conducting six public meetings and engaging more than 2,000 stakeholders, on February 22, , at the USDA’s National Equity Summit, the Equity Commission released its Final Report (, 2.0 ), which features 66 recommendations for institutional change at the USDA. The recommendations cover a range of topics, including advancing department-wide equity, working with farmers and ranchers day-to-day, supporting rural communities, and more. For Rawls, success for the Equity Commission lies in tangible outcomes—where individuals seeking USDA services receive prompt and satisfactory assistance. “Many employees at the Department of Agriculture want to see program and service delivery improve. Rawls said. “And that’s why they’re here…They can take part in reviewing the recommendations of the Commission and try to understand how they might be able to contribute.” Beyond the walls of USDA, Rawls emphasizes the importance of community engagement in driving change. He envisions a collaborative approach, inviting stakeholders and grassroots organizations to actively participate in the implementation process. “This is an invitation for interested individuals, communities, and community groups to get involved and look at these recommendations,” Rawls said. “Many of them do recommend better and more engagement with community groups, and that's an invitation to come and make yourself known and to make recommendations and be involved.” Responding to the recommendations (, 4.7 ) provided in the final report, USDA is taking action to ensure the Department’s programs, services, and decisions reflect the values of equity and inclusion. USDA has committed to create an organizational culture that supports, reinforces, and aims to ensure equal access to resources, closes the racial wealth gap, and addresses longstanding inequities. To encourage transparency in this process, USDA published a Department-wide Equity Action Plan as well as 14 Agency-level Equity Action Plans (EAPs).

"In Conversation with : Beth Robinette  Every month, USDA shares the story of a woman in agriculture who is leading the industry and helping other women succeed along the way. This month, we hear from Beth Robinette, a rancher and leader in the local food and regional food movement in Spokane, Washington. She runs her family's fourth-generation grass fed beef operation the Lazy R Ranch, and is one of the co-founders of LINC Foods, a worker and farmer owned cooperative food hub based in Spokane. She studied sustainable agriculture and business and marketing at Fairhaven College at Western Washington University, and earned her MBA in Sustainable Systems at Pinchot University with an emphasis on Local Living Economies and Sustainable Food and Agriculture.  How did you first become interested in the local and regional food movement? Local food was really the norm in my household growing up. We raised a lot of our own food, or we would trade beef for things we didn’t raise ourselves. My grandpa was a prolific gardener and I can vividly remember the joy of eating a perfectly ripe tomato, warm from the sun, out of his garden. My dad had a part-time job working for a sustainable agriculture non-profit called the Washington State Food and Farming Network when I was in middle school and high school. He was the Eastern Washington coordinator and his job put him in contact with many movers and shakers in the local/regional food movement, which was really my first exposure to the idea. It wasn’t until I left for college, however, that I began to realize how privileged I had been to grow up on a ranch, and that most of my fellow students had a totally different relationship to food and agriculture than I did. I read Michael Pollan’s Omnivore’s Dilemma for a class my freshman year, and I was pretty much hooked on local food from then on.

"White House Executive Chef in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  May 17,   Cross posted from the Let's Move! Blog:  Growing up in the Philippines, my mother was my main source of inspiration for cooking. I came from a family of eleven kids, and as a child, I would constantly volunteer to help her in the kitchen. My mother would prepare such amazing authentic Filipino food, and cooking for her was almost second nature. She didn’t think about it, she just knew what ingredients to use, how much of each to use, and how to combine their flavors in ways that would satisfy everyone in the family. So Filipino food for me is much more than just adobo, longganisa, or tocino and fried rice – it represents a huge part of my culture, and most importantly, it is what connects me with my family. And that’s why it’s so important to me that we think about Filipino food not just in terms of what’s delicious, but in terms of what’s healthy and nourishing for our families. That’s why I’ve teamed up with Chef Ming Tsai, the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, the First Lady’s Let’s Move initiative, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help promote healthy and traditional Asian American and Pacific Islander cuisine. Following a healthy cooking and eating lifestyle has always been important for me as a chef and a mom, and with the USDA’s MyPlate food icon, we have a powerful visual reminder about how to build healthy meals for our families. But no matter where you’re from, there’s no reason to have to sacrifice the food you love, or sacrifice the food that expresses your culture, in order to maintain a healthy and nutritious diet. I hope that after watching Chef Ming Tsai and I prepare healthy and delicious AAPI recipes in the White House kitchen, you too will be inspired to try your own take at making healthy, ethnic food for your own families to eat. Watch the video and try it at home with the recipes below! Recipes: Shrimp, Chicken and Vegetable Fried Rice  Ingredients (Serves 4): 3 tbsp Canola Oil 6 oz chicken breast, julienned 1/2 lb peeled and deveined shrimp, medium, halved length wise 1 small onion, sliced 1 bunch scallions, sliced, 2 tbs green part saved for garnish 6 cloves garlic, minced 6 oz shiitake mushroom, sliced 2 carrots, julienned 1 cup julliened napa cabbage 2 small bokchoy, washed and julliened 4 cups house rice (50/50 brown/white rice combo) 3 tbsp light tamari, wheat free soy sauce 1 tbsp vegetarian oyster sauce 1 tsp sesame oil Salt and pepper to taste (Note: Rice vinegar can be used in place of salt) Pre heat a large skillet or wok on a medium heat.

"Communications Coordinator, USDA Office of Communications in  Equity  Initiatives  Rural  Jul 23,  “It’s been great to have a team that’s not afraid to let me share my opinion, share my identity. I feel like in this space, I’ve been proud of who I am.” So remarked Celeste Lucero, a USDA Tribal Policy Intern working with USDA Rural Development’s Tribal Relations team this summer. Lucero is one of 14 undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students participating in this historic new program that aims to develop a new generation of agricultural professionals with a better understanding of Tribal food and agriculture issues. Through the Future Leaders in Public Service Internship Program, students are working on USDA agriculture, food, and nutrition programs that benefit Indian Country. The program is sponsored by USDA’s Office of Tribal Relations. This spring, Lucero graduated from the University of New Mexico with degrees in environmental science and economics. She will continue her studies with a master’s in economics. She is a member of the Pueblo of Isleta in New Mexico, as well as Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in North Dakota. Before she even started her 10-week internship at Rural Development, “my boss [Tedd Buelow] and the team asked “what do you want to get out of this internship?” With her team’s guidance, Lucero is writing a white paper for the Water and Environmental Program on water rights and accessibility for the Miccosukee Tribe near Miami, Florida. Lucero’s Pueblo of Isleta affiliation gives her a unique perspective on her project. “The protection of our rights and recognition of our sovereignty can be traced back to Queen Isabella I of Castile’s will of . Our sovereignty was protected throughout the Spanish reign through laws within the Recopilación de Indias. When New Mexico became part of the United States, our rights [including water rights] were preserved. Our rights are much different than other Tribes.” she remarked. A big takeaway from this summer is the importance of representation. “Diversity in these fields is important,” she stated. “For example, I’ve taken some [Tribal] trainings, and suggested to my teammates that they could be improved with more regional Tribal information.” Learning about the breadth of USDA resources was also an eye opener. “I’ve also learned how Tribes like mine are able to get USDA funding for projects, Lucero noted. There is a whole new world of resources that hopefully I'll be able to bring that back to my own people.” Lucero’s advice for other interns? “Find your community, whether in or outside of the workplace. And get to know your colleagues and supervisor. They know these policies and programs front to back. USDA has a lot to offer.” Learn more about USDA internship programs at www.usda.gov/youth/career.

"Nevada State Director, USDA Rural Development in  USDA Results  Energy  Rural  Feb 12,  Secretary Vilsack receives the National Energy Leadership Award from the National Biodiesel Board. The award is given periodically to individuals who demonstrate exemplary vision and leadership in development of the renewable fuels industry. Pictured left to right are Ed Ulch, Governing Board Member, National Biodiesel Board; Secretary Tom Vilsack; and Joe Jobe, CEO, National Biodiesel Board. In the days after the Super Bowl it is not unusual for spectators to “Monday morning quarterback” the advertisements, as well as the plays that were called.  For the members of two renewable fuels industries, however, there was no disputing the message of the now famous “God made a farmer” ad featuring Paul Harvey.  Last week in Las Vegas, the Renewable Fuels Association and the National Biodiesel Board both led off their meetings with this ad before Secretary Vilsack spoke. It became a starting point to discuss the Secretary’s compelling vision for rebuilding the rural economy, furthering efforts to develop advanced new biofuels, and creating more jobs in our small towns to grow and strengthen the middle class. Secretary Vilsack shared his personal motivation for building rural vitality, which stems from being a small town Iowa  lawyer in the ’s, first helping farmers do their taxes and later helping others weather that economic farm crisis that led to too many losing their farms. Moving forward more than twenty-five years, Secretary Vilsack highlighted today’s modern, inspiring rural America – and offered a reminder that rural America provides a great deal to everyone across our nation. Rural America provides an abundant and safe food supply, growing more than 85 percent of the food our nation consumes. Rural America provides clean water and soil, with more than 80 percent of the potable water that is domestically consumed first being filtered through U.S. Forest Service watersheds as well as privately owned lands in rural areas.  It provides a majority of America’s fuel and energy – both through traditional means and by producing groundbreaking biofuels. And he discussed how rural values stand at the heart of our national values. Rural Americans understand that you can’t just take from the nation that has given us all so much – you have to give back. That’s perhaps why our nation’s military is disproportionately represented by folks from rural America. Secretary Vilsack shared with the renewable fuels leaders his belief in their work and his expectations for them – that they are at the leading edge of creating an amazing new bio-based economy that will create jobs and opportunity across rural America.  The innovation and entrepreneurship that they have demonstrated in turning not only grain, but agricultural waste, algae, and other forms of advanced biomass into biofuels is just the start. Secretary Vilsack highlighted new research into groundbreaking new plastics, chemicals, polymers, and other bio-based products that he wants to see produced throughout rural America – and believe me, USDA Rural Development, with our ability to finance infrastructure, housing, and business development, shares his vision. Secretary Vilsack’s belief in the future of the biobased economy is one part of his vision for a thriving rural America in the years to come. He shared with the renewable fuels leaders that USDA’s efforts to open new markets and new opportunity for biobased products is just the first of four important pillars that we’ll focus on this year.  Second, we’ll continue expanding export markets to further strengthen production agriculture. Third, we will help rural communities and landowners enhance their conservation efforts and create more jobs related to outdoor recreation - which together are worth billions in revenue and priceless benefits in terms of topsoil and species saved, and pollution avoided. Finally we will look to create new markets for local and regional food system development, which gives the small farmer a way into the market while increasing Americans’ access to fresh, healthy local foods. The Secretary’s final point really stuck with me as well -- that he wants rural America to join in turning the tide of our nation from a country that primarily consumes, to one that grows, creates, and produces even more.  Secretary Vilsack outlined in Las Vegas the unlimited opportunity that our rural communities can achieve – and how rural America will continue to strengthen our nation as a whole. He knows that the hard work, innovation, and entrepreneurship of rural America will be critical to building a new bio-based economy, and supporting new markets for new innovation to ensure rural America is a great place to live, work and raise a family for generations to come.  Right on, Mr. Secretary.

"USDA Agricultural Research Service Information Staff in  Research and Science  Jan 28,   This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. As a boy, Steven Cannon helped his grandfather in the garden grafting fruit trees, all the while developing an interest in plants. As an adult, Cannon has followed in his grandfather’s footsteps, working with USDA as a scientist—but only after first taking a different, though ultimately, complementary career path. After graduating college, Cannon worked various jobs, including one as an educational software designer that used his knack for computing.  In , he rekindled his early interest in plant biology, earning a PhD and practical experience as a postdoctoral researcher assigned to a genome mapping project. In , he accepted a position as a plant geneticist with the USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Corn Insects and Crop Genetics Research Unit in Ames, Iowa. Cannon didn’t simply cast aside his love of computing for his new career in plant genetics, however. Instead, he combined his two interests—so successfully, in fact, that on December 23, , he was named as a recipient of the Presidential Early-Career Award for Scientists and Engineers by President Obama. Since joining ARS, Cannon has hit the ground running, with significant contributions in projects to sequence the genetic code, or genome, of soybean, chickpea, and other legume crops that underpin the health and wellbeing of consumers worldwide. Cannon’s computer skills proved valuable—from working with a team to improve SoyBase, a popular Internet resource among plant breeders and scientists, to successfully leading the Legume Information System Web site redesign, another online tool used by researchers worldwide. Cannon’s fascination with plants that he cultivated as a boy has translated into important findings today about the evolutionary “road” that legumes have taken over the past 60 million years or so—particularly their relationship with root bacteria that turn nitrogen into forms that help them grow. Cannon and colleagues’ efforts is geared toward fostering developing new, improved legume varieties to better meet humankind’s increasing global need for food, feed, fiber, and fuel. “We need to make faster progress in crop improvement and the best way of doing that is by knowing where important traits and genes reside,” says Cannon. “Whatever we learn about soybean is going to be useful in these other crops and vice versa.”  Category/Topic:  Research and Science  Tags:  ARS  Iowa  Plant biology  plants  President Obama  Presidental Award  Science Tuesday","Here's a concise question that focuses on the key concepts: What innovative combination of computing skills and plant genetics expertise has contributed to significant advancements in legume crop research, as exemplified by Steven Cannon's work with USDA?","Steven Cannon's innovative combination of computing skills and plant genetics expertise has enabled significant advancements in legume crop research, particularly through the development and improvement of online tools like SoyBase and the Legume Information System Web site, which have facilitated efficient genome sequencing and trait identification, ultimately contributing to improved legume varieties."
"Wildland Fires Recognize No Borders  An uncontained forest fire burning in Greece, Germany, or the U.S. looks basically the same: they are all destructive. For this important reason, the U.S. Forest Service has a well-established international leadership role in wildland fire management.

"Crafting a Regional Vision--New River Valley, Virginia is Developing Long Range Strategic Plan to Shape its Future  One of the challenges with implementing USDA Rural Development programs is that many of the communities we serve have not had the opportunity to develop strategic plans to guide federal infrastructure investments effectively. Fortunately, a grant from HUD’s Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities enabled the New River Valley Planning District Commission to engage the public in the rural Southwest Virginia counties of Pulaski, Montgomery, Giles, and Floyd and all the major towns to develop a blueprint for future economic activity. Earlier this month I had the opportunity to attend a meeting where over 100 rural citizens in the New River Valley gathered to put some of the finishing touches on the 3-year regional planning process, known locally as their Livability Initiative. I came away inspired by the dialogue that has evolved over the past three years and am looking forward to seeing how the communities in this economically diverse rural region look for ways to implement some of the ideas they have generated to improve their communities and enhance long-term economic opportunities.

"National Partnership Office, USDA Forest Service in  Forestry  Aug 17,  A female wood turtle. (Photo courtesy of Carrie Nelson) Located in northern Wisconsin, the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest has been called home by many species of turtles. The wood turtle, which resides in this forest, is classified as a Species of Concern and is under consideration by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to list under the Endangered Species Act. Many factors, like disease and habitat loss, have caused wood turtles populations to suffer. Although the turtles overwinter in water, they are terrestrial for most of the year and like to make their nests in an active gravel pit on the forest where heavy machinery operates, adding to the threats they face. A turtle nesting platform on the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest. Depending on the time of the nesting season, the bottom wire can be adjusted to accommodate adult turtles or further protect hatchlings. (Photo courtesy of Carrie Nelson) Carrie Nelson, a wildlife biologist on the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, explained that gravel pits are natural nesting locations for turtles, as the substrate is the right combination of sand and loam—sand for easy excavation and hold, and loam for proper drainage. At the same time, the gravel pits are used to repair and maintain roads and trails on the forest. During gravel excavations, many nests and turtles are crushed or dug out. Nelson’s research suggested that creating nesting platforms would help protect the turtles by providing the correct substrate needed for excavating nests while allowing the Forest Service to continue using the active gravel pit. To make this idea a reality, Nelson contacted the non-profit Turtles for Tomorrow. The platforms are made from a wooden frame filled with the sandy-loam substrate and enclosed by a three-wire, low-voltage, solar-powered electric fence. The fence is designed to keep predators, like skunks and raccoons, out of the nests. Depending on the time of the nesting season, the bottom wire can be adjusted to accommodate adult turtles or further protect hatchlings. Nelson worked with the local Chequamegon Resource Advisory Committee to secure Title II Secure Rural Schools funding, and soon the project was underway. With the help of other specialists, Nelson and Turtles for Tomorrow selected and cleared the site locations to prepare them for construction. The project was completed in the summer of . Since then, trail cameras have captured photos of turtles using the nesting platforms, and Nelson has personally documented wood, snapping, and painted turtles on the sites. The public also helped by alerting Nelson to wood turtle sightings, which informed her of key locations to put the nesting platforms. All across the US, hundreds of Title II projects are connecting people with their public lands while helping to improve the national forests. The work being done for the turtles on the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest is just one example. A wood turtle basks in the sun.

"Minnesota Public Information Coordinator in  Initiatives  Rural  Technology  Oct 20,  (Left to right) USDA Rural Development State Director Colleen Landkamer, Senator Klobuchar, Representative Oberstar and Senator Franken at an event marking a Recovery Act Broadband Award that will bring Internet service to two counties in Minnesota.  Several years ago, commissioners in Lake County in Northeastern Minnesota began researching the possibility of bringing fully network connected broadband services to the region. “We thought, ‘Why not Lake County?  Why not us?’ We knew how much it was needed,” Commissioner Rick Goutermont said. That vision and foresight has paid off. Lake County was recently awarded a $56.4 million loan and a $10 million grant to deliver high-speed broadband services to Lake County and parts of St. Louis County. The funds were made available in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, signed into law by President Obama in February of , and delivered through USDA Rural Development’s Broadband Initiatives Program. The award was celebrated during a ceremony on the steps of the Lake County Courthouse on Friday, Oct. 15. The event was attended by Senator Amy Klobuchar, Senator Al Franken and Representative James Oberstar. “Broadband will make all of our citizens the most productive in the world,” Rep. Oberstar said. “It’s bringing rural America into the 21st century.” Sen. Klobuchar shared a story about her father Jim, who grew up in Ely, Minn., and became a reporter for various publications in Minneapolis. When Jim was home in Ely and needed to file a story on deadline, it was often difficult to establish a working wire connection. “Thanks to this project, it’s going to work now,” Sen. Klobuchar said. “This means a reliable connection for schools, businesses and homes right here in Northeastern Minnesota. This funding also creates immediate jobs during construction and establishes a base for future job creation and economic growth.” Sen. Franken highlighted an isolated region near the scenic Boundary Waters Canoe area of Northern Minnesota where Internet service has always been spotty. The Recovery Act funding will bring reliable service to the homes and businesses in the area. “This funding also means that if you get sick and it doesn’t make sense for you to travel the long distance to a hospital, you can see a doctor using telemedicine,” Franken said. Thirteen projects totaling about $185 million have been selected to receive Recovery Act funding to improve broadband services in rural Minnesota. The funding will deliver improved broadband service to about 164,000 homes, 11,500 businesses and about 685 essential community facilities. “We worked hard to deliver electricity and telephone services to rural areas in the 20th century,” said Colleen Landkamer, State Director of Rural Development in Minnesota. “Now we’re working to deliver broadband. The future of our rural businesses, schools and households are counting on it.” To find out how USDA can help your rural community through the Rural Utilities broadband program click here.

"Posted by Fátima Terry, Deputy Director, USDA Digital Service in  Technology  Aug 12,  The seeds of digital transformation are taking root as application reviews for our agency’s first Digital Service (DS) Fellows cohort are in progress. By establishing a dedicated fellow team at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), we will be able to improve access to USDA resources and programs across the country. Once onboarded this fall, our USDA Digital Service (DS) Fellows will work to accelerate the design, development, and delivery of customer-centric services. To gain insight on digital service best practices, we hosted the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) team at our headquarters in Washington, D.C. last month. Digital Service staff from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and other agencies shared their experience with USDS, how they are addressing current challenges, and what the future of digital services at their agencies looks like. “We are so appreciative of the great collaboration and partnership with USDS as we work to shape a Digital Service team here at USDA, and we learned a lot about how we can continue to drive this great work here across the many mission areas and missions of USDA,” said Arianne Gallagher-Welcher, Executive Director of the USDA Digital Service and Co-Founder of the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program. USDA has seen firsthand the difference digital service can make. As the People’s Department, one of our most important missions is ensuring access to nutritious and safe food. Many of our nation’s youngest children were affected when a manufacturer product recall and weakened supply chains caused an infant formula shortage in . This particularly impacted USDA customers, as families who use our Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC program) buy 56% of all the formula sold in America. With other federal partners, USDA teamed up with the USDS to develop and analyze real-time about the amount of formula available in any given U.S. location. As a result, 388 million bottles of infant formula were imported and deployed to the places that needed it most based on new and analytics. This is just one example of how digital service can deliver solutions for the federal government’s most challenging technology implementation problems. You can learn more about this and other USDS solutions in their Impact Report. Our collaborative partnership with USDS is essential as our new Digital Service team launches. Together, we will build a stronger technology organization at USDA than can more efficiently support our employees and customers in the future.

"AMS Fruit and Vegetable Program Marketing Order and Agreement Division Director in  Conservation  Apr 08,  Vidalia Onions are only grown in Georgia. In the past 5 years, the Vidalia Onion Committee increased its focus on research. After seeing consumers demand the traditional Vidalia onion, the committee decided to ensure that the onion that they marketed was of the best eating quality. (Photo courtesy of the Vidalia Onion Committee) Success is often achieved when you have access to a number of tools and know how and when to use them. The USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is equipping produce businesses with the proper tools for success through our Marketing Order and Agreement Division (MOAD). As discussed before, this division administers fruit and vegetable marketing orders and agreements designed to support the industry’s financial and commercial success with the help of tools such as funding production and market research. As self-help programs requested for and completely funded by the industry, marketing orders and agreements can address issues ranging from combating invasive species to identifying key product attributes based on consumer preferences. Our MOAD employees oversee industry boards and committees as they partner with local universities and organizations to overcome these types of challenges. One example is the California Desert Grape Administrative Committee’s five-year canker study conducted by Dr. Carmen Gispert, a viticulture and pest management advisor with the University of California. The study aims to identify the causal agents of destructive canker diseases in U.S. grape production and develop adaptive management strategies to prevent them from occurring. Several fungi cause canker diseases in all types of grape production (wine, table, raisin, and juice). The opportunistic fungi enter grapevines through wounds caused by pruning. Once a grapevine is infected, there is no cure. Applying a fungicide directly to wound surfaces is the only management strategy that will prevent the canker from infecting the vines. Research findings so far indicate pathogens can live on dead vines and become active when wet from sprinklers, rain, or spraying. They also suggest the incidence of canker disease in Coachella Valley vineyards has become more frequent since the installation and use of overhead sprinklers began nearly 10 years ago. Research suggests overhead spraying opens up the spores and spreads the canker. As a result of the research, improved cultural practices have been adopted. This includes shredding and burying infected dead wood, a practice that decreases inoculation by removing the dead wood each year. The Vidalia Onion Committee reached into the federal marketing order tool box to better understand quality preferences among consumers and to fight multiple onion diseases such as black mold, downy mildew, and onion center rot. Some of their research projects include developing a taste panel to identify desired flavor attributes when consumers eat different Vidalia™ onion varieties. Vidalia Onion Committee Chairman Jason Herndon summarizes the committee’s research efforts as the following: Our focus on research over the past 5 years has increased significantly. We saw that consumers wanted us to get back to what we call a traditional Vidalia.  Instead of just going back to what we did 20 years ago, the committee decided to ensure that the onion we market is of the highest eating quality.  We also wanted to make sure that we used cutting-edge science to battle the numerous issues that today’s growers are facing on the farm. We also faced two major outbreaks (black mold and downy mildew). Through our research, I believe we all have implemented new farming practices to limit our exposure to these potentially devastating diseases.  The California Desert Grape Administrative Committee and the Vidalia Onion Committee are just two examples of how USDA’s marketing orders and agreements help fruit, vegetable and specialty crop producers organize to collectively identify and fund needed industry research. Twenty-four of 28 federal marketing orders currently conduct research benefiting their industry. Research initiatives are just one of many capabilities available for producers via federal marketing orders.  For more information, check out the Marketing Order and Agreement Division’s website.

(USDA photo by Debbie Smoot) Cross posted from the Let's Move! blog:  I had the distinct pleasure to join the White House Assistant Chef and Senior Policy Advisor for Healthy Food Initiative Sam Kass, to participate in a unique Chefs Move to Schools event at Edgewater High School Auditorium, Orlando, Fla., in celebration of First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! initiative. Also there were nationally-renowned chefs from well-known Orlando resorts and theme parks such as Disney World and Universal Studios, as well as chefs and schools participating in Orange County Public School (OCPS) District Chefs Move to Schools program. These chefs, school food nutrition managers, and students from ten schools put on quite a show as they cooked new, healthy “chef inspired, kid approved” recipes they developed together.  With all the right utensils, chef hats, the pressure of time, the tantalizing aromas, the smoke machine and the loud music, they impressed the audience who came to watch and later taste the healthy samples they whipped up. A few of the new OCPS recipes unveiled were: fish tacos with tilapia, shredded carrots, red and green cabbage, bok choy and avocado in a whole grain tortilla; taboule chicken salad with tomato, cucumber, couscous, feta cheese, lemon juice and olive oil in a whole grain pita pocket; and a fruit roll with cantaloupe, melon, strawberries, and pineapple rolled in rice paper. “These kids are so creative and come up with recipes with foods you wouldn’t think would go together but they do and they’re good,” said Karen Rich, Bridgewater Middle School Food and Nutrition Manager.  I thought so too. Six of the new recipes that were cooked at the event were also submitted to the Recipes for Healthy Kids Competition, which provides another opportunity for chefs to work with students to enhance the school food environment.  Joshua Turek, Executive Chef for the Young Chefs Academy of Orlando (who partnered with Bridgewater Middle School in Orlando) said it best: “This has been an incredible experience for me.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Nov 17,  Northwest Indian College students are learning how to collect and prepare samples for analysis The annual White House Tribal Nations Conference provides tribal leaders from the 567 federally recognized tribes the opportunity to interact directly with high-level federal government officials and members of the White House Council on Native American Affairs. This guest blog describes how USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supports tribal food sovereignty and economic growth. By Andres Quesada, associate director, National Indian Center for Marine Environmental Research and Education, Northwest Indian College Over recent decades there has been a steady decline of the Manila clam on the tidal flats of the Lummi Reservation just outside of Bellingham, Washington. The loss of this important food source directly impacts tribal food security and sovereignty of the Lummi people. My fellow researcher, Dr. Marco Hatch, and I have teamed up with Dr. Andrew Thurber from Oregon State University to study what is causing the clam population to decline. With the support of NIFA research grants we have identified two possible causes: altered sulfur cycling and changes in the clam’s food supply. Hydrogen sulfide is a compound that is toxic even in low concentrations to most animals. Sulfide can form on tidal flats when bacteria breaks down food sources and exhausts the oxygen supply. While many clams have found ways to tolerate hydrogen sulfide, it can still impact the ability of young clams to grow to harvestable adults. Our goal is to understand the role of sulfide in limiting the clam populations to devise effective management schemes by identifying the ecological mechanism that limits their productivity. Manila clams are suspension feeders, meaning they filter the water and surface sediments for food items such as plankton, detritus and bacteria. Many factors influence the abundance of these various food sources seasonally, in both quantity and quality, and this can limit a population. By learning what clams eat seasonally we hope to better understand the link between food supply and clam survivorship. Northwest Indian College students are using biomarkers, including stable isotope and fatty acids, to identify what the clams eat and how that varies throughout the year. Over the course of this project, the students are learning how to collect and prepare samples for analysis on a variety of instruments, including gas chromatograph-mass spectrometers and isotope ratio mass spectrometers; interpret ; and apply cutting-edge food-chain models. To date, the project has directly trained Native scholars in the field and engaged 20 in the classroom. In addition, more than 40 Native middle and high school students have learned about the project through outreach events. By the end of this project we will better understand what is impacting the Manila clam. In addition to preserving a vital food source, these projects will protect and grow revenue for the Lummi commercial and subsistence clam diggers while providing hands-on experiences from the field to the lab for many students.

"Building the Connection between Federal Programs and Job Creation in Rural America  In his State of the Union Address, the President announced a plan for building a strong, successful and lasting economy. He spoke in particular about the need to source jobs domestically in order to bring employment back to the United States and the need for a strong manufacturing base to build our economy upon. Here at the USDA, we are doing our part by supporting rural businesses, building modern, reliable community infrastructure, and working with farmers and ranchers to export products grown in America. Earlier this week, I participated in a webinar about domestic sourcing and opportunities for partnership between the federal and private sectors back home to America. As the representative for all federal programs, I highlighted many partnering opportunities across agencies like the Small Business Administration and Economic Development Administration, and described in depth the opportunities Rural Development provides to rural residents and businesses. In particular, I spoke about our rural business programs, like the Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program and the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program which in the last year have assisted over 50,000 small and mid-size rural businesses across the country in creating or saving roughly 266,000 jobs.

"Initiatives  Conservation  Rural  Apr 26,   Public Information Coordinator, Kansas Last week as we celebrated the anniversary of Earth Day, we remembered that it is critical that we protect our environment for future generations. In each of the past 40 years, communities and individuals throughout our Nation have taken one day out of the year, Earth Day, to celebrate and initiate actions that preserve our planet. This year, to mark Earth Day in Kansas, USDA Rural Development celebrated with the City of Chetopa, USD Chetopa - St. Paul (School District), local business, and the community. Kim Juenemann, Superintendant for USD Chetopa - St. Paul remarked, “Chetopa Elementary has annually participated in one or more Earth Day activities.  We were very pleased to be part of the USDA's efforts in creating a dual celebration between our school and the city of Chetopa.  Chetopa Elementary students will also be participating on May 14th to continue our celebration of Earth Day at which time they will be completing activities at our OWLS (Outdoor Wetland Learning Site) location.” Local grocery, Chetopa Foods, has provided grocery bags for the K-8 grade kids to decorate with Earth Day or environmental theme drawings. At the event held in the Chetopa K-12 School Building, the children returned the grocery bags back to Chetopa Foods for distribution to the community, to share the art work and messages commemorating Earth Day. As part of the celebration, USDA Rural Development presented the City of Chetopa with a Certificate of Recognition for its efforts to protect the environment, with the planned wastewater infrastructure improvements.  Funding for the City’s project, a $3,000,000 loan provided through the Agency’s Water & Environmental Program, was selected to be funded by federal appropriations, provided through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. (Stimulus Funds).  Funding of individual recipients is contingent upon their meeting the terms of the loan or grant agreements, and the letter of conditions.

"Enterprise Team in  Forestry  Jan 06,  Test flight of an unmanned aerial system used to ignite strategic backfires during wildfire suppression activities in . Photo credit: Shawn Steber, National Technology and Development Program Gifford Pinchot, founding father of the USDA Forest Service, revolutionized American forestry in the late s and recognized the need for science-based forestry. The Forest service embraces innovation, science and technology to this day, and one program has exemplified that spirit for the past 75 years. Shortly after World War II ended in , the United States found itself with a sudden surplus of military equipment. True to its history of innovation, the Forest Service jumped at this peacetime opportunity and created the National Technology and Development Program. This program established two centers in California and Montana tasked with repurposing this surplus military equipment to better fight wildfires. The centers found cost-saving ways to standardize fire equipment like hoses, pumps, and couplings that make it easier to repair and replace broken parts. They refined harnesses, parachutes, and other equipment used in the deployment of firefighters from aircraft to fight fire more effectively in remote locations. To this day, firefighters still rely on these and other life-saving advances like rappelling and parachuting equipment, as well as the portable fire shelter, which has saved more than 300 lives. Over the years, the program’s scope has expanded from fire to include forest management, recreation and engineering research. The program has recently developed artificial intelligence software that connects with logging equipment to more accurately identify which trees to harvest or retain to better manage the landscape. Artificial intelligence software simultaneously measures and maps trees located within a proposed logging area. Photo credit: Lucas Wells, Holtz Forestry, LLC Other modern advances include updating unmanned aerial systems, or “drones,” to conduct prescribed fires – also known as prescribed or controlled burns – in remote areas. These fires, performed under controlled conditions by fire experts, land managers, and with the help of drones, can be a useful tool in restoring unhealthy ecosystems, and reducing hazardous fuel that threaten people, communities and resources. The National Technology and Development Program also maintains consistent equipment standards across the agency for products like fire retardants and personal protective equipment. This allows the Forest Service to purchase this widely used equipment in bulk, saving the agency more than $40 million every year. For all its futuristic work, the program also preserves the Forest Service’s past by maintaining an archive of historical drawings, blueprints and manuals on how to use tools as rudimentary as axes and crosscut saws.

"in  Conservation  Apr 22,  “How many of you like to swim in the creek or fish in the river?”, USDA Rural Utilities Service Administrator John Padalino asked White County Middle School students during the school’s Earth Day awards ceremony.  Do you like to go swimming or fishing? Rivers and lakes are cleaner thanks to USDA water/sewer investments in rural communities. On Monday, I joined Earth Day celebrations in the rural communities of Sparta and Monterey, Tenn.  Part of being good stewards of the Earth and our natural resources is making sure that we take proper care of waste and wastewater disposal.  The stories from Sparta and Monterey show how important this is. At the White County Middle School in Sparta, children recognized Earth Day by planting trees to help the environment.  The celebration also marked the end of a major sewage problem in town. Principal Craig Lynn told me how, about 10 years ago, students and teachers started noticing the football field was still mushy long after a rain.  Antiquated sewer equipment couldn’t keep up with rainwater runoff anymore, and sewage was overflowing out of drains and manhole covers all over the city.  “It just got real obvious down on the field where so many students practice and play,” Lynn said. Sparta Mayor Jeff Young added, “It’s not easy to fix something this big, especially when no new customers are being added to increase revenue.  USDA helped us figure out the best solution and how to pay for in a way we could afford.” “Selling bonds or raising taxes is not usually an option for small towns when something big goes wrong,” he continued  “Private lenders sometimes can’t help with infrastructure, so having USDA as a partner is crucial when it comes to basic public services.” Tennessee’s Upper Cumberland region has some of the largest stretches of contiguous forestland in the eastern U.S., along with dramatic gorges, lakes and rivers.  The near pristine condition of the natural environment is one of this region’s most valuable economic resources.  The USDA financing has had a positive impact on the local environment and economy.  Dependable water and sewer have had an immediate impact on the quality of life for families and make it possible for local businesses to grow good jobs. Next, I went to nearby Monterey for Earth Day to celebrate the extension of its water system.  “The smell of fresh water is wonderful,” local resident Shannon Davis said.  She told me about how for 15 years her family had to haul water in jugs from her parents’ house for drinking and cooking.  “To say getting public water is a blessing is an understatement.” USDA financing made it affordable for the town of 2,800 to extend water service another five miles out into the Walker Hollow area of Putnam County where the Davis family lives.  The Davises and others in Walker Hollow had been using individual water wells that became unsafe due to iron, manganese and coliform bacteria in the water supply.  The water got contaminated because of changes in the water table from recurring droughts and pressures created by growth.  The city made it a priority to get service to households in that area. “Before public water, we spent over $15,000 to repair and replace appliances,” Davis said.  “The sulfur water ruined refrigerators, a dishwasher and our other appliances with electric coils.  “There are not enough adjectives to express how much getting public water means to my family.” USDA Rural Utilities Service Administrator John Padalino and White County Middle School students and teachers added three oaks and two pawpaw trees to the school’s tree park to mark Earth Day.

"U.S. farmers in the 21st Century engage in many forms of agriculture, including conventional, organic, identity-preserved, and genetically engineered (GE) crop production. USDA is unequivocal in its supports for all these forms of agriculture. We need all of them to meet our country's collective needs for food security, energy production, carbon offsets and the economic sustainability of rural communities. Our goal is to promote the coexistence of all these approaches through cooperation and science-based stewardship practices. Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) provides the agriculture industry with valuable tools and services that help create marketing opportunities. AMS ensures the quality and availability of wholesome food and agricultural products for consumers in domestic and export markets. Services are available to producers of all types and sizes, from conventional and organic producers to international agricultural businesses. Through the AMS Specialty Crop Block Grant Program, USDA awards State departments of agriculture funds to distribute to both conventional and organic stakeholders to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops, including projects that develop local and regional food systems, and foster organic and sustainable production practices. Through the AMS National Organic Program (NOP), USDA has helped organic farmers and businesses achieve $35 billion annually in U.S. retail sales. The organic community includes over 25,000 organic businesses in more than 120 different countries around the world. The NOP has supported the continued growth of the organic sector by developing clear standards, enforcing a level playing-field, and expanding trade opportunities to create new markets for U.S. organic businesses. The NOP also provides support and input to the Advisory Committee on Biotechnology and 21st Century Agriculture (AC21). Organic stakeholders are well-represented on AC21. USDA has a number of new and expanded efforts to connect organic farmers and businesses with resources that will ensure the continued growth of the organic industry domestically and abroad. During this Administration, USDA has signed four major trade agreements on organic products, and is also helping organic stakeholders access programs that support conservation, provide access to loans and grants, fund organic research and education, and mitigate pest emergencies. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) provides oversight of genetically engineered organisms under research and development. Through compliance oversight and risk assessment programs APHIS regulates GE organism through science-based risk assessments and risk management to ensure proper confinement of GE organisms and separation from other agricultural commodities including organic commodities. APHIS supports USDA's coexistence effort by actively engaging in interagency efforts to address issues related to coexistence such as, researching and recommending stewardship and education best practices to promote coexistence, and recommending voluntary outcome-based solutions to promote coexistence such as pinning maps and incentives. Agricultural Research Service (ARS) As the chief intramural research agency of USDA, the Agricultural Research Service plays a foundational role in supporting American agriculture. ARS works cooperatively with farmers, producers, industry, universities, and other Federal partners both nationally and internationally to identify major agricultural issues and challenges to producing and sustaining a high-quality robust food, fiber, feed, and fuel production system. ARS research supports agricultural co-existence and takes an integrated approach of developing and identifying production practices that are productive, efficient, sustainable, and economically viable for a variety of farming systems--from conventional to organic farming practices and techniques to non-traditional approaches. Scientists represent a diverse body of scientific disciplines. Some projects focus on developing and evaluating non-traditional approaches that include biotechnology techniques, genomics, genetics, and other cutting-edge approaches needed to respond and adapt quickly and efficiently to unique, new and emerging problems that face our food production system. Research efforts are supported by many unique and innovative partnering tools to ensure that our research moves from lab to market to the American consumer. ARS Investment in long-term and short-term research has helped strengthen and ensure we maintain a safe, secure, and affordable food system, and that American farmers remain competitive in a global farming economy. Economic Research Service (ERS) The Economic Research Service (ERS) conducts research on the economic characteristics of genetically engineered crops and organic farming systems in the United States. The ERS website contains biotechnology information with links to ERS , research, and analysis on the extent of GE adoption, the economic effects of GE adoption, and other agricultural biotechnology issues. The ERS Organic Agriculture site contains links to , research, and analysis on the extent of certified organic acreage and livestock, consumer demand for organically produced goods, the economic characteristics of organic production, and other organic production and marketing issues. ERS routinely updates a number of Products on the economic characteristics of genetically engineered crops and organic farming systems, including: Genetically Engineered Crop : This product summarizes the adoption of herbicide-tolerant and insect-resistant crops since their introduction in . Tables include on corn, cotton, and soybeans, and provide obtained by USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service in the June Agricultural Survey for through . Organic Price : Historical wholesale and retail organic prices and price premiums for selected fruits, vegetables, poultry, eggs, dairy, and grains. Organic Production : ERS has been tracking the adoption of certified organic farming systems in the United States since the late s. ERS collaborates with over 50 State and private certification organizations and other USDA agencies to make estimates of the extent of certified organic farmland acreage and livestock, by commodity and by State, between through . Organic Commodity Costs and Returns: Annual cost and return estimates are reported for the United States and major production regions for corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, grain sorghum, rice, peanuts, oats, barley, milk, hogs, and cow-calf based on historical prices. These estimates are based on from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) survey results. Since , the organic dairy, soybean, apple, wheat, and corn sectors have been included with their conventional counterparts in the ARMS survey which enables comparisons of production costs, revenues, yields, energy intensiveness, structure, marketing, and other economic and environmental aspects. ARMS Farm Financial and Crop Production Practices: The Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) is USDA's primary source of information on the financial condition, production practices, and resource use of America's farm businesses and the economic well-being of America's farm households. on the use of various production practices in major crops by farming system (organic and non-organic systems) is available in this product. Questions about the use of non-genetically engineered seed and crop production practices will also be included. Recent ERS research has examined farmer motivations for adopting GE crops, the relationship between adoption of GE crops and yields, and the relationship between adoption of GE crops and pesticide use. See Genetically Engineered Crops in the United States (, 144) and The First Decade of Genetically Engineered Crops in the United States (, 543) for more information. Also see Off-Farm Income, Technology Adoption, and Farm Economic Performance for more information on economic effects of adoption of GE crops. A ERS report, Emerging Issues in the U.S. Organic Industry, (, 213) examined a broad spectrum of economic research on the profitability and market conditions in this rapidly changing sector. Research and analysis on organic consumer demand and imports is available in the ERS Organic Agriculture site. ERS is also collecting on the increase in retail food products with labels indicating private verification that the products were made according to best practices to avoid use of genetically engineered ingredients. Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) supports all U.S. agriculture. FAS partners with all producers-whether they are large, small, organic, or conventional-to facilitate the export of quality U.S. products around the world. From organic equivalency certifications to advocating for market access for GE crops, FAS is committed to serving the global interests of American agriculture. Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) facilitates the marketing of livestock, poultry, meat, cereals, oilseeds, and related agricultural products and promotes fair and competitive trading practices for the overall benefit of consumers and American agriculture. GIPSA supports co-existence through the High Quality Specialty Grain Temporary Waiver of mandatory inspection and weighing requirements for high quality specialty grain exported in containers, thereby facilitating the development of the high quality specialty grain export market, including business transactions for organic grains. National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) is committed to providing timely, accurate, and useful statistics in service to all aspects of U.S. agriculture. As one of the official federal statistical agencies, NASS produces objective on U.S. agriculture. To do this, hundreds of surveys are conducted every year as well as the every 5-year Census of Agriculture and prepare covering virtually every aspect of U.S. agriculture. Production and supplies of food and fiber, prices paid and received by farmers, farm labor and wages, farm finances, chemical use, organic agriculture, horticulture, equine, aquaculture, conservation practices, bees and honey, and the demographics of U.S. producers are only a few examples. NASS works to keep up with changes and diversification in U.S. agriculture by adding or deleting questions on the Census of Agriculture and by conducting special or new studies. Some recent examples are an expanded study of organic agriculture and new Census questions covering renewable energy, direct-to-consumer marketing, and silvaculture for example. All personal identifying information provided by survey respondents is kept confidential by federal law and is used for statistical purposes only. We publish only aggregated , ensuring that no individual operation or producer can be identified. National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Research and extension can play important roles to strengthen understanding of coexistence between conventional, transgenic and organic production systems. There is a need to precisely evaluate the composition of agricultural products from diverse cropping systems for the presence of genetically engineered (GE) material, which then creates a need for enhanced communication and awareness of the implications of coexistence. Broad-based research and extension initiatives can provide innovative solutions to these challenges. NIFA-supported research has contributed to the development and adoption of optimal mitigation techniques to minimize gene flow through genetic strategies, management practices, social systems, and producer cooperation. Cooperative Extension professionals have locally-specific roles in promoting the adoption of these techniques and strategies. NIFA-supported eXtension Communities of Practice ensure that science-based findings inform federal policy decision makers, consumers, and stakeholders as they develop agricultural practices based on economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Risk Management Agency (RMA) USDA's Risk Management Agency (RMA) provides Federal crop insurance coverage for America's farmers and ranchers. RMA continues to develop new and innovative insurance policies to better meet the needs of America's farmers and ranchers. We provide insurance policies for all farmers and ranchers and work to lower the cost of premiums so all have the ability to afford coverage for their operations. In just the past few years, RMA has:  Removed the 5 percent surcharge on organic policies;  Used new technology to provide policies covering rangeland, pasture, forage, and beekeeping;  Worked with farmers to provide accurate planting and harvesting counts from the that their planters and harvesters report to provide more accurate insurance coverage;  Combined insurance policies to make buying insurance coverage easier;  Continued to provide funding for risk management education around the country;  Offered coverage for the whole farm in most of the country encouraging insurance coverage on small and diverse farms; and  Developed a beginning farmer and rancher program that helps new farmers and ranchers start their businesses These are just a few of the actions RMA has taken in just a few years to help all farmers and ranchers get insurance coverage on their businesses and manage their business risk so America's agriculture industry continues to be robust and productive as technology and the industry change in the 21st century.","Here is a summary of the economic effects of adoption of GE (Genetically Engineered) crops, based on the information provided: 1. **ERS Report**: The Economic Research Service (ERS) reported that research on the profitability and market conditions in the organic industry has shown a broad spectrum of economic benefits. 2. **Increased retail food products with GE-free labels**: ERS is collecting data on the increase in retail food products with private verification labels indicating that they were made according to best practices to avoid use of genetically engineered ingredients. 3. **FAS Support**: The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) supports all U.S. agriculture, including organic and conventional farming, by facilitating export markets for high-quality specialty grains, such as organic grains. 4. **GIPSA Co-Existence Initiatives**: The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) promotes co-existence through the High Quality Specialty Grain Temporary Waiver, which facilitates the development of the high-quality specialty grain export market, including business transactions for organic grains.

"Director, Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, and Jade Smith, Project Assistant, Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 11,  This summer, USDA employees nationwide joined together to raise 1,791,393 pounds of food during the Feds Feed Families food drive. Thank you to all USDA employees and their partnering communities. Your extra efforts and generosity made the 3rd annual food drive a remarkable success.  As summer has faded into fall, this is another season when many Americans are struggling to make ends meet.  USDA programs already make a big difference in the lives of many Americans: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) helps over 45 million Americans put nutritious food on the table.  This summer, USDA employees went even further and helped fill the shelves of food banks and pantries around the country through the 3rd Annual Feds Feed Families Food Drive. With generosity in their hearts and the mission of fighting hunger, USDA employees joined together nationwide and raised an impressive 1,791,393 pounds of food for donation!  That number breaks down further to a donation of about 15 pounds per employee.  Thank you to all USDA employees and partners who contributed to this remarkable donation. Your efforts reinforce the Department’s efforts to help people every day, every way. Recognizing the power of partnerships with their communities, local, state and regional offices worked with local farmers, food banks, community and faith-based organizations to start food drives throughout the country. The Rural Development Office in Humboldt, Iowa motivated communities with the slogan “Smallest County, Biggest Heart” to emphasize that no matter how small a town, big things are possible. Through creative advertising in radio broadcasts, flyers, and newspaper articles, the Humboldt Office boosted the morale of their county and established relationships with local organizations to fill pantry shelves faster. Another exciting partnership was between Dakota Growers Pasta Company and the North Dakota Farm Service Agency Office.  Executive Director Aaron Krauter was motivated to start off his office’s Feds Feed Families food drive with an ample contribution and decided to donate a pallet of pasta (that is about 1,600 pounds of spaghetti!).  Mr. Krauter supports local business and called the pasta company that purchases the durum wheat he produces to get a price quote. Mr. Krauter said “he was a little blown away at the answer,” because the voice on the other line replied, “You must have caught me at a weak moment – it’s free.” By developing and building on strong community relationships in our hometowns, USDA employees were able to collect the second largest Feds Feed Families donation government-wide and surpassed the department’s goal of 500,000 pounds by the greatest percentage of any federal agency: 348 percent!  We’d like to offer a hearty congratulations and round of applause for all USDA employees.   We hope that you are proud of your efforts this summer. Thank you for all that you have done and all that you continue to do to help the American people in these difficult times.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Dec 29,  Cerulean warblers spend part of the year in the Appalachian Mountains of North America as well as the Andes Mountains of South America. Photo by DJ McNeil. What do biologists look for in a healthy forest? A diversity in the ages and composition of trees and occasional breaks in canopy to allow sunlight to reach understory plants. Healthy forests, just like healthy human populations, are sustained by a diversity of ages. Each group has a role to play in maintaining the whole community over the long term. But healthy, diverse forests are on the decline across the eastern United States. A lack of natural and human-induced disturbances because of fire suppression and certain timber harvest methods have led the forested landscape to become largely homogenous. These declines have had negative impacts on many different wildlife species, especially birds – like the cerulean warbler – that use different types of forests for different parts of their life cycle. Through a new project, the Appalachian Mountains Joint Venture (AMJV) is working with landowners and conservation partners to sustainably manage healthier forests, benefiting the declining cerulean warbler. “Because three-fourths of the cerulean warbler’s distribution occurs on private lands, working with private landowners in this region is critical to the successful conservation of this songbird,” AMJV Coordinator Todd Fearer said about the cerulean warbler, which nests and raises its young in the treetops above the Appalachian Mountains. AMJV, a partnership to restore and sustain native bird populations in the region, is working with landowners in West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Kentucky to provide assistance in managing healthier forests and restoring forests on mining sites. The AMJV is working with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), American Bird Conservancy and more than a dozen other conservation partners to provide technical and financial assistance to help landowners plan and implement sustainable forestry practices. “Fortunately, good cerulean habitat is best created using sustainable forestry practices that can improve the health of the forest stand and improve the future value of timber, so it’s a win for both the birds and the landowners,” Fearer said. This project brings together many partners to assist landowners, including the National Wild Turkey Federation and West Virginia Department of Forestry. Photo by Kyle Aldinger. Landowners have found these practices help to “reset the clock” on low-value forests by re-establishing a healthier and more valuable stand of trees. The project has a goal to improve the health of at least 12,500 acres in priority areas. In its first year, the project led to the improvement of about 1,700 acres. The AMJV is also monitoring the response to forest improvement, tracking the use of these managed lands by cerulean warblers and other species. The Regional Conservation Partnership Program, a Farm Bill conservation program administered by NRCS, is investing $8 million in this project, and partners are leveraging an additional $8 million. “One of the greatest strengths of the Migratory Bird Joint Ventures is the collective resources the partners bring to the table,” Fearer said. “We have more than 20 AMJV partners across five states assisting with this project, contributing direct, in-kind and logistical support. This gives us the opportunity to address a range of cerulean warbler conservation needs at a scale not feasible by any one organization.”  This project is part of a broader conservation effort in the East to help landowners manage for diverse forests. Through Working Lands for Wildlife (WLFW), NRCS has helped Appalachian landowners improve more than 13,000 acres for the golden-winged warbler, another iconic migratory songbird that relies on young forests for nesting. “The Farm Bill provides landowners with a variety of tools to manage for more productive forests, including one-on-one technical assistance and financial assistance,” said Bridgett Costanzo, one of WLFW’s coordinators. “Every forest has different needs and resource challenges, and we work with landowners to tailor forest management plans to meet the needs of wildlife and their operations.” Landowners wanting to participate in the AMJV’s effort for cerulean warbler are encouraged to reach out to the AMJV or their nearest USDA service center  Category/Topic:  Conservation  Tags:  cerulean warbler  Conservation  Forests  golden-winged warbler  habitat restoration  NRCS  RCPP  Regional Conservation Partnership Program  sustainable forest management  sustainable forestry  Wildlife  Working Lands for Wildlife",What is the primary goal of the Appalachian Mountains Joint Venture (AMJV) project in managing forests for cerulean warblers?,"The primary goal of the AMJV project is to sustainably manage healthier forests, benefiting the declining cerulean warbler."

"Food Loss and Waste  Why should we care about food waste?  National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste and Recycling Organics  Federal Interagency Collaboration to Reduce Food Loss and Waste  U.S. Food Loss and Waste Champions  USDA Activities and Partnerships  Farmers  Businesses  Consumers  Schools  Donating  Funding  Frequently Asked Questions  Latest News and Multimedia      Videos  Contact Us Reducing Food Waste at K-12 Schools K-12 schools have a special role in not only reducing, recovering, and recycling food waste on their premises but also in educating the next generation about the importance of food conservation and recovering wholesome excess food for donation to those less fortunate. Most importantly, increasing consumption and reducing wasted food means children get the nutritional benefits from the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP). The best way to tackle food waste is to make sure students consume what they take. This involves good planning by school nutrition staff, getting students involved in decision-making, and having teachers educate students on the impacts of wasted food. Strategies  Offer-versus-serve (OVS) – Allows students to decline some components of a reimbursable meal as a way of providing choice and reducing waste. OVS is mandatory in high schools, but optional for elementary and middle schools .  Market your meals – Highlight new foods on your menus and serving lines. Consider holding taste tests and recipe competitions or creating a student advisory committee to provide feedback on food acceptability and recipe names.  Extend lunch from 20 to 30 minutes – In a poll by NPR and the Harvard School of Public Health (, 1 ), 20 percent of parents of students from kindergarten through fifth grade surveyed said their child only gets 15 minutes or less to eat. Extending the lunch period can improve dietary intake and reduce food waste.  Create share tables – Share tables are designated stations where children may return whole and/or unopened food or beverage items they choose not to eat. These items are then made available to other children who may want another serving during or after the meal service. USDA encourages the use of share tables and offers implementation guidance.  Saving food items – Students who may not have time to finish their meal during the designated lunch period may save certain meal components for later in the day. For food safety reasons, this practice should be limited to food items that do not require cooling or heating. Resources/Curriculum  Guide to Conducting Student Food Waste Audits (, 2.7 ) – This food waste audit guide provides students with step-by-step guidance on collecting on how much food and which types of food is thrown away by students in their school cafeterias. The guide is intended to help educate students about the amount of food they waste in their school cafeterias and to educate them about ways to encourage healthy eating and reduced waste.  Reducing Food Waste: What Schools Can Do Today (, 858 ) – Hang this infographic up in your school or use it as an educational tool in the classroom.  Team Nutrition: What You Can Do to Help Prevent Wasted Food (, 1.4 ) – Provides tips for school nutrition professionals, teachers, and students.  Summary of Food Waste Resources and Tools for Nutrition Programs - The USDA Food and Nutrition Service’s Office of Food Safety has compiled a selection of , articles, and tools that school nutrition professionals can utilize to understand the issue of food waste and assist them in implementing strategies to reduce wasted food. Donations and Liability Protection Schools that wish to donate food have protections under the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act. The Act grants liability protections for “persons and gleaners” who make good faith donations to nonprofits for ultimate distribution to needy individuals at zero cost or at a good Samaritan reduced price. Here, the term “person” includes schools and institutions of higher education if they identify as an “individual, corporation, partnership, organization, association, or governmental entity, including a retail grocer, wholesaler, hotel, motel, manufacturer, restaurant, caterer, farmer, and nonprofit food distributor or hospital”.  New amendments passed on January 5, , also grant liability protections to “qualified direct donors” who donate directly to needy individuals at zero cost.  Qualified direct donors include: school food authorities, intuitions of higher education, caterers, restaurants, and more.    For more information, see: USDA’s Frequently Asked Questions about the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act (, 188 ) The information presented is not a guidance document and does not constitute legal advice or create an attorney-client relationship.

"in  Conservation  Jan 29,   Earlier this month, I had the pleasure of meeting with a dedicated group of women farmers and ranchers who are actively taking on leadership roles in farm organizations, cooperatives, and in their communities. They had gathered in the sunshine state for the National Farmers Union Women’s Conference to discuss opportunities and challenges on their own operations, what they believe the future holds for agriculture, and the role of women in that future. Women face a unique set of challenges. They must find ways to balance the demands of family, community and the responsibilities to their businesses - all while being strong leaders within and for their communities. At the conference, I had the privilege of speaking with Jane Alexander, a pioneer for women in leadership roles. Jane began as a state lawmaker in the s and went on to become the first female deputy secretary of agriculture in the United States, serving in the state of Pennsylvania. She has been an inspiration for so many women – not just in agriculture.  She encouraged women at the meeting to follow their dreams and gave guidance on overcoming obstacles. I was inspired by the diversity of the women I met at the conference.  There was a South Dakota rancher who had gone through the challenges of the early winter storm last year.  A young woman and her mother who were attending the conference together.  This remarkable girl is home-schooled on her family’s farm and helps with all aspects of running and caring for her family’s farm – in addition to running her own salves and balms company. There was an Iowan transitioning her farm - a CSA farmer from New Hampshire - and so many more working tirelessly to manage their businesses and make sure their needs are represented as decisions are made that affect their lives and livelihoods. These excellent women are serving on boards, starting committees and bringing their experience and expertise to the agriculture policy table. Talking with these women made it clear to me: the time is now to be planning and building the kind of future we want to have in agriculture.  Farming and ranching is full of new, diverse thinkers who have experience, passion, and can contribute their expertise to the future.  But those of us in agriculture have to be ready to share tools for leadership with this new crop of leaders– and to support them as they work towards success. As Deputy Secretary, I want to meet this challenge head on.  We have an obligation to our future and those who will inherit our farms and ranches to build a tomorrow that works.  Think about your own families and neighbors – what will they need and want twenty years from now?  How will that affect what we do today? The impressive women in Florida had a vision for that future.  The diversity of people that I have met as I have traveled across the country have a vision.  Let’s build upon the successes of agriculture by opening the doors wide to these new thinkers.  The future of American farming and ranching will be a bright one – everyone who loves the land and wants to make a living on it should have a spot at the table to decide how that happens.

"Proposed Rule Clarifies SNAP Outreach Activities Allowed  March is National Nutrition Month. Throughout the month, USDA will be highlighting results of our efforts to improve access to safe, healthy food for all Americans and supporting the health of our next generation.  Even as the economy improves, many Americans continue to need a helping hand putting food on the table.  Many of our most vulnerable low income citizens still have trouble obtaining meaningful jobs due to barriers such as lack of education, transportation, or child care.  Outreach helps people understand whether they may be eligible for USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and how it can supplement their current food budget. But in the end, whether or not to participate in SNAP is a personal decision.  This is a core part of the SNAP regulations and a guiding factor in SNAP outreach strategies. Today, USDA published a proposed rule that codifies portions of the Farm Bill related to outreach that further strengthen against recruitment.  Outreach activities designed to pressure or persuade a person to apply for benefits are not allowed.  Furthermore, as directed by the Farm Bill, the proposed rule specifically prohibits radio, television or billboard advertising.  The proposed rule would also prohibit organizations receiving funds under the Food and Nutrition Act of from tying compensation for outreach workers to the number of people who apply for SNAP benefits as a result of their efforts, also part of the Farm Bill.

"New Media Content Specialist, Office of Communications in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 21,   Number seven on our list of Social Media Moments was our August Twitter chat with Food and Nutrition Service’s Under Secretary, Kevin Concannon and ABC’s Dr. Richard Besser.  This edition of Dr. Besser’s weekly live chat addressed hunger in America and allowed audience members to pose questions to Under Secretary Concannon via Twitter. This was a great opportunity for us as we opened our virtual doors to many individuals who might not otherwise be able to “speak” directly to our key official on the issue. Although the Under Secretary and other agency leadership often travel to schools, food banks, community centers and other venues to talk about hunger and nutrition issues, this Twitter chat was a little bit different.  This wasn’t a planned speech or a more common scheduled Tweet from our blog. The Twitter chat was Concannon having a conversation with people he had never met but who gathered virtually around an important issue. Sitting in the room around our laptop with the Tweet-stream projected on the wall, we were able to use our well-established Twitter channel in a more nimble and free-flowing manner, rather than just a broadcast. And then, in the waning moments of the chat, we experienced a rare earthquake in our nation’s capital. Not sure what would happen, we posted a Tweet that our building was rocked and we might not be back – little did we know Dr. Besser replied that he too felt the shake. When the shaking stopped, the Under Secretary was quite eager to get back to the questions from Dr. Besser and those following the chat, and so we came back to the table and finished before being evacuated from the building. It was truly one of my favorite memories from my time here at USDA, and will be forever a great story to retell when people ask, “Where were you when the Great DC Quake rocked the east coast?” To see our number eight moment, check out our blog from yesterday.

"Technical Information Specialist, USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline, Food Safety Education Staff in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Dec 05,   Being home for the holidays will not be possible this year for many American armed forces. The next best thing may be receiving greetings and gifts of food items. Many foods are safe to mail. However, you must have the name and address of a military person stationed overseas. Because of security risks, the U.S. Postal Service will not deliver mail addressed to “Any Serviceman.” It’s important to mail food gifts that are not perishable, can tolerate a range of temperatures, and won’t break with rough handling. Food gifts that can be safely mailed include dried products such as jerky and fruits, shelf stable canned specialties, and regional condiments such as hot sauces. Homemade cookies, candy, and low-moisture breads and bar cookies are also good candidates for mailing. Perishable foods are not safe to mail. These include foods that must be kept refrigerated (at 40 °F or below) to remain safe -- meat, poultry, fish, and soft cheeses, for example. These foods cannot be safely left at room temperature for more than 2 hours, much less for a week or more in the mail. Foodborne bacteria that may be present on these foods grow fastest at temperatures above 40 °F and can double every 20 minutes. When this happens, someone eating the food can get sick. As an alternative to homemade gifts, some families may wish to send a military member’s favorite mail order foods. Shelf stable “summer sausage,” cheeses, cakes, and snacks can be ordered on the Internet or through mail order catalogues. Because of the delivery time and distances between the U.S. and duty stations overseas, do not order any food gifts that must be kept refrigerated. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s Meat and Poultry Hotline offers the following advice concerning food gifts for armed forces serving away from home including those overseas. RECOMMENDED FOOD GIFTS Dried beef or poultry such as beef jerky, turkey jerky, or beef slims are safe to mail. Bacteria can’t grow in dried foods preserved by removing moisture. Dehydrated soups and fruit drink mixes are lightweight and safe to mail. Regional condiments such as hot sauce and Cajun seasonings in packets are useful for spicing up Meals Ready to Eat (MRE). Canned specialties such as paté, corned beef, shelf-stable hams, anchovies, shrimp, dips and cracker spreads make nice treats. Recipients should be cautioned not to use any cans that are damaged or swollen. Foods in glass containers should not be mailed because they can break. Dense and dry baked goods such as fruit cakes and biscotti are good choices for mailing because they will not mold. Other suitable baked goods include commercially packaged cakes and cookies in airtight tins, dry cookies such as ginger snaps, and specialty crackers. High-moisture baked goods such as pumpkin bread -- while safe at room temperature for a few days -- should not be mailed because they will most likely mold before delivery. Fragile foods like delicate cookies won’t make the trip intact. When mailing sturdy cookies and homemade candies, wrap each piece individually and pack items in commercially popped corn or foam to help cushion the trip. Place the food gifts in a sturdy box and seal it securely with packing tape. Dried fruits such as raisins and apricots, canned nuts and fruit, and commercially packaged trail mix need no refrigeration. Hard candies and sturdy homemade sweets such as fudge, pralines, and toffee are safe to mail because their high sugar content prevents bacterial growth. Ask Karen, the virtual food safety representative, is available 24/7 at AskKaren.gov. Weekdays between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. ET, the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline is available at 1-888-MPHotline or via live chat at AskKaren.gov.

While there, we also traveled to the beautiful countryside and met with key local food stakeholders during a special session and visits to local farms.   The round table forum and farm visits allowed farmers, ranchers, and local food organizations to share their experiences. We heard from Danny Farrar, who owns Rancho La Jolla in Velarde and is also a member of the Farm to School Board of Directors. He told us that many of the northern New Mexico farmers who sell at farmers markets are growing fruits and vegetables on small family farms of just 3 to 5 acres and on land passed down through generations.

They are also naturally low in sodium, high in potassium, and are generally high in vitamins and minerals. Stuffing mushrooms just makes something wonderful ever better!  But what you stuff in these tasty little vegetables can make or break the dish.

"Regional Administrator, USDA Food and Nutrition Service Midwest Region in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 22,   An African proverb holds that it takes a village to raise a child. And what’s a village? Well, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, it’s the Milwaukee Hunger Task Force (the State’s largest food bank and anti-hunger advocacy organization), Kohl’s Department Stores, Milwaukee Public Schools, the Salvation Army, Boys and Girls Clubs, the Social Development Commission and the Milwaukee Park System. When the school year ends, many children and teens who rely on USDA school meals are at a higher risk of going hungry during the summer when school is not in session. USDA’s Summer Food Service Program can make sure that kids don’t go hungry summer, but the program can’t work without sponsors and supportive communities. Volunteers from Kohl’s load signs that advertise USDA summer meals for kids into their cars at the loading dock of Wisconsin’s largest food bank. Enter an engaged and supportive mix of individuals, organizations, government agencies and one of the largest store chains in America and suddenly, child hunger in Milwaukee appears as threatened as a snow cone on a hot August afternoon. I saw this impressive collaboration in action during the launch of Milwaukee’s summer program in early June. And was there ever action! Prior to the launch, Hunger Task Force worked for nearly a year with schools, parks, Boys and Girls Clubs and other organizations to ensure that there would be sites at which the USDA meals could be served. When all the footwork had been done, Milwaukee was ready for the launch of its program which is covered by most local media. The event takes place at the loading dock at Milwaukee Hunger Task Force’s food bank where volunteers from Kohl’s—which pledged $1.5 million over three years to provide suppers for kids to complement the Summer Food Service Program—loaded signs that read “Kids Eat Free Meals HERE” and “Comidas de verano gratis para los niños AQUÍ” into their cars. Kohl’s and Hunger Task Force staff then fanned out across the city to surround feeding sites with the bright green signs, so that kids and communities know where to go to get a meal during the summer. Kohl’s volunteers await directions from Milwaukee Hunger Task Force Director Sherrie Tussler while local news cameras look on.  USDA show that in , over 17 million children lived in food insecure households. Thanks to the efforts of the “village” of Milwaukee, that city’s children are more likely to have access to a summer meal—and to know where to find one.

"Ensuring Safety of Imported Processed Chicken from China  On August 30th, FSIS announced the results of our verification audit of China’s poultry processing inspection system, which reaffirmed the equivalence of China’s poultry processing system.  This determination was made after a long and careful review by our expert auditors to ensure that China’s system for processed poultry meets the United States’ safety standards.  FSIS’ core mission is food safety and our staff works hard and diligently to ensure that the U.S. food supply remains safe.  Since the announcement of the audit results, our agency has received several inquires regarding this determination so I want to take the time to explain this process and clarify any misperceptions. Let me start with explaining what this “equivalence” determination means.  If a country wants to export FSIS regulated product to the United States, as a regulatory agency, we are to review this request and conduct an audit to determine if their food safety system meets U.S. standards.  The process for determining China’s equivalence began in , when China submitted a formal request to FSIS that the agency evaluate China’s poultry system to assess it equivalence and thus its eligibility to export poultry products to the United States.  After an extensive audit, FSIS granted China “equivalence” for processed poultry in which meant that China was eligible to export cooked chicken to the U.S. as long as the raw poultry was from an approved source.  FSIS began rulemaking and published a final rule in the Federal Register, adding China to the list of countries eligible to export cooked poultry to the United States.  However, the appropriations bill prohibited FSIS from using funding to implement the final rule that allowed China to export processed chicken.  In , the appropriations ban was lifted and China submitted a new request for an equivalence audit.

"New Web Application Helps Families Find Summer Meals in Their Communities  USDA’s Summer Food Service Program, a federally-funded, state-administered program, last year served more than 187 million meals to children in low-income areas to ensure that they continued to receive proper nutrition throughout the summer when schools were closed. But that number represents just a small fraction of the children who are eligible to receive summer meals. Many families may not have taken advantage of the program because they didn’t know where meals were served near them. That’s why this summer we here at USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service recently launched the Summer Meal Site Finder, a new web and mobile tool that allows parents, teens and children in all 50 states, as well as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, to type in their address, city, state or zip code to get a list of the summer meal sites closest to them.  The tool also provides information about each of the 45,000 sites already registered for this summer, including their operating hours, contact information, and directions to each site.

Each fiscal year, the Agency targets a portion of its direct and guaranteed farm ownership (FO) and operating loan (OL) funds to beginning farmers and ranchers. Livestock Insurance USDA helps producers manage their business risks. The mission of USDA's Risk Management Agency (RMA) is to promote, support, and regulate sound risk management solutions to preserve and strengthen the economic stability of America's agricultural producers. As part of this mission, RMA operates and manages the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC). RMA has three divisions: Insurance Services, Product Management, and Risk Compliance. Seventeen private-sector insurance companies sell and service the policies. RMA develops and/or approves the premium rate, administers premium and expense subsidies, approves and supports products, and reinsures the companies. RMA also sponsors educational and outreach programs and seminars on the general topic of risk. Federal State Marketing Improvement Program This matching grant program, also known as FSMIP, provides matching funds to State Departments of Agriculture and other appropriate State agencies to assist in exploring new market opportunities for food and agricultural products, and to encourage research and innovation aimed at improving the efficiency and performance of the marketing system. Specialty Crop Block Grant Program The SCBGP funds can be requested to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops. Specialty crops are defined as fruits and vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, and nursery crops (including floriculture). The Farmers Market Promotion Program The FMPP was created through a recent amendment of the Farmer-to-Consumer Direct Marketing Act of . The grants, authorized by the FMPP, are targeted to help improve and expand domestic farmers markets, roadside stands, community-supported agriculture programs and other direct producer-to-consumer market opportunities. Organic Cost Share Program AMS administers two organic certification cost share programs. Each program provides cost share assistance, through participating States, to organic producers and/or organic handlers. Recipients must receive initial certification or continuation of certification from a USDA accredited certifying agent (ACA).","Here is a concise question that focuses on the key concepts: What type of loans does FSA make available to farmers and ranchers who cannot obtain commercial credit, and how can these funds be used?","FSA makes direct and guaranteed farm ownership and operating loans to family-size farmers and ranchers. These loans can be used to purchase land, livestock, equipment, feed, seed, supplies, construct buildings, or make farm improvements."
"NRCS Oregon in  Conservation  Jun 29,  Beth Hoinacki shows an aspect of her crop rotation and cover crop plan.  U.S. trends in organic farming point to a growing industry. USDA agencies like the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) support organic growers by offering funding and technical guidance—both to farmers already growing organic crops, and to those who want to transition to organic production. Luckily for Beth Hoinacki, she heard about NRCS’ Organic Initiative right around the same time that she was pursuing organic certification for her operation, Goodfoot Farm. Hoinacki and her husband, Adam Ryan, purchased 10 acres of land situated along the bank of the Luckiamute River in Kings Valley, Ore. in, which they later named “Goodfoot Farm.” They were interested in the Organic Initiative because it helps producers create a conservation plan and apply approved methods targeting specific concerns on their operation. NRCS District Conservationist Tom Snyder and Hoinacki look through her fence to the recently completed grass waterway and hedgerow funded by NRCS’ EQIP Organic Initiative.  Hoinacki credits the Initiative with helping them start projects critical to soil and water quality that they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to address on the farm, where they grow a variety of produce, including blueberries, onions, garlic, potatoes and winter squash. One project helped the couple install a grassed waterway to reduce erosion in order to minimize sediment runoff into the river and improve habitat for threatened and endangered fish. In addition, they’ve planted a hedgerow for pollinator habitat, pursued a waste management plan to protect water quality and developed crop rotation and installed cover crops to improve soil health. Two curly-feathered Sebastopol and two American lavender geese help control grass and weeds on Goodfoot Farm. Hoinacki says that they’ve recently been interested in biodynamic agriculture ­because it takes a more holistic approach to farming. She says that organic methods focus primarily on allowed off-farm inputs on crops or fields, whereas the biodynamic approach is more about creating a plan and purpose for a farm to realize its potential as a natural, self-sustaining system. Hoinacki’s goal is to have a natural system that reduces the need for pest and fertility products to be imported from off the farm. She says that the biodynamic method has influenced her thinking in designing the farm, and NRCS’ Organic Initiative allows her the flexibility to pursue her goals by supporting beneficial plant life for habitat and developing a natural ecosystem within the production system.

"Deputy Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Aug 17,   Pennsylvania is among the country’s top ten states represented in the USDA’s National Farmers Market Directory.  I recently completed a trip through the Fruit Belt to the Lehigh Valley and Philadelphia to see how USDA’s support of farmers market development is impacting communities and helping farmers across the Keystone State. My first stop was Camp Hill, a small town outside Harrisburg, to visit a new farmers market developed with the assistance of community organizations including   Capital Resource and Conservation & Development Area Council (Capital RC&D).  Capital RC&D received a USDA Farmers Market Promotion Program grant to help farmers markets improve their consumer outreach and receive EBT and debit payments to expand micro-business opportunities for the area’s local farmers.  The market, which just opened in May, is off to a great start with over a dozen vendors selling local bread, meat,  dairy and produce from Pennsylvania’s fruit belt.  Buying apples from Troy Lehman of Rex Fruit Farm at the farmers market in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania A farmers market has been part of Easton, Pennsylvania’s identity since the 18th century.  In however, the market shrank to one vendor.  By the next year, with the support of the city government, local farmers, members of the community, and the Greater Easton Development Partnership, the market was revived.  Now every Saturday in season, over 40 local farmers and vendors create one of Lehigh Valley’s most vibrant marketplaces in the same town square where the Declaration of Independence was read 236 years ago.  With USDA support, the Easton Farmers Market installed the technology needed to accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and in one year, saw a 20 percent jump in vendor sales.  The city also that 70 percent of the market's customers are shopping at downtown business, spending up to an extra $26,000 each week.   Easton Mayor Sal Panto highlighted the significant impact of the farmers market to the local community and the comeback of Easton’s downtown as he announced that the farmers market will now be year-round. Next stop:  Greensgrow in the heart of Philadelphia.  Transforming a once abandoned city block into a robust urban farm, Greensgrow now boasts a nursery, farm stand, mobile farmers market, and community supported agriculture program with 700 members.  With USDA support, Greensgrow established a mobile market to deliver fresh produce to underserved neighborhoods.  I followed the Greensgrow mobile market into nearby Camden, New Jersey where I toured the Camden Center for Environmental Transformation, an impressive urban gardening project which brings a whole new meaning to the name “Garden State”. Food Trust's farmers' market program manager Nicky Uy, Department of Public Health director of policy and planning Giridhar Mallaya and The Food Trust's farmers' market program associate Mukethe Kawinzi joined Walsh at west Philadelphia’s Clark Park farmers market. (photo by April White, The Food Trust) My final visit was to the Clark Park Farmers' Market in West Philadelphia.  Here, The Food Trust operates a lively and diverse market which, with USDA and Philadelphia Department of Public Health support, has significantly expanded SNAP transactions. Clark Park and The Food Trust, which operates 26 markets in Philadelphia, both play a critical role in the city’s initiative to expand access to healthy food while also expanding economic opportunities for area farmers. I used the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass map to plot my trip. The farmers, community leaders, business owners, and city officials I visited with at each one of these stops clearly illustrated the impact farmers markets are having on small towns, big cities, and the farming communities that surround them.

"NRCS Earth Team in  Conservation  Jun 09,  Earth Team Volunteers Lyla Schulz and Jean Herauf (L to R) prepare a conservation mailing to famers in the Dickinson, N.D., NRCS office.  Two women have been helping make an environmental impact in Stark County, North Dakota for nearly two decades. Lyla Schulz, 91, and Jean Herauf, 90, have each volunteered over 1,000 hours doing routine office work to allow conservationists with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service to spend more time working directly with farmers and ranchers. “This lets us give better service and get more conservation on the ground,” said District Conservationist Russell E. Jordre. “When Lyla and Jean volunteer, they increase our ability to work directly with landowners so we can improve the environment for everyone.” Paperwork and other office tasks can take up hours that conservationists could otherwise be spending in the field. Schulz and Herauf assist with client mailings, file maintenance, photocopying, form preparation and educational projects. Both women are natives of Stark County in southwestern North Dakota. They farmed, raised families and retired before they began working with conservationists and staff as NRCS Earth Team volunteers. Lyla Schulz grew up on a farm, but moved to Dickinson when she married. She and her husband raised nine children. She said she never heard of NRCS until she started volunteering with the agency. Now she enjoys her work so much she says wants to be an Earth Team volunteer for as long as possible. Jean Herauf married a farmer in . They raised six children and, today, Jean’s granddaughter is living and farming on the homestead. She stays active bowling, dancing, swimming and playing cards. “Jean is so busy,” said Jordre, “when we ask her to volunteer she has to check her schedule first.” The long-time Earth Team volunteers were recently honored for their service at an award ceremony hosted by the western region of soil conservation districts. In , more than 30,000 Earth Team volunteers donated 641,735 hours of service to NRCS estimated to be worth $13.4 million. Since Earth Team was formed in , over half a million volunteers have donated an estimated $327 million worth of time, in dollars, helping NRCS with its conservation mission.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Conservation  Energy  Forestry  Jan 10,  The Forest Service’s Technology and Development Center is the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s first net zero energy facility in the nation. (RecSolar Inc.) The Forest Service’s Technology and Development Center recently received the White House’s GreenGov Presidential Award and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Federal Energy and Water Management Award for its net zero energy facility project in San Dimas, Calif. A facility earns a net zero energy designation if it produces more renewable energy than it uses per year. This is the first facility of its kind in the Department of Agriculture. The Department of Energy also recognized the Center for the same facility project and the Forest Service’s Northern Region for executing a $2.6 million Energy Savings Performance Contract in Fiscal Year . “We are honored to receive the GreenGov Award, and the Federal Energy and Water Management awards for the Technology and Development Center as the first net zero green facility exemplifying leadership in energy conservation,” said Emilee Blount, the Forest Service’s national director of Engineering, Technology and Geospatial Services. The GreenGov awards are distributed annually to honor personnel and programs that have taken innovative steps to reduce energy use and carbon pollution, curb waste and save taxpayer money in federal agency operations, according to the White House. This is the fourth year for the awards. Recipients of the White House’s GreenGov Presidential Award (L-R): Kurt Gernerd, Washington Office; Nancy Sutley, Council on Environmental Quality; Kathy Kreyns, Technology and Development Center; John Fehr, Technology and Development Center; M. Renee Jewell, Pacific Southwest Region; Emilee Blount, Washington Office; Jeff Goodman, USDA; John Eichhorst, Office of General Counsel, Pacific Southwest Region; James Pena, National Forest System. (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers/ F.T. Eyre) The Technology and Development Center made several changes to its facility, including replacing the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system in the administration building and installing 1,288 solar panels on 1.5 acres to produce up to 600,000 kilowatt hours of energy each year. The center produces enough energy to provide monetary credits with local utility company Southern California Edison (SCE), saving the government $100,000 annually and paying for itself within 10 years. The Center’s net zero energy status was accomplished by first installing numerous energy-saving measures to the 48-year-old facility. The facility installed a 302-kilowatt photovoltaic solar panel system that converts sunshine into electricity and is connected to SCE‘s electrical grid. The system generates more than double the facility’s energy needs, and SCE applies a credit to both the Center and the Angeles National Forest Supervisor’s Office for excess energy the system generates. The Northern Region negotiated a 13-year, $2.6 million energy savings contract in , exceptionally known for its complexity, breadth and logistical challenges. The new contract addresses 500 facilities at 62 sites served by 19 different utility providers, installing programmable thermostats, heat pumps, greenhouse furnaces, lighting, vacancy sensors, attic and foundation insulation, infiltration reduction measures and a 4.9-kilowatt solar photovoltaic system. In total, the projects are expected to save about $250,000 in utility costs per year. This contract has already been used as a template for proposed projects for two other Forest Service regions.

"Full Disclosure: Changes to Poultry Inspections Needed to Protect Public Health  Cross posted from Food Safety News:  For the past 15 years, USDA conducted a pilot project to inform how we modernize our inspection process – all to ensure that meat and poultry is safe to eat. Today, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), released a report on the project, known as the HACCP-Based Inspection Models Project (HIMP), and how FSIS has relied on it to propose a modernized approach to inspecting poultry. While an initial scan of the press coverage may lead you to believe that GAO discredits this proposal, that is not the case. GAO gave HIMP a thorough review and made just two recommendations, both of which FSIS is already working to fulfill. GAO chose not to include some facts that also deserve public disclosure. FSIS put forward this proposal because shows that a system like HIMP will prevent at least 5,000 more foodborne illnesses annually. The study that FSIS has conducted of HIMP provides an appropriate basis on which to judge the merits of this system. Approximately 10 years ago, FSIS asked an independent group of experts in poultry microbiology, statistical evaluation, poultry food safety and public health to evaluate our study.

"Assistant to the Secretary for Rural Development in  Initiatives  Jul 28,  Hazlett visiting an Indiana Farm during her Ag Director days. Every month, USDA shares the story of a woman in agriculture who is leading the industry and helping other women succeed along the way. This month, we hear from Anne Hazlett, Assistant to the Secretary for Rural Development. Tell us about your background. What sparked your interest in agriculture? I am originally from Indiana and grew up in Indianapolis, which is not a rural area, but at a very young age I got involved in 4-H and began showing livestock. We would buy animals in the spring, spend all summer preparing them for show, and then take them to the county and state fairs to compete. I loved the animals, the people, and each of the small towns that I got to visit along the way in those adventures.  Rural America and the people who call them home have been my life and my passion ever since.   What is a typical day for you at USDA? Right now my days are filled with meeting people and learning. I’m spending a lot of time learning about our programs, our structure and operations.  I am also learning more about the many challenges and opportunities that we have in rural America.  Lastly, I am spending time with the Secretary to learn more about his priorities and his style of governing. How would you like a typical day to be? I enjoy listening and learning from other people.  Over the course of my career, I have learned that good leaders sit down and meet with constituents, partners and their staff to learn what their needs are. You can often find solutions to challenges by first carefully listening to people who are on the front lines of addressing an issue.  I have also learned that it is critical to be in the field and learn from people who are on the ground.  Otherwise, you may be pursuing a solution that looks good on paper but will not be effective when put into practice. What are your goals for rural development? First and foremost, I want to assist Secretary Perdue in executing his vision for creating an environment where rural communities can prosper.   In that, I am specifically focused on taking action to improve the quality of life in rural America-- from greater access to broadband connectivity and medical care to distance learning.  Two issues that I am particularly passionate about are leadership and capacity development in small towns and assisting rural communities in responding to the growing nightmare of opioid misuse and the many underlying challenges that have contributed to this issue. Beyond these external goals, I would like to foster greater synergy between Rural Development and the other mission areas in USDA as well as other partners focused on rural programs within the federal family.  For example, how can Rural Development work more closely with other agencies to address challenges like food insecurity and child summer hunger. Who are your role models? 1) Lieutenant Governor Becky Skillman of Indiana. She was the first female elected Lieutenant Governor in my home state.  Lt. Gov. Skillman is my role model for a couple of reasons.  First, rural communities are her lifelong passion and were her primary focus during her time in office.  Becky taught me the value of listening first and bringing people together to listen to each other in order to find a solution.  Another reason I admire Lt. Gov. Skillman is that she is a strong believer in investing time and effort into mentoring future generations of women. No matter the position she has held, Becky has been tireless in giving young women opportunity and then mentoring them along the way.  From 4-H to Girl Scouts and random constituents just stopping by the Statehouse to say hello, Becky went out of her way to make time for girls and young women--  and in doing, would inspire them that they too can do great things.  I remember one time she moved her schedule around to meet with a family and their young daughters, and years later the constituent said to me:   “You know, that 15 minutes and the photo she took with my daughters really changed their life. They won’t ever forget that.”  I was lucky to work for her− she changed my life too. 2) Former Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln.  Senator Lincoln was the first woman to chair the Senate Agriculture Committee.  Similar to Lt. Governor Skillman, Senator Lincoln had a gift for bringing people together-- particularly during difficult legislative battles.  Senator Lincoln was very good at rising above differing viewpoints and bringing people together around the needs of rural America, regardless of their political alignment or philosophy.  Senator Lincoln often made time to visit with staff and encourage young women, no matter how busy her schedule.  She is a tireless worker and anyone who has that energy and fighting spirit leaves an impression on you. What advice do you have for fellow women in ag, both here at USDA and all across the world?  Find something you love and give it all that you have each day.  Each of us were gifted with different talents and abilities.  Take what you have and pour it into that one thing that is your calling. Invest in relationships and invest in people. We often get so focused on what we’re doing that we forget about how we are treating the people who are walking along side us. At the end of it all, people will remember how you made them feel and not necessarily what you’ve accomplished. It’s easy to get caught up in the “how can I make this happen” rather than how you’re treating and helping other people succeed on your own way to success. To learn more and connect with other women leaders in agriculture across the country, we encourage you to visit newfarmers.usda.gov/women-in-ag.

"Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Mar 03,   Secretary of Agriculture The timing of the School Nutrition Association’s (SNA) annual legislative action conference couldn’t have been better as USDA and the Obama Administration continue working on advancing the reauthorization of the Child Nutrition Act.  I really appreciated the opportunity to address the national organization representing 55,000 school nutrition professionals who are on the front lines of the effort to improve the health and nutrition of our nation’s children. Last month, SNA announced their support for First Lady Michelle Obama’s childhood obesity initiative and agreed to a number of key steps to further improve the nutritional quality of school meals and advance nutrition education for America’s students.  SNA is an important partner in our efforts to improve the health of our children and reduce childhood hunger throughout the country. SNA knows that the answer to improving child nutrition and combating obesity lies in our ability to work together and bring everyone on board this effort.  I am pleased that I could speak with them about joining me as I challenged parents, educators, and community leaders to double the number of HealthierUS Schools across the country in the next year. All have us have a stake in working together to improve the health and nutrition of our children and in turn the future of our nation. Earlier in the week, First Lady Michelle Obama also attended the SNA conference to talk about her Let’s Move! initiative and its focus on raising a generation of kids to be healthy adults. The proposed enhancements to the reauthorization of the Child Nutrition Act that the Obama Administration put forward form the legislative centerpiece of the First Lady’s campaign and our efforts to ensure the health of our youngsters. We are encouraged by the leadership that the School Nutrition Association and others have demonstrated. Looking forward we are excited to work with SNA and other organizations to encourage America’s families to get involved in school nutrition programs and promote physical activity and healthy eating at home.

"Nanostructured Biosensors Detect Pesticide, Help Preserve Environment  When does too much of a good thing become a bad thing? That’s the question Dr. Jonathan Claussen, assistant professor at Iowa State University’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, and his team of researchers aim to help farmers answer when it comes to pesticide use. Underuse can harm farmers’ crops, while overuse can result in runoff into the soil or waterways. Claussen and his team created a flexible, low cost and disposable biosensor that can detect pesticides in soil. This biosensor is made of graphene, a strong and stable nanoparticle, and provides instantaneous feedback, as opposed to the time and money it would otherwise take to send a sample to a lab and await results.

"Puff and Fluff the Owls Return Home Puff and Fluff, the baby owls that Forest Service firefighters saved during the Carstens Fire in June, are finally home. Terri Williams of the Fresno Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Service released the Western Screech-Owls on July 24 near where they were found over a month ago in a downed tree in the Sierra National Forest. The birds were weak and dehydrated when Williams first received them from the Forest Service on June 20.  But under her care, Puff and Fluff tripled in weight, enjoying a steady diet of mice, day-old chicks and crickets. They grew strong and healthy and soon began showing signs that they were ready for release into the wild.

Americans waste enough food every day to fill a 90,000 seat football stadium. Approximately one-third of all food is wasted at the retail and consumer levels.  While research has shown that food wasted by children is similar to the rest of the U.S. population, there are many ways schools can reduce food waste and teach students about the impact it has on the environment and in their community. At Chesterbrook Elementary School in McClean, VA, every student learns how to separate waste into categories like recyclables, food to be donated, upcycling bins, and general trash.  The school’s Eco Team, run by sixth graders, ensures their fellow students are putting waste into the correct bin. The team then collects, weighs, categorizes, and places the food to be donated into separate refrigerators, provided by the Food Bus, a non-profit organization that works with schools to donate food that would otherwise go to waste. At the end of the week, PTA members or community volunteers deliver the food to the local food pantry.  In the - school year, the 12 schools that work with the Food Bus provided 13,502.6 pounds of food to their local food pantries.  These donations included packaged peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, bananas and apples, yogurt, string cheese, containers of apple sauce and sliced peaches, granola bars, and cartons of milk.  The milk is especially welcome by food pantries since they lack other reliable sources for the product. “I’ve taken countless cartons of milk to pantries over the past two years and mothers have taken the milk out of the bags before I have put them into the pantry refrigerator and opened them there on the spot and given them to their children.  Milk is expensive.” says Kathleen Weil, founder of the Food Bus. Food waste and recovery is also incorporated into science lesson plans.  But there are other important takeaways as well according to Weil, “the children in the elementary schools are not only learning how to not throw away their food and add it to the national waste stream, but they’re learning that it can be used by someone who is hungry.  They are getting a little spark of community service now that may have an impact in their life and the lives of the many people around them when they are adults.” Generally, six to eight months are needed to set up a food recovery program through Food Bus.  The process requires arranging for equipment needs, setting up a volunteer system and building a relationship with a local food pantry. It also involves a review of county rules and regulations on donations. In the meantime, schools can curb plate waste with simple changes to school rules, especially in the cafeteria environment.  Studies have found that serving lunch after recess can reduce plate waste by as much as 30 percent.  In the cafeteria, tactics like naming vegetables (i.e. “creamy corn”) can increase its selection by 40 to 70 percent.  Another study, from the Smarter Lunchrooms Movement, found that introducing a “healthy options only” convenience line increased consumption of those nutritious items by 35 percent.  You can find other simple tricks tested by the Smarter Lunchrooms Movement. There are many ways to reduce, recycle, and recover food waste in school cafeterias.  By implementing these ideas, schools play a vital role in scaling back the amount of food taking up precious landfill space.  More importantly, if a school uses food waste as a learning opportunity, it instills better habits in our young people and produces more civic-minded, community-conscious adults. As Anne Rosenbaum, Science Specialist at Haycock Elementary School in Virginia says, “there are some kids who really have an affinity for the food donation.  They want to go to the food pantry to see how it works.  Their parents call in to help volunteer because the kids are so interested.  We laugh because our Eco Team and Eco Patrols get blue rubber gloves so that if they find people who have thrown something in the wrong bin they can put it in the right one.  They take their jobs really seriously.” When your school implements a food recovery program or makes simple changes to increase consumptions and reduce food waste, you can share your story by joining the U.S. Food Waste Challenge. Editor’s Note: Updated on 4 Sept. - USDA’s official estimate of food loss at the retail and consumer level remains 31%, not 33% as cited in the original infographic  (Buzby et al. , The Estimated Amount, Value, and Calories of Postharvest Food Losses at the Retail and Consumer Levels in the United States, Economic Information Bulletin No. 121, 39 pp, February ).

"Trees Give Roads a Breath of Fresh Air  It’s Clean Air Month, and roadside trees are cleaning the air and helping us feel better. If you live in an area where there’s a lot of people and traffic, air quality may have crossed your mind at one point or another—and rightly so. In recent years, the health of people living, working or going to school near roads with high traffic volume has been a quickly rising national concern. All over the world, studies are finding air pollution levels especially elevated in these areas. A multidisciplinary group of researchers, planners and policymakers from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Forest Service and other organizations found that strategically planting trees near busy roadways may significantly enhance air quality.

"Administrator of USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service in  Conservation  Feb 26,  Deputy Secretary Krysta Harden (center, first row) is thanked by AMS Administrator Anne Alonzo (far right, first row) and members of the AMS research and promotion team for speaking at the diversity and inclusion training event on Feb. 18, . USDA photo. USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, Deputy Secretary Krysta Harden, and all of USDA are committed to supporting the next generation of farmers and ranchers and promoting diversity and inclusion in all sectors of agriculture. As Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), I had the pleasure of advancing these important priorities during our Research and Promotion Program (R&P) board diversity and inclusion training session, held in Northern Virginia prior to the Agricultural Outlook Forum. Meeting participants – including more than 50 board members and board staff from 20 of the 22 R&P boards that we oversee, AMS employees, and representatives of Certified Nominating Organizations – gathered to tackle a serious issue: how to recruit talented and diverse board members who are representative of the industries they serve. The R&P boards allow farmers and ranchers to pool their resources and set common goals to develop new markets and strengthen current markets for the commodities they grow or handle. The training focused on recruiting members from the next generation of farmers – people who will ensure that the boards help American agriculture remain an engine of economic opportunity for years to come. National Dairy Board member Brian Medeiros noted that the session “was a great way to bring R&P boards together to share successes and challenges as we work to include younger producers on our promotion Boards.” We heard from a range of exciting presenters – Doug Swanson,  4-H national program manager with USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, led a session on recruitment; Michael Wallace, Walmart’s Director of Global Diversity and Inclusion, discussed unconscious bias and the way that inclusion increases innovation; Deputy Secretary Krysta Harden emphasized how important it is to find and develop new leaders; and Lilia McFarland, USDA’s New and Beginning Farmer and Rancher Coordinator, talked about how USDA resources can help new farmers and ranchers succeed. There was also a panel of board stakeholders who shared recruitment strategies, outreach opportunities, successful inclusion ideas, and best practices for success. The training ended with a roundtable discussion that generated practical ideas for enhancing recruitment and diversity on the boards. As Cotton Board President and Chief Executive Officer William Gillon said, “I left with at least 12 new ideas to bring back to the Cotton Board.  That is a good return.”  And that was what this training was all about – giving the boards the tools they need to recruit talented, diverse, and multi-generational board members. A key step toward this goal is the fundamental recognition that diversity and inclusion make the boards stronger. As United Soybean Board Chief Operating Officer Lisa O’Brien said, “The soy- checkoff family is committed to ensuring the U.S. soy industry thrives for generations to come. That means attracting our farmer-leaders of tomorrow. We can’t do that effectively without making sure that every soybean farmer in the nation knows of the opportunities to serve their industry.” As one meeting participant noted, “If you’re at the table and everyone looks like you, how are you going to get those new ideas?” I look forward to seeing how the boards will implement all that we learned. I also want to emphasize that AMS and USDA are committed to making progress in this area, which is why we created a number of outreach materials to help R&P boards with recruitment. We invite you to find out more by watching a short video on R&P diversity, learn how you can shape the future of agriculture by serving on a research and promotion board, or find out how to be a voice for your industry on one of our other councils, committees and boards.

"APHIS Public Affairs, Riverdale, MD in  Animals  Plants  May 09,   As National Moving Month, May marks the height of the moving season.  It also marks a time of great peril for America’s forests.  Gypsy moths normally get their best chance to spread across the country in May as they hitchhike with people moving or traveling from an infested area to a noninfested area.  This year should be different, however, thanks to an outreach campaign called “Your Move Gypsy Moth-Free” that USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) recently launched. The stakes are high: Gypsy moth caterpillars can defoliate, weaken, and kill more than 300 different types of trees and shrubs.  Since , this dangerous forest pest has defoliated ates.  If left unchecked, an infestation can defoliate up to 13 million acres of trees in one season.  New infestations are typically caused by gypsy moth egg masses that people transport accidentally when moving or traveling from an infested area to a noninfested area.  That’s why APHIS requires these individuals to inspect for and remove gypsy moth egg masses from outdoor household items—before they move. Gypsy moth campaign logo People planning a move can learn all about they need to know at the campaign’s Web site, YourMoveGypsyMothFree.com.  They can download a brochure there that has pictures of all the gypsy moth life stages and instructions on how to remove the egg masses to ensure a move that’s gypsy moth-free. Fortunately, it’s easy to stop the spread of gypsy moth.  Just inspect your vehicles and all outdoor household goods for egg masses and remove them.  Female gypsy moths lay their egg masses on just about any outdoor surface: vehicles, yard tools, playground equipment, outdoor toys, grills, lawn furniture, camping gear, and the like.  Remove the egg masses with a putty knife or a stiff brush and dispose of them in a container of hot, soapy water, or placed them in a plastic bag, seal it, and set it in the sun. The brochure has a checklist to make this as simple as possible.  Check off each item as you go through the checklist and then sign it.  You can also hire a state-licensed pesticide applicator to do the inspection for you.  The signed checklist becomes your official inspection certificate for the move. Federal law requires that people moving from a moth-infested area to a noninfested area carry this certificate during the move.  Keep a copy of the completed checklist in the moving van in case it is requested by a State or Federal official at any point during your trip.  This completed checklist will satisfy the requirements of all noninfested States.  It will also relieve you of liability should your items be re-inspected by a State official in the destination State—and be found to harbor gypsy moth.

"PhD, RDN, Director of Nutrition Security and Health Equity, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Equity  Mar 27,  USDA is proud to celebrate the second anniversary of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack’s vision to advance food and nutrition security. This first-of-its-kind, whole-of-department approach uses a four-pillar approach, working across USDA’s eight mission areas. These pillars include:  Providing nutrition support from pregnancy to birth and beyond;  Connecting everyone in this country with healthy, safe, affordable foods  Developing, translating, and enacting nutrition science through partnership; and  Prioritizing equity every step of the way. Leveraging the momentum of the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, we are also doing our part to implement the National Strategy (, 201 ) on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. This whole-of-society strategy was designed to end hunger, improve nutrition and physical activity, and reduce diet-related diseases and disparities. And the Biden-Harris Administration remains focused on the Strategy. At a recent White House event, partners pledged nearly $1.7 billion in new commitments cultivated through the White House Challenge to End Hunger and Build Healthy Communities. Our efforts to advance food and nutrition security also integrates the Secretary’s goal to make MyPlate a household name. As I explain in this video, MyPlate has been our national symbol for healthy eating for more than a decade. MyPlate.gov provides the guidance, tools, and resources that translate the - Dietary into actionable steps anyone can use. We are making our MyPlate materials more culturally, contextually, and linguistically responsive. And we work with more than rategic Partners across a variety of sectors to use common messages to communicate to consumers that it’s never too early or too late to start eating healthy. We even launched a MyPlate Instagram, which is loaded with healthy eating tips and recipes. Agriculture Secretary Vilsack Celebrates Progress on Tackling Food and Nutrition Insecurity As we celebrate the power of nutritious food, we are proud of all we’ve accomplished over the last two years, but we know we can do more and do better, together. Please explore our innovative tools and stay connected. We look forward to working together to help everyone in this country access nutrition education through MyPlate.

"Deputy Under Secretary for Food Safety in  Health and Safety  Apr 07,   Everyone involved in the farm to table continuum has an interest in making our food safe to eat.  Because safe food is important to consumers around the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) has picked Food Safety as the theme of World Health Day . Today, April 7th, as we observe World Health Day, it is important to take a moment to reflect on what a safe food supply means globally and domestically. WHO estimates that unsafe food causes 2 million deaths each year, with 1,ates.  Here at USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), we focus on food safety day in and day out, working around the clock to prevent foodborne illness and protect public health. In the United States, we are fortunate to have one of the safest food supplies in the world. In the last eight years, the U.S. has seen a decrease in the number of foodborne illnesses with 50,000 fewer reported illnesses since . This decrease is the result of our work to develop innovative ways of educating consumers about safe food handling, our efforts to modernize how we inspect food, and the work we have done with establishments to prevent bacteria from contaminating food. We are committed to using an inspection system based in science—science that derives from the work of researchers and public health experts.  It is important to remember how far we’ve come, but our work is not done. Modernization is the key to our approach.  From research to consumer education, modernization influences all the program areas at FSIS. Last week, FSIS released its new FoodKeeper smart phone application. The FoodKeeper application offers users valuable storage advice about nearly 500 food and beverage items. By providing information on proper storage times and cooking tips, FSIS can help consumers protect themselves and their loved ones from foodborne illness.  The application is available for Android and Apple devices. Since December , FSIS has declared that reducing illnesses due to Salmonella is its number one priority. We have been working to meet the goals of our Salmonella Action Plan, developed as our blueprint to combat Salmonellosis, the foodborne illness that is most associated with the products we regulate. Meat, poultry, and processed egg products contribute to one-third of Salmonellosis cases in this country today. USDA is putting in place tighter Salmonella standards on the poultry industry than ever before to target, not just some, but all strains of Salmonella of human health concern. Other measures include requiring companies to do additional testing, placing inspectors in more strategic locations in food facilities, and testing parts such as breasts and wings rather than only whole birds.  In , there were nearly 33,000 fewer cases of Salmonella from USDA regulated products. We believe that the implementation of these standards will have a major impact on public health, preventing an estimated 50,000 illnesses annually. As our food supply becomes increasingly global, it is vital that food safety remain a topic of conversation among industry, our international partners, and the public. FSIS, working with our partners in the United States and around the world, is accountable for preventing foodborne illness for over 300 million Americans and many consumers worldwide. USDA FSIS stands with WHO today and every day in ensuring that from farm to plate, food is safe and nutritious.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Michigan in  Conservation  Sep 30,  A research boat operated by Ohio State University’s Stone Laboratory, takes a group of Michigan farmers to the research facility on Gibraltar Island on Lake Erie. NRCS photo. Michigan farmers heard firsthand from experts about the water quality issues facing Lake Erie as well as the importance of conservation work to cleaning water. A group of ate University’s Stone Laboratory on Gibraltar Island in Lake Erie. The tour was held in late summer, not long after 500,000 people in the Toledo area were forced to spend days without public drinking water. Toledo’s water supply was determined unsafe because of the presence of microcystin, which is produced by algae blooms caused by phosphorus loading to the lake. Large amounts of nutrients like phosphorous cause algae to grow rapidly; when it dies, it removes oxygen from the water, posing threats to water quality. Toledo draws its drinking water from the part of Lake Erie where large algae blooms have formed in recent years. Amy Gilhouse, a technician with the Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program, coordinated the tour. MAEAP is a voluntary program created by governmental and agricultural organizations that allows farmers to certify that their operations incorporate sound environmental practices. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and the Michigan Farm Bureau helped fund the tour, and USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) provided support by sending a local conservationist to share information about available programs. “Taking people out on Lake Erie to fish was my dad’s passion,” said Gilhouse, who grew up in a family of fisherman. “My mother was one of the first women with a fishing charter captain’s license on the Great Lakes.” A clean lake is critical for vibrant fisheries, she said. On the tour, farmers not only heard from Kendrick Flowers, a district conservationist with NRCS, but from Jeffrey Reutter, the laboratory’s director, as well. Phosphorous has been a problem in the lake for years, he said. Reutter said environmental efforts reduced the amount of phosphorus entering the lake by two-thirds, primarily through improved sewage treatment. At the time, most of the phosphorus entering the lake was believed to come from sewage. Now, fertilizer runoff is one of the main contributors of phosphorus to the lake that triggers algae blooms, he said. One of the farmers attending the tour was Jerry Heck. Heck farms 700 acres of corn, soybeans and wheat and his field drains go directly to Lake Erie. He has installed filters strips, practices no-till on most of his land and recently installed water control structures on his field tile outlets utilizing financial assistance from NRCS. Heck also does soil testing and uses variable rate application to reduce his use of fertilizers and lime. “Even though we’ve been studying Lake Erie for 40 years, there’s a lot we still don’t understand,” Heck said. Reutter said more research is needed as well as more conservation work needs to be adopted. “Municipalities, industry and agriculture are all being encouraged to reduce impacts by 40 percent,” Gilhouse said. “Michigan farmers are taking action by moving their farms to MAEAP verification and implementing more conservation practices.” Just recently, NRCS made available $2 million for farmers in Ohio wanting to plant cover crops, one of the main conservation practices that will help prevent runoff. Over the past five years, USDA has worked with landowners, community leaders and members of Congress to invest about $46 million targeted to restore and protect the Great Lakes. Just this year, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack designated the Great Lakes Basin as a critical conservation area, or CCA, in the new Farm Bill Regional Conservation Partnership Program, which will invest an additional $1.2 billion through conservation partnership projects to improve water quality and quantity.

(USDA Photo)  As America’s leadership role in the global economy increases, shipments of American grain, oil seeds, and related agricultural products could continue expanding into promising markets in some of the world’s most robust economies. Facilitating the marketing of U.S. grain exports by thorough inspection and weight certification in accordance with Federal law is the job of the Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyard Administration (GIPSA) through its Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS). A team of dedicated professionals located around the country ensures that America remains competitive in the world agricultural market by upholding the quality of U.S. grain as well as the integrity of U.S. grading standards. Working shifts around the clock in export elevators loading ocean vessels and in interior locations loading shipping containers along the Great Lakes, the Gulf of Mexico, on coastal and other locations, FGIS personnel along with delegated states and designated agencies inspect and weigh grain arriving daily by truck, rail, and barge for domestic markets and export by cargo ships. Once loading is complete, FGIS inspectors provide an official certificate backed by the reputation and authority of the U.S. Government. Having recently visited FGIS facilities at the Ports of Houston and New Orleans, I witnessed FGIS inspectors work meticulously at export elevators to guarantee that inspections are conducted in the most effective manner possible. I was extremely impressed by the efficiency of FGIS personnel. Not only are they exceedingly aware of their role in facilitating international shipments of U.S. grains, but they are also dedicated to the economic prosperity of American farmers by certifying that the quality of U.S. grains remains of the highest standard in the world. The accuracy of FGIS inspections is currently 96.9 percent and FGIS scientists and staff continuously seek to improve performance. At the National Grain Center in Kansas City, Missouri sophisticated grain testing and innovative exploration to improve grain quality assurance are ongoing. Last year FGIS staff and its partners from delegated states and agencies facilitated more than 3 million inspections on 298 million metric tons of grain and oil seeds with 126 million metric tons of exports totaling over $45 billion—at a cost-effective rate of one penny per bushel.  As America’s trade integration expands throughout the world, GIPSA and its team of grain inspectors and scientists offer a promising platform for continued economic growth for rural America.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Sep 18,  The very existence of frogs worldwide is being threatened by a killer fungus. Photo Credit: National Science Foundation A lethal fungus is killing frogs and other water-dwelling amphibians all over the world, but a team of international scientists led by U.S. Forest Service scientist Deanna Olson is working to understand why. Olson, who works at the agency’s Pacific Northwest Research Station, and her colleagues have the daunting task of tracking the disease, known as the amphibian chytrid fungus. Unlike the clearly visible white-nose syndrome killing bats in the U.S., the frog fungus cannot be seen except with a microscope. That makes scientists’ jobs that much more difficult. Since the discovery of the malady is so recent, scientists still don’t understand a great deal about the fungus except that it affects the skin and ultimately leads to cardiac arrest in amphibians. Scientists fear the fungus could mean the possible extinction of entire frog species and other amphibians. These creatures are an integral part of the world’s ecosystem providing a bridge between dry land and water. They are the proverbial canary in the coal mine for the health of aquatic systems worldwide. With this in mind, scientists have assembled an online international database with more than 36,000 records of amphibians that were sampled at more than 4,000 sites. Olson is hopeful that this international mapping network of scientists will see success in understanding this disease. The project, called Bd-Maps, got under way in . “This is allowing us to track what we know about this disease, which has been implicated in mass mortality events as well as some extinction at the global scale,” Olson said. Plotting geographically on both a global and country scale allows the team to see where the fungus is and is not present, and where it has or has not been tested in the animals. Anyone can upload their to the site, and Olson’s team updates it annually to make sure it reflects the latest findings in the field.

"Public Information Coordinator, Minnesota Rural Development in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Dec 10,  Hillside Farmers Co-op in Minnesota is helping Latino farmers plan farm businesses and cooperatively market pastured poultry and other products. The Hillside Farmers Co-op has some big goals for Latino farmers in southeastern Minnesota. With the help of a Small, Socially Disadvantaged Producer Grant (SSDPG) from USDA’s Rural Development, Hillside Farmers Co-op has taken another step toward reaching some of those goals. In Minnesota, Latino workers employed in agriculture in the south-central region of the state added nearly $25 million to the local economy according to a report by the Minneapolis Foundation. And, as they begin to represent a greater share of the producer population, access to land and capital, as well as language differences, can represent barriers to entry into farming and ownership of farm property. Hillside Farmers Co-op is a partnership between Latino farmers, including recent immigrants, and establishedfarmers in southeastern Minnesota who, together, are committed to producing sustainable foods and building healthier communities. The co-op pairs immigrant families with established farmers in the area who rent out their land for gardening and poultry production. The SSDPG will help the co-op conduct a feasibility study, develop a business plan, provide training and help pay for other related expenses in developing a coordinated network of local businesses in the free-range poultry industry. The primary objective of the SSDPG program is to provide technical assistance to small, socially-disadvantaged agricultural producers through eligible cooperatives and associations of cooperatives. This is the first SSDPG awarded in Minnesota. For recent immigrants with a background in agriculture who would prefer not to leave the land, Hillside Farmers Co-op provides the support necessary to realize their dreams of continuing to farm. Hillside Farmers Co-op hopes to tap into the farming expertise that folks bring with them to the United Statesto develop small-scale sustainable farms that are competitive in a regional economy in Minnesota. The project also aims to help Latino families increase income, improve their community, eat healthier and develop valuable leadership skills. “We did not come into this with the perspective that someone else will do this for us,” said Reginaldo (Regi) Haslett-Marroquin, director of the Rural Enterprise Center (a program of the nonprofit Main Street Project) in Northfield, Minn. Regi provides technical assistance and guidance to co-op members. “We’ve got all these ideas and all of this experience, but we need to turn it into something more competitive.” So far, Hillside Farmers Co-op “agripreneurs” have sold about 35,000 chickens. As each farmer continues to gain experience and train other agripreneurs, Regi envisions the co-op expanding into grains, vegetables, medicinal herbs, soil composting and other areas. “I didn’t think this would ever be possible,” said Maria Sosa, Hillside Farmers Co-op Chair. “Now it seems possible with hard work and a little bit of investment.” Poultry allows for quick turnaround times from chick to market, which means families can earn some income relatively quickly and possibly end up in a position to purchase their own land and develop their own farms. The key is convincing people that it can happen. “We’ve been successful early and people see that,” Regi said. “We feel our vision will result in an economic model that empowers people and changes communities.” Chickens raised by co-op farms are free-range and are fed without antibiotics. As much as possible, the birds are fed with grains and grasses raised directly on co-op farms. “Hillside Farmers Co-op is the ideal recipient for the first SSDPG in Minnesota,” said Colleen Landkamer, USDA Rural Development State Director. “I believe Hillside Farmers Co-op is helping create the next generation of Latino farmers and entrepreneurs that will compete in today’s global economy.”  Category/Topic:  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Tags:  KYF2  Minnesota  Rural Development  Rural Enterprise Center  Small Socially Disadvantaged Producer Grant  USDA Rural Development State Director","Here is a concise question related to the content: What innovative approach does Hillside Farmers Co-op in Minnesota use to support Latino farmers and empower them to establish small-scale sustainable farms, while addressing barriers such as access to land and capital?","Hillside Farmers Co-op in Minnesota uses an innovative approach by pairing recent immigrant families with established farmers who rent out their land for gardening and poultry production, providing training, business planning, and technical assistance through a Small Socially Disadvantaged Producer Grant (SSDPG) from USDA's Rural Development."
"An Airport is No Place for an Owl  Seeing a short-eared owl in November on the Pittsburgh International Airport, where I work as an airport wildlife biologist, was a unique occasion. However, as the number of owls grew to eight, I recognized the challenge ahead:  Like all birds of prey, short-eared owls are a recognized potential aviation hazard. Their low rolling flight and difficult-to-disperse reputation means they pose an aviation safety threat.  From -, short-eared owl strikes with aircraft in the United States caused over $1 million in damage, and often are fatal to the birds.  Convincing them to leave would be difficult but important. The task would be harder because short-eared owls are listed by the State as an endangered species.  Common in many areas globally, Pennsylvania is the southernmost edge of their breeding range.  These owls likely migrated from Canadian breeding grounds to winter in Pennsylvania.

"Import Meat Inspector for USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, Sweet Grass, Montana in  Health and Safety  Nov 23,   Several months ago, I was selected to participate in a meat processing project that took me from Great Falls, Montana to Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia.   I went under the auspices of the Citizens Network for Foreign Affairs (CNFA) – an organization supported by USAID – to offer advice on the methods and benefits of meat processing technology, as well as basic food safety skills.   Early on in my visit, I came to understand the rich history and culture of this nation, which leant a heavy influence over their methods and approaches toward meat processing – the ax and chopping-block method of cutting meat stuck out as a preferred taste for Georgians.  This is not a criticism, rather a tip-of-the-hat to their cultural awareness. The company I met with had multifaceted production processes, which ran the gamut from ready-to-eat product, fresh-cut meats, to production-line ready sausage recipes.  In observing their techniques, I saw an opportunity to impart some knowledge and experience I have gained as an FSIS inspector. A significant part of my duties include preventing foodborne illness, so I wanted to discuss the importance of food safety – a recurring theme and mission for FSIS.  We were able to talk about our testing protocols for Salmonella and E.coli, share statistics that illustrate the positive impact of our respective efforts, and help one another better understand how to further reduce the threat of food borne illness. My takeaway from this visit was multifold.  Most significantly, it was a reflection of the advancement in our efforts to improve food safety inspection methods, but also that as an inspector I can confidently say our promise to safeguarding the public is working and the message is spreading throughout the world.

"NRCS Massachusetts Intern in  Conservation  Sep 16,  NRCS District Conservationist Rita Thibodeau (left) points out minnows swimming in a pond that was part of Peter Talmage’s wetland restoration project. (Photo by Jonathan Tokarz, NRCS intern) When Peter Talmage’s career as a professor of renewable energy and energy efficiency brought him from Maine to a college in Greenfield, Mass. with his wife and son, he knew that he wanted to enhance the beauty of the land that they bought in nearby Northfield and improve it as wildlife habitat. So when his wife, Chris, heard about a USDA program that would guarantee its protection and provide help in restoring wetlands on the property, they were sold. Through the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service’s Wetlands Reserve Program, Peter and Chris protected 3 ½ of 12 acres under a permanent conservation easement. They received technical and financial help reshaping wetlands that had long ago been converted to farmland. That project brought me to Talmages’ land, walking amid the waving grass and wildflowers surrounded by the sounds of chirping, buzzing, and croaking coming from thriving marshes. We were joined by District Conservationist Rita Thibodeau, of the NRCS field office in Greenfield, Mass., who helped Peter and Chris develop a conservation plan for their land and apply for the wetlands program. “The blue heron was the first one in,” Peter Talmage told us, explaining how wildlife began appearing after the wetland was created. The heron was looking for minnows that now populate the pond. The restored wetlands have already attracted a variety of waterfowl, turtles, moose, crayfish and countless beneficial bugs and insects. The sharp increase in wildlife is no accident. The wetlands were designed to have a variety of water depths to accommodate a diversity of wetland creatures. The marsh edges slope gradually to provide habitat for wading birds and frogs. The deeper portions of the marshes will hold water when others nearby have long since dried out. It’s part of a larger plan to provide habitat for wildlife. “We don’t mow until the end of July early August because of ground nesting birds. There are birds everywhere, all species,” said Peter, referring to the surrounding grasslands. When I asked why he was willing to set aside his land for conservation, Peter explained, “We believe in conservation. We try to minimize our impact on the environment and enhance it for other species. It was our desire to renew and restore the environment.” Over the winter, Peter and Chris invited the neighborhood kids over for ice skating on the frozen surfaces of the marshes. That’s how the work of one concerned citizen can benefit plants, insects, animals and humans alike. Follow NRCS on Twitter. Check out other conservation-related stories on the USDA blog.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Health and Safety  Technology  Apr 18,  A Washington State University-led research team member works on the prototype microwave assisted pasteurization system (MAPS) unit. MAPS allows packaged foods to be safely processed more quickly and at lower cost than conventional processes. Photo courtesy of Washington State University. During the month of April we will take a closer look at USDA’s Groundbreaking Research for a Revitalized Rural America, highlighting ways USDA researchers are improving the lives of Americans in ways you might never imagine, like innovative ways to make food safer. More than 90 percent of American households have microwave ovens where people heat their food, yet this same technology is seldom used for large-scale production in the food industry. As home cooks know, microwave ovens do not excel at heating food evenly.  The lack of commercial-scale microwave processing technology is, in part, due to the challenge of designing equipment that is capable of pasteurization – heating all of the food evenly to a predetermined temperature for a certain length of time.  Pasteurization makes food safe to eat, by inactivating bacterial and viral pathogens that can make people sick. Food safety is the top priority for the food industry and has long been one of the priority research areas for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).  With the help of a $5 million grant from NIFA, a team of scientists and engineers led by Washington State University (WSU) have developed an innovative, pilot-scale microwave assisted pasteurization system (MAPS) to rapidly and evenly heat packaged food products.  The team included University of Tennessee, North Carolina State University, the U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center, and USDA’s Agricultural Research Service Eastern Regional Research Center. The prototype is a 915 MHz microwave that processes foods that are both safe and of high quality.  Initial results show that the quality of microwave-pasteurized foods, such as mussels, shrimp, and tofu, is better than using conventional thermal processing methods. An additional benefit to this technology is that microwave heating time is shorter than conventional thermal processing, and the shorter time means producing higher food quality at lower energy output and cost. Food companies can now use MAPS to test a wide range of food products and adapt the technology to suit their needs. WSU anticipates licensing this technology to a start-up company, Food Chain Safety, for commercialization in the coming months. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues that impact people’s daily lives and the nation’s future.  More information is available at www.nifa.usda.gov.

"NRCS Ohio in  Conservation  Nov 28,  Mallory McDevitt of Wapakoneta, Ohio in her one-acre organic garden. Mallory McDevitt of Wapakoneta, Ohio, is a real go-getter. This 18-year-old high school senior has been an Earth Team Volunteer with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) since she was 14. She also serves as the Wapakoneta FFA Chapter Vice President. As if school, FFA and volunteer activities weren’t enough, McDevitt also owns and operates her own business, Mal’s Garden and Landscaping. She manages and operates a one-acre organic garden, both selling and donating her produce. For her extraordinary gardening accomplishments, McDevitt was awarded first place by Ohio FFA in the Proficiency Awards, Vegetable Production Category. She went on to take the category at the National FFA conference! When the Feds Feed Families food drive, the federal government’s annual summer-long effort to donate food to those in need, was announced this year, McDevitt saw an opportunity to help, and offered to coordinate the food drive for NRCS’ Wapakoneta Field Office. McDevitt worked with the organization that would receive the donations, Mercy Unlimited, Inc., of Wapakoneta and delivered the food collections to them weekly. She also charted weekly progress toward the office’s goal of collecting 500 lbs. of canned food so everyone could see how they were doing. McDevitt also challenged herself to match the field office’s canned donations with an equal amount (in weight) of fresh produce from her garden. Anyone who has ever gardened, particularly using organic methods, knows the work that goes into growing that quantity of food. It requires a lot of know-how, patience, perseverance and labor to have even a small productive garden, let alone an entire acre. But for McDevitt, the personal challenge made it even more interesting. And seeing the joy others experience from her generosity and effort is tremendously rewarding. Ultimately, the Wapakoneta Field Office donated almost 600 lbs. of canned products to the Feds Feed Families effort, and Mallory donated 612 lbs. of her produce—mostly tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, melons and peppers. After the food drive ended, Mallory continued to donate the fruits of her labor for the rest of the garden season—which ended up being an additional 304 lbs.! In , more than 30,000 Earth Team volunteers donated 641,735 hours of service to NRCS estimated to be worth $13.4 million.

People had flying, self-driven “cars” and robotic housekeepers.

Her father, George Jetson, savored the two small bites filled with flavor and nutrition. This meal satisfied him completely. I couldn’t then imagine that futuristic dinner scene being a reality, and I still don’t. But technology, science, and marketing have changed the way we produce our food and have altered the structure of farming. tell us so. Let’s look at milk as an example. According to the Census of Agriculture, there were 6.8 million farms on 1.05 billion acres with an average size of 155 acres on January 1, , just 2 years before the establishment of what is now National Dairy Month. In , 24.6 million milking cows on 5.2 million farms produced 10.7 billion gallons of milk. That’s 84 gallons a year or 1.6 gallons each week for each of the 126.ates. If each of the cows were milked every day, each would have produced about 433.9 gallons per year or about 1.2 gallons per cow each day. Eighty-three years later, the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), which conducts the Census of Agriculture today, documented in the Census of Agriculture that there were 2.0 million farms on 900 million acres with an average size of 441 acres. In , 54,599 farms had 9.5 million milk cows. A separate milk production report published by NASS showed that 8.7 million cows in the top 23 milk producing states produced 202.5 billion pounds of milk or 23.5 billion gallons in . That’s ates. Each cow produced about 2,695 gallons per year or about 7.4 gallons per cow each day. Milk is used for making cheese, butter, ice cream, and yogurt in addition to drinking milk and other dairy products. According to the International Dairy Foods Association, National Dairy Month started out as National Milk Month in as a way to promote drinking milk. It was initially created to stabilize the dairy demand when production was at a surplus. While we can supplement our nutrition in a pill, we still rely on actual agriculture for our food. Thanks to agricultural innovations, we have seen remarkable increases in production efficiency to feed a growing global population. Technology, science and marketing have transformed the dairy industry.

According to new , there are now 21,ates and 31,160 around the world.""Organic food is one of the fasting growing segments of American agriculture,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""As consumer demand for organic products continues to grow, the USDA organic seal has become a leading global standard. The increasing number of organic operations shows that USDA's strong support for the vibrant organic sector is helping to create jobs and opportunities in rural communities.""According to released by the Agricultural Marketing Service's (AMS) National Organic Program (NOP), the number of domestic certified organic operations increased by almost 12 percent between and , representing the highest growth rate since and an increase of nearly 300 percent since the count began in . The total retail market for organic products is now valued at more than $ates and over $75 billion worldwide.Along with consumer demand for organics, increasingly they are asking for local foods. Under Secretary Vilsack, USDA has supported providing consumers a stronger connection to their food with more than $1 billion in investments to over 40,000 local and regional food businesses and infrastructure projects since between . Industry estimates that U.S. local food sales totaled at least $12 billion in , up from $5 billion in . More information on how USDA investments are connecting producers with consumers and expanding rural economic opportunities is available in Chapter IV of USDA Results on Medium published today.USDA has strengthened programs that support organic operations over the past seven years, helping to make organic certification more accessible, attainable, and affordable through a ""Sound and Sensible"" approach. This initiative includes streamlining the certification process, focusing on enforcement and working with farmers and processors to correct small issues before they become larger ones.USDA has also established a number of resources to help organics producers find technical and financial resources to help them grow domestically and abroad. The site www.usda.gov/organic creates a one-stop-shop for operators, and USDA has made market and pricing information for approximately 250 organic products available free of charge through USDA's Market News. In , USDA made more than $11.5 million available to assist organic operations with their certification costs.The NOP maintains the list of organic operations and leads activities that support organic integrity and market growth. In addition, USDA helps organic stakeholders access programs that support conservation, provide access to loans and grants, fund organic research and education, and mitigate threats from pests and diseases. USDA also administers organic certification cost-share programs that offset the costs of organic certification for U.S. producers and handlers.The announced today are publicly available as part of the recently launched Organic Integrity Database, a modernized system for tracking certified organic operations. In the past, USDA published an updated list of certified organic operations once each year. With the new database, made possible by the Farm Bill, organic certifiers can add new operations and report changes to existing operations at any time, allowing USDA to report updated counts of certified organic operations throughout the year. The modernized system will provide for market research, enable stakeholders to identify market opportunities and make supply chain connections, support international verification of operator status to facilitate trade, and establish technology connections with certifiers to share more accurate and timely .Additional information about USDA resources and support for the organic sector is available on the USDA Organics Resource page.Since , USDA has focused significant and targeted investments in America's rural communities to bring transformative change to millions of rural businesses and families, demonstrating USDA's efforts to help farmers and ranchers bring their products to tables domestically and abroad, build critical infrastructure in America's rural areas, conserve our nation's natural resources through long-lasting partnerships, and continuously work toward improving the lives of all Americans.

"& Mary Harris, Public Affairs Specialists-USDA Food Safety Mobile Program in  Health and Safety  Nov 08,   As the nation’s capitol geared up for Halloween and midterm elections, the USDA Food Safety Discovery Zone (FSDZ) was equally busy at the end of October spreading its Be Food Safe messages to Washington, D.C. residents and tourists. In just one week, the FSDZ hosted a Food Safety Education Camp on Gallaudet University’s campus for students from Kendall Demonstration Elementary School and Maryland School for the Deaf, followed by an exhibit at the Marine Corps Marathon Health and Fitness Expo by GE, where over 100,000 health-conscious participants were ready to learn illness prevention measures. The goal of the USDA Food Safety Education Camp is to reach out to young children about food safety, and the trip to Gallaudet University proved to be a success. This camp was especially meaningful and worthwhile for the FSDZ staff, and more than 70 students, teachers, and parents learned the importance of food safety through storytelling, the Food Safety Soccer Game, and the Food Safety Wheel Game. The students, familiar with nutritious lunches, were intrigued by the additional importance of using a cold pack or thermos to keep food at a safe temperature. The Food Safety and Inspection Service continues to reach out to deaf and hearing impaired consumers with its SignFSIS food safety videos in American Sign Language, which can be accessed here. Just a few days later, the FSDZ was one of the biggest attractions at the Marine Corps Marathon Health and Fitness Expo. With its prime location near the main entrance, the mobile was the first stop for thousands of runners and volunteers supporting the Marine Corps. After taking a brief tour with her family, one avid runner exclaimed, “I’m glad I took my family in there, I’ve never seen anything like this. I’m going to tell some of my friends to visit because it’s good information.” If you haven’t seen the USDA Food Safety Discovery Zone and its staff in action, the final event for the tour will be at the National Science Teachers Association Baltimore Area Conference, to be held at the Baltimore Convention Center on November 11-13, . On Thursday, November 11, the event will be from 11:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. On Friday, November 12, the hours will be from 9:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m. The event will conclude on Saturday, November 13, from 9:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m. We hope to see you there!

Photo by Amber Kerr. All this month we will be taking a look at what a changing climate means to Agriculture. The ten regional USDA Climate Hubs were established to synthesize and translate climate science and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers that are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA's Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate."" There are many ways that farmers can use plant cover to mitigate and adapt to climate change. To learn climate-smart practices, farmers can turn to resources like USDA’s Plant Materials Center in Lockeford, California (CAPMC) which is one of 25 PMCs nationwide.  Established in the ’s to help with plant-based tools to combat the Dust Bowl, the PMCs test, develop, and deploy plant mixtures and cultivars to solve conservation challenges.  These challenges include soil erosion, water and air pollution, riparian degradation, loss of wildlife habitat – and now, climate change. The basic idea is to emulate some of the useful features of natural ecosystems: diverse plant species, permanent cover in all seasons, and healthy soil rich in organic matter and biota.  Not only can these features increase resilience to climate variability and extreme weather, they usually have side benefits of increasing soil carbon and even increasing crop yields.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution, which is why PMCs work to develop locally appropriate options. Sid Davis, Assistant State Soil Scientist, National Resources Conservation Service, Davis, CA, demonstrates the root system of perennial Berber orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) at the Lockeford Plant Materials Center, March . Photo by Amber Kerr. One such option is pollinator-friendly cover crops.  In California, many fruits and vegetables (such as almonds, cherries, melons, and tomatoes) depend on pollinators to achieve good yields. Honeybees and other pollinators have recently experienced serious declines due to a still-unknown combination of factors that may include pesticides, mites, habitat loss, and climate. CAPMC evaluates plantings of “pollinator mixes” developed by partners including Project Apis M and the Xerces Society.  The PMC tests the effectiveness of the plant mixes for California farmers’ production systems.  Not only can this help bees thrive in a changing climate, the bees may return the favour with native bees helping buffer crops against environmental variability. Another example of climate-smart agriculture for California is enhancing soil organic matter in rangelands through practices such as compost application and use of deep-rooted perennial grasses.  Starting in on a site planted to several different pasture grasses, CAPMC is participating in state-wide trials that will examine the effect of experimental compost application on soil carbon, forage productivity, and other parameters of pasture quality and soil health.  Not only can soil carbon help mitigate climate change; it can increase soil moisture, helping ranchers weather drought conditions. The California Climate Sub Hub is developing a partnership with CAPMC to highlight the known benefits of some of these conservation practices, and to seek farmer input where concerns arise – for example, ensuring orchard cover crops do not take needed moisture from the trees. Climate-smart agriculture is intended to benefit not only the land itself, but the producers who depend on it.

"Administrator, USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 11,  WIC nutritionists discuss healthy food choices with program participants and children. USDA’s nutrition assistance programs provide access to a healthy diet for millions of eligible Americans each month. Whether in schools, community feeding sites, or in households across the country, they comprise a nutrition safety net to ensure that no eligible American goes hungry. In my opinion the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, better known as “WIC,” is indeed a special program. It provides supplemental foods to our most vulnerable -- infants, pregnant, breastfeeding and postpartum women, and children up to age five who are at nutritional risk.  WIC also provides referrals to social and health care services and nutrition education, including breastfeeding promotion and support. And it’s working, as a new USDA report on WIC Participant and Program Characteristics released today shows. Researchers found, for example, that breastfeeding among WIC participants increased by four percentage points in two years.  Among WIC state agencies that reported breastfeeding for , 67 percent of all 6- to 13-month-old infants were currently breastfed or were breastfed at some time, compared with 63 percent in , the last time a participant profile study was conducted. In fact, breastfeeding among WIC participants has been steadily increasing since , and this year, for the first time, the percentage of breastfeeding women exceeded that of non-breastfeeding, postpartum women. That’s a good thing because breastfeeding is the optimal method of feeding infants, as it provides positive health benefits for both the mother and child. And WIC is reaching those in need -- low-income mothers and children at nutritional risk. Among the over 9 million WIC participants who reported incomes, nearly three-quarters had incomes below the federal poverty level, as compared to 15 percent of the U.S. population. The great majority of those enrolled in WIC were infants and children under the age of five, and more than half of all WIC participants were less than 3 years of age. Good news, too, is that child obesity has begun to decline among WIC participants. In , 15.3 percent of WIC children who were one year old were considered overweight compared with 16.8 percent in . Similarly, for children ages two to four, 14.7 percent were overweight in compared with 14.0 percent in . The Centers for Disease Control looked into this more closely using mostly WIC from 43 States and territories on 2 to 4 year old children for to . They found that reversing the previous upward trend, 19 States/territories had significant reduction in obesity and 21 showed no increase, with only 3 showing an increase. WIC is helping to shape the future of our country in a vital way by providing expectant and nursing mothers and young children the nutrition they need for healthy birth outcomes or, in the case of the young ones, to grow up healthy and strong. In fact, earlier research has shown that WIC has been playing in important role in improving birth outcomes, including fewer premature births, and containing healthcare costs.  This is a program that is not only providing nutrition to low income families, but reducing infant mortality and truly creating a Healthier Next Generation.

"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication in  Forestry  Nov 11,  The 65-foot white fir that will be this year's Capitol Christmas Tree is loaded onto its flatbed truck by two cranes after being harvested Nov. 5. Prior to its harvesting on the Stanislaus National Forest in California, an elder from the Tuolumne Band of Me-wuk Indians blessed the majestic tree and its journey in a private ceremony. (U.S. Forest Service photo) The 65-foot white fir from California’s Stanislaus National Forest was harvested and embarked on its journey toward the nation’s capitol on Nov. 5. While this is the fourth time California will provide the Capitol Christmas Tree, it is the first time that the Forest Service has partnered with a local American Indian tribe to bless the tree. Prior to its harvesting on the Stanislaus, an elder from the Tuolumne Band of Me-wuk Indians blessed the splendid tree and its journey in a private ceremony. After the blessing, local businesses and arborists teamed up to lift the tree and set it on a double flatbed truck that will eventually deliver it to Washington, D.C. on Nov. 28. But first, the tree started its in-state tour in Sonora, Calif. where it was met with various exhibits, booths and activities. Many attendees signed the tree’s “Christmas card to the nation,” a huge banner that will be hung and displayed on the flatbed truck during the 4,500-mile cross-country road trip. After visiting communities in California, the tree will head east. During its 20-day trip, it will make a total of 23 stops in nine states, including New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. “For the next couple of months, this majestic white fir from the Stanislaus National Forest will be one of the most photographed trees in the world,” said Maria Benech, U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree coordinator. The tree will be “an internationally recognized symbol of the holiday season.” Upon its arrival, the tree will be lowered about five feet into the grounds of the Capitol’s west lawn and the Capitol Grounds crew will spend about one week decorating the tree with thousands of ornaments, which are handmade by residents of the Golden State. In fact, community efforts play a critical role in this annual holiday project. When Speaker of the House John Boehner lights the tree on Dec. 6, he will be accompanied by Johnny Crawford, a 7-year-old from Sonora, Calif., the lucky child whose name was randomly drawn for the event. Additionally at the tree lighting ceremony, Californian singers Kate Wallace and Annie J. Dahlgren will perform their original song called “Peace, Peace, Peace,” and Californian Marc Davis’s original photograph titled “Granite Ablaze,” which depicts his interpretation of the Christmas tree, will be added to the permanent display of previous years’ winning artwork at the Washington office of the U.S. Forest Service.

"Deputy Administrator of APHIS’ Animal Care program in  Animals  Dec 02,  We see the headlines about natural disasters all the time – hurricanes in the South, wildfires in the West, flooding, tornadoes, and the list goes on. But do we stop to think about how those natural disasters affect animals, especially those housed in zoos, sanctuaries, and other licensed facilities? In addition to preparing themselves and their families for various emergencies, Animal Welfare Act licensees must also consider how to protect the welfare of all of their animals when the unexpected happens. A critical part of ensuring animal welfare is making sure facilities can continue to provide food, water, housing, protection, and appropriate veterinary care for animals during an emergency, especially if facilities are damaged or animal handlers cannot get to the facility. This means anticipating potential emergencies, planning ahead, and training staff to protect animals. USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service just announced a final rule that requires regulated facilities to proactively develop contingency plans to safeguard their animals. Just like families carefully plan how they will react and respond to emergencies or disasters that affect them, this rule will ensure regulated businesses take the time and care to think ahead of their animals’ welfare and ensure it’s a priority.

"High-Tech Agriculture Continues to Reap Rewards for Farmers and Society  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Just like a smart phone helps users learn, communicate and make important decisions, smart technology—known as precision agriculture—helps farmers know and apply critical information about the right investments in fertilizer, seed, pesticide and water needed to produce their crops. Through new technologies, farmers produce more efficiently and see an increase in profits while improving stewardship of ecosystems and local communities. To talk about precision agriculture is to talk about mapping the amount of a crop grown per acre (yield) or the types of soils in a given area. It also includes the technology that automatically guides farm machines and controls variables like the rates of seeds, fertilizers or chemicals.

The mid-Atlantic region saw double-digit growth in its listings in the National Farmers Market Directory. Maryland added 76 new market listings alone. USDA Photo by Lance Cheung. We’ve known for some time that local food is a vibrant and growing sector in agriculture. Consumers are seeking out food produced in their region, and this local food – whether it’s purchased at a farmers market, in a grocery store, at a restaurant or elsewhere – is now a multi-billion dollar industry. This week, we received further evidence of the strength of consumer demand for local foods. The National Farmers Market Directory, compiled by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has just been updated and shows a nearly 10 percent increase in listings over last year. There are now 7,864 farmers markets listed in the directory – 7,864 opportunities for producers to capture more of the food dollar and for consumers to connect with the men and women who produce their food. Our directory listings saw double-digit increases in the Southeast, Northeast, and mid-Atlantic regions of the country.  That means we’re connecting 689 more markets with new customers, and bringing more farm-fresh foods to your fingertips—just in time for National Farmers Market Week. Gorgeous produce from the Winter Park, Florida farmers market. The Southeast also saw a significant increase in its number of farmers market listings, with Florida adding 56. Photo by Meagan Perosha. Throughout the week, we are celebrating the vital role that farmers markets play—by connecting us to our communities and our food—and the business opportunity they represent to producers across the nation.  About 25 percent of U.S. farmers sell exclusively through farmers markets. Their commitment and ties to the communities they serve are linked directly to the success of their businesses. USDA is committed to supporting these direct marketing opportunities; it is one part of our strong, diverse agricultural industry. We provide support to farms, businesses and markets across the country through programs like our Farmers Market Promotion Program (FMPP) and Specialty Crop Block Grant Program (SCBGP).  In addition, our Federal State Marketing Improvement Program (FSMIP) offers matching funds to states to support new opportunities in their local agricultural communities.  Information on these programs and more is available through the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass, a newly-updated guide and map to USDA support for local food systems. Whether you’re at home during National Farmers Market Week, or traveling elsewhere in the country, our directory will help you find a farmers market to visit.  If you’re in Washington, D.C., please join us at the USDA farmers market this Friday.

"Historic Investment Will Support Entire Local Food Supply Chain  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .14  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  WASHINGTON, May 8, – Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced that USDA is making a historic $78 million investment in local and regional food systems, including food hubs, farmers markets, aggregation and processing facilities, distribution services, and other local food business enterprises.""The Farm Bill has given USDA new tools, resources and authority to support the rural economy,"" Vilsack said. ""Consumer demand for locally-produced food is strong and growing, and farmers and ranchers are positioning their businesses to meet that demand. As this sector continues to mature, we see aggregation, processing, and distribution enterprises across the local food supply chain growing rapidly. These historic USDA investments in support of local food give farmers and ranchers more market opportunities, provide consumers with more choices, and create jobs in both rural and urban communities.""Vilsack said that $48 million in loan guarantees for local food projects is now available through USDA 's Rural Development's Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program, and $30 million is available through competitive grants via the Agricultural Marketing Service's (AMS) Farmers Market and Local Foods Promotion Program.The Farm Bill requires USDA to set aside at least five percent of Business and Industry (B&I) program loan guarantees for projects that focus on local food business enterprises. Details on how to apply for local food funding through the B&I program are available on the Rural Development website. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis. The B&I program has the authority to fund local food infrastructure in urban areas as long as the project supports farm and ranch income and expands healthy food access in underserved communities.Rural Development's B&I program provides financial backing for rural business development in partnership with private-sector lenders. It is one of several USDA programs that help finance local foods projects. In , Rural Development supported more than 170 local food infrastructure projects – from food hubs, to scale-appropriate processing facilities, to cold storage and distribution networks. Entities eligible for B&I loan guarantees include cooperatives, non-profit organizations, corporations, partnerships or other legal entities, Indian tribes, public bodies or individuals.The Farm Bill tripled funding for marketing and promotion support for local food enterprises by creating the Farmers Market and Local Foods Promotion Program, administered by the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). This new program makes $30 million available annually to farmers markets, other direct producer-to-consumer venues, and other businesses in the local food supply chain. Under this program, $15 million is now available for marketing and promotional support specifically for local food businesses, including food hubs, delivery and aggregation businesses, and processing and storage facilities along the local food supply chain, while $15 million is for marketing support for farmers markets and other direct to consumer outlets. Since , AMS, which administers this program, has funded nearly 450 projects totaling $27 million to support direct marketing efforts for local food. More information about how to apply is available on the AMS website. Applications are due June 20, .These funding opportunities are cornerstones of the USDA's commitment to support local and regional food systems. USDA's Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative coordinates the Department's policy, resources, and outreach efforts related to local and regional food systems The Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass maps nearly 3,000 local and regional food projects supported by USDA and eleven other federal agencies.

"Are Frogs on the Edge of Survival?  A lethal fungus is killing frogs and other water-dwelling amphibians all over the world, but a team of international scientists led by U.S. Forest Service scientist Deanna Olson is working to understand why. Olson, who works at the agency’s Pacific Northwest Research Station, and her colleagues have the daunting task of tracking the disease, known as the amphibian chytrid fungus. Unlike the clearly visible white-nose syndrome killing bats in the U.S., the frog fungus cannot be seen except with a microscope. That makes scientists’ jobs that much more difficult. Since the discovery of the malady is so recent, scientists still don’t understand a great deal about the fungus except that it affects the skin and ultimately leads to cardiac arrest in amphibians.

"Deputy Administrator of the National Organic Program in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  May 14,  Organic certification cost share programs puts organic certification within reach for farms of all sizes. It is of great value to organic farmers and supports the integrity of the organic label. Consumers are increasingly looking for organic products when they visit the supermarket.  Last year, organic products reached a record number of sales, accounting for over $39 billion in U.S. retail sales.  To meet consumer demand, the industry needs more organic operations to produce everything from organic milk to organic granola bars.  Thanks to support from the Farm Bill, USDA has two cost share programs that assist organic farms and businesses with about $11 million per year in certification assistance– making it possible for producers and handlers of all sizes to consider organic certification.  Cost share programs support certified operations across the organic supply chain by making certification more affordable. The USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) administers these programs through grants to participating states. In , USDA funding allowed states to issue nearly 10,000 reimbursements worth more than $6 million, helping the organic community thrive and grow.  ""The U.S. is currently experiencing an explosion of demand for certified organic products and our goal is to see that demand is met by U.S. farmers,” said Abby Youngblood, Executive Director of the National Organic Coalition.  “We expect that the organic cost share programs will encourage more U.S. farms to certify and/or add another certification scope to meet this demand."" Cost share programs cover a wide range of certification-related expenses, and cover 75 percent of the cost of each certification, up to a maximum of $750 annually. Here’s how it works: If you’re not yet certified, contact a certifier and get certified. If you are already a certified operation, contact your state agency; Submit your information – a short application and tax form, proof of certification, and itemized expenses; and Get reimbursed by your state agency. “As a small seed company, the cost share program helped make becoming certified organic a reality for us,” said Ken Greene, Founder of the Hudson Valley Seed Library. “We are proud of our certification, what it means about our seeds, and are committed to increasing the diversity and availability of certified organic seed for organic growers.” Organic certification lets consumers know that the products they buy meet the USDA organic requirements.  USDA has a number of new and expanded efforts to connect organic farmers and businesses with resources that will ensure the continued growth of the organic community.

"Leaf Litter Keeps Ground-Roosting Bats Warm  When winter weather arrives, most bats hibernate in caves, but a few species migrate to warmer areas. Warmer being relative, the migrating bats may still end up in places that are too cold for comfort, and sometimes hibernate under leaf litter for short periods of time. Roger Perry, a wildlife biologist at the U.S. Forest Service’s Southern Research Station, studied these temporary hibernation sites to find out how much protection they offered bats, and how much energy bats expend to stay alive. The leaf litter study took place in and around the Alum Creek Experimental Forest of the Ouachita National Forest in Arkansas, and focuses on eastern red bats, a migratory species that remains active through most of the winter. When winter temperatures are not too cold the bats roost in trees, but when temperatures plunge, the bats temporarily hibernate underneath leaf litter.

"Siuslaw National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Aug 18,  Students from the Inner City Youth Institute acquired a love of the outdoors while removing invasive tansy ragwort from the Drift Creek Wilderness area in the Siuslaw National Forest. (U.S. Forest Service/Brian Hoeh) Inner city youth helped protect an ancient forest wilderness in the Siuslaw National Forest by spending a day removing invasive tansy ragwort. High school students from the Inner City Youth Institute  in Portland, Oregon, arrived in the Drift Creek Wilderness near the Alsea River, where Douglas fir and western hemlock make up the largest stand of old-growth rainforest in the Oregon Coast Range. “We love coming to the Siuslaw,” said institute group leader, Stacey Sowders. “We love this chance to do meaningful work and meet people who are so passionate about what they do.” The group drove in a drizzling mist along the route where invasive plants had spread up an old logging road to the edge of the wilderness boundary. Senecio jacobaea, commonly known as tansy ragwort, is poisonous to native plants, toxic to animals and livestock, and harmful to soil quality. This weed has made a comeback in recent years, threatening local economies and community health. Students worked alongside Siuslaw employees who shared their own stories of how and why they came to serve America’s public lands. “Today was as important for us as it was for them,” said Rob Stenson, Siuslaw Forest trails crew assistant leader. “It’s rewarding to see kids make these connections and to see the meaning behind what we’re doing,” he added. Trips like the Inner City Youth Institute event can be a defining experience in young lives. Youth gain insight into the values of natural resources and also gain exposure to possible career paths.  For some institute kids, this was their first visit to a national forest. “No matter where we live, the natural world provides for us. Our goal is to open student’s eyes to the wonders of these places, and also to their own potential,” Stenson added. In recent years, young people have become more estranged from the outdoors, but for some youth, the wilderness seemed intimately familiar. “I would love to live in a place like this,” exclaimed one student, who picked ripe salmonberry along the descending trail where wildflowers emerged from thick mats of moss and lichen. After the weeds were packed in garbage bags and loaded onto the back of a Forest Service truck, one student shared the day’s impact. “Because of experiences like today, I know where I want to go with my life, and I’m not ever going to forget this,” she added.

"USDA Wildlife Services Director in Ohio in  Animals  Plants  Aug 14,   When startled by a swarm of flying and buzzing insects, complete with stingers, the common response may be to grab an aerosol can of insecticide; but appreciating the vital importance of honey bees to agriculture and knowing something of various difficulties currently faced by bees, alternative actions are warranted. Recently my staff noticed a huddled mass of what turned out to be bees in the lot by our office and shop.  We looked for a queen but left the swarm alone.  It later became apparent the bees had created a home under flashing at the building’s roof line, which seemed an inopportune location both for the bees and my staff. We encouraged our landlord to consider relocation of the hive and were amazed to watch the process when Charlie Reffitt showed up one May morning.  In shorts and T-shirt, he climbed 20 feet up a ladder, with bees swirling around.  He inserted a funnel-like device into the hive under the flashing, caulking all other entrances.   He secured a cardboard box on the roof, populated with a queen and initial colony. Charlie Reffitt shares the cab of his pickup truck with loose bees and boxed hives. Each box contains a queen and initial colony, designed to attract wild bees. The black taped box is a collected wild hive ready for delivery to a local apiary. The funnel served as an exclusion device, creating a one-way passage through which the bees could leave.  When returning from their nectar search however, the bees could not re-enter the wild hive but were attracted instead to the boxed queen.  Within days the wild bees had all relocated to the cardboard hive, which Charlie picked up to integrate the wild bees into local apiaries. This process benefits the bees, agriculture and the homeowner or business that isn’t looking to share space with bees.  Private beekeepers will often collect swarms and hives found at ground level but specialists may be needed for some locations.   Not every nuisance control company offers this service, but the value to agriculture is well worth the search and investment. Charlie Reffitt, also a beekeeper, and USDA’s Andy Montoney agree honey bee relocation is a win-win situation.  Bee pollination is responsible for more than $15 billion in added crop value, particularly for specialty crops, such as nuts, berries, fruits, and vegetables. About one mouthful of three in our diet benefits from honey bee pollination, directly or indirectly. USDA is surveying hives to learn more about pests and diseases that may be contributing to the decline of honey bee colonies nationwide.   Scientists are investigating colony collapse disorder.  While this research progresses, those of us encountering poorly placed hives can protect agriculture and bees -- one hive at a time.

We capture for everything from cotton, fruits, vegetables and specialty crops, livestock, meats, poultry, eggs, grain and hay, to milk and dairy, and tobacco. At some point in our lives, we all wonder what it would be like if we didn’t exist.  How would things be different?  Last month, American farmers and businesses experienced what it was like to live without USDA Market News.  While the markets continued to operate, we received several phone calls and heard stories of how so many small and mid-sized producers struggled without the valuable information we provide. In the 100-year history of Market News, this was only the second time that the were not available.  The give farmers, producers and other agricultural businesses the information they need to evaluate market conditions, identify trends, make purchasing decisions, monitor price patterns, evaluate transportation equipment needs and accurately assess movement.  The information, gathered by the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and provided for free,  captures for everything from cotton, fruits, vegetables and specialty crops, livestock, meats, poultry, eggs, grain and hay, to milk and dairy, and tobacco. The is released within hours of collection, allowing producers and marketers to quickly see which of their commodities are in the greatest demand at which markets.  As an unbiased agricultural resource, USDA Market News helps encourage market stability by promoting healthy competition within the marketplace and providing equal access to market information for small and mid-sized growers trying to get the best prices for their commodities. But for those few weeks in October when the wasn’t available, producers – especially small farmers and ranchers – were left without a benchmark to accurately evaluate the market.  Their risk of over-paying or under-pricing their own goods increased dramatically. The loss of Market News also disrupted other agricultural stakeholders and businesses. Wholesalers and retailers appeared more cautious in making purchases, having to renegotiate contract terms without reliable about the direction of the markets. Commodity traders pulled money out of the market, slowed or halted trading, and adjusted settlement terms.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which makes calculations based on published Market News prices, temporarily suspended both its feeder cattle and lean hog indexes because the wasn’t available. Trade organizations could not provide members with economic analysis and forecasting services, and industry and market analysts found themselves without the basic needed to conduct their work.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Nov 07,  ARS scientists are studying new ways to trap and reduce stink bugs. Photo by Peggy Greb. The invasive brown marmorated stink bug causes problems for homeowners and farmers and threatens U.S. specialty crops valued at over $20 billion. Farmers rely on insecticide sprays to reduce crop-damaging stink bugs. Another strategy is using traps with lures to capture this pest. Finding reliable ways to attract stink bugs is a challenge for researchers. Most insects are attracted to visual and chemical cues that enhance the ability to capture them. According to Agricultural Research Service (ARS) entomologist and research leader Tracy Leskey, brown marmorated stink bugs are attracted to visual cues such as UV black lights and chemical cues such as pheromones. However, black lights also attract numerous non-target insects, making trap capture identification laborious. Leskey’s recent laboratory trials show that brown marmorated stink bugs are attracted to blue lights—lights that attract fewer non-target insect species. She also tested a combination of visually attractive blue lights with chemically attractive pheromones. Her studies revealed that in regions like the Mid-Atlantic, which includes large high stink bug populations, pheromone-baited traps performed better than unbaited traps. Timing was important, too. During mid-season, traps containing lights captured more adult stink bugs, while pheromone-baited traps worked better during late season. In regions like the Pacific Northwest, which includes fewer stink bugs, pheromone-baited traps captured more adult stink bug than unbaited traps. These studies about the effectiveness of both light and pheromone-baited traps will help researchers develop more effective stink bug traps in the future.

"Posted by acampbell in  USDA Results  Rural  Feb 02,   The United States Department of Agriculture Rural Development and Farm Service Agency in Louisiana hosted a Jobs and Economic Growth Roundtable in Alexandria, bringing together more than 30 community leaders, business owners, and residents from across the state to discuss what is needed to create jobs and economic development in rural Louisiana. “This is in response to a request from President Obama” said Clarence Hawkins, Rural Development State Director and moderator of the roundtable. “The Obama Administration is currently exploring every avenue available to foster job creation and USDA Rural Development has been tasked nationally to take the lead in this effort. Your input in identifying obstacles and opportunities will be provided to the United States Department of Agriculture Secretary, Tom Vilsack, and to the White House.” The discussion centered on infrastructure, spanning the need for better transportation to possible solutions in developing more production ready sites. The group identified Louisiana’s strengths which included health care, energy services, and law enforcement. Obstacles discussed included lack of a skilled workforce, lack of capital for small businesses, and the need to further develop and strengthen the state’s infrastructure. Much discussion centered around the impact on Louisiana’s forest industry with recent paper mill closings in the state.  USDA officials discussed the resources that are invested in Louisiana including funds for housing, businesses, community infrastructure and facilities, broadband, farming, biomass, and conservation. These all create jobs. All agreed in the importance of state and federal agencies collaborating to educate each and every rural community in the state.  In summary, Hawkins stated, “This group identified a serious need for additional funds to renovate and develop infrastructure, as that serves as the foundation for us to attract the industries that will provide the jobs we need in Louisiana.” USDA Rural Development Louisiana State Director Clarence W.

"and William Shoutis, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 12,  Understanding soil carbon graphic. Graphic credit: Aurora Cutler and Cheryl Ziebart (Click to enlarge) As the climate changes, and our forests are affected, the need to reclaim impacted areas and restore native species becomes more important than ever. The U.S. Forest Service’s Monongahela National Forest is at the forefront of not only forest restoration, but also helping those landscapes adapt to climate change. The red spruce forests of the Appalachian highlands are an integral part of the regional biodiversity, providing habitat and food for the northern flying squirrel and the Cheat Mountain Salamander, and the ecosystem supports 240 rare species in West Virginia alone. Additionally, the forests blanket the headwaters of five major river systems upstream of millions of people living and working in the Charleston, West Virginia; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Washington D.C. regions. “Different soils have the ability to store different amounts of carbon, and Appalachian soils have potential to store carbon for the long-term if managed correctly. There is evidence of this in the soil profiles under the historic red spruce ecosystem,” said Stephanie Connolly, Forest Soil Scientist on the Monongahela forest. Most of the soil carbon in the world is found in the cool, moist conifer forests of the north. There is more carbon in the soils than in the atmosphere and the vegetation combined. Historically, timber harvesting of red spruce has resulted in large losses of soil carbon into the atmosphere. Forest Service scientists are helping figure out how to better manage these forests long term to restore lost soil carbon. The restoration of red spruce to its historic range could restore much of the lost soil carbon within a century, improve wildlife habitat, and protect water resources. In West Virginia alone, recent suggests that carbon—equivalent to 56.4 million barrels of oil—could be taken out of the atmosphere and incorporated in the forest floor within 80 years. Regional Forester Review at the Lambert Run Red Spruce Restoration Project with forest leadership, forest staff, and partners. Photo credit: Crystal Simons, Davis and Elkins College Student Intern One example of this work is the work of Monongahela National Forest staff and their partners at The West Virginia Highlands Conservancy and The Nature Conservancy who are working to restore historic red spruce forests on lands that were previously strip-mined for coal. The Lambert Run lands were mined in the s and s resulting in heavy soil compaction and the introduction of non-native plants. While earlier restoration efforts stabilized the land for erosion control, many areas remain in a condition scientist term “arrested succession.” The partnership uses machinery to break soil compaction and allow water to infiltrate the ground making it healthier to support the native spruce and reestablish critical habitat. Wetlands are being constructed to retain water and support native plant systems. Hardwoods and Norway pine are being removed from the Lambert Run in preparation for the planting of red spruce seedlings. After this kind of restoration work prepares the soil, the Monongahela forest staff work with climate change specialists to create adaptation management plans to enhance long-term resiliency of the newly restored forests. Together partnerships like this return forested areas into living tools that benefit all of us now and for generations to come.

"US Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 16,  Ghost stories illustration by Mary Horning, US Forest Service. Shadows start falling fast while you scurry to gather the last scraps of dead wood before it’s too dark – and too scary – to leave the relative security of the campsite on your favorite National Forest or Grassland. But, once the fire is safely lit, everyone gathers around to start roasting marshmallows and listen to…ghost stories! No one really knows when or how the tradition of telling scary ghost stories around a campfire began. It just did, and we really like to do it. In fact, there are many books out there that provide those with less creative story telling talents to get a group of outdoors enthusiasts nervously shifting their eyes and jumping at the sound of what was certainly a twig being broken by the heavy foot of a monstrous creature in the night or, yes, even a clumsy ghost. There are many reasons most of us, to some degree, are afraid of the dark especially while outside. Some believe it’s simply an evolved trait that kept us from, well, being eaten by the above mentioned monstrous creature in the night. All I know is as a creative writer myself, I really looked forward to trying out my story telling skills around a campfire. Sometimes my spooky tales are really creative like the ghost of Isabella who haunted a nearby meadow searching for her child who wandered off and was never seen again. And, sometimes, my stories are complete rip-offs from classics like Washington Irving’s headless horseman, albeit with a little twist. My headless dude was a lumberjack who literally lost his head in a bizarre tree cutting accident that really challenged my imagination to the delight of those around me. But, bad, good or just silly—ghost stories that really scare you are best served around a campfire with friends and family. So start your summer this Great Outdoors Month and Get Outdoors with some really spooky and memorable fun!

"North Dakota State Director, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Sep 26,  Students help break ground on their future Head Start building. ""In the Dakota language, there is no word for 'child' or 'children.' Instead, there is 'wakanyeja,' which means 'sacred little ones,'"" reported a local newspaper. The importance of that future generation was evident on the Spirit Lake Indian Reservation in North Dakota as we broke ground for a new Head Start facility. This was a special project to me as it embodies so well what we do at USDA Rural Development. President Obama’s recent visit to North Dakota highlighted our tribal areas and opportunities for native youth. This project aligns with the President’s vision as well as being a strong validation of Secretary Vilsack’s StrikeForce initiative. The Secretary’s leadership has allowed us to further identify issues in areas of persistently high poverty, which cultivated the ensuing meetings that helped make this project a reality. Scattered across the tribal reservation, currently art classrooms are housed in mobile trailers that are no less than 30 years old. The rooms are in need of great repair and one was recently condemned due to air quality issues. With one kitchen preparing the children’s meals, buses are used to deliver the food to all the Head Start locations. Recognizing that the system is inefficient and that the children need a safe and healthy environment to learn, Cankdeska Cikana Community College is utilizing the USDA Community Facilities loan program leveraged with a Head Start grant to construct the new building. The project will bring all of the Head Start classrooms under one roof as the facility will accommodate up to 175 children, ranging from infants to 6-year-olds. I’ve always believed that the best investments we can make as a society are the ones that benefit our children - our wakanyeja - now and for the little sacred ones generations to come.

"USDA Rural Development Iowa Public Information Officer in  Rural  Jan 14,  Farm owner Andy Dunham (wearing cap) explains his crop production system to John Whitaker, FSA Iowa State Executive Director Recent estimates indicate only nine percent of family farm income comes from farming and fewer than half of our nation’s farmers and ranchers list farming as their primary occupation. In Grinnell, Iowa, Andy and Melissa Dunham support themselves and their two children entirely on the 10-acres of USDA-certified organic vegetables, flowers and herbs they raise on their family–heritage farm.  Their business brochure lists 39 different vegetables and herbs, and Andy believes they are the largest grower of kale, carrots and beets in the state.  They are also among the more progressive, and more vocal, members of the state’s exploding local foods network. USDA Farm Service Agency State Executive Director John Whitaker and Rural Development State Director Bill Menner visited the Grinnell Heritage Farm recently to meet with the Dunhams and explore potential roles for USDA.  With a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) operation that already reaches into Des Moines, Cedar Rapids and Iowa City, a presence at the major farmers’ markets in the area, and a contract with a member-owned coop grocery, the Dunhams have seen their revenues almost triple over the last three years. But in order to survive with no off-farm income, they need to continue to grow.  And, the Dunhams say they want to expand production from ten acres to as many as 45, add 5,000 square feet of storage and cold storage space, and increase the number of seasonal workers they employ. Menner pointed out that Rural Development’s Value Added Producer Grant (VAPG) program could be used to expand marketing of the CSA, while its Business and Industry loan guarantee program (B&I) could be accessed by the Dunhams’ banker.  Whitaker discussed FSA’s Beginning Farmer Loan Program, its Farm Storage Facility Loan Program, and the Non-Insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) and its applicability to vegetable growers. The Dunhams are familiar with many USDA programs – they have applied for VAPG in the past and already track their production in a manner that simplifies work for local FSA employees.  They have a vision for a system that enhances the ability of small growers to expand their markets, be profitable, but not face catastrophic losses or bankruptcy in the event of floods, hailstorms or other events. They also recognize the importance of locally-grown foods and the relationship between producers and consumer – especially when that relationship is personal – such as the one that exists between the Dunhams and their CSA shareholders, as evidenced by this excerpt from their CSA newsletter last spring. “Much of our landscape is shaped by our food system and the quality of our health is greatly dependent on what we eat. Transparency in our local food system is the greatest asset we possess and the best argument we can put forth when discussing food and food policy with naysayers. When you meet your farmer and see your farm, you can be assured that we are not polluting, mistreating our employees or livestock, and not simply mining our soils. When you purchase your produce locally, that food dollar stays in Iowa, it isn’t sent out of state or out of the country. Reinvigorating small towns and cities depends in large part on creating and sustaining a regional economy.” Learn more about the Dunhams and Grinnell Heritage Farm at www.GrinnellHeritageFarm.com.  To find out how USDA can assist your farm visit the FSA or Rural Development web sites or stop by your local USDA Service Center.

"Dora Flores, and the entire AMS Dairy Programs Virtual Internship Team in  Initiatives  May 07,  Dora Flores, Dairy Programs Virtual Intern Program Team Lead, communicates with Daman Wandke. On May 7th, Wandke was invited to participate in a White House ceremony honoring “Champions of Change” within the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math for people with disabilities in education and employment.  The definition of “being in the office” or “being on the clock” is changing.   Most organizations—government or private—have a multi-generational workforce that may or may not be in the same location. Our team alone has four generations with varying comfort levels in using different technologies. Through our virtual internship program, we have strengthened our ability to work seamlessly regardless of physical location. Every year college students come to Washington, D.C. to spend their summer break gaining valuable work experience and making solid connections. Many students return to school having made a good impression on potential employers. Through its new virtual internship program, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has successfully extended this summertime experience, giving new meaning to making connections and creating a model for others to follow. Since , our Dairy Programs have offered virtual internships. Virtual internships are like regular internships, but the students work from a remote location. Most of these interns came to Washington, D.C., for a summer internship and returned to school to finish their degrees.  During the school year, the student interns stayed connected to AMS by working with the agency on a part-time and intermittent basis. The Virtual Internship Program (VIP) goes above and beyond, since it also works as a Leadership Program. It’s a win-win situation for our agency because we get to attract bright, young students and then retain their knowledge. As leaders and innovators they are typically very busy – not only with their academics, but also with extracurricular activities.  Sometimes this limits their ability to commute to and from internship programs that are outside their community, so a virtual opportunity is a perfect fit. Daman Wandke, Virtual Intern, communicates with Dora Flores. Wandke came to USDA Headquarters in Washington D.C. and stayed with the agency as a virtual intern while seeking a degree in Management Information Systems from Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA.  Communication has been both a challenge and a success for this program. We often use Microsoft Live Meeting, Office Communicator and similar programs, relying on technology and new communication tools to stay connected. Our projects encourage our interns to focus on collaboration and creativity, leading to innovative ideas, and injecting new approaches into our government processes. The use of different technologies makes our students well-suited to evaluate the ways that the agency communicates with the general public. Some of their projects include testing new software, like the new Public Comment Analysis Tool, and reviewing our website to make sure it’s accessible for people with disabilities.  They have also proposed innovative ways to communicate with un-served and underserved farmers. In an age where government agencies are using webinars and similar technologies to communicate with the public and increase transparency, our experience with the internship program has made our agency a leader. We are developing our Virtual Internship “Leadership” to present to the department as an option for all USDA interns, and our program has become an example for other agencies. In the summer of , the USDA and the Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) hired a virtual intern by following our model. Working from home, the intern was responsible for maintaining the HSI website after his traditional summer internship ended. We encourage other agencies and offices all over the country to develop similar programs to improve public communication and general access. We are excited for the upcoming internship season.

"Virginia State Statistician, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Conservation  Jan 29,  The Old Dominion Dominates when it comes to farming – more than one-third of the state’s area is farmland. VA Farmers, take a BOW! Check back next week for another in-depth state focus from the Census of Agriculture. The Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture. Nothing can compare to the economic impact agriculture has in Virginia. Census of Agriculture counted more than 46,000 farms, which cover more than 8.3 million acres of farmland in the commonwealth. That’s nearly a third of our entire state! In fact, according to Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, agriculture is our state’s largest industry. In the most recent census, Virginia farmers reported selling more than $3.7 billion worth of agricultural products. Of these, most came from the livestock sector. Broiler chickens were the top commodity sold in , the year of the latest Census of Agriculture. That year, growers sold $638.3 million worth of broiler hens. Cattle is another big commodity in Virginia. In our farmers and rancher sold more than $430 million worth of cattle and calves. And, as can be expected, with livestock you also get livestock products, such as milk. In , farmers sold nearly $347.2 million worth of cow milk in Virginia. Our crop sales, which amounted to nearly $1.4 billion in are also nothing to sneeze at. In Virginia, soybeans are our top crop. Nearly 580,000 acres of farmland are dedicated to this crop, with Virginia farmers selling more than $300 million worth of soybeans in . Not surprisingly, tobacco is a major crop in Virginia. While this industry is not as big as it once was, Virginia still ranks as one of the top 5 states for tobacco. In , our farmers sold $109 million worth of leaf tobacco from their farms. Virginia farmers also grow plenty of edible fruits and vegetables. According to the Census, our farmers harvested more than 5,000 acres of potatoes and more than 3,000 acres of tomatoes, which are key vegetable crops in the commonwealth. On the fruit side, apples are the largest commodity in Virginia. Our growers harvested nearly 12,000 acres of apples in . And, largely in thanks to our growing wine industry, grapes are now one of the top agricultural commodities in Virginia. Our farmers dedicated more than 4,300 acres to grape production in . There are plenty of other facts about Virginia agriculture that I could mention here, but I’ll let you check them out yourself.

"Deputy Administrator, AMS Transportation and Marketing in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Dec 15,  A winter market in Rochester, NY. There are more than 1,200 operating winter farmers markets across the nation. You can find a market near you by using the USDA National Farmers Market Directory. Traditionally, the onset of winter meant the end of farmers market season. However, in recent years, winter farmers markets have become increasingly popular. According to the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), there are over 1,200 of these farmers markets operating across the country. This is almost a 38 percent increase from last year. From to , the number of winter markets in New York, the top state for these markets, increased from 152 to 180. The state has been the recipient of several grants to support and promote access to healthy foods. For example, New York’s Oneida County received grant funds to develop a year-round market in downtown Utica. For consumers, winter farmers markets provide an opportunity to enjoy winter crops like squash and pears, fresh from their local farmers. For the farmers and vendors who sell at the markets, it means increased financial opportunities. “Our sales at the winter market even out our income over the year, eliminating some of the highs and lows of our financial situation,” said Skip Paul, a farmer at Wishing Stone Farm in Little Compton, Rhode Island. In addition to increasing financial opportunities, winter markets allow farmers and vendors to solidify their relationships with customers. An extended season enables market customers to get to know their local farmers better. “The biggest impact for us is really doing local networking and selling,” said Rhode Island farmer Lauri Roberts. “Selling directly to customers really means a lot to us.” It also means a lot to us, here at USDA, that local producers can provide consumers with this direct buying experience, while at the same time, offering them fresh, healthy, locally-grown foods.  We even hold our own winter farmers market, which features local products such as fresh fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, eggs, honey, herbs, handmade soaps, baked goods and more.  In addition, through USDA grants, such as those offered by the Farmers Market Promotion Program and Specialty Crop Block Grant Program, many of the nation’s winter farmers markets can look to us for support in their marketing initiatives. So, where can YOU go to find one of these great winter farmers markets?  Check out the National Farmers Market Directory to find a market near you.

"Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  Conservation  Oct 07,  USDA is committed to working with our partners in the sheep industry to support them as they provide quality products to consumers and increase producer returns here at home. USDA Photo by Lance Cheung Since they were brought over during the earliest explorations of North America, the sheep industry has played a vital role in the agricultural history of our nation.  In the s, there were over 55 million sheep in the U.S., but today those numbers hover around one-tenth of that total.  There are about 80,000 sheep ranchers across the U.S., and, with support from the Farm Bill, they will have additional resources to help develop innovative approaches to address their long-term needs. Consolidation of the U.S. sheep packing industry, higher feed and energy costs, loss of animals to predators and lower lamb consumption, along with competition from imported of lamb cuts, have taken their toll on U.S. sheep producers.  In response to industry needs, USDA is committed to working with our stakeholders to ensure the long-term viability of the sheep industry. Authorized by the Farm Bill and administered by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the Sheep Production and Marketing Grant Program is designed to strengthen and enhance the production and marketing of sheep and sheep products in the United States.  The National Sheep Industry Improvement Center (Sheep Center) is the first recipient of this grant.  The Sheep Center will use these funds to award grants to other industry organizations, focusing on projects that will improve infrastructure, build business and develop industry-wide resources. USDA is committed to supporting the U.S. sheep industry—and the thousands of rural communities that benefit from the jobs, food and other products it generates. This grant program will create new opportunities for growth and innovation for this long-standing piece of American agriculture.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .15  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  Factsheet: The Four Pillars of Agriculture and Rural Economic DevelopmentThe potential to grow and make innovative products in rural America is limitless. Since , the Obama Administration has made targeted investments to help rural businesses grow. Through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's projects in affordable housing, energy efficiency, roads and bridges, and internet access, coupled with loans and grants for rural businesses, the Administration has helped to attract and retain a talented rural labor force, improve connectivity and access to information, move products to market, and make rural communities competitive—ultimately supporting strong local economies and expanded opportunity for rural Americans.These investments are creating new markets for innovative rural products in four key areas:Production Agriculture Opening Foreign Markets: USDA has opened new markets abroad for farm and ranch products. Recent trade agreements with Panama, Colombia, and South Korea will result in an estimated $2.3 billion in additional agricultural trade each year and support nearly 20,000 domestic jobs. USDA continues to pursue strong new trade deals that will expand exports and help farm and ranch businesses grow and create jobs. Breaking down Barriers: USDA has removed numerous barriers to U.S. trade. We have removed unfair restrictions to help farmers export more U.S. apples to China, a market with an estimated value of nearly $100 million per year and expanded market access for U.S. beef in Japan, Mexico, Hong Kong, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Uruguay. Total U.S. beef and beef product exports reached a record $6.8 billion in fiscal year . Expanding Access to Credit: USDA support has helped more than 89,000 rural small businesses grow through grant and loan support, creating or saving more than 420,000 jobs. Researching New Methods: USDA scientists and university partners are conducting research every day to help farmers and businesses grow and produce more. In recent years they have revealed the genetic blueprints of apples, pigs, turkeys, tomatoes, beans, wheat and barley. Local and Regional Food Systems Creating Local Markets: USDA has strengthened local and regional food systems by investing in projects that recruit and train farmers, expand economic opportunities for small businesses and increase access to healthy foods. For example, the number of food hubs has nearly doubled since , with more than 300 now operational around the country thanks in part to support from USDA. Growing Regional Businesses: USDA is helping create strong regional supply chains and the jobs that come with them. Since , USDA has made over 500 investments in local food infrastructure - from cold storage facilities, to processing plants, to food hubs that aggregate products from many farms and help smaller producers reach larger buyers. Making Resources More Accessible: USDA has a variety of resources available to help every part of a regional food system grow stronger and contribute to local economies. Sometimes the best lessons learned are from other communities who have forged a successful path. The Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass maps over 4,500 projects where USDA and 11 other federal agencies have invested in local and regional food systems to encourage community development and peer to peer learning. Pursuing Expanding Markets: Schools, hospitals, retailers and other institutional and wholesale buyers are a rapidly expanding market opportunity for local producers and an investment into local economies. USDA's Farm to School, for example, efforts are working directly with producers and schools to supply over $385 million in local food, reaching over 23 million students in school cafeterias and investing in the health of America's next generation.The Biobased Economy Growing New Fuel: USDA helped jumpstart efforts to provide a reliable supply of advanced plant materials for biofuels. Through our Biomass Crop Assistance Program, for example, USDA is incentivizing more than 850 growers and landowners farming nearly 48,000 acres to establish and produce dedicated, nonfood energy crops for delivery to energy conversion facilities. Creating New Infrastructure: To ensure those feedstocks are put to use, USDA has invested in the work needed to create advanced biofuels refineries. USDA has supported efforts to build 6 new biorefineries to produce advanced biofuels in Louisiana, Georgia, Oregon, Nevada, North Carolina, and Iowa, in addition to three existing facilities in New Mexico, Michigan and Florida previously supported by the program. Putting Innovation to Use: USDA has worked with agencies to strengthen markets for biobased products. Approximately 2,000 products now carry USDA's BioPreferred label. Approximately 150 applications for the BioPreferred label are in process. Companies in over 40 countries on six continents are now participating in the BioPreferred program.Conservation and Natural Resources New Model for Conservation Investment: To date, USDA has 115 high-impact projects across all 50 states and Puerto Rico through the Regional Conservation Partnership Program to improve the nation's water quality, enhance soil health, support wildlife habitat, and protect agricultural viability. RCPP brings a radically different approach to investing in natural resource conservation and empowers local communities to work with multiple partners, farmers and ranchers to design solutions that work best for them. New Strategy to Mitigate the Impact of Climate Change: USDA has developed a framework of ten ""building blocks"" that span a range of technologies and practices to significantly reduce carbon emissions while improving yields, increase farm operations' energy efficiency, and help farmers and ranchers earn revenue from clean energy production. New Uses for Wood: USDA launched the U.S. Tall Wood Building Prize Competition in , a $2 million prize competition in partnership with the Softwood Lumber Board and Binational Softwood Lumber Council to support a resilient rural wood products industry, promote forest restoration and retention, and foster sustainability in the built environment. Fostering Innovation: USDA has awarded more than 323 Conservation Innovation Grants since to support the development and adoption of innovative conservation approaches and technologies.Inspiring and innovative work is going on across the country today - from our smallest towns to our biggest cities. USDA will continue investing to build partnerships and further innovation. Together, we can grow more prosperity in rural America, and grow the bottom line for American business.","Here's a concise question that focuses on key concepts: ""What strategies is the USDA implementing to support advanced biofuels development, materials production, and resilient rural communities, while also promoting sustainable conservation practices and mitigating climate change impacts?""","The USDA is implementing the following strategies: * Supporting the growth of advanced biofuels through investments in biorefineries and biomass crop assistance programs * Promoting the use of biobased products through the BioPreferred program and labeling initiative * Investing in conservation projects through the Regional Conservation Partnership Program to improve water quality, enhance soil health, and protect agricultural viability * Developing a framework to mitigate climate change impacts through ten ""building blocks"" that promote carbon emissions reduction, yield improvement, energy efficiency, and clean energy production * Fostering innovation through Conservation Innovation Grants and other initiatives."

"USDA Forest Service Climate Change Advisor in  Forestry  Research and Science  Sep 22,   This post is Part Two of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Read part one here.  Accountability is just as important when dealing with climate change as any other issue faced by government. Because of limited financial resources, every aspect of government operations will be scrutinized by the Administration, Congress, and the American public. We in the Forest Service believe that what we do makes a difference in climate change response just as in the other facets of our mission pursuit. But we need to create compelling evidence to array alongside other agencies that are vying for increasingly scarce resources. We must continue to show that our programs have impact as a national effort; they are not just a collection of noble, individual actions. A recurring question will be how well our agency accomplishments are aligned with our stated goals. By linking field accomplishments directly with the USDA Strategic plan, which devotes one of its four goals to our nation’s forests, our climate change performance system allows us to more fully describe and justify the total impact of our actions. Our performance system is an opportunity for the Forest Service to step out on one of the major issues of our time. We can show that what we do is relevant to the lives of today’s and tomorrow’s citizens. Does this mean we are about to turn the whole national forest system upside down, chasing climate change? No. Instead, we are incorporating climate change considerations into what we already do in our many programs. We will need to reshape the appropriate elements, mixes, and locations of those activities based on the best predictions we have about where climate change is taking us. As we do this, our major functions – restoration, fire, fuels, forest health, recreation, public affairs, and many others – will be better positioned for the future. What kinds of accomplishments can be considered for the scorecard? They should be activities that are being directed in some demonstrated, justifiable way to dealing with the effects of a changing climate or the opportunities to reduce the net emission of greenhouse gases either in land management or consumption/operations. These activities could include moving facilities to prevent flood damage, treating stands to relieve water stress, responding rapidly to invasive species, increasing landscape connectivity, conserving genetic material, creating and expanding partnerships with scientists and stakeholders, monitoring for climate change impacts, raising climate change awareness among employees and the public, and reducing energy use. As the effects of climate change begin to take a larger toll on our national forests, the public will ask us what is happening to their favorite forests, trees, recreation areas, water supplies, and wildlife species and what we are doing about it. We already have a good start on our answer, but we need to up the level of the game, reshape some of the ways we do things, adapt to changes around us that are already well underway, and build a track record. The climate change performance system will help keep us balanced, flexible, and accountable as we move together as an agency as leaders in the response to climate change.

"SNP Regional Director, FNS Western Region in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Feb 10,   Cross posted from the Let's Move! blog: The two most direct ways to get involved in the Summer Food Service Program in your community are to either become a sponsor or a feeding site.  What’s the difference you may ask?  Being a sponsor means acting as the organizer for Summer Food Service sites.  Sponsors manage, train, supervise and monitor all food service activities and locations where children can eat.  They also maintain paperwork and submit claims for reimbursement. You can also be a feeding site and work under a sponsor.  Feeding sites are the physical locations where children come to receive a free meal during the summer.  Being a feeding site involves providing a safe place for kids to eat and making sure the meals served to kids meet the meal pattern for a reimbursable meal. If you are interested in participating as a sponsor or as a feeding site, the best way to get information is to contact your state office that administers the Summer Food Service Program.  The deadline to apply as a sponsor varies from state to state, but it is usually before June 15.  There is no deadline to be a feeding site. There are also other ways you can get involved.  Consider volunteering!  Providing activities are what keeps children coming back. This takes volunteers—and LOTS of them—especially in June, July and August.  You can plan and do educational or recreational activities with the kids.  You can also help with basics things like transporting food, setting up or cleaning up a site.  Again, contact your state agency to find a sponsor or feeding site to volunteer within your area.  A little help goes a long way. If you are a parent, you can certainly participate by doing a little research and finding a feeding site close to your home, and then walking or bringing your child or children to the site.  Where are these feeding sites?  Go online and do a web search for “USDA SFSP feeding site” in your city.  You can also go to this directory or contact your state agency to find the nearest site. To get started and involved, and for a comprehensive list of all state offices that administer the Summer Food Service Program, please visit our website. Thanks for your interest in keeping children in your community healthy and eating nutritious meals throughout the summer months!

"USDA Agricultural Research Service Information Staff in  Research and Science  Mar 05,  The penny in this photo provides a sense of scale to the size of bed bug skins collected for analysis by ARS scientists in Beltsville, Maryland. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research profile. Most likely you’ve heard the old saying about “sleep tight and don’t let the bed bugs bite.” The “sleep tight” part relates to old-fashioned beds in which the bedding was suspended on cords pulled tight to provide a firmer sleeping surface, but you probably don’t need any extra explanation for “don’t let the bed bugs bite”! That saying might have been most Americans’ only knowledge of bed bugs until a decade or so ago, when the bed bug population came roaring back to infest workplaces, hotel rooms, and even our apartments and houses.  That’s why scientists with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) have been working hard on finding ways to fight these tiny-but-terrible pests. Bloodsucking bed bugs, while dirty and disgusting, don’t appear to transmit disease, but they can cause severe allergic reactions in some people.  Since the bugs are so small, they can be difficult to detect until their population is fairly large, and it can be costly to get rid of them. The ARS scientists say one strategy for combating these creatures could be turning their own chemistry against them.  In recent studies, the scientists identified two new “alarm pheromones” that the bugs emit when they’re frightened, to tell other bed bugs to flee. While breaking up a bed bug party sounds like a great idea under any circumstances, the scientists say causing the bugs to scatter increases the likelihood that the pests will run across an insecticide or other control agent. The ARS scientists and a university colleague have used a technique called mass spectrometry to identify 17 compounds called “cuticular hydrocarbons,” associated with the outer protective layer of the bug.  These compounds could play a role in the beg bugs’ habit of banding together. The scientists say these cuticular compounds and the alarm pheromones might help dogs detect bed bugs.  Canine detection of bed bug infestations is an emerging industry, and a better understanding of the chemical basis of canine detection could contribute to a harmonization of  training and detection methods—and give dogs yet another chance to live up to their reputation as “man’s best friend”!  Category/Topic:  Research and Science  Tags:  ARS  pests  Science Tuesday",**Can alarm pheromones released by bed bugs when they're frightened be used to increase the effectiveness of insecticides against these pests?**,"Yes, according to the USDA Agricultural Research Service Information Staff, causing bed bugs to scatter using their own alarm pheromones can increase the likelihood that they will run across an insecticide or other control agent."

"Energy  Rural  May 06,   Administrator-USDA Rural Utilities Service If you lived in a rural area 75 years ago, you probably didn’t have electricity. Water for livestock, cooking, cleaning and bathing had to be hand pumped from a well. Farmers risked milk spoilage in the summer, and people often got sick from lack of refrigeration of their food.  On May 11, , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an executive order to create the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) to bring power to rural areas. It was a resounding success.  Nothing before or since has transformed rural America like the REA.  Today’s Rural Utilities Service (RUS), part of the USDA Rural Development mission area, continues the work of REA. Just this week, four former REA and RUS administrators gathered in USDA’s radio studio, reflecting on their roles from to the present. Their observations will soon be available via podcast.  Rural Development, through RUS, is aggressively building a program to finance renewable energy, and rural America is rapidly becoming a greater energy producer for the nation. Not only is this part of President Obama’s clean energy economy, but it will also create quality jobs in rural America.  Working with other federal agencies, rural electric cooperatives and other utilities, we are taking steps to modernize the electric grid and improve energy efficiency.  While working to improve electric transmission services we are also meeting a new challenge: Delivering broadband to rural communities.  Without broadband, rural businesses are placed at a disadvantage and our children face diminished educational opportunities. Our next great achievement will be to build a system that will connect even the most remote places in America to the web.   Rural America’s future is bright, thanks to the thousands of men and women who have worked in or with the REA and now the RUS over the past three-quarters of a century.  Chances are, if you live in rural America, some of those people are your neighbors, as close as your local electric cooperative.  They achieved a modern miracle, lighting rural America. This week, take a minute and think about all the good they’ve done.  They’ve achieved the greatest success in a government technology program of all time.     (Left to right) Christopher McLean, Administrator,  -; Wally Beyer -; James Andrew -;  Glenn English (CEO-NRECA);  Hilda Gay Legg -; Jonathan Adelstein – present; Dallas Tonsager (Undersecretary, USDA Rural Development); gathered on May 4 at the U.S. Capitol for an event marking the beginnings of the effort to bring electricity to rural America.

"in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Feb 28,   This week at USDA, we took several steps forward in the fight for a healthier future for our nation’s children. On Tuesday, we rolled out new proposed that will make sure only healthy foods and beverages are allowed to be marketed to kids at school. The new will ensure that schools remain a safe place where kids can learn and where the school environment promotes healthy choices. Parents, schools and food and beverage industry stakeholders are on board and have applauded the move as the right direction for our schools. As we move forward, we will continue to work side by side with them to implement the new . We also released a report that reiterates the importance of community eligibility, which allows schools that serve predominantly low-income students to provide free breakfasts and lunches to all students. This helps to reduce the paperwork burden for administrators, and helps to ensure that kids can focus on learning and achieving at school, instead of their rumbling stomachs. Beginning next school year, more than 22,000 schools across the country will be eligible to participate, which could help as many as 9 million American children eat healthy meals at school. We have also finalized the food package for our Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children—commonly known as WIC—which helps to ensure that moms and young children have access to healthy food and nutrition and breastfeeding education during formative years. This program helps to start every American child on equal nutritional footing and gives them the opportunity to grow up healthy and strong. Our announcements this week build on groundbreaking work happening across government to make healthy choices the norm. The Food and Drug Administration this week announced major changes to the nutrition facts labels found on the back of more than 700,000 food products. The changes will make information about calories and serving sizes easier to find, read and understand. The First Lady’s office teamed up with Boys & Girls Club of America, the National Recreation and Park Association and the Partnership for a Healthier America to announce a new commitment to provide healthy snacks and physical activity to 5 million kids that participate in after school programs. I am pleased to be a part of the ever-building momentum towards healthier schools and healthier kids, and I am happy to say that we continue to see the fruits of our labor. Just this week, the Centers for Disease Control released a new study that shows that over the past decade, the obesity rate among young kids ages 2 to 5 has declined by 43 percent. That is impressive progress, and while I know that the changes we have made help, none of this would be possible without parents and caregivers. They make decisions each and every day in the best interests of their children—and we back them up. They no longer have to worry about what their kids eat at school. Breakfast, lunch and snacks at school reinforce the nutrition lessons moms and dads teach at home. The school environment focuses on learning and achievement, without the distraction of unhealthy foods and mixed nutrition messages. More than anything, collectively, we are giving our next generation the gift of health. Investing in good nutrition and healthy habits today helps our kids grow up to be the smart, strong, capable leaders of tomorrow.

Every month, USDA shares the story of a woman in agriculture who is leading the industry and helping other women succeed along the way. This month, we hear from Mary Safie, owner of Safie Specialty Foods. In , Mary took over her family’s canning business which began in in her grandfather’s kitchen with food grown on his farm in Chesterfield Township, Michigan. Specializing in pickled vegetables, Safie’s has experienced success domestically and abroad, with assistance from USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service and State Regional Trade Groups.  Tell us how you reignited the family business in and how you assumed a leadership role?  It was the passion that I learned as a young girl, following my dad and relatives in the pickling process that reignited our family business.  I wasn’t ready to let go of the process and with my Dad and Mom at my side, I decided to continue with the family tradition.  We are now a successful, women-owned and operated business. What does a typical day look like for you? I’m an early riser and usually off to the plant to walk the floor and see factory staff for the morning.  I make certain daily decisions that are passed on to the supervisory staff.  Any mechanical interruptions or order explanations are taken care of and inventory are received.  On a daily basis, I’m on the phones marketing and planning for future orders and product research.  Currently, my focus has been on marketing and introducing our newest product, our Organic Sweet Pickled Beets, which have generated a tremendous amount of buzz and positive feedback. Who are your role models? My parents—George and Madeline Safie—laid the foundation and provided guidance and are the best role models I could have asked for.  Our staff and advisors at Safie’s create a dynamic, collaborative team with regard to processing, marketing, and growing operations. What do you wish you knew before starting into food?  How the globalization of our food supply is reliant upon a strong knowledge of food safety and quality assurance.  There is a science behind a sustainable shelf life, lasting taste and presentation.  Also, growing to understand the needs of regulatory agencies has been challenging, as they are very task-oriented until you understand the how and why.  But the support and guidance that I have received and continuously receive will always be the backbone of the growth of knowledge of organization. You’ve had success exporting your products. How did you find overseas markets? What benefit has this provided for your business?  We worked very closely with the USDA’s FAS program and other federal programs offered through the state of Michigan’s Department of Agriculture & Rural Development. Through MDARD, we were given a grant for equipment and expansion, which allowed us to grow and put us where we are today. These opportunities gave us the ability to attend trade shows internationally and domestically, where we secured the overseas markets we sell our products to.  It all begins with a fantastic product that we market and produce, and support from USDA programs. What is some advice you have for other women looking to run a successful business with both domestic and international markets?  First and foremost, you must possess a strong passion and a love of the work that you are doing, because it becomes a part of you.  Drive and tenacity are two key ingredients to a recipe for success.  Love what you do, do what you love, and you’ll always shine.

Choose MyPlate Outdoors Going on a day trip to any of our 154 national forests or 20 national grasslands? Pack a picnic lunch, some snacks, and drinks to keep everyone hydrated and satisfied. Plan to have plenty of water with you and ready-to-eat foods such as mini-carrots, oranges, 100 percent whole wheat bread, and a container of peanut butter. Toss unsalted nuts and dried cranberries in small containers for easy grab-and-go snacks. Visiting national forests and lands also provide an opportunity to experience foods readily available from local farmers markets. Use the USDA National Farmer Market Locator Directory to find a market near you. (USDA Flickr Image) Planning meals and snacks for several days of outdoor activity may require a little more thought. Consider ahead of time which foods to take, ways to keep your food safe, and how to prepare easy meals. Rely on paper plates and include just a few cooking tools like a skillet or small pot for meats or soups. Mix quick-cooking oats with low-fat dry milk powder, walnuts, and raisins for a fast breakfast. Chop veggies like onions and peppers in advance to use when cooking over the campfire.  Bring cans of low-sodium soup or tuna fish that you can quickly re-heat or mix with vegetables for lunch or dinner. Also, think about cooking local foods. Enjoying nature means appreciating and eating what’s available to you. If you’re near the ocean, find a place to buy fresh fish. Visit a local farmers market to find fresh veggies, eggs, meat, or local cheeses. Savor your outdoor experience. Eating outside near a lake or under the stars is a special event that you will want to repeat. With just a little planning you can figure out how to have healthy, delicious meals that make it easy to get away and enjoy your public lands. We have one request: Please abide by the Leave No Trace seven principles of outdoor ethics so the beauty you see when you are there will be there when you return. Unplug and take your kids outside, where they can view though world though a different lens - away from televisions, cell phones and other electronic gadgets.

(Forest Service photo/Tiffany Holloway) On a recent cool, crisp spring morning in the mountains of Virginia, the Boy Scouts of America Troop 88 followed in the footsteps of the first “boys” of the Civilian Conservation Corps, the CCC. The first CCC camp, Camp Roosevelt, was established April 17, at the George Washington and Jefferson National Forest. Over time, the forest had 14 camps. The forest was celebrating the Civilian Conservation Corps’ 80th anniversary by inviting the scouts, missionaries, and Forest Service employees to participate in stewardship projects around an old CCC camp. Volunteers Westin Yardley and Ethan Richins said this was their first time participating in the clean-up. “We cleaned out the fire pits, cleared off the trails from debris, and did some leaf blowing,” said Yardley. Other stewardship projects included re-posting interpretative signs, which included pictures of what the camp looked like in the s and snippets of history about the camp. The interpretative signs were financed by one of the Civilian Conservation Corps members. Scouts from Boy Scouts of America Troop 88 dig a hole for a new interpretative sign. (Forest Service photo/Tiffany Holloway) “In his will, it stated that money would go to the Civilian Conservation Corps to help commemorate their legacy,” said Stephanie Chapman, recreation specialist on the George Washington and Jefferson National Forest. Ian Buschong, from Boy Scout Troop 88, was lead for this project and said, “I was interested in doing this project because the new signs will add to the camp experience.” The Civilian Conservation Corps, a public work relief program under President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, operated from to . The program, for unemployed, unmarried men between 18 and 25 years old, provided unskilled manual labor jobs related to the conservation and development of natural resources in rural lands owned by federal, state and local governments. Nationally, the Forest Service had several hundred camps across the U.S. mainland and Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico. Civilian Conservation Corps projects included: more than 3,470 fire towers erected 97,000 miles of fire roads built 4,235,000 man-days devoted to fighting fires more than 3 billion trees planted disease and insect control forest improvement — timber stand inventories, surveying, and reforestation forest recreation development — campgrounds built, complete with picnic shelters, swimming pools, fireplaces, and restrooms. “I’m really glad the Boy Scouts are taking care of the place. If someone doesn’t do it, it’s not going to be done.” said Joan Sharpe, Civilian Conservation Corps legacy president. “Conservation efforts such as this help to continue with tradition and helps (the scouts) learn by exposure.” Joan Sharpe, Civilian Conservation Corps legacy president, points to one of the old interpretative signs that displays the site where “the boys” built the Army headquarters.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Apr 10,  EFNEP provides food and nutrition information to limited-resource families, including how to understand the nutrition information provided on food labels. (iStock image) Educators from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories recently met in Arlington, Virginia to discuss local implementation of the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP), one of the nation’s largest nutrition education programs. Through nutrition education, EFNEP helps limited-resource families and children gain the knowledge and skills to change their current attitudes and behaviors when it comes to choosing nutritionally sound diets and improve their health and well-being.  USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) administers EFNEP and provides national program leadership. “The EFNEP Conference brought together about 170 representatives from and land-grant universities (LGUs) to coordinate, collaborate, and receive training that they can take back and implement in their respective university programs,” said Stephanie Blake, NIFA EFNEP program coordinator. Conference agenda items included an update on changes to packaged food nutrition labels, youth participant evaluation forms, a new adult behavior checklist, and an Internet tool used for EFNEP evaluation and reporting called the Web-Based Nutrition Education Evaluation and Reporting System.  EFNEP coordinators also shared ideas and resources through breakout session presentations and poster exhibits. EFNEP has assisted more than 32 million families and youth since the program’s inception in .  Last year, EFNEP reached nearly 122,000 adults and 400,000 children directly and about 360,000 family members indirectly.  Among the results listed in EFNEP’s Impacts Report, 94 percent of adult participants reported improved diets, 86 percent of youth participants reported an increased ability to choose healthy food, and 84 percent of adults reported being better able to manage food resources. “EFNEP is about reducing health disparities of some this nation’s most vulnerable audiences through hands-on learning experiences and interactive nutrition education,” said Helen Chipman, NIFA national program leader for food and nutrition education.  “This annual meeting, combined with other cooperative state and federal efforts, improves EFNEP’s ability to promote nutritional health and well-being among low-income families and children.” While LGUs manage state EFNEP programs, local educators run them at the county level.  “Our educators are so successful because they are members of the communities they support and dedicated to reaching diverse, low-income populations,” Blake said. Contact your local Cooperative Extension office for more EFNEP information. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Seen and Heard: The USDA Food Safety Discovery Zone is a Big Hit at the B’More Healthy Expo  The USDA Food Safety Discovery Zone began its spring tour this past Saturday at Baltimore’s B’More Healthy Expo. Staffed by five food safety experts, the Discovery Zone was arguably one of the top attractions at the expo, giving interactive tours and food safety prizes to at least 5,000 visitors in one day. FSIS’ Bridgette Keefe-Hodgson, who communicates through American Sign Language, captured the attention of deaf and hearing visitors alike with her presentations. Bridgette estimates that about 15 deaf expo attendees stopped by the Discovery Zone, and each stuck around for quite some time to see what they could learn. They were thrilled that FSIS has a series of YouTube videos in ASL, called SignFSIS, on preventing food poisoning, and Bridgette wrote down the URL for her pet project so the videos could be found later. One happy customer told her, “Wow, it is truly fantastic to see a deaf employee working at the FSIS booth.  For me, that makes it so much easier to ask food safety questions directly in ASL.”  Cathy Cochran, Public Affairs Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service  Posted in  Health and Safety  Mar 23,   Respond to this story",Here is a concise question related to the content: What was Bridgette's role at the USDA Food Safety Discovery Zone and what inspired one happy customer about her presence?,"Bridgette Keefe-Hodgson was a food safety expert staffing the USDA Food Safety Discovery Zone, and she communicated through American Sign Language (ASL).

"Where the Moon Trees Grow  Many space enthusiasts know that one of the U.S. Forest Service’s most famous former employees was astronaut Stuart Roosa. The smokejumper circled the moon as part of NASA’s Apollo 14 mission more than 40 years ago. However, what most folks don’t know is that Roosa brought a group of tiny travelers along for the ride. After all these years, they’re still among us today, living quietly across the United States. Their names – Douglas fir, sequoia and loblolly pine – are familiar to most everyone because they were seeds from these and other well-known tree species.

"Acting South Dakota State Director, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Jan 22,  Little Wound School students hold round table discussions on their vision of the future. Tribal elder Cecilia Fire Thunder facilitated. Recently USDA Rural Development staff in South Dakota spent two days at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, home of the Oglala Sioux, where they met with Tribal leaders, educators and other Federal partners.  They made this trip as part of a broader administration effort to change the way the federal government works with communities. This approach values residents’ knowledge of their communities’ strengths and needs; it also includes local leaders as essential partners and collaborators. Jennifer Irving, Director of Regional Equity for Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation, a local non-profit intimately involved in one-such effort at Pine Ridge said, “It is important to coordinate engagement of the Promise Zone stakeholders to ensure that Tribal Leadership’s vision and priorities are being met while optimizing Tribal commitment of time and resources.” Pine Ridge was designated a Promise Zone last April and in July a Presidential Disaster Declaration was received following severe summer storms. Since then the federal government, the Oglala Sioux Tribal government, and local organizations, such as Thunder Valley and other key partners have been working collaboratively to ensure activities, investments, and projects of the many entities across the reservation have broad-based community support and coordinated, and likely to yield results for residents. Dr. Richard Zephier provided an overview of the CEDS process and long term vision to develop a stronger economy for Pine Ridge. Visiting Rural Development staff were given an overview of the wide array of work underway including the Tribe’s work on a proposed Tribal Planning Office and a Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) that will lay out a long term vision for developing a stronger economy for Pine Ridge.  Other topics covered included recovery efforts underway in partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recovery efforts and an overview of the work two local organizations, Mazaska and Lakota Funds, are doing to identify housing and other finance-related needs. At Oglala Lakota College we met with President Shortbull who talked about work underway to develop an Ag Expo Center that would be instrumental in making local food a path for economic development. The College has already raised a substantial amount toward the expected total project need. A representative from each of the round table break-out sessions provided the entire group a synopsis of the top issues that were drawn out of the round table discussion at their respective table. This project will create educational opportunities in the community by increasing training and hands on experience for producers of all types of agricultural production on Pine Ridge. It will expand their economic opportunities by providing a place where producers can work in a commercial kitchen or work with large animals in a modern facility. This project has broad public support and holds significant potential for the Tribe and people living at Pine Ridge. While at Pine Ridge we also heard directly from Oglala Sioux youth at a roundtable with high school students at Little Wound School.  Of all of the meetings over the course of the two days, this opportunity to connect with the students at Little Wound that really hit home. The stories of hope, struggle and the students’ passion inspired us even more with the work ahead. Persistent poverty and lack of infrastructure investment have taken their toll at Pine Ridge. Now, these placed–based efforts aims to leverage investments, increase economic activity, improve educational opportunities and improve the quality of life in the area through focused work on the six goals the community has identified as instrumental to improve the economic health of the area, increase the quality of life and accelerate the work to create comprehensive community revitalization. First, accelerate job creation by building the foundation for new businesses including implementation of workforce development programs to ensure people are trained with the skills to fill new positions. Second, increase economic activity by addressing economic issues at the systemic level—like expanding increasing banking options and affordable housing for the workforce on the Reservation. Third, improve educational opportunities on the Reservation from primary school through the post-secondary level by offering Lakota immersion education, charter school options and opportunities at the Oglala Lakota College. Fourth, improve public safety Reservation by addressing substance abuse issues and strengthening the justice system. Fifth, provide affordable, low maintenance, energy efficient housing for residents of the Reservation, focusing on key issues like affordable rent, homeownership and middle income housing by developing the real estate market and increasing access to capital. Sixth, systematically develop infrastructure by providing the Tribal government with the ability to operate, maintain, and replace current infrastructure and facilitate future development. A representative from each of the round table break-out sessions provided the entire group a synopsis of the top issues that were drawn out of the round table discussion at their respective table. The Promise Zone Initiative is part of the President’s plan to partner with local communities, businesses and Tribes to create jobs, increase economic security, expand educational opportunities, increase access to quality, affordable housing and improve public safety.  To date, thirteen Promise Zones have been designated across the country; Pine Ridge is one of only two Tribal Promise Zones.  Seven more Promise Zones will be designated in and applications are currently being accepted. We know that increasingly, the community where a child grows up in impacts her odds of graduating high school, her health outcomes, and her lifetime economic opportunities. The Administration has been steadily embarking on a different approach to working with communities to ensure where a child is born never determines her destiny. The Promise Zone Initiative is one of the Administration’s community-based initiatives in action across the country.  In these places federal experts are working side by side with residents and local leaders to create customized solutions; bolstering coordination across agencies and improving how we interact with communities as a ‘one Government’ partner; and relying on valuable to help inform solutions and evaluate what’s working and what’s not. The Promise Zone designation enables USDA to work more collaboratively with other federal agencies in partnership with the Oglala Sioux and others across the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation on efforts to increase economic mobility and create opportunities across the entire region.  To view all active community-based initiatives in your community, visit www.whitehouse.gov/omb/place.

"Prescribed Fire Training Exchanges  Wildfires can negatively impact communities, as the past few years illustrate. However, many communities are surrounded by ecosystems where fire has always been a natural part of the landscape. These negative impacts can be reduced by returning fire to its natural role on the landscape, and the Forest Service uses prescribed fire to protect communities and improve landscape resilience.

"NRCS Arkansas in  Conservation  Jul 13,  The stream bank next to Deanna Young’s home after stabilization. Although raging waters had subsided at Deanna Young’s home in Ponca, Ark., a flood of emotions hit her when she found out USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) would pay 100 percent of the cost of protecting her home from falling into Adds Creek. “I couldn’t hold back the tears,” Young said. “My prayers had been answered.” After the creek flooded her property in April, washing away the stream bank next to the house where she lives with her three children, Young had qualified for help under the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program. But the program asks beneficiaries to come up with one-quarter of the cost of rebuilding after a flood damages their property. Young couldn’t afford the cost-share, and the bank turned down her loan request. The mother of three, who works a full-time job at a Christian book warehouse and also holds down two part-time jobs cleaning buildings and mowing a cemetery, wasn’t sure what to do next. But Margaret Lonadier, NRCS district conservationist for Boone and Newton counties, continued to follow up with Young—and she had an idea. Although the EWP program doesn’t normally allow NRCS to pay 100 percent of the cost of repairs to an individuals’ property, a waiver can be granted for unusual situations or circumstances. And, when the cost-share became an issue, Lonadier sent a note to Arkansas State Conservationist Mike Sullivan, who is the person authorized to pursue waivers in the state. The cost-share waiver was approved, and work began almost immediately on the Youngs’ property. It was completed in June. The project stabilized the stream bank, which is only 8 feet from Young’s house. During the flood, a 10-foot-wide by 240-foot-long swath of the stream bank was washed down Adds Creek to the Buffalo National River. Stabilizing the stream bank will not only protect the home, but will also prevent more sediment from washing into the Buffalo National River. Sediment is a major cause of water pollution. Margaret Lonadier (left), NRCS district conservationist for Boone and Newton counties, and Deanna Young discuss the work that will done to stabilize the stream bank beside Young’s house.  The bank was stacked with gabions, rectangular wire containers filled with rocks and soil. The gabions will reinforce the stream bank and act as a 9-foot-tall retaining wall protecting Young’s home.

"Posted by Doug O'Brien, Acting Under Secretary, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Technology  Oct 22,  A Matanuska Telephone Association Lineman works to bring high-speed broadband to Chickaloon and Glacier View. Photo courtesy MTA. Today, Secretary Vilsack announced over $190 million of investment in broadband projects through USDA's Community Connect program, the Public Television Digital Transition Grant, and the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program. Time and time again, we hear stories about the significant impact USDA’s investments have in the lives of hard working Americans, and we know that an investment in our rural communities is an investment in America. At the terminus of the majestic Matanuska Glacier in Southcentral Alaska sits the tiny community of Glacier View. It's better than an hour's drive northwest of Palmer, the headquarters of the Matanuska Telephone Association (MTA). With a population of fewer than 250 residents, the unincorporated community hosts a lodge, a gas station, and tourism-related businesses that provide visitors access to the massive glacier just south of  the community. Not far down the road you'll find Glacier View School, a K-12 public school that serves children in the area. Chickaloon is a half an hour down the road, and is home to tourism businesses, artisans manufacturing by hand uniquely Alaskan crafts, lodging and food, as well as the home of the Athabascan Nation Chickaloon Village. An aerial shot of the terminus of the Matanuska Glacier at Glacier View, Alaska. Photo courtesy U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service With the investment of a USDA Community Connect grant, MTA is adding Glacier View, Chickaloon, and others to the growing list of communities with access to high speed broadband. Matanuska Telephone Association was founded as a cooperative over 60 years ago, and has a service area covering over 10,000 square miles – larger than the entire state of Vermont. With a USDA Community Connect investment, and local investment from MTA, students, families, manufacturers, small businesses, and Native communities will have access to upwards of 10 Mbps upload and download speeds – that allows these very rural communities to connect and compete globally. Additionally, with the Community Connect grant, the folks that live along the Glenn Highway between Chickaloon and Glacier View will also have access to a brand new Community Connect Center providing free broadband access for the next two years. The Community Connect grant creates an opportunity for USDA to partner with our cooperatives and other public and private sector entities to provide rural residents access to advancing technology, to help educate students, and to give rural crafters and manufacturers access to a global customer base. As Secretary Vilsack said in today’s announcement, “Modern telecommunications and broadband access is as essential to the businesses and residents of Rural America as electricity was in the s.” Investing in rural America adds to the economic viability of rural communities, which strengthens the nation’s economy and helps all of America to thrive. In the words of President Obama, “Strong rural communities are key to a stronger America.” For more on how USDA investments are helping build a stronger rural America in your area, check your state fact sheet: usda.gov/opportunity.

"Farm Service Agency in  Food and Nutrition  Nov 27,  Children from Emerson Elementary School in Albuquerque, N.M., were treated to their own pumpkin, compliments of the New Mexico Farm Service Agency. More than 8,500 pumpkins were donated to schools, children’s hospitals and local food banks. What started out with just a handful of FSA employees trying to do the right thing has turned into an annual event that spans six New Mexico counties. Ten years ago John Perea, county executive director for Torrance County, N.M., started a project to glean pumpkins from farmers John and Dianne Aday. “We started it as an effort to take pumpkins that were left in the field and still in good shape, and try to get them to needy children,” said Perea, who along with other FSA employees coordinates the event each year. “We try to find schools in areas which demographically have families that are lower income and in neighborhoods with a history of drug abuse and various social problems.” Today, that effort has grown to include 200 volunteers from local Native American organizations —  Isleta, Santa Clara, Zuni, San Ildifanzo, Northern Jickarilla and Santo Domingo Pueblos — several youth organizations, students from the University of New Mexico and employees of the USDA Forest Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service and Rural Development. It took about 50 vehicles to hold more than 8,500 pumpkins gleaned this year. The pumpkins left in the field are still good, but left on the farm to rot because the farmer has either filled his contract obligations or the pumpkins didn’t meet a certain class or size. “We go into the fields after commercial harvesting is completed and we physically pick the pumpkins and load them into trailers and pickup trucks,” said Perea. “We have a great deal of success finding good pumpkins that will still make someone happy.” A group of about 200 volunteers gleaned more than 8,500 pumpkins to deliver to children in six counties throughout New Mexico. About 1,500 students in the Torrance and Albuquerque County schools had smiles on their faces as trucks pulled up and delivered pumpkins to the students. The pumpkins also made their way to pediatric units at local hospitals, the St. Felix Pantry, a local food bank and youth centers in six counties around New Mexico. University of New Mexico students carved and decorated the pumpkins and delivered them to sick children. “One day the local FSA guy called us up and asked if they could [glean the pumpkins]” said John Aday. “If it’s something that benefits the kids then I’m all for it.” John and Dianne Aday have been farming their whole lives but have a commitment to making a positive impact in their community. They plant 60-80 acres of pumpkins annually and have opened their fields for the past 10 years to help support the project. John Aday said he usually isn’t there when the actual gleaning takes place but he knows there are a lot of people participating because he sees plenty of vehicles. “I’m glad to help make a child happy,” he said. Perea feels the same way. “I think that if we are even helping one child have a brighter day, we are making a positive impact,” he said. “I have given out thousands of pumpkins, and it literally makes my heart melt every single time I see that smile on that child’s face when I hand him or her that pumpkin, and I hear them say, ‘thank you.’” Volunteers from NM FSA have watched a small gleaning project turn into a massive event that brings joy to thousands of kids around the state.

"Northern Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Nov 01,  Two students with the Youth Forest Monitoring Program monitor the impact of weeds in a meadow near Webb Lake in the Scapegoat Wilderness. Forest Service photo. In an age where technology tends to focus the attention of youth indoors, getting kids outdoors and interested in natural resource careers is even more vital today. Since , an innovative U.S. Forest Service seven-week summer program in central Montana has been achieving that goal by immersing high school students in forest management. They gather and present findings to Forest Service officials and other representatives in their local communities. Students involved with the Youth Forest Monitoring Program spend the summer monitoring the health of the national forests at a variety of different locations in the area, but one of the high points is their three-day trip into the Scapegoat Wilderness on the Helena National Forest northwest of Lincoln, Mont. Though the area isn’t far from where many of these students have grown up, the trip gives them the opportunity to experience a protected area many had never visited before. Earlier this year, 13 students along with four field instructors were there to gather on recreation impacts, water quality and document the spread of invasive weeds. “This is a highlight for the students,” says Liz Burke, the Helena National Forest program manager of the Youth Forest Monitoring Program. “It’s a three-day, two-night backpack trip where we hike in seven miles to Webb Lake for monitoring recreation impacts, and also for perfecting their monitoring skills.” In addition to measuring stream and soil health near Webb Lake, the students also visited nearby Heart Lake to look for amphibians.  The number of amphibians and the diversity of species they find can help Forest Service officials determine water quality. Laura Burns, a geographic information systems specialist with the Helena and Lewis & Clark National Forests, holds a western toad during an amphibian monitoring study at Heart Lake. Forest Service photo. Tom Pederson, a field instructor and science teacher at Capital High School in Helena, Mont., says the types of insects, fish and other species that live in the water are indicators of what students are looking for in healthy streams. “The quality of the water is based on life in the water, not drinking water, so you’re looking at chemistry, macro-invertebrates and physical features of the stream,” said Pederson. After gathering the , the students then compare their information with students have gathered in past years and later present their findings to Forest Service officials, elected officials and the public. “It’s a great opportunity, because it always seems like they take our recommendations and really look at what we’re talking about, and it makes you feel important,” said Kaitlin Martin, a senior at Helena High School who is in her third year with the program. The Youth Forest Monitoring Program is open to high school students in Lincoln, Helena and Deer Lodge and work on projects on both the Helena and Beaverhead-Deer lodge National Forests.  Students work with the Forest Service to find areas where their monitoring can help forest managers determine the impacts of natural events such as fires, floods or rock slides as well as the impacts or effectiveness of management actions. Amber Kamps, District Ranger for the Lincoln Ranger District on the Helena National Forest, says monitoring creates a feedback loop following the completion of a project on the forest. “Often times you can be working so hard at implementing all of your projects, but then you don’t get that feedback of how well those projects are being implemented, how well those treatments are actually being applied, and then what’s the response,” said Kamps. “Are we getting the response that we need? And if we aren’t getting the response we need, then maybe we need to choose something a little bit different.” The program has been incredibly successful through the years by introducing kids in high school to natural resource careers. Burke keeps in touch with alumni of the program through annual surveys, and has found that more than 60 percent of the students who have taken the program ultimately seek out a career in natural resources. At the end of the seven-week program, each of the students receives a stipend.  Youth Forest Monitoring Program is supported by a partnership with the Helena National Forest, Montana Discovery Foundation, Helena College of Technology, and generous support from local counties. Additional photos from the Youth Forest Monitoring Program’s work in the Scapegoat Wilderness are available on the U.S. Forest Service Northern Region Flickr page.

"Advisor to the Secretary for Special Projects in  Initiatives  Research and Science  Mar 06,  National CARES Mentoring Movement founder and Editor-in-Chief Emeritus, Essence magazine, Susan Taylor (red coat), met for a cross-departmental discussion with Department of Agriculture and Department of Energy personnel in the Whitten Building, U.S. Department of Agriculture, in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, February 28, . This not-for-profit organization is dedicated to recruiting and connecting mentors with local youth and mentoring organizations to help guide under-resourced children to academic and social success across the country. This discussion provided a continuation of the White House Policy in Action conference that took place in November . The focus of the discussion was about how existing federal programs and administration priorities can be leveraged with her organization, especially as it relates to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) literacy, education and rural youth. USDA Photo by Lance Cheung. Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture held a cross-departmental discussion focusing on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) literacy with Susan Taylor of the National CARES Mentoring Network. Susan Taylor, Editor-in-Chief Emeritus of Essence magazine, founded the National CARES Mentoring Network while spending time in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.  While in New Orleans, Susan said that she learned that over 50% of African American fourth graders are functionally illiterate. Susan came to USDA to explain the need for literacy training and other academic enrichment support for under-resourced children in low-income families in order to help students develop a broad range of 21st century literacy skills. During the discussion, individuals representing various federal agencies and stakeholder groups discussed ways in which existing programs and initiatives that have a youth or STEM component could be leveraged with National CARES Mentoring Network to increase STEM literacy of under-resourced youth. The discussion included agricultural science opportunities offered through USDA like the ’s Scholars Program, Ag In the Classroom and our work with 4-H.  The Summer Jobs+ initiative offered by the Department of Labor and various study abroad programs offered through the Department of State were also mentioned. Both USDA’s Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Joe Leonard and  Department of Education Deputy Assistant Secretary Jim Shelton closed the discussion by stating that it will take all levels of government, companies, foundations and non-profits, working together in partnership, to prepare America’s youth to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century.  This commitment will help provide access to and support excellence in STEM education, allowing us to out-educate and out-innovate our global competitors.

"USDA APHIS Public Affairs Specialist in  Animals  Plants  Apr 04,  Invasive feral swine have spread rapidly across the United States as a result of natural range expansion, illegal trapping and movement by people, and escapes from domestic swine operations and hunting preserves. Wild boar, razorback, feral hog, wild pig — these are just some of the names we attribute to one of the most destructive and formidable invasive species in the United States. Feral swine adapt to just about any habitat, have few natural enemies, and reproduce at high rates. As such, their population is growing rapidly nationwide. At 5 million animals and counting, feral swine are now found in at least 39 States and cause approximately $1.5 billion in damages and control costs each year. Their damage is diverse and includes destroying native habitats and crops, eating endangered species, and spreading disease. Natural resource managers, researchers and academics nationwide are grappling with how best to address the challenges of feral swine management. Feral swine are hunted by the public in some States for recreational purposes; but hunting will not solve our country’s feral swine problems. “Feral swine don’t know boundaries and what happens in one State affects neighboring States,” states APHIS’ new national feral swine initiative coordinator Dr. Dale Nolte. “Only through a concerted, comprehensive effort with the public and our State and Federal partners can we begin to turn the tide on feral swine expansion and reduce their negative impacts to our economy and environment.” The USDA and it partners hope to accomplish just that. In , APHIS Wildlife Services received $20 million from Congress to begin a collaborative, national feral swine management initiative with APHIS Veterinary Services and International Services, as well as numerous local, State, and Federal partners.  The goal of the initiative is to prevent the further spread of feral swine, as well as reduce their population, damage, and associated disease risks.  Though management efforts will occur in many different locations and habitats throughout the United States, these actions will be modified and adapted to best meet the needs and objectives of each State.  The initiative will be highlighted at the International Wild Pig Conference in Montgomery, Alabama, on April 14-16. For more information, please visit the APHIS feral swine web page. April is Invasive Plant, Pest, and Disease Awareness Month.  Learn more about APHIS Wildlife Services activities related to invasive wildlife.

"U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Apr 07,  Current range permittee Lynn Sanguinetti and Fred Wong, U.S. Forest Service district ranger, stand in front of a cabin once used by Chinese cowboys in . The cabin is on the Stanislaus National Forest. (U.S. Forest Service) The often-forgotten footprints of Chinese immigrant laborers cover the floor of America’s national forests, railroads and mines. These laborers left behind physical and cultural remnants of the past woven into the fabric of our country. The U.S. Forest Service is partnering with The Chinese American Historical Society and others to ensure the legacy of these early American immigrants is long remembered. The partnership is working on a website scheduled to launch in April that will highlight more than 50 Chinese heritage sites with self-guided tour information for destinations in California and Nevada. The partnership goal is to schedule guided tours during the summer of in both states. “Traces of Chinese history, long forgotten by many, can be found within the present day boundary of the Stanislaus National Forest,” said Lisa DeHart, a Forest Service archaeologist in California. “Chinese laborers contributed to building portions of the Columbia and Stanislaus Miners Ditch, segments of the Westside Lumber Companies railroad grade and the Big Gap Flume. “However, few people are aware that Chinese men also were cowboys, as evidenced by the Chinese names left behind on the wall of the Cooper Cabin, a high-elevation range cabin in the Emigrant Wilderness.” The retelling of these stories is important because their existence during the mid- to late-s often solicited hatred. Newspaper articles focused more on describing Chinese as foreign threats to the American workforce and editorial cartoons were often racist. In reality, many Chinese immigrants were driven from mining camps and eventually Chinatowns through intimidation, arson, violence and murder. Those who managed to survive were either returned to China or moved into larger cities. But the evidence of their hard work and dedicated contributions remain scattered across the physical landscape, in documents deep in the recesses of local historical societies and in government records. Through our research on the Stanislaus and other forests, we have found many interesting historical sites that highlight Chinese-American contributions to developing of the west. Those examples include what many would suspect: railroad tunnels, railroad and road grades, water ditches and tunnels, flumes, stone walls and corrals, battlefields, agriculture, wine cellars, lumber camps, mining camps, Chinatowns, businesses, temples, and more. The wooden Big Gap suspension flume is an example of incredible engineering for . It towered 25 stories high and spanned almost a half-mile across and brought water to the mines, ranges and farms of the surrounding communities. Only documentation remains of the flume, which rotted and was replaced by the end of that century. Hundreds of miles of stone walls built by Chinese stone masons also attest to their industry. The walls snaked through the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and were used to manage cattle on Quick Ranch in Mariposa County in the mid-s. The Forest Service and other government and non-government agencies are remembering the past and the nation’s rich historic and cultural heritage as part of Preservation50, a three-year celebration of the enactment of the National Historic Preservation Act of . The Act made the federal government a full partner and a leader in historic preservation. The Forest Service program, Windows on the Past, will explore some of the more than 370,000 recorded cultural sites on the agency’s national forests and grasslands.

"USDA Deputy Undersecretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  May 24,  Cross posted from the Let's Move! blog:  Have you cast your vote? The selection period for the Popular Choice Award in the First Lady’s Recipes for Healthy Kids competition will close soon, so it’s time to make your voice heard.  The First Lady and the U.S. Department of Agriculture launched the competition last September, challenging teams of school nutrition professionals, chefs, students, and community members to develop creative, nutritious, and kid-approved recipes that schools can easily incorporate into National School Lunch Program menus - and families can try at home. And I just want to say that I think Recipes for Healthy Kids is a really neat idea. It draws on America’s culinary creativity and our commitment to the healthy lifestyle we all aim for. Chefs are providing culinary expertise, school nutrition professionals are sharing insight as to what can be accomplished in a school setting, and kids and parents are making sure that students will choose these nutritious items in school and beyond. But back to the voting: Fifteen recipes were chosen recently (from among 340 recipes originally submitted) to move forward as semi-finalists in the competition. Schools located across America, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio and South Carolina, submitted delicious recipes in each of three categories: whole grains, dark green and orange vegetables, and dry beans and peas. Offering more of these healthful choices to children is important because we know children eat less than 20 percent of the recommended levels of dark green and orange vegetables and less than one-quarter of the recommended level of whole grains.  So these kid-friendly recipes can definitely help improve the nutrition of our kids. Choosing a winner for the Popular Choice Award won’t be easy. That’s why it’s so important that we hear from you. The recipes are posted on the Recipes for Healthy Kids website, where you can find out more these yummy entries and if there’s one from a school near you. But don’t wait.

"Moving Back to Rural America: Why Some Return Home and What Difference It Makes  Population loss persists in rural America, especially in more remote areas with limited scenic amenities. Communities in these areas are attuned to the annual out-migration of their “best and brightest” high school graduates, typically a third or more of each class. But stemming rural population loss--and spurring economic development--may depend less on retaining young adults after high school and more on attracting former residents some years later. Researchers at the University of Montana and USDA’s Economic Research Service visited 21 rural communities during and and conducted 300 interviews at high school reunions. The aim was to better understand what motivates return migration and the barriers to such moves. Reunions allowed for simultaneous interviews with both return migrants and nonreturn migrants.

"Oregon State Director, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Jul 01,  In honor of National Homeownership Month, USDA Rural Development State Director Vicki Walker (center with wheelbarrow), U.S. Representative Suzanne Bonamici (center with level), local nonprofit Community Action Team (CAT), and community leaders join first-time homeowners Jessica and Jason Smith (far right) Jessica and Jason Smith used to watch home improvement shows in which old and deteriorating houses are completely renovated. They never thought they’d be the ones giving a neglected home new life—until now. While building their dream of homeownership, they are quite literally helping revitalize a neighborhood. Last week in honor of National Homeownership Month, I joined U.S. Representative Suzanne Bonamici, local nonprofit Community Action Team (CAT), and community leaders to meet the Smiths at their work-in-progress in St. Helens, Oregon. Jessica and Jason participate in CAT’s Self-help Acquisition Rehabilitation Program (SHARP) funded with support from USDA Rural Development. The effort allows families to use their own sweat equity as down payment on a home and provides an affordable USDA mortgage for the balance. As the local partner, CAT receives USDA Mutual Self-help Housing grant funds to qualify families, identify home sites, and coordinate professional construction assistance. Before the Smiths took it on in April, the house was falling into disrepair and vandalism. “Everyone in the neighborhood knows the house and thanks us for turning it,” Jessica said. Jessica and Jason Smith have rented a small apartment for the past five years. With the arrival of their second child, the apartment is smaller than ever. They are ready for more space, a yard, and a single family home in a neighborhood setting. On top of their full-time jobs—Jessica is a veterinary technician and Jason works at a service station—the Smiths put in 30 hours a week renovating their new single family home. They are doing everything from roofing and siding to the ventilation system and plumbing. Community Action Team estimates the full rehab project would cost $80,000 if done by a private contractor. While most USDA Mutual Self-help Housing programs across the nation focus on new construction, CAT wanted to address issues with homes that were foreclosed and abandoned during the recent housing crisis. In St. Helens, like many rural small towns, the housing recovery is taking longer than in surrounding urban areas. Lingering impacts include the blight that follows when multiple vacant homes in a neighborhood are left to deteriorate and attract nuisances like vandals and squatters that lower everyone’s property values. Additionally, as CAT executive director Jim Tierney explains, many single family homes have been sitting empty while rental housing has become scarce. “We’ve seen a less than one-percent vacancy rate in St. Helens for apartments and a three- to four-year wait for low-income rental units.” Helping working families who are financially ready transition into homeownership, like the Smiths, not only breathes new life into neighborhoods, but also frees up scarce rental housing. At the same time, the first-time homebuyers are building equity and personal assets through homeownership and home improvements.   Jessica and Jason expect to complete renovations and move in later this summer. The cozy home has three bedrooms and a playroom for five-year-old Dereck and baby Harper. “Our son asks for a dog every year for Christmas—not a stuffed dog, but a real one,” Jessica said. “Now, we can get one!”  Category/Topic:  Rural  Tags:  homeownership  Mutual Self-Help Housing grant  National Homeownership Month  Oregon  RD  Self Help Housing","Here is a concise question related to the content: What is the primary goal of the USDA Mutual Self-help Housing program in St. Helens, Oregon, as highlighted during National Homeownership Month?","The primary goal of the USDA Mutual Self-help Housing program in St. Helens, Oregon, is to help working families who are financially ready transition into homeownership, thereby revitalizing neighborhoods and freeing up scarce rental housing."
"Alaska Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Mar 29,  Two yellow cedar trees have fallen victim to the yellow cedar decline; the smaller tree on the right recently died, the larger tree on the left is slowly dying. U.S. Forest Service photo by Mary Stensvold. Yellow-cedar is an ecologically, culturally, and economically important tree species in the coastal temperate rainforests of Alaska and British Columbia. This slow-growing tree has few natural insect and disease agents and is capable of living more than years. But less snow in Alaska’s winters is leading to the demise of yellow cedar trees at and just above sea level. During hard freezes when little or no snow is on the ground to insulate the yellow cedar’s shallow roots, the roots freeze. Ultimately this leads to the tree’s death. This yellow cedar decline has occurred over the past 100 years. This winter here has been particularly warm. At sea level, rain rather than snow has dominated the precipitation. Instead of crisp, snowy winter days, we’re experiencing soggy, drippy weather. The temperature is warm enough that the early blueberries are beginning to flower. Because this is very early for flowering, a hard freeze later in the winter could destroy the budding plants and threaten the berry crop. Early blueberry is budding out in mid-February in southeastern Alaska. U.S. Forest Service photo by Mary Stensvold. Winters in southeastern Alaska and the Tongass National Forest are typically heralded by a series of storm systems that roll in from the west, often remnants of collapsing typhoons that originate in the tropics and carry a large amount of moisture. These storms are in part responsible for our glaciated landscape and temperate rainforest, and the wind disturbance ecology on both small and large scales. As soon as the storms hit the Alaska coast and mountains, the air lifts, cools and then a supercharge of precipitation drops ­rain at low elevations and snow higher up. These storms often retain their cyclonic form and can generate hurricane force winds. This year the big weather systems tended to arrive in Alaska further to the west than usual, sparing the southeastern portion of the state its usual scary storms. Normally in January and February we have three or so periods of clear, cold weather. However, this year we experienced that clear, relatively cold weather in November. Some have characterized this mild weather as a “Puget Sound” winter. What are the current winter conditions?  Live views of weather throughout Alaska are available on the Federal Aviation Administration’s website of Alaska airport cameras. On this website you can also see views of Tongass and Chugach National Forest lands. Mary Stensvold is the regional botanist in the Forest Service’s Alaska Region.

"How FNS Partners Take Their Summer Feeding Sites to the Next Level  USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service partners serve a vital role in the success of the federal Summer Food Service Program (SFSP).  These important relationships are critical to helping operate and expand summer meals and sites so that no child or teen goes hungry when school is out. Evaluating their best practices and listening to their anecdotes confirms that kids truly depend on these healthy meals over the course of the summer.  During the first day of the summer feeding program, the Hopkins County Family YMCA in Kentucky served over 500 meals.  But that’s not the only difference they made that day.  The director was at the store picking up supplies, when the cashier asked about her purchase.  The director explained the details of the program and the woman’s eyes filled with tears, as she relayed that her husband just lost his job and the family had become desperate.  She was put at ease knowing that the Summer Food Service Program will be available to feed her children this summer.  Kristin Caulley, Program Analyst, USDA Food and Nutrition Service  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 11,   Respond to this story",What anecdote shared by a cashier at the Hopkins County Family YMCA in Kentucky illustrates the vital role of the Summer Food Service Program in supporting families during times of economic hardship?,"The anecdote shared by the cashier is that she and her husband had become desperate after he lost his job, but was put at ease knowing that her children would be able to receive meals through the Summer Food Service Program this summer."
"U.S. Department of Agriculture in  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Initiatives  Jun 28,  FAO's Director-General elect José Graziano Da Silva. A Dialogue on Women in Agriculture: Where to after SOFA?

Copyright ©FAO. Editorial use only. Photo credit: ©FAO/Alessandra Benedetti This week, I joined my colleagues from all over the world for the 37th Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Rome. This bi-annual conference brings together world leaders in food and agriculture to discuss important issues related to agriculture, forestry, and global food security. This year’s conference is of particular significance as delegates elected a new Director-General, Jose Graziano da Silva of Brazil, to replace Jacques Diouf of Senegal, who has served in the position since . The United States thanks Dr. Diouf for his hard work and dedication during his time as the Director General.  We are confident that Dr. Graziano da Silva will continue the ongoing reform effort to ensure that FAO is a strong, vibrant organization capable of tackling the challenges before us. At this year’s meeting, ‘Women in Agriculture’ is the central theme and I am joined here by Melanne Verveer, U.S. Department of State’s Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women’s Issues, and Ertharin Cousin, Ambassador, U.S. Mission to the U.N. Agencies, as part of the U.S. delegation. In , I had the great honor of being the first woman to chair this meeting. This year, the conference focused on the important role of women in agriculture. FAO emphasize that closing the gender gap in agriculture would greatly benefit the agriculture sector and society as a whole.  If women had the same access to knowledge, resources, and leadership roles as men, they could increase yields on their farms by as much as 30 percent. Production gains of this magnitude could reduce hunger for as many as 150 million people. Obviously, women play a key role in the fight against hunger and poverty.  We look forward to working closely with Dr. Graziano da Silva to ensure that the FAO continues to reform and push for more sustainable agricultural development, greater access to nutritional crops and more opportunities for women, particularly small-holder farmers, to receive the technical capacity and training support that are to participate in the agricultural sector. As FAO begins a new era in its history, we remain committed to supporting the organization, its continuing reforms, and its critical work combating hunger around the globe.

The Directory, voluntarily updated by farmers market managers, state departments of agriculture, marketing associations, and others, is published online at farmersmarkets.usda.gov. This year, the Directory has been upgraded to include a new Application Programming Interface (API) that improves customer access to farmers market .""Farmers markets are an important public face for agriculture and a critical part of our nation's food system,"" said Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""They provide benefits not only to the farmers looking for important income opportunities, but also help fill a growing consumer demand for fresh, healthy foods. In recent years, USDA has stepped up efforts to support local and regional marketing opportunities for producers, including a modernized Farmer's Market Directory to help connect farmers, consumers, communities, and businesses around the country.""USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) Administrator Anne Alonzo spoke at Saturday's farmers market celebration at Washington, D.C.'s Columbia Heights Marketplace announcing the newly updated National Farmers Market Directory information.""Due to consumer demand for local food we are seeing an increase in the diversity of market offerings, and more participation from small businesses and farms,"" Agricultural Marketing Service Administrator Anne Alonzo said. ""This year we are focusing on the sustainability and maturity of farmers markets- keeping new and old markets thriving and improving. Farmers markets around the country continue to be popular social events for families and communities.""Local food and direct marketing opportunities, including farmers markets, are one of the fastest growing segments of agriculture.

"USDA Farm to School Program in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Initiatives  Oct 17,   Cheney Public Schools (CPS) is a 7-school district in rural eastern Washington State. Of the 4,135 students who attend CPS, more than 2,000 are eligible for free and reduced price school lunch, and more than 30 percent are obese. Several years ago, realizing the need to improve child nutrition, the district began to take some modest steps to that end, including initiating a scratch cooking program and participating in a regional childhood obesity prevention initiative. Upon receiving a USDA Farm to School Planning Grant in November , CPS developed an eight-member team, comprised of school district officials and community partners, to lead their efforts. The group, which meets every four to six weeks, has done extensive research to determine the most effective path forward and has leveraged relationships with a range of partners to accomplish a great deal in a short period of time. In just the first half of the grant period, Cheney initiated conversations with two regional produce distributors who have indicated that they are able to supply the district with Washington-grown fruits and vegetables, and a commodity retailer who can offer CPS Washington-grown lentils. Through these relationships, they were able to launch a Harvest of the Month Program and begin offering local products on their lunch line daily. To complement these changes in the cafeteria, CPS has also established a robust farm to school curriculum that includes field trips to a local farm; a Harvest of the Month taste test program with a supplementary parent education piece; a planned Your State on Your Plate lunch event that will offer outreach to students, parents, community leaders and the media; a Chefs in School Food Science program at the middle schools; and integration of nutrition and agricultural reading materials into the K-12 core. The district works closely with the City of Cheney and its Let’s Move Cheney Coalition to partner on a number of initiatives that promote health and nutrition in their community. They have also enlisted the help of the Washington State University Extension, the Spokane Conservation District, and the Washington Sustainable Food and Farming Network to help with various aspects of their project. At USDA our goal is to create more Cheneys: more districts that have the resources, confidence, energy, and creative ideas to bring their communities together, enrich the bodies and minds of their students, and support the vital agricultural enterprises in their region. Editor’s Note: The USDA Farm to School website offers resources on how to start a farm to school program in your area.

"USDA Facilities Energy & Water Program Manager in  Energy  Conservation  Mar 28,   Did you know that USDA manages 193 million acres of land; occupies approximately 89 million square feet of office and laboratory space and operates over 23,000 buildings?  And if this isn’t enough, USDA also operates a fleet of over 40,000 motor vehicles and equipment. Photo of green roof on court 5 of the South Building. Saves energy and reduces excessive stormwater runoff (which supports our efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay). With statistics like these, it is no wonder that USDA remains focused on reducing its rather significant environmental footprint by using clean energy while working towards improving the environment.   To accomplish this, USDA conducts its operations in a sustainable manner, complies with environmental laws and regulations and walks its talk. In order to realize these goals, USDA works on many fronts to: Reduce its reliance on nonrenewable energy by improving energy conservation; Increase efficiency and promote renewable energy projects and programs; Support green transportation and travel practices that reduce harmful emissions; Increase operational and fuel efficiency; and Reduce nonrenewable fuel use. To better coordinate this effort and build on past success, the Department created the USDA Sustainable Operations Council.  This Council includes representatives from each USDA mission area which represents each of USDA’s agencies.  The efforts of the Council are supported through several other groups, specifically, USDA’s Asset Management Council, Procurement Council, employee green teams and various workgroups throughout the Department. Photo of one of our new “Cool Roofs” (made from biobased materials) at the USDA HQ Complex Facility - helps save energy. Green teams embody USDA’s efforts to achieve sustainable operations at the grass roots level.  A USDA green team is a group of employees, regardless of discipline or organizational level, specifically chartered by leadership to promote and foster sustainable operations that reduce a unit’s environmental footprint.  For example, some successes which can be attributed to USDA green teams include: Reductions in electricity use by seven percent and natural gas use by 26 percent in the Pike-San Isabel National Forest; and Installing electric steam kettles and electric hot water heaters within the USDA Headquarters Complex for summer mode use which yielded an annual savings of $194,000. And another success can be illustrated through USDA’s energy initiative, the “USDA Unplugged Challenge,” which was designed to bring awareness to USDA employees about the energy usage and waste that occurs at the USDA facilities during the evenings and on weekends.  The “USDA Unplugged Challenge” demonstrated that employees can make a significant difference in reducing electric consumption and costs. USDA energy managers found that employees within the Headquarters Complex were able to reduce electric use by 9,000 kilowatt-hours in a 24 hour period during the work week and by 24,000 kilowatt-hours over the weekend during the “USDA Unplugged Challenge.” USDA has synergistically combined its strategic plans and policies with the services that the U.S. Department of Energy’s Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) provides to create effective management tools and energy initiatives.  Examples include FEMP-sponsored Energy Savings Performance Contracts and Utility Energy Service Contracts, green power purchase agreements, internal USDA Agency scorecards, corporate energy management systems and environmental management systems.  Specific energy initiatives entail increasing the use of alternative transportation fuels, procuring more energy efficient replacement vehicles, performing facility energy evaluations and strategically disseminating energy-related outreach and awareness materials. The Forest Service is building net-zero energy installations, including the San Dimas Technology and Development Center, shown. As you can see, USDA is working hard at reducing its environmental footprint, however there still is much more work to do.  For example, in the future USDA plans to: Reduce GHG emissions from USDA operations by 21 percent by (compared to base year); Increase use of energy performance-based contracting investments by $5 million over the next 2 years; Complete energy evaluations of USDA’s most energy-intensive facilities by July 1, ; and Increase alternative-fuel use in fleet vehicles by 10 percent by .

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Minnesota, District Conservationist in  Conservation  May 09,  The western prairie fringed orchid is one of Minnesota’s 43 wild orchids. Photo by Ben Sullivan. Used with permission. My family and I enjoy natural scavenger hunts. When we explore the landscape surrounding our Norman County farm, we teach each other about the birds, animals and plants we see. It’s fun to search for native wildflowers. It’s even more fun to spot something rare. Recently, through a school project for my son, we learned about Minnesota’s many wild orchids. Our state is home to 43 different orchids. Who knew? We learned Minnesota is the only state with an orchid as its state flower. We also learned we live in close proximity to suitable habitat for a very special wildflower – the western prairie fringed orchid. We’re planning to search for this unique flower this summer. This week, we celebrate National Wildflower Week as a way to share our interest and to increase public awareness for wildflowers in the landscape, including the fringed orchid. The fringed orchid has flowers on a stalk, or raceme. The stalks grow two to four feet tall, boasting up to 40 white flowers about an inch long. The flower’s lower lip has three lobes that fan out and are delicately fringed. The fringed orchid is federally listed as threatened and in Minnesota as endangered because of loss of habitat. The orchid prefers to grow on higher, drier slopes of moist swales in full sunlight. Even though these treasures enjoy the sun, they do not flower in dry areas or during times of drought.  They are pollinated primarily by hawk moths. The fringed orchid’s prime habitat in Minnesota is in Glacial Ridge, the nation’s largest prairie wetland restoration project. The project area located in northwestern Minnesota is more than 24,000 acres. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has worked with private landowners to restore native vegetation and wetlands through conservation programs since the s. Much of the land was enrolled into easements through the former Wetlands Reserve Program, now the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program. In this program, private landowners voluntarily choose to restore wetlands on their land. The Nature Conservancy purchased the land in and cooperatively worked with NRCS and more than 30 partnering groups to restore the land to prairie wetland habitat. In , Glacial Ridge was designated a national wildlife refuge. Glacial Ridge now provides habitat for numerous prairie wildlife and threatened prairie plants like the fringed orchid. I’m excited for my family’s upcoming expedition to Glacial Ridge. Why not conduct a natural scavenger hunt of your own by identifying as many wildflowers as you can? Happy hunting!

"Changing Climate Is Affecting Agriculture in the U.S. The changing climate presents real threats to U.S. agricultural production, forest resources, and rural economies. These threats have significant implications not just for farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners, but for all Americans. Land managers across the country are already feeling the pressures of a changing climate and its effects on weather. As these risks continue and amplify, producers will be faced with the challenges of adapting. Some of these risks are:  More severe storms - NOAA reported that was the second most intense year in our history for extreme weather events.  Rising average temperatures - Higher temperatures mean increases in invasive species and costs for weed and pest control.  Extremes in precipitation - In the Northeast, heavier, more intense rains threaten to reduce yields. In the Southwest, increased drought poses a challenge to nut, fruit and vegetable producers.  More forest fires - The fire season is 60 days longer than it was 30 years ago. A recent Forest Service study predicts that the number of acres susceptible to fires could double by . Preparing for Increased Weather Risks Regional Climate Hubs In an effort to mitigate climate-related risks, USDA has established seven regional hubs for risk adaptation and mitigation to climate change. These Hubs will deliver science-based knowledge and practical information to farmers, ranchers and forest landowners on a regional basis to support decision-making related to changing climate. The Hubs will provide:  Technical support for land managers to respond to drought, heat stress, floods, pests, and changes in the growing season.  Assessments and regional forecasts for hazard and adaptation planning to provide more time to prepare.  Outreach and education for farmers, ranchers and forest landowners on ways to mitigate risks and thrive despite change. For more information on the Hubs, visit the USDA Climate Hubs Webpage. Climate Solutions at USDA USDA is taking steps to create modern solutions to the challenge of climate change.

"Secretary's Column: A New Food, Farm and Jobs Bill to Fight Hunger Here at Home  America’s farmers and ranchers work hard every day to put healthy food on our tables. Thanks to their incredible productivity, we have the capacity to produce enough food not only for every American family, but for much of the world. In a nation with such an abundance of food resources, it is unthinkable and unacceptable that any American go hungry. Unfortunately, even as the economy recovers and more Americans get back to work, millions of hardworking folks still need help putting food on the table.

"Agricultural Marketing Service Deputy Associate Administrator in  Research and Science  Feb 12,  Currently a proposal for an Organic R&P is getting closer to Step 1 in the creation process. While a proposal has not been formally submitted to USDA, a proponent group is working with stakeholders to develop a draft. USDA photo courtesy of Sam Jones-Ellard. We often talk about the many ways research and promotion (R&P) programs benefit both ag industries and the consumer. Our nation’s farmers and ranchers leverage these programs and the pooled resources they collect to help overcome marketing barriers and connect with consumers. R&P programs are self-help initiatives that are national in scope and funded by the industry to help these businesses continue to strengthen their rural economies and the communities they support. To form a new R&P, there are specific steps that the industry and USDA follow:  STEP 1: A proponent submits a proposal to USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), which oversees all national R&P programs. The proposal typically includes an analysis of the industry, the program’s objective, and its potential impact on small businesses. While there are specific requirements needed for a proposal, the proponent can tailor the proposed program to best meet a specific industry’s needs. For example, some proposals include different eligibility requirements to vote in their referendums or an exemption for small producers, handlers and importers. STEP 2: USDA publishes the proposal in the Federal Register, soliciting public comments so that prevailing industry thoughts are incorporated into the final program. This is important because these programs will use pooled resources from across the industry to invest in creative marketing campaigns and innovative research projects that will support all of the industry’s growers, handlers, processors, manufacturers and importers. STEP 3: After the comment period ends, USDA reviews and analyzes the comments to determine whether the program has merit to move forward. STEP 3a: If a review of comments shows general consensus or agreement among the industry stakeholders, USDA moves forward with the proposal and a second proposed rule is published in the Federal Register to announce a referendum so the industry can vote on the rule. STEP 3b: If a review of the public comments suggests that a proposal needs to be re-evaluated, there are two options:  1) if the comments suggest a need to adjust parts of the proposal, a supplemental proposed rule can be published to modify parts of the proposal and request that the industry provides further comments; 2) the proposal is terminated. STEP 4: USDA conducts a referendum, allowing eligible parties to vote on whether or not the measure is approved. STEP 5: If the referendum is approved by the eligible voters within the industry, USDA issues a final rule implementing the program. For proposals that request a delayed referendum, the program will be announced as a final rule with a referendum to be held at a later date. STEP 6: Nominations from the industry are collected and a board is appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture to represent the interests of the entire industry. USDA seeks nominations from the industry for board members and alternates. These steps are intended to help the farmers and businesses establish a framework that will work across an entire industry and make the broadest positive impact for everyone involved.  Industry research and promotion programs have played an important role in shaping the agricultural landscape and yielding positive results for farmers and businesses throughout the country. For example, when research supports adding lean pork to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension – or DASH – eating plan, it helps consumers create healthy menus to meet their nutritional needs and it helps pork producers connect with a larger consumer base. And an August economic analysis found a return on investment (ROI) of $8.87 for every dollar the peanut industry invested into the National Peanut Board activities over the last 5 years. These are just a couple of ways that research and promotion programs are making a positive contribution for our nation’s agricultural businesses. USDA is committed to supporting these industry-driven programs, and ensuring that they address the needs and help meet the challenges faced by today’s farmers and agricultural businesses.

"Gardens Unit Leader, U.S. National Arboretum in  Research and Science  Nov 01,  Fothergilla leaves make the transition from green to red in the National Herb Garden at the U.S. National Arboretum. (Photo credit U.S. National Arboretum) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Like a lot of people, I remember being taught when I was young that the brilliant autumn foliage of deciduous trees was caused by the cold temperatures of autumn frosts.  I believed this until I became a horticulturist, studying the intricate system that plants use to prepare for winter’s harsh weather.  Where I work, at the U.S. National Arboretum, we grow about 10,000 different kinds of trees and shrubs and have an overwhelming variety of fall color right now. Daylength (or more correctly, the length of nights) is the real cause of trees’ transition to autumn .  (Read more here about how longer nights translate into the vibrant color of autumn.) So what role does frost play in the changing color of autumn leaves?  Frost actually ruins vivid fall by causing cells in the leaf to rupture and die. The appearance of fall shifts each year due to weather. Heavy cloud cover limits ultraviolet light, so the chlorophyll lasts longer, and leaves stay green longer. High night temperatures cause cells to burn accumulated sugars, so less red and purple pigments are formed and yellow and orange are the predominant . Drought stress or a windy interlude cause leaves to drop prematurely. The ideal conditions are warm, sunny days and cool nights with little wind or drought stress. At the Arboretum, you can watch this process in action through the course of many months this time of year. Dogwoods begin to turn in late September, and Chinese fringetree ends its show of in early December. Even some of our herbaceous plants have great fall color—most notably the willow amsonia, which you will find near the Capital Columns with ‘Raydon’s Favorite’ asters that are in full bloom right now, also in response to the longer nights of autumn. Willow amsonia blooms in late spring. There’s a lot to enjoy about the changes autumn brings to the plants around us. Come to the Arboretum and see it.  If you’d like to learn more about fall color, attend my lecture on the topic at the U.S. National Arboretum from 1-2 pm on Nov. 5, followed by a fall color tour led by Horticulturist Mariya Navazio. With sunny weather forecast this week, maples, hickories, and oaks will be at or near peak fall color.

"Chief, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Oct 21,  NRCS Chief Weller talks with partners, conservation agencies and landowners during a conservation tour in Illinois. When USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) launched the Regional Conservation Partnership Program, (RCPP) we envisioned a program that would help local and diverse organizations to accelerate innovation, bring new partners to the table, and demonstrate the value and effectiveness of voluntary, private lands conservation to a national audience. The response was tremendous! More than 5,000 partners submitted nearly 600 pre-proposals from all 50 states and each critical conservation area. The total amount of NRCS funding requested was more than six times what was available. About $2.7 billion in federal assistance was requested, but incredibly these partnerships offered about $2.9 billion in leveraged conservation funding and in-kind support to deliver their projects. In the end, NRCS has about $394 million in total funding to co-invest in projects during this first signup. The sheer magnitude of the response we received was both rewarding and energizing. It shows that communities and partnerships are motivated and excited about investing in the long-term success of farming and ranching by protecting and improving the health of our soils, abundance and quality of our water, and quality of wildlife habitat. As of the deadline for submitting final proposals earlier this month, we are pleased that about 210 partnerships submitted full proposals. We are now reviewing those proposals and will announce selections in November, and we are looking forward to getting to work this fall and launching the successful projects. RCPP, one of the Farm Bill’s new conservation programs, has provided us a unique opportunity to extend our reach and work with both core partners and new groups that are as devoted to conservation as we are.

As part of National Volunteer Week, NRCS is celebrating the contributions of volunteers like Stetz that help the agency advance the conservation mission through Earth Team. Stetz, a graduate student in wetland ecology at the State University of New York at Brockport, donated more than 900 hours to NRCS through the agency’s Earth Team volunteer program. “Volunteers are an integral part of our agency,” NRCS District Conservationist Heath Eisele said. “In a one-employee field office, every bit of assistance helps.” Stetz worked closely under Eisele’s supervision assisting with many of the day-to-day operations of the office, including compliance reviews, highly erodible land slope measurements, construction checks and wetland plant identification. “She helped us with so many different projects, it was like having another NRCS position on staff,” Eisele said. She took the lead in creating a map guide of the Tonawanda Creek watershed and revised a guide on another creek watershed. These are used to show visitors and residents boat launch areas, fishing locations and other attractions within the watershed. When she wasn’t in the field, Stetz was offering top-notch computer support with geographic information systems, or GIS, and developed innovative techniques for identifying potential natural resource concerns. She conducted the annual monitoring of seven wetland easement sites throughout Genesee County, N.Y. Her knowledge of wetland plant identification and hydrology was critical to the success of the project, Eisele said. Her volunteer work helped her with her master’s thesis in wetland ecology.

"USDA Forest Service Climate Change Advisor in  Forestry  Research and Science  Sep 21,   This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.  On July 20, the Forest Service announced a new system for integrating consideration of climate change into agency operations. This system is based on our Strategic Framework for Responding to Climate Change, adopted by leadership in , and tiers to the new USDA strategic plan that emphasizes forest resilience to climate change. Our climate change performance system is anchored by three tools – a national Roadmap, a Performance Scorecard, and the Climate Change Resource Center (CCRC). Each of these tools has full leadership support and commitment. The Roadmap outlines sets of ongoing, short-term, and longer-term actions that will enhance the resiliency of our ecological and human systems to climate-driven changes. The Scorecard breaks our accountability into four dimensions – agency capacity, engagement (partnerships/education), adaptation, and mitigation/sustainable consumption. The CCRC, now a national resource, provides information and tools to support performance and innovation. All National Forests and Grasslands will assess their response to climate change using the questions in the Scorecard. The national office is developing guidance that will be completed by the end of the calendar year. After the release of this guidance, forests and grasslands will complete a reference assessment for the Scorecard. Regions, research stations, and national program offices will also take stock of what they are already doing and what they plan to do, allowing us to develop a coherent national picture and to identify resource, technology, policy, or other gaps that we need to fill. The Scorecard was built on three principles: balance, flexibility, and accountability. Balance in our climate change response – reflected in the four dimensions of the scorecard – means that the elements of the scorecard support one another and that we can’t go off the deep end with a single emphasis. For example, we can’t mitigate greenhouse gas emissions through forest management without also adapting to climate change. This is because the role of our nation’s forests in the carbon cycle depends on sustained health and is intertwined with so many other ecosystem services. Another example is the balance and integration between agency capacity and engagement. We can’t create enough impact unless we engage partners on a landscape scale around a shared vision. We also need to balance engagement, adaptation, and mitigation with agency capacity. The success with which we adapt to climate change and help mitigate emissions depends on employee awareness, a strong connection between science and forest management, and actions based on well-informed judgment. Flexibility means that this system was not meant to be one-size-fits-all. The impacts of climate change and the options for responding vary regionally and across the rural to urban spectrum. Forests must be able to respond to these unique patterns and problems. The flexibility to operate at the most effective scales and across traditional boundaries will be vital. Some of the tools for dealing with the pervasive influence of climate change may be better developed at the regional or even national level. It may be inefficient and inconsistent for each forest to devise vulnerability assessments, adaptation and carbon management strategies, and landscape-level partnerships. These foundational actions are probably better done at the multi-forest or regional level. This will take coordination and a strong partnership between the national forest system, state and private forestry, and the research stations. This story has two parts.

"Food and Nutrition  May 21,   A few short weeks week ago we announced an exciting partnership with the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) to kindle innovation and creativity and offering unique opportunities for Apps for Healthy Kids contestants.  Now the excitement is about to begin. Later today, Game Jams will kick off nationwide to provide support and feedback for designers and developers as they create games and apps with a nutrition focus for the competition. The game jams will draw game developers, graphic artists, and local youth together to brainstorm ideas and produce video game prototypes from scratch in just 48 hours. Adding to the buzz, U.S. Chief technology Officer Aneesh Chopra will be on hand this afternoon at the George Mason University Game Jam to open the weekend of innovation. Tune in later this evening to watch his call to action and get the creativity flowing. His opening remarks will be streamed live at 5pm here.  As many of you followers of the game scene know, the Apps for Healthy Kids competition challenges software developers, game designers, students, and other innovators to develop innovative, fun, and engaging tools and games that help kids and their parents eat better and be more physically active. Prizes totaling $60,000 will be awarded to the entries that are voted the best by a panel of expert judges. This weekend’s jams will offer a great opportunity for amateur and professional developers to share ideas and make great progress on their submissions. The prototypes created during the jams will be displayed at the sixth annual Games for Health Conference, May 26-27, in Boston, further refined, and submitted to the Apps for Healthy Kids competition before the June 30th deadline.
