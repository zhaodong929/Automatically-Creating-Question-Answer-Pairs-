"Trashy Life: Crayfish Turn Rubbish into a Home  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. To raccoons, snakes and opossums, crayfish look pretty tasty, and large crayfish will even cannibalize their smaller kin. Crayfish, which live in rivers and streams, need instream cover to hide from all their predators. They also use cover to find food, to shelter while incubating eggs, and to keep themselves from being washed away in floods. Susan Adams, a fisheries research scientist for the Forest Service’s Southern Research Station, examined different types of cover in the Yazoo River basin of Mississippi to see whether crayfish used large pieces of household trash for shelter when natural cover was limited. Her findings recently appeared in the journal Environmental Management.  Sarah Farmer, Southern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Jun 03,   Respond to this story",What types of cover do crayfish use for shelter and survival?,"Crayfish use large pieces of household trash as well as natural cover such as rocks, logs, and vegetation for shelter and survival."
"Public Affairs Director, USDA Food and Nutrition Service, Western Region in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Jan 19,  Fremont Elementary School students at Chefs Move to Schools program kick off. Cross-posted from the Let's Move! blog: Earlier this fall, in conjunction with International Chefs Day, Chef Melinda Burrows had the opportunity to team with Fremont Elementary School in Alhambra, California, to help launch their Chefs Move to Schools program. They did so in grand style. With three school assemblies focusing on harvests, the popular event centered around chef-led demonstrations featuring spaghetti squash, pumpkins, and other varieties of healthful foods. Chef Burrows said she became involved with the Chefs Move to Schools program by simply answering First Lady Michelle Obama’s call to service.  Through the initiative, the First Lady has encouraged chefs to adopt a school and work with teachers, parents, school nutritionists and administrators to help educate kids about food and nutrition. The Morrison Senior Living executive chef, who works in the school’s community, chose Freemont for several reasons: “As an Executive Chef I love teaching others, especially children, about healthy and nutritious foods and how to cook them.  I know that little minds are sponges and can be inspired to do amazing things, like learning how to cook.  My Grandma Sendejar was the one who inspired me to learn when I was six years old.  I wish to give back what was so freely given to me.” Her story is not unique, as chefs across the country have been motivated to take their unique talents to benefit young, hungry minds in our nation’s schools. Chef Burrows also happens to be the parent of an eighth grade student at Fremont Elementary School.  Her son has shown great interest in following in his mother’s footsteps.  Along with her other three children and husband, the family has always shared a love of eating good, nutritious food.  And this collective love of cuisine made the program a natural fit for her expertise. “Earlier this summer before the American Culinary Federation (ACF) National Convention, I participated in a community service event with the Chef and Child Foundation.  A group of chefs spent the day at Hermosa Village, a low-income housing development, working with the families through four food stations.  The focus was on healthy and nutritious eating.  It was an inspiring day which lead me to the Chefs Move to Schools program.” Last month, Burrows planned a chef demo and an on-site registration for the Chefs Move to Schools program to engage other principals in the program.  Thanks to her passion, more school leaders will likely follow her selfless lead.

"AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow, USDA Office of the Chief Scientist and Ann-Marie Thro, National Program Leader for Plant Breeding and Genetic Resources, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Oct 17,  Plant breeding continues to support higher production, delivering diverse cornucopia crops for generations to come. It’s that time of year again when many of us adorn our homes with autumn décor, and our tables with the bounties of a fall harvest. Consider the cornucopia. This centerpiece is symbolic of the food and thanks that we share with our friends and family. Inside, we find examples of grains, fruits, and vegetables – familiar crops that have occupied places at our tables for generations. We continue to enjoy foods made from these crops today, largely due to plant breeding efforts over the past century that significantly expanded their diversity and productivity. Plant breeding is the human-aided development of new plant varieties with important characteristics such as drought or pest resistance. It is one of agriculture’s most effective tools for ensuring food security and the adaptability of crops to changing conditions. Take grains, for instance. These iconic components of many cornucopias and fall harvests in the U.S. are some of our most important food crops. Over the past century, plant breeders from USDA and its land-grant university and private partners developed more productive and drought resistant corn. Similarly, USDA researchers working with universities and international partners developed more productive and disease-resistant wheat. These efforts contributed to what is known as the ‘Green Revolution,’ which is estimated to have saved over one billion people worldwide from starvation. If we were to take a fruit from our cornucopia, say grapes, we would see a similar story where plant breeders have produced many new varieties of disease-resistant table grapes. And the same is true for vegetables. Since , extensive plant breeding research by USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and its university partners has produced over 115 new disease-resistant and productive onion varieties. Plant breeding programs remain just as active and important today for creating a food secure and adaptable agricultural system as they were during the Green Revolution. For example, in collaboration with ARS scientists, researchers at Washington State and Cornell Universities are currently in the process of breeding exciting and delicious new varieties of apples. This year, as we celebrate the harvest, let us also remember the care and agricultural research that helped to create this bounty.

"O'Brien in  Rural  Jun 02,  The Riggio family was able to purchase their home in Newville, Pennsylvania, with a loan from USDA Rural Development’s Self-Help Housing Loan Program. As we celebrate National Homeownership Month this June, I am reminded how USDA delivers positive outcomes ‘Every Day, Every Way’ through the comprehensive programs and services that touch the lives of every American. While many people think of USDA in terms of food, farms and forestry, nearly 3.4 million families over the past 65 years have found the affordable financing they needed to become homeowners through USDA Rural Development. In alone, more than 170,000 rural residents became homeowners with the help of Rural Development’s direct loans, guaranteed loans, grants and technical assistance. In both people and dollars, was the most successful year on record in the history of USDA’s single-family housing programs. President Obama has said the true engine of America’s economic growth is a rising and thriving middle class. For most Americans, a home is the largest single investment they will make — and the largest asset they will hold — in their lifetime. A home is a life-changing rung on the ladder of opportunity as families work toward a brighter financial future. Homeownership helps build equity, assets, and long-term financial security — the foundation for upward mobility. During National Homeownership Month, please join us as we celebrate these rural families who, with USDA’s help, have invested in their future through a home of their own.

"APHIS Administrator in  Animals  Plants  Jun 16,   I’m Dr. Gregory Parham and I’m the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).  As a proud member of the veterinary profession, I’m happy to share with you that has been declared World Veterinary Year in honor of the 250th anniversary of the founding of the first official school of veterinary medicine. The veterinary profession is one I have been close to for decades.  In fact, my father served as a veterinarian for APHIS.  During his career, he worked in the field, assisted in disease eradication efforts, and even worked internationally.  Seeing what he did every day was a strong influence on me.  I learned early in life that becoming a veterinarian could be an interesting career.  I followed through with my goal of studying veterinary medicine and have determined that I was right.  Being a veterinarian is most certainly an interesting and fulfilling career, one that has exposed me to all sorts of experiences and opportunities. As a vet trainee, I was in central Florida testing cattle for brucellosis.  That wasn’t the hard part.  To this day, the scariest moment of my veterinary career had to be learning to watch for alligators while I was out doing tests.  Later in my career, I was working in the field as an epidemiologist on a disease outbreak investigation.  The blood samples I took from horses led to the isolation of a new virus. Work such as this is challenging and rewarding for me and for the APHIS veterinarians that help protect animal and human health every day.  I would like you to know more about the work they perform in every state across America and internationally. To that end, we’ll be celebrating World Veterinary Year throughout by shining the spotlight on all that our veterinarians do.  Over the next several months, other members of the APHIS veterinary community will be sharing their own stories in this blog space. We have quite a diverse group – both in their backgrounds and in the work they do on a daily basis.  I’m honored to have such a talented, dedicated staff of veterinarians working at APHIS.  I am excited about sharing them with you. APHIS and USDA are joining with organizations around the world to celebrate World Veterinary Year by highlighting the work of veterinarians on the USDA blog.  This post is part of a series underscoring the important and diverse work of APHIS veterinarians.  Check back each Thursday as we showcase the work of a different veterinarian.

"Give Yourself a Hand!  “Clean vs. dirty” is a concept that seems easy enough to understand. You know your jeans are dirty when they get grass stains on them, because you can easily see the stains. Seeing bacteria on your food is a different story. All foodborne bacteria are microscopic and can’t be seen with the naked eye, making it difficult to know if your foods have been cross-contaminated. Bacteria may come into contact with our foods from contaminated cooking equipment, utensils and even our hands. According to the FDA Food Safety Survey (, 530 ) Americans are doing well to prevent cross contamination from some common sources, but not all.

"Developing National Dietary Guidance for the Birth to 24 Months Age Group  Good nutrition is vital to optimal infant and toddler growth, development, and health. The importance of this age group has been emphasized by First Lady Michelle Obama, who said that “If our kids get into the habit of getting up and playing, if their palates warm up to veggies at an early age, and if they’re not glued to a TV screen all day, they’re on their way to healthy habits for life.” So, making sure that even the youngest infants and toddlers are on the road to a healthy life is critical, and having national dietary guidance for infants and children from birth to 24 months can help make this happen. The Dietary for Americans (DGA) provides sound advice for making food and physical activity choices that promote good health and a healthy weight, and help prevent disease for Americans, including Americans at increased risk of chronic disease. The DGA has traditionally focused on adults and children 2 years of age and older. Infants and toddlers from birth to 24 months of age have not been a focus in previous versions of the DGA because of their unique nutritional needs, eating patterns, and developmental stages.

"AMS Commodity Procurement Director in  USDA Results  Food and Nutrition  Mar 21,   An opportunity to reach a new market is a big deal for any company, but this is especially true when it comes to our nation’s 23 million small businesses. In their search to reach new markets, they not only compete against each other they also compete with larger establishments. To help them meet their goals, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) offers some contracts exclusively for small businesses. This allows companies with less than 500 employees to compete against similar sized organizations to provide a service or product to the government. Small businesses are the glue that holds our economy together and AMS is committed to supporting them. Our Commodity Procurement Staff (CPS) recently purchased 25 million pounds of fresh russet potatoes in one of our small business procurements. While reducing a potential surplus in the market caused by a nearly 9 percent increase in U.S. potato production from the previous year, the purchase also enabled small businesses to sell products to the USDA. These companies sent their products to food and nutrition programs like the National School Lunch Program and food banks. The recent purchase will send 25 million pounds of fresh russet potatoes to food and nutrition programs like the National School Lunch Program and food banks. Photo courtesy of Michelle@TNS. AMS, along with other agencies in USDA, has employees dedicated to help small businesses understand federal procurement programs. Whether you are new to federal contracting or just learning about opportunities within USDA, there are a number of resources to help your business successfully compete for a contract. Companies looking to sell products to AMS should visit our Commodity Procurement website to see the list of foods the agency purchases and how they can become an approved vendor. All offers to supply products need to be placed through our Web-based Supply Chain Management System (WBSCM). This online tool houses all of the business processes for our procurements including: orders, solicitations, bids, awards, deliveries, invoices, and payments. Last year, the system was used to purchase 10 billion pounds of food. This includes $170 million worth of protein items from our nation’s producers -- many of which were small businesses -- who were devastated by the drought. AMS remains committed to creating opportunities for small companies looking to do business with our agency. After you become an approved vendor, get training on the WBSCM system by checking out the schedule of upcoming training courses. New vendors should go to the new vendor page and become approved. Anyone can obtain tailored information from our CP News to stay up to date on what’s happening in the world of commodity procurement.

"Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Apr 11,  Last month, I spent three days in Michigan and while spring weather in the Great Lakes State doesn’t appeal to some, I was excited to make the trip. After all, when I was a student at the University of Michigan (Go Blue!), I volunteered at Food Gatherers. So, when asked to speak at their “The State of Our Plate” convening, I said, “Yes!” Some of the people in the room, who were classmates, continuously help federal nutrition programs operate successfully in Washtenaw County through their work to improve food access. I am deeply appreciative for their unwavering service and for showing up for families in need. Another set of Michiganders that I’m fiercely proud of are the school food service professionals. I joined the Oakland County child nutrition professionals at their 42nd annual workshop: Get Your Groove On for Child Nutrition. Day after day, they are feeding our future and giving kids a healthy start. After meeting with 15 Oakland County food service directors, I learned more about their local initiatives and their thoughts on the child nutrition proposed rules. I heard about Oakland County’s Better with Breakfast program, a groundbreaking public/non-profit collaboration between the Oakland County Board of Commissioners, Oakland Schools, and the United Way for Southeastern Michigan. Following the meeting, I also visited Waterford Kettering High School’s early lunch service, talked with students, and met with school administrators who couldn’t agree more that hungry children don’t learn well. But it is not just kids who need proper nutrition to thrive, nutrition security for all is critically important which is why USDA was thankful to be a part of the summit hosted by ProMedica and The Root Cause Coalition at Trinity Health Ann Arbor. Healthcare professionals, insurers, federal, state, and local government officials, and many others came together to discuss hunger as a public health issue. Hunger and diet-related diseases are almost entirely preventable and while USDA administers some of the most effective tools to help address these problems, USDA can’t fight this battle alone. One amazing model that provides access to healthy foods and bridges nutrition security and healthcare is The Farm at Trinity Health which I toured following the summit. Watch for an upcoming blog about The Farm and how it is growing a healthy community. Incredible!

One of the results of the thorough process was a watershed action plan, which was funded by NRCS partner, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. A watershed action plan is not a legally binding document, but rather a tool to help community leaders make informed decisions about water quality in a certain area. One change that can negatively affect water quality in a watershed is the conversion of land from wilderness or agricultural uses to urban areas. That’s because land covered with asphalt or concrete pavements can cause excessive surface water runoff from rain or snowmelt, which can contain contaminants like sediment, petroleum products from roads, and fertilizer and pesticides from yards. The water flows over the land, picking up any contaminants found there, and eventually drains into the lowest water body in the watershed—in this case Fox River and its largest tributary, Jelkes Creek. The impermeable pavement typically used to create sidewalks and roads also reduces the amount of water that can be absorbed into the soil. The Jelkes Creek–Fox River watershed action plan, which the conservation district developed with technical advice from NRCS, set goals for addressing water quality in the watershed—primarily reducing stormwater runoff, water pollution and soil erosion. When the conservation district obtains funds to implement the watershed action plan, NRCS will help install the conservation practices needed to protect water quality. First, though, NRCS experts will analyze where the worst of the erosion is coming from and estimate sediment delivery so that the most problematic areas in the watershed are tackled first. Then stormwater runoff will be reduced through the addition of rain gardens, engineered wetlands and biowales (landscaping that removes silt and pollutants). Soil erosion will be addressed with the building of stone structures that will slow the speed of water running down hills, helping to prevent soil from washing into the river. The plan will be put into action not just by the conservation district and NRCS, but also the people who live in the watershed, says David Powleit, Jelkes Creek–Fox River Watershed Coalition member. “The development of the watershed plan offers an opportunity for citizens to get involved with the water resources out their own backdoors,” he says. The Kane-DuPage Soil & Water Conservation District suggests voluntary methods for residents to enhance water quality. For example, they can sweep up yard debris, plant native plants and reduce the use of fertilizer and pesticides. Follow NRCS on Twitter. Check out other conservation-related stories on the USDA blog.

"Southern Research Station, USDA Forest Service in  Forestry  Nov 15,  John and Elizabeth Alter manage more than 1,000 acres of tree farms that were hit hard by Hurricane Michael. (Courtesy photo American Tree Farm System) Hurricane Michael, which roared through Florida, Alabama and Georgia on October 10, hit timberland owners and timber markets hard. John Alter and his wife Elizabeth manage more than 1,000 acres in Malone, Florida, including 18 Tree Farm stands. The Alters were honored as Florida’s Outstanding Tree Farmers of the Year in . “This is a true disaster,” said Alter. “My immediate focus is on determining what to do with what’s left of my timber, and I do not have access to everything right now.” Timber damage on John Alter’s land in Florida. The total losses to Florida timber producers and consumers from Hurricane Michael may exceed $1 billion. (Photo by John Alter) The monetary estimate of timber damage in Florida alone is well over $1 billion. The hurricane also caused extensive damage in Georgia and Alabama. Research shows that damage from individual storms and other forest threats, such as insects, fire, and disease, can create widespread wealth redistribution among timber land owners. The entire supply chain is impacted – from landowners to loggers to the mills and beyond. Southern Research Station Forest Economics and Policy researchers Thomas Holmes and Jeff Prestemon’s studies show that growers with damaged stands lose wealth. “Prices fall during the salvage period due to the spike in volume and quality degradation,” said Holmes. “Plus, not all damaged timber can be salvaged.” Timber growers with damaged stands and timber consumers – mills – tend to lose out, he explained. However, timber producers with undamaged stands benefit because wood is still needed, and prices can rise to make up for the lack of high-quality wood available after salvage operations. He predicts that, based on a timber market welfare analysis, the aggregate losses to timber producers and consumers in Florida from Hurricane Michael may exceed the current $1 billion estimate. In the past, state governments have taken steps to assist timber managers with salvage operations. Some examples include relaxing weight limits on roads; allowing logging trucks to carry heavier loads; permitting larger than normal log storage volumes at mills; and assisting private landowners and nongovernmental organizations with salvage planning. “It would take 2.4 million logging trucks to remove all of the dead trees that we have in Florida as a result of this hurricane,” said Florida Forest Service State Forester/Director Jim Karels. The Forest Service is supporting restoration efforts by working closely with state foresters in Florida and Georgia to increase timber sale and salvage operations. At the states’ request, agency specialists will also provide technical assistance to help private landowners write plans for treatments and get their timber to market. The Forest Service will also provide funding to state forestry agencies to administer landowner reforestation programs. “Active cooperation between state and federal agencies will be the key to recovery,” said Rob Doudrick, SRS Director. “Our research will provide the sound science for making decisions.” Using satellite imagery, Southern Research Station scientists are able to see the impacts of Hurricane Michael’s destructive winds and Florence’s drenching rains. The ForWarn tool, which SRS scientists helped develop, reveals impacts before people can view damage on the ground.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Nov 06,  Sliced sweet potatoes. Photo credit: Getty Images Sweet potatoes, which are native to the Americas, sustained our founding pioneers with beneficial nutrients like beta carotene, calcium, fiber, and a host of vitamins. No wonder it’s a holiday favorite, especially during Thanksgiving. But what makes a good sweet potato? USDA scientists know what it takes to make a good sweet potato, whether you like it in pies and custards, baked, as chips or French fries, and even juice or smoothies. Together, researchers with the Sweetpotato Breeding Program at North Carolina State University (NCSU) and the USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) develop sweet potato varieties for improved color, flavor and texture—testing them for sugar, starch, beta carotene, anthocyanins and other characteristics that appeal to consumers’ appetites. “Different sweet potato varieties with different flesh color—white, yellow, orange, and purple—are available around the world,” says Van-Den Truong, research leader at the ARS Food Science Research Unit (FSRU) in North Carolina. “But for American consumers, a good sweet potato should have a deep-orange flesh color, a good shape and size with the common skin color of light to medium rose, copper, or red. It also should have good sweetness, flavor, and moist texture.” Truong provides a wealth of information about sweet potato production, different varieties, genetics, storage, packing for fresh root markets, and technologies for processing into consumer food products and functional food ingredients for the food industry in his chapter in the recently published Handbook of Vegetables and Vegetable Processing, 2nd Edition. The chapter also details the nutritional quality of raw sweet potatoes and the processed products. ARS scientists work closely with NCSU researchers, developing new varieties for commercial production that have high yields and nutritional value; are more disease and insect resistant; and can be stored for longer periods for fresh root markets and the food processing industry. Additional research involves testing new varieties for consumer preference. FSRU food technologist Suzanne Johanningsmeier recently showed the high potential for consumer acceptance of Evangeline, a new sweet potato variety, because of its intense orange color, flavor, and moist texture. “It came as no surprise that consumers preferred both Covington and Evangeline sweet potato varieties oven baked compared to cooking in the microwave due to more sweetness and flavor development and softer textures,” Johanningsmeier says. “We always focus on what the American consumers would like,” Truong says. “We target the orange flesh color, which is very rich in beta carotene.” Sweetness—increasing the sugar content—and texture also are important traits. ARS scientists are also evaluating purple-fleshed sweet potato varieties with high anthocyanins and antioxidants for home cooking and processed foods as well as natural colorants. Desired sweet potato characteristics vary somewhat depending on how they’re prepared. For making pies, scientists develop varieties that make a good puree—not too viscous, sticky, or hard to mix after cooking. For fries and chips, sweet potatoes should have higher dry-matter content for good texture, low reducing sugars, and free amino acids for less browning and low acrylamide formation during frying, Truong says. Scientists believe that the sweet potato was domesticated more than 5,000 years ago, but there is debate as to whether this took place in South America or Central America. However, everyone agrees that the sweet potato ranks as one of the healthiest vegetables because of its high levels of vitamins A and C, iron, potassium and fiber.

"USDA Northeast Regional Farm to School Lead and Katina Kefalas, Program Specialist, USDA Food and Nutrition Service Northeast Regional Office in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 07,  Connecticut service members serve local blueberry smoothies and continue farm to school efforts at summer meals sites. Over the past few summers, sponsors of USDA’s Summer Meals Programs have been elevating meal quality and encouraging program participation by serving seasonal menus, utilizing high quality ingredients, and providing nutrition education activities. We’ve heard of such farm to summer activities – the embedding of farm to school principles within summer meals programs – from practitioners all around the country. Here in the Northeast, summer brought a wave of coordinated programming, and National Farm to School Month is the perfect time to celebrate this trend that is supporting healthy kids and communities all year long! Vermont: Farm to School 12 Months a Year  Last year, VT FEED secured funding from a local philanthropic partner, and embarked upon a mission to extend its robust farm to school training, coordination, and professional development services beyond the school year. The Farm to School 12-Months of the Year project provided local procurement training and guidance for summer sponsors, piloted summer meals sites over the weekend at two farmers markets, and ran food and nutrition-related activities at 10 summer sites. By continuing the strategies that have built robust farm to school programs over many years throughout the summertime, Vermont is creating consistent learning opportunities and year-round access to nutritious foods for kids across the state. Massachusetts: Farmers Markets as Summer Meals Sites  Farm to summer strategies picked up steam elsewhere in the Northeast, as the Massachusetts Farm to School Project secured funding to support the opening of additional summer meals sites at natural access points for local foods and fun, healthy community activities: farmers markets! With additional planning and support from the Child Nutrition Outreach Program and Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, farmers market sites were piloted in five different communities across Massachusetts. By setting up a new site at the Greenfield, Mass., market, Greenfield Public Schools was able to add local fruits and vegetables to their menu from market producers and serve kids on Saturdays. Connecticut: Service Members Launch Farm to Summer Programming  Building new elements of programming – like finding and buying local foods, promoting healthy menu items, running taste tests or gardening activities that get kids excited about summer meals – all take additional time and coordination. Partners in Connecticut tapped a school year resource to help sponsors make this programming possible. Fifteen FoodCorps and ten AmeriCorps service members were trained and supported by UCONN Extension, End Hunger CT!, and FoodCorps CT, with help from a USDA Farm to School Grant, and were perfectly positioned to run farm to summer activities at summer meals sites throughout the state. Local blueberry smoothies were a hit at Anna E. Norris Elementary School in East Hartford, and kept kids nourished and refreshed for their outdoor activities.

"Northern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Feb 11,  Bats like this northern long-eared bat are important to agricultural and forest ecosystems and are a significant force in keeping insect populations in check. (U.S. Forest Service/Sybill Amelon) Sybill Amelon is trying to repair the damage Bram Stoker did to bats’ public image. A research wildlife biologist with the U.S. Forest Service’s Northern Research Station in Columbia, Mo., Amelon has introduced bats to more than 20,000 primary, secondary and college students and teachers. Over the past 20 years, she has explained bat biology and lifecycles to master naturalist classes, Audubon clubs, garden clubs and native plant societies. Through her research and conservation efforts, she has raised awareness about bat species, while inspiring people to save them. Amelon’s work was recently recognized with a regional Gifford Pinchot Excellence in Interpretation and Conservation Education Award, a national accolade given to Forest Service employees for achievement in environmental interpretation and conservation education. The annual award is named in honor of the first Forest Service chief. Long before she became a scientist, Amelon was fascinated with bats. “They’re such an amazing group of species,” she said. “They eat every kind of diet in the world, and they’re found everywhere but Antarctica. They’ve adapted to a niche that nothing else has adapted to.” While they amaze some of us, they have not had universal appeal, thanks in part to Mr. Stoker and the less-than-positive depictions of bats in his enduring novel “Dracula.”  Amelon tries to set the record straight:  Bats are not blind, they are no more likely to be rabid than other mammals, and getting themselves tangled in long hair is something they do mostly in summer camp mythology. Two years ago, Amelon’s presentation to a group of master naturalists in St. Louis, inspired some to volunteer to help with research. Amelon outfitted them with acoustic monitoring equipment to track bats in the city’s’ urban areas. The results were surprising: the group identified active gray, red, Indiana and big brown bats in St. Louis during the summer months. The success of the project has allowed Amelon to expand her research collection to other cities, including Kansas City, Mo. and Springfield, Mo., again with the help of citizen scientists. Amelon says that it’s important to track bats in places where they are thriving because it may help scientists monitor the impact of white-nose syndrome. Caused by a fungal pathogen, the deadly disease was first identified in New York in and has killed thousands of hibernating bats in ates and five Canadian provinces.  “We’re losing so many bats in caves,” Amelon said. “We need to know what other habitat they are using, including urban habitat, and where they are thriving.” Forest Service research biologist Sybill Amelon’s work on behalf of bat conservation and educational outreach was recognized this year with the Gifford Pinchot Excellence in Interpretation and Conservation Education Award.

"New Land Ownership Add Value to Many Policy and Research Questions  Whether they farm the land themselves or rent it out to others to farm, those who own agricultural land are taking measures to keep the land in their families. This is good news for those who worry about the United States losing agricultural land to competing pressures. At USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, we just released the findings from a survey of agricultural landowners conducted earlier this year. It confirmed some things we know already and generated lots of new information that farmers, policymakers, businesses and others will use to understand more about who owns farmland, who has and will have access to farmland in the future, what kinds of conservation and production decision landowners are making, and lots more.

"Food Driver Coordinator, Human Resources Department, USDA Food and Nutrition Service, Southwest Regional Office in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 28,  Lupe Gomez, Coordinator and WIC staff show their contributions to the food drive. This summer I had the honor of organizing the Feds, Farmers and Friends Feed Families Food Drive for the Southwest Region Food and Nutrition Service.  As the human resources liaison for the region, I don’t get the opportunity to work directly with partners or clients so this food drive gave me a very unique perspective on hunger.  I collected food items, sent out reminders to staff and ensured delivery of the food to the North Texas Food Bank. The Feds, Farmers, and Friends Feed Families program was USDA's contribution to the federal government-wide effort Feds Feed Families, led by the Office of Personnel Management. From June through September , USDA employees, farmers, and friends joined together to combat hunger and help children and families in need. This year's goal was to collect 1.2 million pounds of food from federal offices nationwide. I am proud to report that the Southwest Regional Office (SWR) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) staff donated 518 pounds of non-perishable food during the months of July and August.  We kept track of the donations by program area throughout the drive.  I am happy to report that the SWR Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children staff surpassed the donations made by all other program areas.  We have wrapped up our food drive for the summer and it has been a positive experience for everyone involved, especially FNS staff who had the opportunity to show who much they care about the community we serve – either on the job or through our volunteer efforts.

"Farms and Schools – A Critical Link for a Healthy Future  One of my fondest childhood memories was helping my grandma tend to the fresh fruits and vegetables in her garden. After a morning’s work outside in the sunshine, the fresh-picked corn was a feast for the taste buds and a sweet reward for our hard work. Working alongside my grandma taught me many important lessons – notably, that food on the table across the nation is a result of the dedication and effort of America’s farmers.

"Deputy Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics in  Rural  Research and Science  Apr 04,   Recently, I visited Tohono O’odham Community College, in Sells, AZ, one of the tribal colleges that the Department of Agriculture supports around the country to level the playing field and open the doors of higher education to more young people. The Tohono O’odham or “Desert People” live in the Sonoran Desert on tribal lands in the southern part of the state, bordering Mexico. The terrain is flat, dry desert and presents numerous agricultural challenges that USDA helps students address through research and hands-on training, teaching traditional scientific disciplines – but through the lens of the tribe’s needs and culture. The college is doing a lot of work to keep their tribal language alive, providing language classes for all students. But science professor Dr. Teresa Newberry has taken that to a whole new level by building a Web-based database of plants that is built in three languages: English, Latin and Tohono O’odham. It’s the kind of project that integrates the native culture into learning in a practical, living way. They’re also looking for ways to guarantee they’ll always be able to grow their traditional foods even in the hotter and drier climate that may lie ahead. Faculty and staff are gathering over 30 different varieties of tepary bean and working with the NRCS plant material center, propagating these varieties so they can be planted out in the field. This is a real example of connecting traditional knowledge, science and providing options to adapt to a changing climate. In another study funded by USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture, students from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell are working with Tohono O’odham students and local plumbers, electricians, and others from the reservation to build a house that is totally powered by solar energy. The house has been a great success, proving to be so energy-efficient that it’s feeding energy back to the grid. Students at Tohono O’odham Community College are happy that they have an option to get an education in science, and in other professions that affect agriculture, right there at home and can take the skills they learn back to their community to help solve local problems. My visit to Tohono O’odham Community College was a good reminder of how our work at USDA is really woven into the fabric of the communities we serve. It also showed me how valuable it is to enhance the culture that exists in every corner of the country we touch with the advanced education, training and research support that USDA offers every day.

"Communication Specialist in  Health and Safety  Plants  Apr 14,  For the second time in his career, Marvin Enoe, Tree Climber Supervisor with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s Ohio Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB) Eradication Program, was in the right place at the right time. While driving for work, Enoe stopped to deliver life-saving aid to a tractor trailer driver lying on the side of the highway. “Myself and four other drivers pulled over to help,” Enoe said. “Together we took turns providing chest compressions for about 30 minutes. Since no one had a disposable CPR mask, we couldn’t safely provide rescue breathing but we kept the man alive until emergency medical services (EMS) arrived and took over.” At the scene, EMS personnel used an automated external defibrillator (AED) to shock the man multiple times before transporting him to a nearby hospital. Enoe credits the CPR courses USDA offers and tree climber rescue drills for his lifesaving knowhow. He takes a refresher course every two years to maintain his CPR certification and every month his climbing crew stages a mock emergency rescue to keep their skills sharp. Four years earlier while driving to inspect a tree, Enoe’s life-saving skills were tested then too. He and Tree Climber Treavor Fry arrived moments after an elderly woman lost control and flipped her car—she was pinned inside. Together they used their tree climbing ropes and equipment to secure and stabilize the vehicle so emergency medical services and fire rescue could use the jaws-of-life to free the woman and treat her injuries.

"Program Analyst, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 11,  Children in Baltimore enjoy healthy offerings at one of the city’s summer meals sites. USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service partners serve a vital role in the success of the federal Summer Food Service Program (SFSP).  These important relationships are critical to helping operate and expand summer meals and sites so that no child or teen goes hungry when school is out. Evaluating their best practices and listening to their anecdotes confirms that kids truly depend on these healthy meals over the course of the summer.  During the first day of the summer feeding program, the Hopkins County Family YMCA in Kentucky served over 500 meals.  But that’s not the only difference they made that day.  The director was at the store picking up supplies, when the cashier asked about her purchase.  The director explained the details of the program and the woman’s eyes filled with tears, as she relayed that her husband just lost his job and the family had become desperate.  She was put at ease knowing that the Summer Food Service Program will be available to feed her children this summer. Even though the summer program is focused on feeding children and teens, there are parents that are going hungry as well.  The YMCA of Greater Indianapolis tackled this issue by partnering with the local university to get donated meals from their cafeteria to provide to parents in need.  This allows them to not only feed kids and teens, but they can offer the kids’ parents a free, healthy meal as well, compliments of the university. The Y of Superior California hosts farmers markets on their front lawn.  Each kid in the meal program gets “Y Bucks” to purchase fresh produce to bring home for their families.  They also partnered with First Book and are giving away hundreds of free books to kids!  You can read more of the program’s success stories on their Summer Food Program Blog Tour. YMCA isn’t the only partner focusing on enrichment activities in the feeding program for the children.  Boys & Girls Clubs of America runs over 1,900 sites across the country and plans to serve more than seven million meals this summer!  The Boys & Girls Club of Greater Bemidji in Minnesota used funds from both the Child and Adult Care Food Program and SFSP to offer reimbursable snacks to all club members for free. The National Recreation and Park Association is another shining star.  NRPA has been helping support and expand summer meals through their Commit to Health program; a campaign that helps implement and evaluate healthy eating and physical activity standards in the nation’s parks and recreation sites.  The program provides funding in New York to hire additional staff to operate programs such as “Kids in Motion” and gives NYC Parks the ability to distribute up to 8,000 additional free meals over the summer. There are many ways a feeding site can expand their program by using available resources from their community.  It’s important to take these innovative ideas and see how they can work in where you live.  To check out more best practices, please visit the Summer Food Service Program best practices.

"Office of Communication, US Forest Service in  Forestry  Oct 10,  The Olympic Experimental State Forest Area The Olympic Experimental State Forest is the largest site in the U.S. Forest Service’s national network of experimental forests and it’s the only representative of the Olympic Peninsula’s temperate rain forest ecosystem, which is known for its extreme rainfall and growth rates. Its large size, encompassing 270,000 acres, and history of innovation make this a forest that offers many opportunities for research and monitoring. As a cooperating experimental forest, this vast expanse of land is managed by the Washington Department of Natural Resources as a working forest, with the U.S. Forest Service coordinating research there. The Olympic averages an incredible 140 inches of rainfall annually. Strong winds from the Pacific Ocean are a major and persistent natural disturbance. With such heavy precipitation and steep terrain, streams fill with erosion material and have the potential for unstable channel banks and upslope slides, creating challenges for scientists. Conservation management strategies for the forest focus on restoration and maintenance of habitats that support salmonids, the northern spotted owl and marbled murrelets. The habitat conservation strategies for the Olympic are based on an experimental concept of an unzoned forest—that is, a landscape without specific areas set aside for timber management. Old-growth forests that once dominated the landscape still grow on some state trust lands in the Olympic as well as in the adjacent Olympic National Park and Olympic National Forest. Because the area is characterized by a very high rate of tree growth, the Olympic was designated to test innovative approaches to integrate conservation and commodity production of trees.

I am 13 years old and am home-schooled. I am going to update you on the Wastewater Treatment Plant in Port Wentworth, Georgia. This Wastewater Treatment Plant is being built so that water will be clean enough to go into the Savannah River. The cost for this project is about $11,500,000. USDA Rural Development provided a low interest loan of about $4,000,000 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided $4,000,000 in grant money. The project was designed by Port City Design Group in Savannah. I went to the plant on Friday, September 3. When I went to visit, I met Jack Smith of Choate Construction. I toured the construction site and watched the men finishing concrete that was just poured. When he is through with the construction, the plant will treat two million gallons per day of raw sewage. I also went to another treatment plant near Port Wentworth to see what a plant will look like when it is finished. It was more spread out and was built a little differently but still does the same thing Port Wentworth’s plant will do. It really didn’t smell as bad as I thought it would. It still smelled; just not very bad. The new plant was started in November of and should be complete in February .

"Leaf Litter Keeps Ground-Roosting Bats Warm  When winter weather arrives, most bats hibernate in caves, but a few species migrate to warmer areas. Warmer being relative, the migrating bats may still end up in places that are too cold for comfort, and sometimes hibernate under leaf litter for short periods of time. Roger Perry, a wildlife biologist at the U.S. Forest Service’s Southern Research Station, studied these temporary hibernation sites to find out how much protection they offered bats, and how much energy bats expend to stay alive. The leaf litter study took place in and around the Alum Creek Experimental Forest of the Ouachita National Forest in Arkansas, and focuses on eastern red bats, a migratory species that remains active through most of the winter.

"USDA Rural Development Wisconsin Public Affairs Coordinator in  Rural  Research and Science  Aug 15,   The Lake Holcombe High School in Holcombe, Wisconsin recently upgraded its science classroom as a result of a USDA Rural Development Community Facilities Economic Impact Initiative Grant.  Holcombe is a small rural community in the northwest area of the state.  The science classroom was outdated, making it difficult for the teachers to keep pace with new curriculum requirements and for students to conduct the necessary science experiments for that curriculum. The newly redesigned science classroom is now compliant with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and is similar to other high school science classrooms in the state.  A tank was also installed, along with new plumbing, to provide treatment for the chemical waste generated from science-related class work.  Now, the science curriculum can be expanded to offer experiences and experiments to the students that are equivalent with other science courses offered to their peers in the state.  In addition, new flooring, counters tops, bench fuel valves, sinks, and cabinets were installed, bringing the classroom into the 21st century.  The - school year will be the first full year that the students will have access to the improvements.

"Posted by Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack in  USDA Results  Aug 24,   Before I was sworn in as Secretary of Agriculture, I took time to meet with a handful individuals who held the job before I did.  I asked them for advice, and two recent Secretaries mentioned that it was important that I focus on civil rights.  As I soon learned for myself, USDA has an unfortunate and checkered history with regards to civil rights, with a multi-decade history of discrimination against our customers and our employees. So since becoming Secretary in January , I have made civil rights a priority at USDA, working to turn the page on the Department’s tragic civil rights record.  I pledged that we would correct past errors, learn from mistakes, and take definitive action to ensure that there is no disparity in program benefits based on race, color, sex, age, sexual orientation or disability. Over the past 20 months, I have implemented a comprehensive program to move us into a new era as a model employer and premier service provider.  And I made it clear to every employee that USDA will have zero tolerance for any form of discrimination, and that each employee and customer must be treated fairly and equitably, with dignity and respect. We have made substantial progress towards these goals, and civil rights will remain a priority at USDA until we have truly moved into the new era I envision. But for our work on civil rights to be successful and lasting, it must be part of a broader cultural change at USDA.  We began this process last year when I created a task force to build a more open, responsive, collaborative, transparent, and effective USDA. So there is irony in the fact that my commitment to civil rights was a factor in the run-up and decision to ask for and accept Shirley Sherrod’s resignation as USDA State Director for Rural Development in the State of Georgia. Following that incident, I directed the USDA Acting General Counsel to conduct a review of what took place.  I wanted to determine what mistakes were made to ensure that the USDA could learn from the incident and avoid similar pitfalls in the future. Today, I met with Mrs. Sherrod to discuss, among other things, the review we completed of this incident and how USDA will be moving forward to address the recommendations it contains. This review identified a handful of significant lessons.  Among them is that we need to improve protocols for internal communications at the Department, and create a set of safeguards to avoid the sort of hasty action which led to the mishandling of the matter with Mrs. Sherrod.  I have accepted all of these recommendations and asked that they be implemented immediately.  I know that they will help us build a more inclusive and deliberative decision-making environment and prevent similar mistakes from occurring again at USDA. This experience provides an opportunity to learn from our mistakes.  But it also provides an opportunity to build a Department that empowers and respects its employees and customers.  And at the end of the day, I know that we will build a stronger Department and better serve the American people.

Click to enlarge. Buying and selling, supply and demand, wholesale and retail—the market and all of the economic factors surrounding it are complex things to track and understand.  From the smallest farmer to the largest grocery store chain in the nation, all of American agriculture depends on the trends and prices within the marketplace. At USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), we know the value of information and .  For almost 100 years we’ve tracked pricing and market trend information in our USDA Market News , and now we’ve formed the Agricultural Analytics Division (AAD) to help further meet the informational and statistical needs of farmers and businesses across the country. The AAD provides a wide range of econometric, statistical, and analytical expertise and services. From production numbers to prices and market trends, to international trade activities and environmental impact—they track it all. They produce periodic assessments, compiling and organizing vast amounts of market trends and into streamlined, easily understood assessments.  They study spot markets—near-term trading to cover immediate needs—and they look at market impacts that effect the long- and short-term pricing of agricultural products. Their analysis of holiday trends and spot markets is the basis for the holiday infographics we’ve produced this year.  Everything from Valentine’s Day to Halloween has consumer and retail trends that shed light on the market activity and consumer preferences.

"Alaska Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Aug 27,  The male sockeye salmon has a larger head with elongated jaws, hooked snouts and strongly developed teeth. (U.S. Forest Service photo) Since the second week in July, locals and visitors alike have congregated on the viewing platforms above Steep Creek near the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center in Juneau, Alaska to enjoy the sockeye salmon migration. From mid-July through the end of August, the sockeye salmon enter the creek to dig redds (nests), find mates and spawn. For thousands of viewers this annual show is seen not in person but on the screens of their computers or smart phones, thanks to the Steep Creek salmon cam. The first salmon cam installation at Steep Creek was a summer project for Eagle Scouts. With the unexpected popularity of the live video stream, fisheries biologist Pete Schneider and other employees of the Tongass National Forest have made significant improvements to the original setup. A closet in the center’s pavilion was used to house electrical equipment. New trenches were dug through the woods and coaxial cables were run through hard conduit so the camera could be hard wired and not have to depend on batteries. A new, high-resolution analog camera made for divers replaced the old camera. The camera was attached to rebar similar to a tent stake and pounded into the substrate of the creek bed in only 18 inches of water, although it can appear much deeper in the video. Pete Schneider, fisheries biologist at the Tongass National Forest, conceals the conduit leading to the Steep Creek salmon cam with rocks. (U.S. Forest Service/Teresa Haugh) For Schneider, the salmon cam is more than an opportunity to entertain the public. His desire is to call attention to the unique qualities of the fish habitat of Steep Creek. “Steep Creek is a natural system with minimal impact from development,” Schneider said. “The importance of that cannot be overemphasized.” He said that all stages of the salmon’s lifecycle can be observed at Steep Creek. Although the spawning ground is small compared to bigger systems in Alaska, at only two-thirds of a mile long, it produces a comparatively large number of fish. The lush vegetation along the stream banks is due to the constant return of the nutrients to the soil from the fish carcasses that are transported by bears and eagles. “Sometimes people give value to the big systems like the Mendenhall River, the Taku River, or Montana Creek,” Schneider said. “The small systems can be undervalued and overlooked. But look at what Steep Creek produces.” Although the amount of salmon currently spawning will wind down, numbers will increase again at the end of September. “Once the sockeye run winds down in early September, the stream will be fairly quiet,” Schneider said. “Coho (silver) salmon will then﻿ enter towards the end of September, along with Dolly Varden.” Steep Creek at Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau, Alaska serves as an excellent spawning ground for sockeye salmon. It is a natural system that has minimal impact from development.

After Rebecca heard about the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) from a friend at the gym, she went to a WIC clinic near her home in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. There she discovered she qualified for the program and signed up. Now among nearly 80,000 active WIC participants in Mississippi, Rebecca says that WIC has not only helped them get nutritious food for their baby, it has also helped them become more financially stable. ""It’s helped us save money so we can pay more on our other bills,"" Rebecca said. ""It’s really helped out my family and I’m sure it will help out multiple people.” “The value of the WIC program is not only to provide supplemental foods, the nutrition education is invaluable because as children grow, parents will understand why they should feed their children certain healthy foods,” said Diane Hargrove, director of the Mississippi Department of Health WIC Program. And Mississippi is now in the process of making WIC benefits delivery more convenient by transitioning from issuing benefits through paper checks to using WIC Electronic Benefits Transfer (eWIC) cards. Like the paper checks, the eWIC cards can be used for purchasing approved foods from authorized grocery stores. The state began statewide rollout last month and Hattiesburg, Meridian, and Tupelo are currently transitioning to eWIC. “We are excited about Mississippi’s transition to eWIC which will offer participants a wider variety or authorized foods and allow them to make purchases at their convenience,” said Southeast Regional Administrator Willie Taylor of the USDA Food and Nutrition Service. “We know that good nutrition is key for being healthy and having a productive life.” Families like the Catts truly appreciate all the support. “The people at the WIC clinic are super nice and helpful,” said Rebecca. “WIC to me means good nutrition, overall, I just love it.” Learn more about the USDA WIC program here: www.fns.usda.gov/wic.

"Rural  May 13,   USDA Rural Development, Wisconsin The Village of Gays Mills lies in a valley among the steeply chiseled bluffs of the region known as the Driftless Area of Southwest Wisconsin, along the banks of the Kickapoo River. The people are known for growing apples and holding the Annual Apple Festival. The small village of 625, nearly flooded off the map twice in the past few years. Normally the river runs its course but in the Kickapoo flooded, reaching record levels of almost 20 feet. All was quiet until August, . Extensive rain in the areas upstream from Gays Mills caused flash flooding and overnight the town filled with water. Homes and businesses filled with water and many people lost everything. The river crested just below the record level of , and 75 homes were damaged. Then in June Gays Mills was dealt another blow. This time, the river broke its previous record and crested at 20.1 feet, seven feet above the flood stage level. During both the and floods, the water on Main Street submerged cars. In October , the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) asked residents and businesses to relocate to a new site. About 150 of the village's 230 houses lie in the flood plain. The planned layout of the new development outside the flood area calls for village offices and a library, along with space for a farmer’s market. Local businesses that move are expected to retain 41 jobs, and new businesses are expected to create 18 jobs within the first year. The relocation project also includes the construction of 10 townhouses and 34 single family homes for the residents. USDA is a partner in the effort to help local residents.  In Rural Development awarded nearly $100,000 in a Rural Business Enterprise Grant to help businesses move. In addition, USDA Rural Development awarded the Redevelopment Authority a $1,081,500 Community Facilities Loan for the relocation/construction of a new Village Community Center in the Central Business District. The community center will house the village offices, library, a meeting room, office for the Commercial District Manager and facilities for a farmer's market. USDA also awarded two Community Facilities Disaster Assistance Grants to the town. A $67,100 grant will be used to buy a previously owned pumper truck for the Fire Department, replacing a truck that is almost 40 years old. The second grant of $35,200, will help to purchase a new one-ton pick-up truck with plow to assist with snow removal, and a new trailer mounted 4-inch pump for use at the wastewater treatment plant and to help with water removal from properties during high water events. Other Federal and State agencies have also pitched in. In March of , a grant of $4.31 million was awarded by the Economic Development Administration to prepare a strategy for relocating the Village’s commercial district outside of the floodplain.

"Pacific Southwest Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jan 06,  Ally Buccanero, Shasta College student and volunteer, demonstrates how to make a bird feeder using a large pine cone and peanut butter during Shasta-Trinity National Forest’s annual Operation Christmas Tree event on Dec. 7. (U.S. Forest Service) For some, it can be a bit challenging to get in the holiday spirit in Redding, Calif., because the area typically has warm winter temperatures. But this year, residents were treated to a Dec. 6 snowstorm, which offered the Shasta-Trinity National Forest a wintery-white backdrop for its annual Operation Christmas Tree event. Working in partnership with Shasta County Youth and Families Foster Care, OneSAFE Place (a women’s refuge), and the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Center, the forest invited 62 local, disadvantaged youth on Dec. 7 to kick off their holiday season on the forest. About 40 volunteers from the U.S. Forest Service and multiple partners, including the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service and Shasta College, braved the snow to help make the event a big success and bring some cheer to the children’s holiday season. Volunteers cooked lunch in Dutch ovens and helped with arts and crafts as they guided small groups of children through the day’s activities. Children made ornaments for the Christmas trees they received. The trees were cut off the Shasta-Trinity National Forest and provided for the event at no cost. Volunteers led the children on a tour of the smokejumper base. The children caught candy that was thrown to them by smokejumpers, who jumped from a training tower. To wrap up the day’s festivities, as with most Christmas holiday events, Santa Claus came to town complete with presents, which were provided by Toys for Tots. “We understand that most of the children who attend this event have seen far more than their fair share of hardship and that the Christmas trees they take home with them might be the only holiday decorations they have,” said Andrea Capps, interpretive specialist and event coordinator for the forest. “This event takes weeks to plan and certainly a lot of energy, but creating an experience like this for these children is a reward that can’t be measured. It is an honor for the Shasta-Trinity National Forest to be the host.” The Shasta-Trinity National Forest has hosted Operation Christmas Tree since .

"Montana Range Riding Aids Ranchers, Mitigates Conflicts  As silvery moonlight washed across the Montana meadow, it sent long shadows over the grass. Tonight, I didn’t need the gentle clang of the grazing bell to tell me where the horses were feeding. My leggy quarter horse was as brightly silver-white as the full moon. The distant lowing of cows across the meadow confirmed that all was well. Somewhere in the distance, a wolf pack was probably making evening rounds, but tonight they likely wouldn’t visit this meadow. I swung up into my horse trailer’s tack room and wriggled into my sleeping bag as my dogs made way for my arrival. The next morning I’d rise at daybreak and head toward the sound of the cattle.

"in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Oct 02,   This October, just like every other month during the school year, school menus will feature an array of products from local and regional farmers, ranchers, and fishermen. Kids of all ages will dig up lessons in school gardens, visit farms, harvest pumpkins, and don hair nets for tours of processing facilities. Science teachers – and English, math, and social studies instructors, too – will use food and agriculture as a tool in their classrooms, so that lessons about the importance of healthy eating permeate the school learning environment. An investment in the health of America’s students through Farm to School is also an investment in the farmers and ranchers who grow the food and an investment in the health of local economies. In school year -, schools purchased $386 million in local food from farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and food processors and manufacturers. And an impressive 56 percent of school districts report that they will buy even more local foods in future school years. Farm to school programs exist in every state in the country. For example, the Lake County Community Development Corporation in Ronan, Montana a 40 percent increase in revenues to farmers based on school sales alone. The Southwest Georgia Project, a community development non-profit, notes that “We’re actually seeing our farmers have hope. The farm to school program allows them to see an opportunity for a sustainable living for themselves and their families.” Testimonials in a USDA video released this week highlight the degree to which farm to school programs support healthy eating behaviors among children and provide positive economic impacts to local communities. Strengthening local food systems is one of the four pillars of USDA's commitment to rural economic development, and Farm to School programs can play an important role. To support the expansion of Farm to School programs into more schools and expand opportunity for farmers and ranchers, USDA offers grants, training, and technical assistance. Since the start of our Farm to School Grant Program in fiscal year , for example, USDA has awarded grants to 139 projects spanning 46 states and the District of Columbia, serving more than 16,200 schools and 4.55 million students, nearly 43% of whom live in rural communities. Just this week, I visited the George Washington Carver Elementary School in Richmond, Virginia and the Virginia State Fair to announce more than $52 million in new USDA grants nationwide to support the development of the local, regional and organic food sectors. You can learn more about USDA’s investments at www.usda.gov/results. At USDA we’re transforming school food and creating a healthier next generation. We’re happy to celebrate in October, but we’re going to be cheering for schools with farm to school programs all year long. When students have experiences such as tending a school garden or visiting a farm, they’re more likely to make healthy choices in the cafeteria. I see the change every time I visit a cafeteria; students light up when meeting their farmer. They are piling their trays full of healthy foods, they are learning healthy habits that they will carry with them for life, and they are learning an appreciation for the American farmer that they will carry with them their entire lives.

"Secretary of Agriculture in  USDA Results  Rural  Aug 19,   Cross-posted from the White House Blog I’ve spent the last few days here in Iowa, a state that I was honored to serve as Governor for eight years. Yesterday, I walked the grounds of the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines. The fair is refreshingly the same each year, but also a snapshot of changing rural America. The food stands, midway and cattle barns are in the same place that they’ve been for years. We’ve sculpted a ""Butter Cow"" since the early s, but now the young people all have iPods and Blackberry phones. Their parents have cell phones. Like the state fair, rural America is changing each year in subtle ways. Many of our grandparents and great grandparents made their homes on small farmsteads and made their living directly from the land. Today, farming is more mechanized. Farms are larger, and fewer Americans call them home. Most people who live in small towns in rural America still feel connected to the land, but they don’t necessarily depend on it for their livelihood. The demands of rural America are changing, along with the drivers of the rural economy. While at the fair, I participated in a roundtable on rural revitalization. The roundtable discussion featured some of Iowa’s top rural leaders, including Iowa Farm Bureau President Craig Lang. We discussed our vision for developing a new, strong, vibrant rural economy; one that supports food production, but also generates renewable energy while safeguarding our environmental heritage. To help drive this rural renaissance, the Obama Administration supports quality health care and educational opportunities for all Americans, availability of broadband, and safe, sanitary rural housing. It’s what rural America wants. At USDA, we are moving forward to meet the changing demands of rural America. Yesterday, I announced a major USDA investment toward the Administration’s goal: loans and grants to allow farmers, ranchers, business owners and producers improve energy efficiency, develop renewable energy and cut costs. Today, I will join Commerce Secretary Locke in announcing additional projects to bring broadband to rural America. While USDA is adapting to meet the expanding needs of all of rural America, our primary purpose remains the same: to help those who live there prosper. Like the Iowa State Fair’s cattle barns and butter cow, some things at USDA remain constant, but we know that to remain vital to rural residents, we need to assist them when they ask for broadband and cell phone service, too.

"USDA Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 21,   I began this year by discussing the SNAP Stewardship Solutions Project, our ongoing efforts to further improve Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) integrity.  Halfway through the year, we have made significant progress: we are requiring more frequent reviews of higher risk retailers, expanding the definition of fraud to crack down on newer methods of SNAP benefit abuse, and establishing -sharing agreements to help catch recipients that attempt to commit SNAP fraud. We are working hard to ensure the taxpayer investment in SNAP is spent wisely, and that those who are eligible for the program receive the correct amount of benefits—not too much, and not too little. That is why I am pleased to announce that at 96.58 percent, the fiscal year SNAP payment accuracy rate—the combined measure of benefit overpayments and underpayments to recipients—was the highest in the history of the program. Last year’s record-high payment accuracy rate reflects our ongoing investment of resources and technical assistance at the State level. We applaud our State partners for their efforts to improve program administration, while still maintaining access to this critical nutrition assistance program for families and young children. This is a repeating pattern of success. Over the last nine years, the payment accuracy rate has been above 94 percent—originally considered a benchmark of success—and we are consistently improving each year. But the bottom line is this: any waste or misuse of taxpayer dollars is too much. The American taxpayer has every right to expect, and we are striving to deliver, a program that is administered wisely so that SNAP benefits do what they are intended to do—provide healthy food to families.

"USDA Rural Development Pennsylvania Public Information Officer in  USDA Results  Rural  Apr 08,   Applications are being accepted starting today from qualified non-profit and public organizations (intermediaries) to provide loans to create jobs by promoting new business development. Funding will be made available through USDA’s Intermediary Relending Program (IRP). Intermediaries work as partners with USDA and serve as a critical component to boosting local economies. The Intermediary Relending Program is USDA Rural Development's primary program for capitalizing revolving loan funds. Since President Obama took office, the program has created or saved an estimated 20,000 jobs nationwide. Here’s an example of how it works:  Antler Ridge Winery in Pennsylvania is accurately named—a huge set of deer antlers proudly hangs behind the tasting bar at each of the four locations. USDA Rural Development Pennsylvania State Director Tom Williams recently joined state and local officials, as well as representatives from Northeastern Pennsylvania Alliance, to announce the award of  a $115,000 business loan for the growing business. The loan, provided in part through a USDA Intermediary Revolving Loan, will be used to purchase land for the expansion of the branch winery located in Waymart, Wayne County. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development Acting Administrator John Padalino (left) visits with Ron Prins at Ron’s Repair in Worthington, MN on Thursday, May 31, . Ron Prins started a truck repair business out of his home and used funds from the USDA Intermediary Relending Program (IRP) to move into a shop in Worthington. Prins started with five people on staff, which has grown to 22. A subsequent IRP loan in helped Prins expand his Worthington shop, adding a separate area for displaying parts and accommodating for the growth of his business. USDA photo by Adam Czech. Stephen Unis, owner of Antler Ridge Winery started the business in .  Although he has a degree in computer engineering, he couldn’t resist the urge to follow in a family tradition of home brewing that started with his grandfather’s passion for brewing hard cider. In turn, Unis started out home-brewing wine over 20 years ago.  He grows many of his own grapes at the main location, located on the family farm in Rome, Bradford County. Additional grapes are all purchased from local growers and Unis proudly proclaims that he lives the “PA Preferred” life, supporting local producers in the surrounding region.  The PA Preferred Program is a state-supported agricultural marketing program, launched by the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture to identify and promote food and agricultural products grown, produced or processed in Pennsylvania. Antler Ridge Winery currently employs thirteen staff members in four rural northeastern Pennsylvania locations and plans to expand to additional locations. According to State Director Williams, “The Intermediary Revolving Loan Program is about helping businesses grow and providing more employment opportunities.” USDA provides funds to “intermediaries” which then make loans to the ultimate recipients. A wide variety of businesses can be funded and a number of loans can be made at the same time by one intermediary.  For more information on the program, visit our website.

"USDA Public Information Officer in  Rural  Feb 06,  A houseboat manufacturer in Kentucky builds a prototype energy-efficient single family home with support from the University of Kentucky, USDA Rural Development and other partners. A ribbon cutting was held last month, for the first prototype from the University of Kentucky’s (UK) Houseboat to Energy Efficient Residences (HBEER) initiative in an established residential area near downtown Monticello, Kentucky. The HBEER initiative has created green jobs and is bringing back 575 skilled workers and 1,000 related jobs that were lost in the houseboat manufacturing and marine industries due to the economy. HBEER is a partnership between the UK College of Design, the Center for Applied Energy Research at UK, the Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation (KHIC) and the Kentucky Housing Corporation (KHC). HBEER has received financing from the U.S. Department of Energy through the Kentucky Department of Local Government and the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Appalachian Regional Commission, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Economic Development Administration, Rural Local Initiatives Support Corporation and UK. USDA Rural Development has worked with KHIC throughout the project, awarding the company a Rural Business Enterprise Grant which was used to establish a revolving loan fund. That fund was used to supply some of the working capital used by Stardust to build the prototype. KHIC also is working with Rural Development’s Single Family Housing Program to assist potential homeowners obtain financing for HBEER properties. The completed prototype sits on a city lot. The firm is also considering building multi-family units and portable school classrooms. The multi-year project was initiated in the fall of and directly responds to the impact the current economic downturn has had on the houseboat manufacturing industry in Kentucky. More than 50 students and faculty at the college’s School of Architecture were responsible for researching and developing initial models of energy-efficient, affordable housing that could be produced by the region’s houseboat manufacturers. Highlights of the HBEER project include: Estimated energy costs at current rates are expected to be about $1.65 per day, which is one-half to one-sixth of energy bills for other housing alternatives. More than 80 percent of the home value is derived from products made in Kentucky and Kentucky labor, which further increases the jobs created or saved. When the partnership began in , Stardust Cruisers had 12 full-time employees and 12 contract workers. It now has 56 full-time employees, including six who are dedicated to the HBEER project. As a result of this project, Stardust also has improved the energy efficiency of its houseboats and is one of the few houseboat manufacturers exporting new products. The completed prototype sits on a city lot. The firm is also considering building multi-family units and portable school classrooms. The next phase of the HBEER project will include a prototype for multifamily housing as well as classroom space for schools that will serve as an energy efficient and more durable alternative to portable classrooms.

"Public Affairs Director, FNS, Mountain Plains Region in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Dec 17,   It was a pleasure to learn about Dr. D’Aun Carrell’s career-long commitment to children’s nutrition.  Even more so to discover her involvement with Chefs Move to Schools, part of First Lady Michelle Obama’s www.LetsMove.gov campaign to help solve the problem of childhood obesity.  The initiative was a natural fit, as she’s been matching local St. Louis chefs with schools since . Dr. Carrell’s path to the kitchen began at age three, when she learned to cook with her grandmother for the ranch hands of her Texas upbringing.  She brings those early cooking experiences full-circle in her nutrition and cooking lessons for kindergarten through grade 6 children in her curriculum.  Carrell is also active with the American Culinary Federation’s Chef & Child Foundation, for which she serves as the chair of the St. Louis chapter. When she signed up with the initiative, she was matched with five St. Louis Charter middle schools and connected with Pat Holmes, R.D., from Fresh Ideas Food Service Management.  The two wasted no time discussing class workshops, lunchroom logistics, food service staff training, teacher information, evaluation of student consumption, as well as working with vendors and local farmers.  She has incorporated these principles into her nutrition lessons in schools for years, and was about to do the same for the young kids of St. Louis. “My Fuel for Thought curriculum is geared toward children in kindergarten through sixth grade, and I’m finding it’s a little different with middle school students,” Chef D’Aun said.  Noticing the students were exhausted as they entered her 3:00 p.m. class, she included a healthy snack as part of the lesson to demonstrate how nutritious food provides the energy to learn and thrive. Chef D’Aun hammered home the significance of that first bite to the schoolchildren.  She wanted them to realize where the food goes and what the body does with it in the short and long term. The seventy year old chef is excited about the attention being paid to nutrition and to society’s greater awareness of food’s role in health.  She said she’s delighted to still be involved in teaching nutrition to kids, and concluded, “I don’t know if the students will ever know how much they teach me.” Please follow USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service on Twitter.

"APHIS Public Affairs Specialist in  Animals  Plants  Jul 11,  A gypsy moth caterpillar on a leaf in Massachusetts While being outside in Massachusetts this June, I first noticed it.  A lot of leaves were falling from the trees, only these were chewed leaf parts, not whole leaves. Similar to the children's book, The Very Hungry Caterpillar written by Eric Carle, some leaves didn’t just have chew marks but actual holes going straight through them.  Unlike the children’s book, this damage isn’t being caused by a friendly caterpillar who turns into a butterfly.  Instead it’s the result of ravenous gypsy moth caterpillars feeding…and feeding.  It’s so bad that in some areas, on walkways and roadways, it looks like fall.  Brown, dried up leaves are a contrast to summer’s lush greenery. What comes along with all the feeding and falling leaf parts?  Caterpillar feces, everywhere.  It too covers walkways and roadways.  And you don’t have to listen hard to hear the feeding, or the leaves and feces dropping.  The chewing is constant and so are the droppings.  It almost sounds like rain falling, continuously.  I regret that I did not take a picture of a car covered with caterpillar feces that I saw at the grocery store this weekend, which looked like it had peppercorns stuck all over it.  Don’t park under a tree, or like everything else, your car will be covered. Gypsy moth is not everywhere in the United States.  It’s primarily in the northeast to mid-west, and it’s Federal and State agriculture officials’ goal to not let it spread further.  You can do your part to help by finding out if you are in an area that already has gypsy moth, and if you’re not, report any gypsy moth egg masses or caterpillars on trees to Federal or State agriculture officials.  Also, the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is asking folks to check for gypsy moth before you move to a new area by inspecting your outdoor household articles (lawn furniture, yard equipment, outdoor toys, etc.) for gypsy moth egg masses and remove them.  It's not just the right thing to do—it's also the law. And now it’s easier than ever because APHIS just made its gypsy moth inspection checklist a fillable (page 2 of our gypsy moth factsheet) that can be digitally signed, making it acceptable in all situations where the form is . The gypsy moth caterpillars here in Massachusetts are ruining thousands of trees, changing the way the landscape looks.  The crabapple tree I planted two years ago didn’t bloom this year, and it may not survive these gypsy moth caterpillar attacks.  Please help prevent this insect from moving to other areas by visiting www.HungryPests.com to learn more about gypsy moth and other invasive pests we don’t want in the United States. Gypsy moths can lay their masses on just about any outdoor item—like this lawnmower—which people could move to uninfested areas, accidentally causing great harm.

"China Emerging as a Key Market for Agricultural Products  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. China is often noted for its dominant export presence in the world market. The ubiquitous “Made in China” label, found on everything from pens to smart phones has made China’s export prowess acutely visible and at times overshadowed the other side of the country’s trade relationship with the world. But in recent years, China’s potential as a significant market has drawn increasing attention. A new Economic Research Service (ERS) report examines China’s emergence as a major importer of agricultural products over the past decade. Between and , China’s agricultural imports grew from US$ 10 billion to about US$ 123 billion. The surge in imports has been driven by rising incomes and changing consumer preferences as well as growing demand for industrial raw materials. While bulk commodities such as soybeans and cotton remain predominant in China’s agricultural imports, consumer preferences and increased purchasing power have broadened the scope of these imports. As a result, imports of processed and consumer-oriented products like meats, dairy, wine, and nuts are increasingly showing up in Chinese markets.

"NASS Illinois Field Office director in  Research and Science  Apr 11,  Illinois field office director Brad Schwab examines a field of early planted corn in central Illinois. (NASS) Of the many factors that make farming risky, weather is particularly important. With this year’s unseasonably warm March, some farmers are taking a risk they hope pays off in a big way. Despite the peril of a spring frost, many farmers are planting corn almost a month earlier than the usual mid-April planting dates. As they wait to see what happens with the weather, these farmers, along with analysts, policymakers and others interested in U.S. agriculture, will pay close attention to the Crop Progress report issued weekly by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). The Crop Progress report collects input from nearly 4,000 individuals whose occupations give them opportunities to make visual observations nationwide. These respondents report the progress and condition of crops weekly through various stages of development from early April through the end of November. They receive training at the beginning of each season and NASS field offices contact them routinely to ensure proper reporting. Each Monday morning, respondents complete the questionnaires and submit them to the NASS field offices in their states. Field office staff review the for reasonableness and consistency by comparing them with reported the previous week, reported in surrounding counties for the current week and historical averages. Major weather events play a big role in determining crop progress and condition estimates. We often think of major weather events as destructive (for example, flooding rains, heavy snows or devastating droughts). But many farmers view this year’s warm March weather as a good opportunity to get in the field early and plant some corn. If the early planted crop makes it through without any late spring frosts, we could see early pollination and an early harvest. But only time, weather and the Crop Progress report will tell. NASS released the first weekly report on crop progress and conditions on Monday, April 2. To learn more about the report or to sign up to receive national or state by email, go to the NASS Crop Progress and Conditions web page.

"Deputy Director of Capacity Building and Development, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Aug 13,   The Waters family farm in Orrick, Mo. had a few unusual guests last week when dozens of African ministers came to learn about their corn, soybean and wheat farm. To embrace the 9th African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Forum’s theme, “New Strategies for a Changing World,” the organizers made some innovative changes, splitting the forum between Washington DC and Kansas City, Mo. Why Kansas City? As a major agricultural hub, Kansas City was ideal for bringing American and African agribusinesses and investors together. It also took the forum beyond policy discussions and into the field, literally. It was the perfect place to demonstrate the close relationship between American farmers and “the people’s department,” as USDA was originally named by Abraham Lincoln. Tom and Karla Waters explained how they plant, harvest, store, and sell crops in their seventh generation farm operation. USDA Farm Service Agency’s county director and an extension agent discussed how the Department supports smallholder farmers and large scale operations such as the Waters’ 5,000 acres through research and training at land-grant universities, and marketing and credit programs. In the Foreign Agricultural Service, I oversee capacity building and development programs, many in Africa. I talked about how our technical assistance programs help give farmers in Africa the same knowledge and tools available to farmers in the United States, through partnerships and coordination with farm groups, governments, and other public and private organizations. The ministers and delegates asked questions about purchasing seeds, planting cycles, irrigation, value-added end products, how prices are determined, and how to make a profit. On the policy side, they gained valuable insight about the Farm Service Agency’s network of service centers where farm loan managers, rural development officers, and extension agents serve the agricultural needs of communities throughout the United States. By seeing the producer-government relationship in action at the farm, I hope the ministers and delegates will take some new ideas and practices to use back home.

"NRCS Project Liaison, USDA Northeast Climate Hub in  USDA Results  May 20,  Organic farmer on his computer accessing information regarding climate conditions. USDA photo All this month we will be taking a look at what a changing climate means to Agriculture. The ten regional USDA Climate Hubs were established to synthesize and translate climate science and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers that are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA's Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate. In the Northeast and Midwest U.S., a changing climate is expected to continue impacting agriculture for the foreseeable future.  From Minnesota to Maine and Maryland to Missouri, increasingly severe weather, variable temperatures, and at times droughty soil conditions are exacerbating the existing challenge of managing productive lands without degrading natural resources.  To help farmers adjust their practices or even transform their operations (“adapt”) to meet these challenges, the USDA Northeast, Midwest, and Northern Forests Climate Hubs collaborated to develop “Adaptation Resources for Agriculture,” a compilation of information about climate change considerations and responses.  Authors from the U.S. Forest Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the Agricultural Research Service teamed up to review climate change literature and develop easy to understand guidance for on-farm decision-making. “Adaptation Resources for Agriculture” includes a regional summary of climate change effects on agriculture, a compilation of adaptation strategies and approaches, and a workbook to identify farm specific response options leading to flexible adaptive actions.  The workbook is intended for use in a small workshop setting to enable farmer engagement in understanding how climate change impacts their enterprise and natural resources and how to respond for the benefit of current and future generations. Based upon the “Forest Adaptation Resources” developed by the U.S. Forest Service and Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science in and Adaptation Workbook demonstrations completed by hundreds of users across a wide variety of projects on public and private lands, “Adaptation Resources for Agriculture” has been developed specifically to meet the unique needs of agricultural producers.  Many climate science concepts apply to both agriculture and forestry anywhere in the nation, including sustaining the fundamental functions of soil and water resources, reducing the impacts of biological stressors or extreme weather, and managing the enterprise as part of a larger landscape. In each region, agricultural producers will experience different types and degrees of climate change effects depending on their site specific conditions and capacity to cope with impacts or to take advantage of opportunities.   For example, the Midwest and the Northeast have experienced a significant increase in extreme precipitation since the mid-’s resulting in delayed planting, increased soil erosion, loss of nutrients, flood damage, and resulting increases in expenses or decrease in yields.  Three examples of typical farms in the region highlighted in the publication: corn and soybean production in Iowa; beef grazing in Missouri; and confined dairy in Pennsylvania, demonstrate how an adaptation perspective helps farmers overcome ever increasing challenges of climate change, as well as take advantage of possible opportunities. The publication is intended to serve as a template for other regions to create adaptation strategies and approaches relevant to their expected climate change conditions and typical agricultural commodities.  It is currently under review and scheduled for public release later this year.   Several workshops are planned to introduce “Adaptation Resources for Agriculture” to educators, conservationists and producers, including a session at the Soil and Water Conservation Society annual conference in Louisville, KY in July and the National Small Farms Conference in Virginia in September.

"California Hub Lead in  Conservation  Nov 06,  Jesse Sanchez evaluating soil. The White House recently recognized 12 Champions of Change for their leadership in sustainable and climate-smart agriculture. This week we will meet them through their USDA Regional Climate Hub, today featuring California’s Jesus “Jesse” Sanchez. California is the nation’s number one agricultural production state with revenues of over $46 billion in . State farmers and ranchers produce a diverse array of specialty crops, field crops, and livestock products. The top five by value in were milk, almonds, grapes, cattle and calves, and strawberries. California is also home to more than 30 million acres of forested land, including many ecologically unique and economically important forest types as well as more than 40 million acres of rangeland. The state’s forests and grasslands, like those of other Western states, have long been shaped by fire and drought. California’s precipitation is highly variable from year to year and ranges from 60” on the North Coast to just a few inches in the southern deserts. California agriculture, concentrated in the Central Valley, depends heavily on irrigation from a combination of groundwater wells and surface water delivered by state and federal projects. Since , California has been in the grip of its worst drought on record. Through the California Regional Climate Hub, USDA is working to bring land managers the science and tools that can help them adapt to changing weather and climate conditions. Many farmers, ranchers and land managers are already leading efforts to develop and demonstrate sustainable agricultural practices that benefit soil, air, and water quality while helping to mitigate climate change by reducing emissions.  Educators and advisors have also been crucial in bringing science-based, sustainable, and climate-informed agricultural practices to the agricultural community. These trends are expected to continue and become more unpredictable in the future. The Southwest Regional Vulnerability Assessment presents an overview of current conditions and trends, and provides adaptation and mitigation strategies for land managers and advisors with the best available information. The Hubs also support the implementation of climate-informed agricultural practices so rural communities and businesses can help slow the effects of climate change while creating jobs, growing the economy, and providing the quantity and quality of food, fuel and fiber needed to meet the needs of the region, nation and world.  The hubs rely on the support of early-adopters to help lead the agricultural community toward sustainable and productive practices that also conserve our nation’s natural resources.  Jesus “Jesse” Sanchez was honored by the White House for his work in California. Sanchez serves as the Farm Manager for Sano Farms, a diversified tomato, almond, wheat, garbanzo, and garlic farm spanning 4,000 acres in Firebaugh, California.  Firebaugh is a small town of about 8,000 people in the heart of the West Side of the San Joaquin Valley.  For over ten years, Sanchez has implemented innovative conservation agriculture practices including the use of cover crops and strip-tillage at Sano Farms.  These practices have resulted in considerably less use of diesel fuel, lower emissions of dust, increased soil carbon, and reductions in soil water evaporation; all of which contribute to the farm’s resilience and sustainability. He has also been an eager spokesperson for these conservation farming practices, has hosted numerous tour groups and provided many presentations to farmers from all over the world who are eager to learn from him. The Champions of Change like Sanchez are making a difference in California and we look forward to working with them and others like them to pave the way to a more resilient future.

": Investments in Rural Business  The fifth and final stop on our is the backbone of our nation’s rural economy — rural business. By making historic investments and streamlining access to capital for enterprises of all sizes, USDA is helping to build a productive and dynamic rural landscape capable of supporting America’s workforce. Local businesses foster growth and prosperity not only by creating jobs in our rural communities, but by improving the overall quality of life outside of our urban centers. Whether it’s manufacturing, service-based, retail, wholesale, or farming, when business is booming in rural cities and towns, it adds to the breadth and depth of these communities and provides more opportunities. When rural Americans can find jobs, access healthcare, and buy groceries locally rather than travel fifty miles round-trip to the nearest big city, it saves them time, expense and helps to stimulate both the local economy and the American economy as a whole. Our investments in rural businesses are a strategic investment in all Americans.

"Posted by acampbell in  Initiatives  Jul 16,   Do you want to make your garden the best it can be? Do you want to learn more about how to conserve as much as possible, while cultivating a thriving garden? The Peoples' Garden at USDA was conceptualized to help Americans learn more about all things gardening -- and this summer, we're putting on weekly Healthy Garden Workshops to help everyone learn the ins and outs of a great garden. July 3 Kickoff Workshop At the July 3 Healthy Garden Workshop, “Watering Your Lawn and Garden,” USDA experts offered a few of the scientific tricks to ensure that your plants and lawn get enough water, but not too much as well as how much water plants “drink” from the soil every week. For example: It helps to create a weekly watering plan, and to monitor the rainfall in your lawn/garden and subtract that amount of water from your weekly watering plan. Plants use approximately one inch of water from the soil each week during the summer growing season. Therefore, this amount needs to be replenished for plants to continue to grow and thrive. Depending on where we live, nature takes care of this for us by providing rain and we supplement with additional water as needed. Watering is a delicate balance for gardens. Too little water causes plants to wilt and die. Too much water means the plant cannot breathe; this can cause rotting and make the plant susceptible diseases. And that's just a sample. For more information about these tips, and to learn more about gardening, visit the the Peoples' Garden page. Upcoming Events At tomorrow's Healthy Garden Workshop, you can learn about gardening in containers and window boxes (especially helpful for Americans living in cities and urban areas). The workshop will include discussion on finding the right container for the job, getting good soil, and nursing the container garden over time. Next week, on July 24, we'll show you techniques for weeding and removing invasive plants. At both of these activities, a ""Sprouts"" workshop for kids will focus on a series of activities for children that demonstrate how the food system works, from farm to fork. If you can't make a workshop, consider a garden tour -- they're held every Tuesday and Thursday at 1 p.m. at the Garden.

"Deputy Administrator of the National Organic Program in  Conservation  Sep 05,  Amy's Organic Garden in Charles City, VA. Organic certification ensures the integrity of organic products around the world, and this initiative will make sure the process is accessible, attainable and affordable for all. This is the seventeenth installment of the Organic 101 series that explores different aspects of the USDA organic regulations. Making organic certification accessible, attainable, and affordable involves collaboration with many partners across the country and around the globe. To advance this work, USDA supports a diverse community of organic stakeholders. Nonprofits, businesses, universities, state governments and other organizations lead a range of technical assistance, training, outreach and certification programs for organic farms and businesses.  These organizations provide the National Organic Program (NOP), part of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), with valuable feedback about how to keep organic certification sound and sensible and how to meet the needs of new and transitioning organic farmers. To support their work, USDA is awarding project contracts to 13 organizations that will advance the NOP’s Sound and Sensible initiative by identifying and removing barriers to certification and streamlining the certification process. Here’s a summary of the exciting projects in store for the organic community: The Agriculture and Land-Based Training Association (ALBA) will use a blended teaching approach to help farmers understand the alignment between organic practices and food safety requirements. California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF) will conduct focus groups to explore barriers to certification with disadvantaged groups, develop a “10 Steps to Certification” reference guide and self-assessment, and conduct outreach sessions to candidate organic businesses. Florida Certified Organic Growers and Consumers will produce videos for producers to outline the steps to organic certification. The International Organic Inspectors Association (IOIA) will produce a range of materials to support organic inspectors and farmers, including training modules that integrate sound and sensible principles into organic inspections and certification activities. Massachusetts Independent Certification Inc., associated with Baystate Organic Certifiers, will develop training videos to dispel certification myths, an organic system plan consultant pilot program, training workbooks and information sheets, and a set of model organic system plans. National Center for Appropriate Technology (NCAT) will lead two projects. The first will focus on technical assistance support for organic farmers and will include a workshop series. The second project will result in a streamlined organic system plan template for organic farms, a compliance checklist and model inspection report, and tip sheets related to organic transition. Northeast Organic Farmers Association – Vermont (NOFA-VT) will develop an organic mentoring program, provide technical assistance, and implement outreach activities. Ohio Ecological Food and Farm Association (OEFFA) will share materials and approaches that address the unique cultural and communication needs of Plain and Amish farmers seeking organic certification. Oregon Tilth Certified Organic (OTCO) will develop a pocket guide for organic certification and develop and implement an organic outreach and education program. Organic Services will work with the NOP to develop for setting up, administering, and managing an internal control system for grower groups engaged in organic certification. Pennsylvania Certified Organic (PCO) will engage in a technology project to develop a standardized tool for capturing the key elements of an organic system plan. WILL Interactive, partnering with the Carolina Farm Stewardship Association, will develop an interactive scenario-based video training program to help farmers navigate the elements of organic certification. Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) will develop videos to illustrate the organic certification process for small and direct marketing farmers. All of these projects will be completed by September , and any materials developed under these contracts will be available through each organization’s website, via other organic partner sites and from the National Organic Program.  Organic certification ensures the integrity of organic products around the world.  We’re excited to launch these initiatives to ensure the process is accessible, attainable and affordable for all.

"USDA Kentucky Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  Nov 02,   As Deputy Agriculture Secretary Kathleen Merrigan wrapped up a multi-state visit last week, she stopped in Kentucky where she announced the recipients for the Rural Microentreprenuer Assistance Program (RMAP) on Oct. 28. Two of the recipients announced in this first round of funding are Kentucky companies, including Community Ventures Corporation (CVC) in Lexington – where Merrigan made her announcement. CVC was selected to receive a $500,000 loan and a $105,000 grant to provide financial and technical assistance and training to rural microentrepreneurs. The organization serves rural businesses in 10 counties that have been designated as Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) communities, which are characterized by high unemployment rates, poverty and low per capita income. The Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation in London, Ky., was selected to receive a $500,000 loan and a $100,000 grant to provide employment opportunities in southeastern Kentucky through investments, training and management assistance. “We need to be putting our programs to work for small businesses. For us at USDA that means small businesses in Rural America,” said Merrigan. “The importance of small entrepreneurship is particularly profound in the most rural areas.  We need micro lending in rural areas and Congress addressed this issue in the Farm Bill by giving the USDA’s Rural Development Mission Area a brand new program, the Rural Microentrepreneurship Program.

Anna Marletta shared the story of how she and her brother opened Bellini’s in downtown Lexington seven years ago. Marletta said 70 percent of the food served in the Italian restaurant is purchased from local growers. “It keeps us fresh and current,” said Marletta. “It’s so endearing to know where your food is coming from and the growers are proud too.” Marletta received a microloan from CVC six months ago and the results have been astounding. The restaurant hired new workers and purchased new equipment – and sales have increased by 50 percent, according to Marletta. “The future is very bright for us and we’re looking to expand,” said Marletta. “We’re proud to be part of the revitalization of downtown.” To find out more about USDA Rural Development’s Business Programs click here.  To find out more about opportunities in Kentucky click here.

"Philly Market Rises Up to Meet Hunger Challenge  Did you know that nearly one-third of the food available to U.S. retailers and consumers never makes it to the dining room table?  That’s 133 billion pounds of food going to waste--all of which has far-reaching impacts on food security, resource conservation, and climate change.  Experts have projected that reducing food waste by just 15 percent would provide the equivalent of enough food for more than 25 million Americans every year. That’s why my agency, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), decided to help tackle the problem by sponsoring the Terminal Market Food Waste Challenge.  Produce markets across the U.S. joined the friendly 90-day competition by making sure that usable fruits and vegetables were not thrown away.  While these fresh foods weren’t picture-perfect supermarket quality or simply didn’t sell, they were healthy, wholesome foods that could be made into juices, added to animal feeds, used for compost, or donated to charity.

"USDA Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement in  Equity  Initiatives  May 25,  Veteran Tray Middlebrooks grew up in Merritt Island, Florida, and Manassas, Virginia. After college, he wanted to follow a reliable and purposeful path forward. He went on to serve 10 years of active duty as an Air Force medic stationed in Nevada and Florida followed by three years in the Florida reserves. Post-service, Tray found it challenging to secure permanent, fulltime employment. He found a temporary position working for the U.S. Small Business Administration, but his goal was to secure a permanent federal position. Fortunately, Tray met USDA Military Veterans Agricultural Liaison (MVAL) Monshi “Ram” Ramdass. Ram helped Tray narrow his search and navigate the federal application process, helping him be successful. “I kept on applying and kept on applying,” Tray said. “I am here today because Ram did not give up on my career placement.” Today Tray is a loan specialist with USDA’s Rural Development in South Carolina. He is the team lead for his area and serves on a planning committee to help streamline the loan application process. His day-to-day work involves helping individuals and families in rural communities work towards their own goals, which he finds a rewarding use of his experience. He believes veterans can bring great experience to the government, including leadership, a strong work ethic, reliability and integrity. He wants fellow veterans to know that they, too, can be successful in the federal workforce by using the skills they gained in the military, such as the ability to work well with others to achieve common goals. “You can apply your military experience to a government position that will allow you to continue to serve your country in a new way,” he said. “We know how to work, replicate, teach and lead to reach team goals.” His boss agrees. “Tray has brought a wealth of knowledge and excellent leadership skills to our agency,” said USDA Rural Development South Carolina State Director Dr. Saundra Glover. “I believe his military experience helped him perfect those skills, which he uses daily when helping individuals from diverse backgrounds apply for home loans or grants under our Single-Family Housing Programs, working with lenders or entrepreneurs interested in our Business and Cooperatives Programs, or connecting with leaders from surrounding rural communities and providing them information about our Community Facilities Programs or Water and Environmental Programs.” USDA welcomes veterans like Tray and the many skills they can bring to the agency.

"Deputy Undersecretary for the USDA Food Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 22,   Feeding students healthy, tasty and nutritious school meals can be a challenge.  Just ask any one of the thousands of school nutrition professionals who carry out the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program.  They have to balance menu planning following nutrition standards, financial management, and inventory management, all while making meals that will be enjoyed by students – not always an easy audience.  It is a testament to their dedication that over 90 percent of America’s schools have now implemented the improved standards found in the Healthy Hungry Free Kids Act of . USDA is working hard to find ways to continue to support their efforts. One way we are doing that is a new program that we recently piloted in Mississippi that provides free training through a partnership with the National Food Service Management Institute (NFSMI). The Team Up For School Nutrition Success Training (Team Up) is tailored to schools and covers topics like menu planning, financial management, procurement, meal presentation and appeal, as well as youth engagement tactics, and strategies to reduce plate waste.   Another partner in this initiative is First Lady Michelle Obama. Mrs. Obama is grateful for the hard work being done in our country’s school cafeterias, but also recognizes that some may need a little help. When she heard about our initiative, she took the time to make a video to not only thank and encourage the dedicated school food service professional around the country, but to encourage them to take advantage of Team Up. Hear with the First Lady had to say about Team Up:  The name Team Up really says it all. This unique learning experience provides not only professional training and resources, but peer-to-peer mentoring. Schools have the opportunity to learn from each other, in order to make positive strides toward providing healthy school environments with financial stability and strong student participation. It isn’t a one-off experience. The peer-to-peer mentoring will continue after trainees return to their districts, and NFSMI will conduct 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups to gauge the success of the plans the schools developed after the training.  If additional training is needed, NFSMI will recommend options based on the schools progress.  The state agencies and USDA Food and Nutrition Services will also provide support and feedback.  I couldn’t be more pleased with what I have heard about the how the first training class went, which was attended by 53 participants and 27 mentors. Participants told us that it was helpful to have a chance to discuss their individual challenges, as well as those that participants had in common. They said that hearing their colleagues and mentors talk about how they have handled some of these challenges in their schools was especially helpful.  Some participants even said that it was the best training they had ever attended!  The Kentucky Department of Education staff was so inspired that they created a video to say what a great experience they had. We look forward to continuing our relationship with the White House and all the trainees. Together we can ensure that America’s students are getting and eating the healthiest food possible during the school day.

"in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Feb 02,   Last week was an exciting week for America’s school lunchrooms.  Our new meal standards were announced and they will help improve the health of millions of children.  These new standards represent one of five major components of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of .  There’s more to come: The ability to take nutrition standards beyond the lunch line - for the first time ever, rules for foods and beverages sold in vending machines and other venues on school campuses will contribute to a healthy diet;  Increased funding for schools – an additional 6 cents a meal will be available -- the first real increase in 30 years – tied to strong performance in serving improved meals; Common-sense pricing standards for schools will ensure that revenues from non-Federal sources keep pace with the Federal commitment to healthy school meals and properly align with costs; and Training and technical assistance will help schools achieve and monitor compliance. Through the establishment of a new grant program, The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of will also allow the USDA to take a giant step forward in facilitating growth in farm to school programs, in which schools bring in locally produced food from neighboring farms.  The USDA Farm to School Team, an outgrowth of the  Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative, has been busy the last couple of years trying to figure out how Farm to School efforts can best contribute to improved health and well being of kids participating in school meals.  The Team has done great work and people can access the resources collected and follow their travels from the FNS website. This week, we took another important step as Deborah Kane  began work at the USDA as the National Director of USDA’s Farm to School Program.  Deborah Kane comes to USDA from Ecotrust in Portland, Oregon, where she founded and ran Food-Hub.org, a groundbreaking food hub connecting farmers and buyers, including schools, across the Northwest.  She was also recognized by the White House as a “Champion of Change” for her work in regional food system development. Deborah will work with the Secretary and me, along with leaders from the Agricultural Marketing Service, Food and Nutrition Service, and the USDA Farm to School Team to promote and expand our Farm to School efforts by implementing the provisions provided in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of , overseeing a new farm to school grant program, and continuing to find creative ways to increase schools’ access to local foods.  Deborah joins a great Team at USDA already at work on Farm to School and primed for even greater success.  USDA expects to enhance schools’ ability to work with regional producers, create economic opportunities for food producers of all kinds and empower schools to increase or augment programming that builds food literacy among the nation’s children.

"Deputy Under Secretary of Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  Feb 11,  USDA Deputy Undersecretary Ann Mills (ninth from left) visits with Leopold Conservation Award winners at USDA last week. USDA photo. “Water conservation begins where the first drop of rain falls…most likely on private working lands.” This is a favorite saying of Tom Vandivier, a Texas cattle rancher and recipient of the Sand County Foundation’s Leopold Conservation Award (LCA). Tom was one of more than two dozen recipients of the LCA – which recognized landowners for achievement in environmental improvement on agricultural land – in Washington, D.C. last week.  I was fortunate to meet with them here at USDA headquarters to talk about the importance of conservation and the need to spread the message that investing in conservation practices on our farm and ranch lands not only protects water, air and wildlife – it also makes economic sense. Jill Giacomini Basch is a LCA recipient who, with her father and three sisters, owns a family dairy in Marin County, Calif.  I had a chance to meet with the Giacomini family during my tour of several California farms last month. Jill explained that conservation improves the way they run their business. Partnerships with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and others have helped them protect their land and water resources, and ensure their dairy will be prosperous for the next generation. “We have very close ties with NRCS and other programs,” Jill said. “They have helped us with our water allocation -- above ground storage pond facilities and spring well drilling.  With the USDA we were able to utilize new technology to install a methane digester to help mitigate waste run off into the nearby lagoon, but also eventually the Point Reyes National Seashore.  Because of the methane digester, we generate about 65 percent of our on farm energy needs.” “Much of the work we’ve done has been through NRCS programs,” Tom added. “NRCS is very important to us.  We’re very much about conservation. The stewardship practices that we’ve accomplished on our property have enhanced water resources in the state of Texas.  I think it’s a message that needs to be spread so others can take similar stewardship practices and hopefully have the same results in their perspective states.” Jon Bednarski, LCA recipient, shared his story as well.  He started farming 12 years ago outside of Louisville, Ky.  After meeting with NRCS, he discovered he was farming a “sensitive” piece of land, upstream of Louisville’s drinking water source. Since then he has managed his operation to help protect water quality. The group discussed the need for conservation in the face of extreme weather – including the significant drought conditions in 11 western states.  As we were meeting, the U.S. Senate was in the process of voting on the Agricultural Act of . I talked about how important this legislation is to providing the tools and programs necessary for USDA to help farmers, ranchers and forestland owners manage the risk and uncertainty associated with extreme weather and climate change.  Conservation programs will be streamlined to better target limited resources to areas of highest need, while building on record conservation and stewardship efforts already underway.  I also previewed Secretary Tom Vilsack’s announcement of USDA’s new regional hubs to help agriculture and forestry mitigate the impacts of a changing climate. The group also discussed the importance of passing on to the next generation the passion for agriculture and land stewardship.  There is a new energy in America around opportunities in agriculture. The Agricultural Act of will provide our communities with additional support to attract new economic opportunity and create jobs.  We all agreed that outreach and education is crucial.  USDA will continue to work with the LCA recipients and other partners to make that happen.  To view a video about the meeting click here.

He’s dedicated to connecting the communities of Southeast Alaska to the stunning, natural world that surrounds them including the Tongass National Forest. Sitka Conservation Society’s charge is to protect the forest’s natural environment while supporting sustainable development of surrounding Southeast Alaska communities. As director, Harris has worked for the last seven years to bring these communities together with those responsible for managing the landscape. The society and the forest partner together for work focused on ecological monitoring projects. For the past five years, they have worked with the Sitka Ranger District and local young students to monitor the effects of stream restoration projects. Harris has focused on increasing the number of interns in resource management during the past several years. “Our internship program benefits both the interns and the organization,” said Harris. “We are often able to hire people who grew up in Alaska who just finished college or are looking for summer work. They want to do so something in their field of interest and we give them that opportunity.” The injection of youthful energy that the student interns bring to the projects also assist his long-term goal to motivate the students to stay involved in natural resource management on a professional level. “Some of the interns may decide to go on to college,” Harris said. “This would prepare them to work for the Forest Service as a technician, biologist or researcher. But even if they don’t do that, they will still have knowledge of what’s going on in the woods in their backyards.” The interns are savvy with social media tools and create outreach videos and blogs for the internet. They also employ traditional media like newspapers and radio. “They’re all over it,” said Harris. “They help spread the word and they are excited about it.” Kelly Petty, a fisheries technician intern with Sitka Conservation Society, learns how to measure fish smolt on Twelvemile Creek on Prince of Wales Island.

The non-profit organization recruits high school students from Klawock, Craig and Hydaburg on Prince of Wales Island to get them involved in long-term monitoring projects with the society and Forest Service staff for hands-on outdoor experience in collection. As the largest national forest and the largest remaining temperate rainforest on earth, the Tongass is also home to many rural communities that depend on the forest’s natural resources including the five salmon species that swim its waters. Last summer, a statewide citizen science initiative called Stream Team sponsored by the society, Forest Service and National Forest Foundation involved students in work with fisheries technicians and researchers at Twelvemile Creek on Prince of Wales Island. Students honed their math and other academic skills to learn more about forest management, salmon habitat, and restoration efforts on the forest. The Sitka Conservation Society created an inspiring video of the Twelvemile Creek story profiling the students in action. For Harris, this is another successful chapter in the Society’s role to connect young people to the outdoors and encourage development of future scientists and technicians. It’s often an inspiring opportunity for local youth to help and learn from natural resource management decision makers including those on the Tongass National Forest.

Many people want to cultivate healthier eating habits and March, National Nutrition Month, may be a great time to start. USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service’s MyPlate website is a resource available to help get on (or back on) the nutrition track. MyPlate itself is divided into five major food groups – vegetables, fruits, grains, protein foods, and dairy and fortified soy alternatives. But do you ever wonder where your food comes from, and how much our hardworking farmers and ranchers produce in a year? Here are facts about some of America’s favorite, nutritious foods: According to USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS), the tomato is one of the most commonly eaten vegetables in the country. In , U.S. farmers produced 24.1 billion pounds of tomatoes with California producing more than 97%. Apples are also a big hit in the U.S.. In , our growers produced nearly 11 billion pounds, nearly 69% of which came from Washington state. The average yield from each of Washington’s 172,000 total apple bearing acres was 44,200 pounds! For , check out the Non-Citrus Fruits & Nuts Annual Report. Wheat, a health-promoting grain found in many foods, is one of our largest field crops.

"Taking a Bite out of the Local Apple in the Windy City  March is National Nutrition Month, and local food plays an important role in providing Americans with fresh, healthy fuel for their bodies. From farmers to financiers to schools and hospitals, there is a lot of passion for sharing good food by supporting strong local and regional food systems. I experienced this firsthand during my trip to Chicago, Ill., where I spoke at last week’s Good Food Festival & Conference. The trip came on the heels of a recent announcement that USDA is making $97 million available to expand access to healthy food and support rural economies.  Grants from my agency -- the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) – make up over $90 million of that funding.  AMS was a sponsor and exhibitor at the trade show, where we shared information with stakeholders about the many resources we have to support local and regional food systems. Through our Specialty Crop Block Grant Program and Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program (comprised of the Farmers Market Promotion Program and the Local Food Promotion Program), AMS supports producers, local food entrepreneurs, and rural and urban communities across the country.

"Coexistence is critical to U.S. agriculture-biotech, organic and non-GE farmers are all vitally important to U.S. agriculture-they all have to thrive. We see a key role for each of these sectors in meeting our global and domestic food needs, increasing sustainability, and enhancing farm profitability and economic development. All three segments are vital, important, and a part of rural America's success. All three sectors should be able to thrive together. Over the last two decades, there has been rapid adoption by farmers of new technologies, like biotechnology. Biotechnology holds great promise for agriculture here in the United States, and around the world. USDA's regulatory system has done a very good job of safely bringing genetically engineered (GE) agricultural products to market. There has also been strong growth in the organic sector and in identity preserved markets. These identity preserved markets include meeting requirements of trading partners who don't accept GE products and the organic market. It also encompasses other products with particular, non-GE, but not organic, characteristics. The rise and growth of all these sectors is great for U.S. agriculture. It means farmers have a range of ways to meet consumer needs and preferences both here and around the world. It means they can grow their operations and contribute to the success and vitality of rural America. But it also presents challenges. The developers and users of GE products want the ability to use the technology to help us feed our country and the world. And the organic and identity preserved sectors are sensitive to the unintended presence of GE material in those product streams. Coexistence is an important challenge facing U.S. agriculture today. Farmers and others in the food and feed production chain have an important role in collaborating to make coexistence work. USDA is working to increase awareness of the need for coexistence, as well as information on practices that can help support it. USDA is also working to help different sectors of agriculture exchange information, build coalitions, and make decisions that contribute to or directly support coexistence.","What is the primary challenge facing U.S. agriculture in terms of biotech adoption, and how can farmers and stakeholders collaborate to achieve effective coexistence?","The primary challenge facing U.S. agriculture is Coexistence between genetically engineered (GE) agricultural products and organic/non-GE sectors.

"NRCS Washington in  Conservation  Apr 22,  The bright yellow demonstration house built by Earth Team volunteers Mike and Jill Viafore is being used at fairs and exhibits to show how to install a home rain barrel and miniature rain garden. Using these practices, homeowners can save water and protect nearby lakes and streams from pollution.  Mike and Jill Viafore are crafty. This past summer, the couple designed and built a portable demonstration house to educate the public about the benefits of rain barrels and rain gardens at exhibits and fairs. But the Viafores didn’t put this exhibit together just for fun—they are contributing their crafty skills as Earth Team volunteers. Earth Team is the name given to USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service volunteers. Earth Team volunteers work side by side with Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) employees on conservation projects to improve their local environment. The NRCS Pierce Conservation District Stream Team uses the shed-sized structure the Viafores built as a conservation education tool in the Seattle, Wash., area. With the easily transported house, Stream Team volunteers can now show people ways they can minimize the impact of stormwater on local streams using rain barrels and rain gardens. Rain barrels take rainwater from roofs and divert it into a barrel. The captured water can then be used to water gardens and landscapes during dryer periods. Rain gardens are attractive landscape features that take stormwater from roofs and other impervious surfaces and filters pollutants out as the water percolates down through the soil into the groundwater to help recharge aquifers. Stream Team personnel say the Viafore–built house allows them to better demonstrate the importance of using conservation practices to protect local streams, lakes and the nearby Pacific Ocean. Earth Team volunteers Jill and Mike Viafore stand in front of a portable demonstration house they built in Washington State. The structure is being used to exhibit the benefits of urban conservation practices to residents near Seattle. In , more than 32,000 Earth Team volunteers donated 641,549 hours of service to NRCS estimated to be worth $13.4 million. Since Earth Team was formed in , over half a million volunteers have donated an estimated $327 million worth of time, in dollars, helping NRCS with its conservation mission.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Feb 23,  The SGI Interactive Web Application enables conservationists to help plan the best conservation efforts to restore sage grouse habitat. (Click to enlarge) The saying “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts” is often attributed to the Greek philosopher Aristotle, and that couldn’t be more true when it comes to doing conservation planning across 11 states, multiple federal agencies and millions of acres of public and private land. The Sage Grouse Initiative (SGI), led by USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), introduces the SGI Interactive Web Application, a tool that will take habitat restoration efforts for sage grouse to new heights — both visually and on the ground. The tool graphically layers vital pieces of information to paint a more cohesive picture of connected landscapes, so state and federal agencies and their partners can make more effective and targeted decisions. For instance, the web application includes a brand new high-resolution map of conifer encroachment across 100 million acres of sagebrush-steppe landscape. Invading conifers degrade the sagebrush landscape by crowding out native plants, that’s why NRCS and its partners target their removal when they’re young. Conifers are just one layer. Each layer added will help address threats that NRCS is prioritizing through the Sage Grouse Initiative 2.0 investment strategy, a four-year $211 million effort to help conserve sagebrush habitats in 11 Western states. A second layer available depicts the ecosystem’s resilience and resistance based on underlying soil temperature and moisture,” said Jeremy Maestas, NRCS regional biologist. “Someone using the application will be able to visualize which areas are more or less likely to rebound after wildfire and resist cheatgrass invasion,” Maestas said. “By putting these cutting-edge products at the fingertips of practitioners and landowners, it helps us more quickly apply science and technology into targeted action on the ground.” The SGI partnership is in the process of adding more layers to the web application and layers will be periodically updated to reflect the most recent scientific information. Brady Allred, a rangeland specialist with University of Montana, developed the tool for SGI using Google Earth Engine, a platform for petabyte-scale scientific analysis and visualization of geospatial datasets, both for public benefit and for business and government users. “By using Google Earth Engine, we are able to do range-wide science and conservation planning that was functionally impossible before,” Allred said. “And because Google Earth Engine is built for the web, we can immediately implement that science into planning and decision making.” Soon the web application will be completely interactive, allowing the user to change analysis parameters, input new , or specify an area of particular interest for a more detailed analysis. It gives the user the ability to get the exact information he or she needs. “Geography is not a barrier here,” Allred said. “By focusing on the entire western half of the country, we are able to get the whole picture—a better view of what is occurring. This improves conservation planning for all western rangelands.” Since , NRCS has worked with ranchers to restore and protect more than 5 million acres of sage grouse habitat through SGI. This work was part of a large landscape-level effort that led the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to conclude last year that the sage grouse did not warrant protection under the Endangered Species Act.

"in  USDA Results  Sep 23,   A week ago, President Obama released the American Jobs Act, a specific plan to jumpstart our economy and put Americans to work today.  It contains ideas that both parties in Washington have supported.  And yesterday, he laid out a plan that will pay for it – and for other long-term investments we need to stay competitive – while reducing our deficits. The plan takes a balanced approach.  It looks for savings across government.  And it asks everyone to do their part and pay their fair share so we can live within our means. For agriculture, the plan focuses on what the President and I believe is one of the most pressing challenges facing producers right now: maintaining a strong safety net and disaster assistance programs that will work for all farmers and ranchers, no matter what they produce or where they produce it. The plan will extend our disaster assistance programs, which are currently set to run out of funding on October 1.  We will pay for the extension by making modest reductions to the subsidies that crop insurance companies receive.  Without the President’s plan, producers will lose the added protection our disaster programs offer. These aren’t easy changes, but they will help us maintain a strong safety net in the long term so that farmers knocked down by natural disaster can get their operations back on track.  After witnessing flood, drought, hurricanes, tornadoes and wildfires this year, I am even more certain of the importance of this component of the safety net. Farmers and ranchers know that to succeed they must work hard and invest wisely.  But they also understand the importance of living within their means.  Following the farm crisis of the s, they have taken steps to reduce their debt, and have thrived in recent years. The President’s plan takes a page out of their playbook.  The American Jobs Act will put people back to work now while building a strong foundation for sustained economic growth.  We just need folks in Washington D.C. to come together and get it done. At the same time, the President is making the tough calls and tough choices we need to get our fiscal house in order.  All of this will help create jobs, promote growth, and help build a stronger middle class.

"USDA Office of Communications in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Oct 15,  A student from DC Bilingual Public Charter School enjoys a taco. The following guest blog is part of our Cafeteria Stories series, highlighting the efforts of hard working school nutrition professionals who are dedicated to making the healthy choice the easy choice at schools across the country. We thank them for sharing their stories! By Bea Zuluaga, Food and Nutrition Director, CentroNía/DC Bilingual Public Charter School, Washington, DC Children living in Washington, D.C., and across the country spend a large part of their day in school and rely heavily on their educational institutions for nourishment. As educators, it is imperative that we expose children to a variety of healthy, nutrient-rich foods early on in their development, and CentroNía does just that! We prepare various meals and snacks to support children’s learning thanks to programs such as the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act of . With more than 260 employees who serve 2,500 children, youth, and families in the District of Columbia and Maryland, CentroNía’s mission is to educate children and youth, and strengthen families in a bilingual, multicultural community. We cook meals and prepare snacks on the premises that incorporate whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, more vegetarian proteins and local produce.  By eliminating processed foods and juices from our institution, we drastically reduced the sugar and sodium on our menus. Our menus are creative and have a variety of healthy foods that our children have learned to enjoy. Children love the tofu in their vegetarian chow-mein. We’ve even replaced fish sticks with baked tilapia. We are proud to offer our children five different fresh fruits and vegetables daily and have found that our children's love for local fruits facilitated the elimination of juices from our menus. Likewise, with salad bars, children feel empowered when they are able to serve themselves their own food. Many teachers and parents expressed skepticism at first of the menu changes and convincing them was our biggest challenge. To the delight and surprise of teachers and parents alike, children have embraced these changes because we consistently offer them healthier food choices. As a result, we created the campaign, “Eat Healthy, Live Healthy” and launched innovative basic nutrition workshops with teachers, highlighting the importance of exposing children to a variety of foods. Our curriculum, called “I Want to be Healthy,” teaches about selecting healthy foods, increasing physical activity, and drinking more water.  We've reached even further, availing ourselves of all opportunities to expose parents to our nutritious meals, inviting them to workshops and cooking demonstrations, and encouraging them to join in our efforts. Seven years into our program, our hard work has shown great results! Our teachers are now convinced that good foods are essential to each child's success, and they implement this nutrition foundation into the curriculum. In addition, our school nurse a decrease in the incidence of children complaining of stomach aches; and parents are telling us that their children are demanding salads at dinnertime. We are very excited with all of these outcomes and are delighted to be working with partners, such as Let’s Move!, to promote healthy eating habits for children and families across the country.

"Information Officer, Office of the Chief Economist in  Energy  Sep 21,  USDA Report highlights Increased Energy Efficiency for Corn-based Ethanol Harry Baumes, Acting Director of USDA’s Office of Energy Policy and New Uses, says a report that surveyed corn growers in and ethanol plants in indicates the net energy gain from converting corn to ethanol is improving in efficiency.  Titled “ Energy Balance for the Corn-Ethanol Industry,” the report surveyed ethanol producers about ethanol yield (undenatured) per bushel of corn and energy used in ethanol plants. This report measured all conventional fossil fuel energy, 53,785 BTU used in the production of 1 gallon of corn ethanol. For every British Thermal Unit (BTU)  (unit of heat equal to the amount of heat to raise one pound of water one degree  Fahrenheit at one atmosphere) of energy to make ethanol, 2.3 BTUs of energy are produced (energy output/energy input). The ratio is somewhat higher for some firms that are partially substituting biomass energy in processing energy (thermal and electrical energy in the plant to convert corn to one gallon of ethanol). Since the last study in , the net energy balance of corn ethanol has increased from 1.76 BTUs to 2.3 BTUs of energy. According to the report, overall, ethanol has made the transition from an energy sink (more energy used than energy produced), to a moderate net energy gain in the s, to a substantial net energy gain in the present. And there are still prospects for improvement. Ethanol yields have increased by about 10 percent in the last 20 years, so proportionately less corn is . In addition to refinements in ethanol technology, corn yields have increased by 39 percent over the last 20 years, requiring less land to produce ethanol.  The report can be found here.

Heart-healthy pecans are the focus of a project in Georgia to help educate health-conscious consumers on the nutritional values of tree nuts. Photo by Judy Baxter. This Saturday is National Nut Day, a perfect opportunity to honor nature’s nutritional dynamo– the nut.  It seems that Americans are more than a little nutty about nuts, which are considered specialty crops.  Nearly one out of every 10 of us eats nuts, or a nut product, at least once a day.  Almonds, walnuts and pecans are the top three nuts consumed in the United States* and the production of almonds, walnuts and pistachios has more than doubled in the last decade. Tree nuts – which include almonds, walnuts, pecans, pistachios, hazelnuts, and macadamia nuts – are a great source of plant protein.  Several nuts play a role in preventing heart disease or lowering cholesterol.  Although they are high in calories, nuts are a fiber-rich, phytonutrient, antioxidant (i.e.-Vitamin E), highly portable food that can enhance dinner, compliment dessert or stand alone as a tasty snack. California is the country's leading producer of tree nuts. Nearly 90 percent of each year's tree nut production is harvested from the state's orchards, including almost all almonds, pistachios and walnuts. Together, Georgia, New Mexico and Texas produce 75 percent of the U.S. pecan crop.  U.S. tree nut production since the mid-s has generated, on average, nearly $4 billion in annual farm cash receipts, with almonds, walnuts, pistachios, and pecans accounting for most of the sales. Earlier this month, we announced the award of ates and its territories.  In one project, the Georgia Department of Agriculture will partner with the state’s Agricultural Commodity Commission for Pecans.  They will promote pecans and educate health-conscious consumers on the importance of its antioxidant and health benefits by placing heart healthy billboards in strategic locations throughout the state.  Their outreach efforts will also include two minutes of pecan in-flight video on all Delta flights in November. In California, the Department of Food and Agriculture will partner with the Center for Produce Safety at the University of California to develop and implement new strategies for preventing salmonella contamination in almonds and pistachios.  The science-based strategies will focus on the transfer of the microbial dust and contaminants carrying salmonella from livestock farms and ranches to nearby almond and pistachio orchards.  They’ll also take a look at the contaminants found in places that handle almond and pistachio shelling/hulling. These projects along with several others will help strengthen the market for specialty crops, such as fruits, vegetables, dried fruits, horticulture and nursery crops, including floriculture, and tree nuts.  Find out what projects were funded in your area.

"Communications Staff Intern, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Aug 27,  A poultry producer checks the broiler hens in one of his chicken houses. (USDA photo by Bob Nichols) A major war was fought in -, with more than ates alone. You may not have seen much of it on the news, but there’s a good chance your wallet felt it. The outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in 17 states caused the American poultry industry to lose about 51.5 million chickens and turkeys. During this outbreak, the infected flocks cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1 billion in depopulation, cleanup, disinfection, and insurance payments. This also caused the egg-laying population to dramatically decrease. Poultry producers lost $1.1 billion in broiler exports (a 26-percent decrease from the previous year), $41 million in lost egg export income (down 13 percent), and $177 million in turkey export income (a 23-percent decline). The law of supply and demand, naturally, caused consumer prices to increase at grocery stores and restaurants. The danger of infectious disease outbreaks in the agricultural community is real and preventing them is critical for maintaining the supply of safe, nutritious, and affordable food. This is where biosecurity comes into play. USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supports agricultural biosecurity by providing funding and national program leadership to projects that secure and protect the integrity, reliability, sustainability, and profitability of the American food and agricultural system against catastrophic hazards, whether natural, emerging, accidental, or deliberate. Non-animal agricultural biosecurity issues include spotted wing drosophila, which caused $715 million of damage in berry and stone fruit crops, and the brown marmorated stink bug, which caused $37 million in damage to the apple industry across the mid-Atlantic region. Citrus greening disease, arguably the greatest current threat, is devastating the citrus industry in Texas, Arizona, California, and Florida, where about 80 percent citrus trees are affected. NIFA’s fight against citrus greening began in February with a $20.1 million investment in research and extension. The projects included the University of Central Florida testing a bactericide to kill the citrus greening bacteria and the University of California, Riverside developing disease resistant varieties of citrus. NIFA-funded projects advance our understanding of biosecurity and provide solutions for protecting the food supply from intentional and natural threats and hazards. The National Animal Health Laboratory Network, National Plant Diagnostic Network, and the Citrus Greening Research and Extension manage many of these projects. NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

"ADAPTA - New Climate Adaptation Video Series for Tropical Farmers  We are living in historic moments in the world’s response to climate change. Last December in Paris, delegates from 196 countries signed an agreement to work towards curtailing greenhouse gas emissions and to keep global warming to “well below” 2 °C degrees. This is a big step, but there is still much work to be done and the agricultural sector has an important role to play. Agriculture, forestry, and land degradation contribute just under a quarter of anthropogenic GHG emissions, mainly from deforestation and agricultural emissions from livestock, soil and nutrient management.  Climate change also poses a great challenge for food security and nutrition. It can reduce yields and affect where and how food is produced. As the risks of natural disasters increase, farmers need to modify how they produce food in order to become more resilient to prolonged droughts, excessive rains, floods, and more intense storms.

"Assistant Chief, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Aug 01,  The inlet once suffered from pollution. But the nearby community gathered together to improve water quality by preventing runoff of sediment and nutrients. Now, oysters thrive. NRCS photo. Two years ago, the Nisqually Shellfish Farm south of Belfair, Wash. didn’t have a chance. Runoff from surrounding homes and dairy farms polluted Henderson Inlet, and the state declared the water unfit for raising shellfish for human consumption. Worsening the problem, the place was overrun with an invasive species, the Japanese oyster drill, which feeds on and kills shellfish. But water quality in the inlet, which flows into Puget Sound, is improving. Last year, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) began working with a nearby tribe and shellfish producers to monitor and remove the Japanese oyster drill. NRCS also worked with the dairy farm to put conservation practices into place to contain runoff. Meanwhile, local homeowners working with Thurston County followed suit by striving to manage runoff from their lawns and, septic and storm water systems. It was neat to watch how conservation principles can be put to work to make a difference, whether we’re talking in acres or backyards. The work of both homeowners and the dairy led to good news for the inlet’s water quality: it was safe for shellfish operations. Once water was clean enough, NRCS assisted partners in rebuilding dense breeding populations of the Olympia oyster to restore ecosystem function. To do this, they had to restore prime habitat near the shoreline on which oyster larvae depend. Sue Shotwell with Nisqually Shellfish Farm and NRCS Assistant Chief Kirk Hanlin look at an oyster harvest at Nisqually Shellfish Farm. NRCS photo. Because of this work, the Nisqually Shellfish Farm is able to grow high quality oysters that not only feed the local community, but communities across the nation. This led to the creation of a new business where oysters are harvested daily, cleaned, put on ice, packed and shipped by air to New York City, where they’re showcased at top oyster bars. At the end of the day, I realized I had witnessed an effort that would be perfect for the new Regional Conservation Partnership Program. RCPP was created by the Farm Bill, and this new program aims to leverage bigger results by matching federal dollars with those of partners. The program looks to projects with definable goals, a variety of engaged partners and quantifiable results. RCPP can be the solution, leading to cleaner air and water, healthy soil and viable wildlife habitat. NRCS has already taken applications for fiscal funding for the program, but it’s not too late to look at the program for next year. The agency is in the process of requesting groups with stronger pre-proposals to prepare a full proposal. At NRCS, we’re proud we worked with a community to help restore an ecosystem and improve water quality while also creating jobs. That’s the win-win that we look for in conservation. But without the help of the local community none of this would have been possible.

"Our Unwavering Efforts in Facilitating Bilateral Trade  Recently, I had the pleasure of visiting with US Department of Agriculture counterparts in both Chile and Peru. My travel to South America was an opportunity to discuss our most recent trade successes and how we can further build on this great relationship and momentum.  In Chile, I met with the Chilean Minister of Agriculture, Carlos Furche and Chilean Agriculture and Livestock Service (SAG) officials to discuss bilateral animal and plant health trade issues. US Ambassador to Chile, Michael Hammer, was also in attendance. To better understand their domestic processes and procedures for imports, I participated in a tour of a grocery store selling U.S. products including U.S. beef and visited a feedlot and a dairy farm as well as other agricultural sites near Santiago. This year Chile granted market access to U.S. live cattle and renewed domestic access to U.S. bovine embryos, more easily allowing Chile’s farmers to improve the national beef and dairy herds with genetics supplied from the U.S. The last time I visited Chile was five years ago, so it was great to refresh the cooperative and collaborative working relationship between USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and SAG.

"Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  May 17,  ARS testing demonstrates the efficacy of DEET—used on the left hand—in repelling mosquitoes. For over 75 years, USDA scientists have been developing ways to protect the U.S. military around the world from powerful adversaries—mosquitoes and other biting arthropods that cause disease. Their work began in in a small USDA field laboratory in Orlando, where scientists made key discoveries about new chemicals for controlling these pests. At the time, the most effective repellents lasted only 2 hours, and the U.S. military needed a repellent that could protect for 10 hours. In , testing in Orlando confirmed DEET was an effective repellent; it was soon adopted for use by the U.S. Army, became commercially available by —and is still used widely today. Scientists at the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), USDA’s chief in-house research agency, have continued their search for better repellents ever since. They used the USDA database of 30,000 compounds to develop a model that used chemical structure for predicting how long a repellent would keep pests away. This model predicted that some compounds would be more effective than DEET, and subsequent research confirmed some compounds did indeed repel pests more than three times longer than DEET. In , the Department of Defense initiated a partnership with USDA and others as part of the Deployed War-Fighter Protection (DWFP) program. Its' mission: to develop and test management tools for pest and vector species that transmit diseases to deployed U.S. troops. ARS scientists in Gainesville, Florida; Beltsville, Maryland; and Oxford, Mississippi, have contributed discoveries about repellent as part of the DWFP research and accomplishments. ARS has also collaborated with the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Systems Center since to optimize the arthropod bite protection of factory-produced permethrin-treated uniforms. Treating uniforms became standard practice in the s, first with a miticide, and starting in with permethrin. ARS National Program Leader Uli Bernier has been responsible for developing protocols to evaluate uniform protection against mosquitoes, and in conducted a study that led to the registration of etofenprox as an alternative clothing repellent. He recently staffed an ARS information table at the 5th USA Science & Engineering Festival Expo, where he said visitors wanted to learn more about a new pest-resistant tropical lightweight uniform on display. Visitors were also fascinated by a cage of mosquitoes used for research—but unlike USDA researchers, they were reluctant to place their hand in a cage full of mosquitoes!

"International Affairs Fellow, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Nov 28,  USDA developed this U.S. Food Loss and Waste Reduction Hierarchy in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency. What should you have done with all of that leftover Thanksgiving turkey? Should you have frozen it, given it away, or composted it? Maybe these aren’t even the right questions. Should you have bought a smaller bird? What would you have done if you were in the country of Turkey? Or if you were in Japan? You may never have thought that everyday questions like these could come up in international organizations, but they do. Food loss and waste (FLW) is a major global issue with far-reaching impacts on food security, resource efficiency and the environment. USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) estimates that in the United States, 31 percent of food available for human consumption at the retail and consumer levels goes uneaten. The U.S. approaches FLW in its own way, but it can benefit from teaching, learning from, and exploring collaborations with other countries.  FLW was one theme on the agenda for the recent Group of 20 (G20) Meeting of the Agricultural Chief Scientists (MACS) hosted by Germany. The G20 emerged as a forum for the governments and central bank governors of the 20 largest economies in the world. The G20 MACS was established in “to better coordinate agricultural research systems and to seek and apply common solutions strategies” in the fields of agriculture and nutrition across G20 countries. Since then, the G20 Agricultural Chief Scientists have gotten together annually to discuss important issues that can benefit from sharing information and approaches, and leveraging national agricultural research with efforts in other countries. USDA represents the United States at the MACS. Dr. Chavonda Jacobs-Young, Acting USDA Chief Scientist, led the U.S. delegation during two days of pre-meetings followed by two days of formal presentations and discussions. In this role, she represented U.S. national agricultural research priorities and the breadth of USDA agricultural research. In the case of FLW, USDA has robust research and outreach efforts. Through this international forum, the U.S. can share its efforts, learn from those in other countries, and leverage its research with complementary work of others. We learned that Turkey, for example, has focused its FLW efforts on reducing over-purchasing and creative reuses of stale bread, while Japan promotes waste reduction by requiring businesses to manage their own waste. Based on U.S. research, it turns out the best solution to too much leftover turkey may not be in creative reuses at home, but in reducing FLW at the source – improving storage and distribution efficiencies earlier in the supply chain (see the U.S. Food Loss and Waste Reduction Hierarchy). Check out this ERS article for an in-depth overview of food loss. Happy holidays!

This is an important first step in the process to write the legislation and get it passed into law. Farmers, ranchers, and the men and women who live in rural communities deserve to know what the rules will be moving forward. With the current law expiring, we cannot wait any longer to reauthorize this essential law for rural America. It needs to happen this year. That is why I am pleased that Senators Stabenow and Roberts have stepped up and are working together on a bipartisan basis to get the ball rolling. As they go through the process, I’m optimistic that members of Congress will make sure this bill will support farmers… guarantee a safe, affordable, and nutritious food supply…. promote trade and agricultural research… fund nutrition programs that help millions of families put food on the table… and help create jobs for the American people, especially in rural America. Last fall I laid out my priorities for this farm, food and jobs bill – and they remain the same today. For producers, Congress must focus on three core principles that have shaped the success of the American producer over generations: maintaining a strong safety net, supporting sustainable productivity and promoting vibrant markets. They should remember that this bill is about the future, so it must support and grow the next generation of farmers. By focusing on these priorities as they work to pass a bill this year, Congress will help move our nation and our economy forward.

During this holiday week, I couldn't help but think of my recent visit with Ms. Rebecca Weber of St. Johns, Michigan – about twenty minutes north of our state capital of Lansing. USDA Rural Housing Service Administrator Tony Hernandez and I were able to meet Ms. Weber and hear her inspiring story. USDA Rural Development in Michigan has forged a valuable partnership with Habitat for Humanity, where USDA provides the necessary financing for these families to build their homes. Rebecca Weber is one of the shining examples of success coming from that partnership. Rebecca is a hard-working single mother who built her home this year with the help of Habitat for Humanity and USDA Rural Development. Rebecca was so dedicated to getting this home build, that when heavy rains this summer forced a six-month delay due to standing water, she enlister her mother and together they bailed out the property with five gallon buckets to get things back on schedule. Rebecca told us her motivation was her daughter Kelseigh, as she wanted Kelseigh to have a home, something Rebecca didn't have. Now those two are enjoying their first Christmas in their new home, and I'm genuinely pleased to know we played a role in helping them achieve this dream. We also had time to visit Sunrise Apartments in Keeler, Michigan. This off-farm labor housing is currently under renovation with financing made possible through USDA Rural Development. Construction is expected to be completed in time for the next growing season, and the site was buzzing with activity.

"and Danielle Shannon, Northern Forests Climate Hub in  May 05,  White-water rapids (class 5 rapids) of the Tutshi River and Canyon in the British Columbia, Canada. USDA photo by Alice Welch. All this month we will be taking a look at what a changing climate means to Agriculture. The ten regional USDA Climate Hubs were established to synthesize and translate climate science  and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers that are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA's Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate. There are many reasons landowners value forests - their iconic beauty, cultural connections, wildlife, recreation, and economic opportunities.  More reasons and in-depth information can be found in the USDA Forest Service National Woodland Owner Survey. The bottom line is forests help to sustain our local communities: ecologically, economically, and culturally, and many forests are vulnerable to climate change. These ecosystems are already responding to changing conditions, and climate change is anticipated to have a pervasive influence on forests over the coming decades. Careful forest stewardship involves long-term planning, which naturally includes the consideration of these changing climate influences. This is especially true in northern forests that formed in cold climates, but are now beginning to experience rapid change. Our northern neighbors in Canada manage 397 million hectares of forests and woodlands (approximately 10% of the worlds forest cover), which face many of the same climate change impacts and challenges that we are grappling with in the United States. Because each country shares a similar set of values and challenges related to climate impacts on forests and agricultural lands, the USDA Northern Forests Climate Hub is actively working with Natural Resources Canada and the Canadian Forest Service to share scientific and technical expertise pertaining to climate change adaptation, resources and tools. The purpose of this work is to build meaningful connections and partnerships that will aid natural resource professionals to make climate-informed decisions in their management and planning activities regardless of which nation they work in. Recently, Dr. Chris Swanston, Director of the USDA Northern Forests Climate Hub was invited by Natural Resources Canada to speak to a variety of groups, including presenting at the Adaptation Canada conference. While visiting, Dr. Swanston shared forest adaptation tools and real-world examples developed through the Climate Change Response Framework, which is led by the Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science. He also actively learned from the Canadian Forest Service’s Forest Change Initiative, which has developed climate indicators, assessment, and tools for northern forests. Nationally, the USDA Climate Hubs could be a platform for science delivery between both countries, sharing not only resources created in the U.S. but also Canadian approaches to climate adaptation planning and implementation strategies. The strategy to bridge science and management as an approach to considering climate change impacts on public and private lands was by all accounts well received, and the USDA Northern Forests Climate Hub looks forward to future engagements and collaborations. The pace of change in our northern forests dictates that we learn quickly and learn together. Per Capita forest area (hectares).

"FNCS in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Dec 15,  Sixth Grade cheerleaders from Sumrall Middle School perform a “healthy eating” cheer during a HealthierUS School Challenge awards ceremony where their school received a Gold level award from USDA FNCS Deputy Under Secretary Dr. Janey Thornton.  I was privileged to go to the State of Mississippi on Dec. 9, for a HealthierUS School Challenge event.  Actually, I was there for three events and 11 schools received either USDA’s Gold of Distinction Awards or Gold Awards.  One of the six schools that was recognized for the Gold of Distinction Award was Purvis High School in Purvis, Miss.  This school is actually the first high school in the country to win this award and counting the other five Gold of Distinction award winners; these six schools are the first in Mississippi to be recognized for this particular award. Certainly nutrition staff, along with parents, teachers and students, have played a huge role in Lamar County School District’s success. The Child Nutrition Department for the district has a centralized menu providing daily:  four entrees, chef or specialty salads, three to four fruit and vegetable choices, and whole grain bread and croutons baked daily.  An annual PTO Academy is conducted keeping parents and faculty abreast of wellness policy regulations and fresh ideas on healthier snacks and fundraising. In addition, some of the schools have their own gardens. Some require walking a few laps around the track or field before starting free play at recess.  The Child Nutrition Staff has a lot of training every year in food preparation and presentation, and whole grain breads are baked from scratch daily at all of the schools. I think you can readily see why Lamar County School District is an outstanding organization that encourages wellness.  So many of its schools are providing an excellent nutrition environment and exercise opportunities for their students.  I was encouraged by what I saw and I hope many more schools will follow Lamar County School District’s example.      USDA’s HealthierUS School Challenge recognizes schools that create and maintain healthy school environments by promoting good nutrition and physical activity.  It’s a key component of First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! campaign to end childhood obesity within a generation.

Follow along on the USDA blog. Earlier today, I met with leaders from the 566 federally-recognized Native nations who participated in the White House Tribal Nations Conference. This was the seventh of such conferences hosted by the Obama Administration, and built upon the President’s commitment to strengthen the government-to-government relationship with Indian Country and to improve the lives of American Indians and Alaska Natives, with an emphasis on increasing opportunity for Native youth. All told, over the course of the Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture alone has invested nearly $3 billion in rural development projects that have helped Tribal members achieve the dream of homeownership; improved community facilities in Tribal communities; made critical upgrades to electric, water and telecommunications infrastructure that serve Tribal communities and members; and invested in the Tribal businesses and entrepreneurs who drive economic growth in Indian Country.

"Office of Communication, US Forest Service in  Initiatives  Forestry  Mar 11,   In , the Girl Scouts of the USA adopted “Linking Girls to the Land,” a program supported by the U.S. Forest Service and one that echoes the non-profit organization’s nearly decade-long legacy of helping to build girls of courage, confidence and character, and who make the world a better place. On Saturday, March 12, as they have all week during National Girl Scout Week, the organization will honor founder Juliette Gordon Low, who organized the nation’s first Girl Scout Troop with just 18 girls in Savannah, Ga., 99 years ago. Congress chartered the Girl Scouts of the USA on March 16, . Today, there are more than 3.2 million Girl Scouts and more than 50 million American women who wore the uniform during their childhood. By partnering with the Girls Scouts and other federal natural resource agencies and partnering organizations, the Forest Service is helping to provide girls with the tools to discover stewardship principles as a personal value, to connect with a natural or cultural resource agency, to participate in a career program and take action on addressing environmental issues. The 16-year-old program shows that by learning from women mentors who are natural resource professionals, girls in the program see first-hand the vast array of careers available to them in environmental, outdoor, and science fields. The program has reached about 40,000 girls – more than half from underserved backgrounds. Some Forest Service women work directly with Girl Scouts in outdoor camps where federal resource agency employees mentor girls on environmental education, career exploration, outdoor skills development and action and service learning. Others work with the Girl Scouts through many Forest Service-sponsored programs, such as during National Public Lands Day, National Get Outdoors Day and Take Pride in America.

"Under Secretary of USDA Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  Trade  Apr 11,   Earlier this year, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) published the first Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) Wholesale Pork .  This was the culmination of a process that started when Congress passed the Mandatory Price Reporting Act of , which added wholesale pork cuts to the commodities to be reported by packers.  Cattle, swine, sheep, boxed beef, boxed lamb, and imported lamb meat already were covered under the program. Using negotiated rulemaking – a process that allows more interaction with stakeholders than formal rulemaking – AMS developed the rule with the Wholesale Pork Reporting Negotiated Rulemaking Committee, which included pork producers, pork packers, processors, retailers, buyers, and other interested stakeholders.  By working directly with a range of stakeholders, USDA ensured that the final rule had support throughout the industry. In January , pork processing plants began submitting the price and quantity of each sale, as well as sale characteristics like type of sale, item description, and destination. The new system captures more on negotiated spot market trades; formula, forward, and export trades; less-than-carlot pork sales; pork sales to NAFTA countries; and frozen pork sales.  Packers are reporting products that AMS was not previously able to collect, like skinless bellies and some boneless ham cuts. AMS uses this information to produce market for the public that provide significantly more information and a more complete, accurate picture of the industry.  AMS has already seen a jump in the volume of daily negotiated transactions reported by the industry, with more than eight times as many transactions being captured.  The increased volume of sales transactions yields more that can be used as the basis for calculating the daily pork carcass cutout value – a key pricing mechanism used by the industry. Everyone knows the saying, “Knowledge is power.”  Having spent decades working with livestock producers, dealers, and markets, I know this is also true in livestock production and marketing.  That is why it is critical to distribute this robust, reliable, timely information to everyone in the pork industry.  Leveling this information playing field will mean more confidence in the fairness and transparency of the prices being paid throughout the marketplace.  The sheer volume and breadth of pork products reported with LMR provides the entire pork industry with more market information than ever before.  This greater market transparency is a testament to the success of the LMR program. USDA is committed to supporting businesses of all sizes.  Fostering marketplace transparency is just one of the many ways we meet this goal.  But we don’t do it alone – this new program wouldn’t have been possible without the dedication of the negotiated rulemaking committee and the stakeholders that USDA employees worked with throughout the process.

"Rural  Jul 01,   Written by USDA Public Relations Intern Megan Harrison In celebration of June as National Homeownership Month, I had the privilege of travelling all over the state of Illinois (from Freeport in northern Illinois to 400 miles south in Carterville, and a few places in between) with Illinois Rural Development staff to watch a “talk show” hosted by our state director, Colleen Callahan. The unique talk show-format gave me an interesting perspective on homeowners who used our programs to achieve the “American Dream” of owning a home.  Instead of having the homeowners (and everyone involved in their purchasing process) stand up and give a presentation, Colleen interviewed each of them to get a more personal look at their experience with USDA Rural Development.   Since I just started working here last month, this was truly my first exposure to Rural Development “in action.” The opportunity of hearing the direct beneficiaries talk about their experiences with our loan programs is simply amazing (and it also happens to be my favorite part of the show).  They are so appreciative and excited about their new homes that it’s hard for anyone in the room to miss because it’s written all over their faces.   Talk about a work motivator!  Seeing the lives that Rural Development impacts just gives you a sense of accomplishment and inspires you to work harder. I discovered that the format of the event was a very clever idea.  Instead of having the public listen to a person lecture or give a presentation, the talk show gave them an easy way to learn about Rural Development programs in a causal and interactive environment.  I’ve always felt I personally learn better when I can relate to the topic; so by listening to the conversations and stories in the talk show, the public was learning about the housing services Rural Development has to offer them. One topic I learned the most about (aside from some specifics in Rural Development’s programs) was the impact homeownership has on the community.  I knew that owning a home had advantages in a community, but I never stopped to think about it.  Several guests at our talk shows were interviewed about homeowners and community involvement.  When someone owns a home, the person is more likely to be a more active member of the community and volunteer, patronize local businesses and use facilities available to them within the community.  The livelihood of the community truly depends on the homeowners. With National Homeownership Month coming to a close, I realize just how important our programs are to those who need them.  It truly feels like Rural Development is making a difference in the lives of people who live in rural communities.

(Forest Service photo/Tiffany Holloway) On a recent cool, crisp spring morning in the mountains of Virginia, the Boy Scouts of America Troop 88 followed in the footsteps of the first “boys” of the Civilian Conservation Corps, the CCC. The first CCC camp, Camp Roosevelt, was established April 17, at the George Washington and Jefferson National Forest. Over time, the forest had 14 camps. The forest was celebrating the Civilian Conservation Corps’ 80th anniversary by inviting the scouts, missionaries, and Forest Service employees to participate in stewardship projects around an old CCC camp. Volunteers Westin Yardley and Ethan Richins said this was their first time participating in the clean-up. “We cleaned out the fire pits, cleared off the trails from debris, and did some leaf blowing,” said Yardley. Other stewardship projects included re-posting interpretative signs, which included pictures of what the camp looked like in the s and snippets of history about the camp. The interpretative signs were financed by one of the Civilian Conservation Corps members. Scouts from Boy Scouts of America Troop 88 dig a hole for a new interpretative sign. (Forest Service photo/Tiffany Holloway) “In his will, it stated that money would go to the Civilian Conservation Corps to help commemorate their legacy,” said Stephanie Chapman, recreation specialist on the George Washington and Jefferson National Forest. Ian Buschong, from Boy Scout Troop 88, was lead for this project and said, “I was interested in doing this project because the new signs will add to the camp experience.” The Civilian Conservation Corps, a public work relief program under President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, operated from to . The program, for unemployed, unmarried men between 18 and 25 years old, provided unskilled manual labor jobs related to the conservation and development of natural resources in rural lands owned by federal, state and local governments. Nationally, the Forest Service had several hundred camps across the U.S. mainland and Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico. Civilian Conservation Corps projects included: more than 3,470 fire towers erected 97,000 miles of fire roads built 4,235,000 man-days devoted to fighting fires more than 3 billion trees planted disease and insect control forest improvement — timber stand inventories, surveying, and reforestation forest recreation development — campgrounds built, complete with picnic shelters, swimming pools, fireplaces, and restrooms. “I’m really glad the Boy Scouts are taking care of the place.

"USDA Food Loss and Waste Liaison in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  May 07,  In , only 2.6 million tons of food scraps were composted, compared to 35 million tons that went into landfills, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). What are organizations doing to increase composting in the United States? In observance of International Compost Awareness Week (May 2-8), this interview features insights with Frank Franciosi, executive director of the U.S. Composting Council. Buzby: What’s the mission of the U.S. Composting Council? Franciosi: We believe compost manufacturing and compost use are central to creating healthy soils, clean air and water, a stable climate, and a sustainable society. Our sister organization the Compost Research & Education Foundation funds initiatives that enhance the stature and practices of the composting industry by supporting scientific research, increasing awareness, and educating practitioners and the public to advance environmentally and economically sustainable organics recycling. Buzby: What are the benefits of composting food waste? Franciosi: By investing in compost manufacturing infrastructure, training, and policy, 13.8 million tons of food scraps can be diverted annually from landfills through compost manufacturing, reducing an estimated 4.94 million tons in greenhouse gas equivalents, while creating over 14,200 new jobs. Buzby: Why does composting matter for climate change? Franciosi: Methane is 25 times more potent of a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Methane is generated in open landfills from decaying organic matter. The EPA that municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills are the third-largest source of human-related methane emissions in the United States, approximately 15.1 percent of these emissions in . When properly managed, the aerobic process of composting does not produce methane because methane-producing microbes are not active in the presence of oxygen. Compost also sequesters carbon and returns nutrients and minerals from food scraps to the soil. Buzby: How do you spread the word about the benefits of composting? Franciosi: We welcome anyone interested in composting – backyard composters, municipal programs, and large-scale centralized operators – to visit our websites for resources training, and certification. In June, we are launching a Target Organics Hub, a one-stop resource for municipalities to access information on how to start an organics recycling program for their community. Buzby: Do you see changes in how much people are composting? Franciosi: Over the past five to ten years, there has been an increase in food scrap composting. Municipalities like San Francisco were the early pioneers. Boulder, Austin, Phoenix, and Minneapolis all have successful curbside collection programs. There is a nationwide surge of growth of community composters: some manage household subscription programs and some have expanded into restaurants and food services. Consumers are also demanding a more sustainable way of handing their organic waste. California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and just recently Maryland, all have regulations on food scrap collection and mandates on keeping organics out of landfills and incinerators. Buzby: What is the most important take-away for the people to know about composting food waste? Franciosi: Food scrap is an untapped resource. It can and should be diverted from landfills and composted. The existing waste management infrastructure in the U.S. needs to be reconfigured so that this valuable resource can be returned to our soils. I urge you all to support source separated composting in your community at all levels. Read more blogs on the topic of food loss and waste.

"Office of the Climate Change Advisor, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Oct 14,  The massive Mendenhall Glacier in Alaska's Tongass National Forest is rapidly retreating. In this photo a developing forest can be seen above the glacier illustrating how the Mendenhall landscape is being dramatically altered by climate change. (Photo courtesy of The National Science Foundation, Durelle Scott) Day after day we’re seeing more impacts from climate change, and many concerned folks want to know what exactly their government is doing about it. In other words, who’s keeping score on what we’re doing as our climate warms? With this in mind, the U.S. Forest Service has developed something it calls the Climate Change Performance Scorecard. The scorecard was created as a way for the Forest Service to measure how well it was responding to climate change and to keep track of experiences and best practices so others could learn from them. “Given our role in managing our country’s natural resources, we have a particularly unique opportunity to respond,” said Dave Cleaves, U.S. Forest Service Climate Change Advisor. “The Scorecard is helping more forest land managers develop an understanding of how climate change will impact rivers, tree health, wildfire activity, and more … and what to do about it.” And, importantly, the Scorecard helps implement the Forest Service’s National Roadmap for Responding to Climate Change. “The Roadmap is our strategic guidance for pulling climate change into the Forest Service’s daily operations, and the Scorecard helps implement this guidance by focusing national forests’ efforts and tracking success,” said Cleaves. This is because the Scorecard is organized around areas like integrating climate change into employee education, program management, and partnerships. The Scorecard also encourages national forest land managers to better understand which of their natural resources are most vulnerable to climate change, how forests can operate more sustainably, and more. Since the Roadmap and Scorecard were released in , the Forest Service has accomplished impressive results. The majority of the Scorecard is now being successfully achieved by our national forest land managers. But this is just the beginning.

"USDA Michigan Public Information Officer in  Rural  Oct 12,   USDA Rural Development Michigan State Director James Turner joined Senator Debbie Stabenow and local officials this summer in celebrating the opening of the largest commercial-scale anaerobic digester in the United States. The Fremont Community Digester is an ambitious new use of a proven technology.  Once used chiefly in farms, anaerobic digesters are now coming into their own. The facility will convert organic waste products – such as farm and food waste – and process it into biogas.  Approximately 1,500 local families will derive their power from this previously untapped energy source. Just as importantly, the digester will greatly reduce pollution.  As NOVI Energy President Anand Gangadharan noted during his remarks, the bacteria colonies within the tanks are voraciously hungry and can process more than 100,000 tons of waste. The byproducts of this process can be used for fertilizer, soil amendments and cow bedding. USDA provided a $12,825,000 Rural Development loan guarantee to finance the project, which has a total cost of $22 million. Anaerobic digesters are in concert with an agreement with U.S. dairy producers signed by the Secretary in Copenhagen, Denmark in to accelerate adoption of innovative manure to energy projects on American dairy farms. The agreement represents a dynamic public/private partnership and is another demonstration of the Obama Administration's commitment to curb the emissions of greenhouse gases.

This was one of many stops on the first-ever USDA agricultural trade mission to Vietnam, which Scuse led in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City Sep. 25-20, Photo By Le Nguyen-Binh Under the Obama Administration, USDA has continued to expand markets for American goods abroad, worked aggressively to break down barriers to trade, and assisted U.S. businesses with the resources needed to reach consumers around the world. And by organizing and executing agricultural trade missions, USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) is helping U.S. businesses reach the 95-percent of consumers who live outside the United States. Over three years, more than 1,000 U.S. companies and organizations—about 70 percent of them small and medium sized businesses—participated in 87 USDA-endorsed trade shows in 20 countries. On-site sales totaled more than $350 million and 12-month projected sales reported by exhibitors were estimated more than $2.7 billion. The companies made over 42,000 business contacts and displayed nearly 20,000 new products in various markets on all continents.

Photo by Victor Malpica The goal of USDA trade missions is to provide U.S. agricultural businesses with firsthand market information, access to government decision makers and one-on-one meetings with business contacts, distributers and importers so they can position themselves to enter or expand their presence in foreign markets. Often, trade missions correlate with USDA-sponsored international food and trade shows, which was the case this past year during the trade missions to Peru, Indonesia and Vietnam. Trade shows give companies even more opportunities to make business contacts and share their products with potential buyers and consumers. A full range of agribusinesses participate in these missions, including large companies with production sites around the United States and the world, as well as small- and medium-sized businesses, some of which are are just beginning to export internationally. The companies who participated in trade missions represented a variety of products including feed, meat, dairy, poultry, wood and forestry, rice, grain, seafood, fruits and vegetables, consumer-ready products, agricultural equipment and more.

Photo By Rifky Suryadinata, U.S. Embassy, Jakarta The countries USDA selects as destinations for trade missions are usually booming or emerging markets where companies can expect to achieve export success. Indonesia, for example, is the United States’ largest agricultural market in Southeast Asia and Vietnam is the fastest-growing market in that region. USDA’s trade mission to Colombia and Panama came just weeks after congressional ratification of free trade agreements with these countries, which will stimulate and increase our bilateral trade immediately upon implementation. Beyond the benefits going to participating agribusinesses, trade missions allow the USDA representatives leading the missions to meet with government and agricultural officials, and to visit agricultural production sites, markets and retail establishments around the world. Acting Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services Michael Scuse, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam David Shear, and Consul General An Le of the U.S. Consulate in Ho Chi Minh City cut the ribbon to open the USDA-endorsed USA Pavilion at the Food and Hotel Vietnam trade show in Ho Chi Minh City on Sept. 28, .

A mission to China is scheduled to take place from March 23-28 in the cities of Chengdu and Shanghai. With this trade mission, participating companies will have access to what is now the United States’ largest market for agricultural products. Currently, the American brand of agriculture is surging in popularity worldwide. Farm exports in fiscal year reached a record high of $137.4 billion—exceeding past highs by $22.5 billion—and supported 1.15 million jobs here at home. The agricultural trade surplus stands at a record $42.7 billion. For more information, visit the USDA agricultural trade mission website.

"Communications Program Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), USDA in  Health and Safety  Jul 02,  Throwing a celebratory BBQ gathering this Fourth of July does not have to be stressful when it comes to the menu and food safety. As you prepare to welcome a large gathering of family and friends, keep these core food safety practices in mind:  Clean—Wash hands and surfaces often. Hands should be washed for 20 seconds with clean water and soap. If no running water is available, use hand sanitizer or moist towelettes that contain at least 60 percent alcohol.  Separate—Separate raw meats from other foods to avoid cross-contamination of harmful bacteria. Use separate cutting boards when preparing raw meat and poultry and other foods that are ready to eat, and use different utensils and platters when placing raw foods on the grill or smoker and taking cooked foods off.  Cook—Cook food to the safe minimum internal temperature as measured with a food thermometer. Burgers and other thin foods, such as sausages and boneless chicken thighs, should have the thermometer inserted through the side and into the center to get the most accurate thermometer reading.  Chill—Refrigerate food promptly within two hours (or one hour if the temperature is over 90 F). Keep hot foods hot above 140 F and cold foods cold below 40 F to avoid the Danger Zone. Hot foods like burgers, hot dogs, and chicken can be kept hot by placing them on a grill on low, in heated chafing dishes, or in a slow cooker, and cold foods like deviled eggs, salads, and guacamole can be nestled in a bed of ice. For more information about food safety, call the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline , email MPHotline@usda.gov, or chat live at ask.usda.gov from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday to reach a food safety specialist in English or Spanish.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Massachusetts in  Conservation  Oct 29,  Al Rose discusses his fourth-generation Red Apple “green” Farm with NRCS’ Soil Conservationist Dave Bacon. NOTE: This week on the USDA Blog, we'll feature the stories of America's Harvest Heroes who, like farmers across the nation, are working this harvest season to secure the bounty of healthy food American agriculture is renowned for. From laying the foundation for the next generation of farmers putting down roots in rural America, supporting the fruit and vegetable growers who are helping to build healthier communities, bolstering new markets for the products of agricultural innovation, to harvesting renewable energy that is made in Rural America, with USDA's support our farmers are yielding strong results for every American. For these reasons and more, America’s Harvest Heroes deserve our thanks. A towering, craggy McIntosh apple tree in the center of the orchard at Red Apple Farm in Phillipston, Massachusetts, has weathered 113 winters, borne many tons of crisp, tart apples and fed generations of customers. Planted in , it’s the oldest commercially planted McIntosh tree in New England and possibly the country. Thanks to care by generations of the Rose family, that ancient apple tree still produces fruit today. Al Rose and his wife Nancy, who operate the fourth-generation farm, have introduced an innovative, modern growing system just a stone’s throw from the century McIntosh. To ensure success in an area that sees its share of dry summers, the Roses sought the help of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). “It may be challenging, but I think we’ve got a natural environment that’s conducive to growing great apples,” said Al Rose. “We have cold nights for a good part of the growing season, which are great for the color of the apples. Fall without apples in New England just wouldn’t be the same.” A micro-irrigation system was installed to deliver water from the pond directly to the young trees. This type of watering system conserves more water than a conventional overhead sprinkler system. “We’re at one of the highest elevations for orchards in New England – 1,250 feet,” said Rose, standing in the orchard on a windy day. “We have a wind turbine that’s been cranking today. Between that and our solar panels, we’re a red farm and a ‘green’ farm.” Red Apple Farm is protected under the state Agricultural Preservation Restriction (APR) program.  Through a state grant program to help the viability of APR farms, Rose developed a business plan that called for planting an acre of trees in a new trellis system. “We’re not creating more land here; we have to be more productive on the land that we do have,” explained Rose. The “fruit wall” is small trees, shallow-rooted and spaced as close as a foot apart. “It’s the most productive way and, from a cost standpoint, it’s easier to maintain,” said Rose. “But, to do that, you have to have a pond in place.” So, Rose reached out to NRCS for help with irrigation. “I know they have the technical expertise to do it right and give us advice,” said Rose, who also got financial help through the federal Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) program. Dave Bacon, NRCS Soil Conservationist, has been assisting Red Apple Farm for more than a decade. He explained that, in Massachusetts, the AMA program is used for drought mitigation. “We didn’t want to have an acre’s worth of apple trees fail because there was no irrigation water available,” said Bacon. Al Rose stands near the McIntosh tree, planted in . Bacon explained that soil indicated that there was adequate ground water to create a pond, a more reliable water source than drilling a well. With well drilling, there is a risk that there won’t be enough water to meet the plants’ needs.  A micro-irrigation system was installed to deliver water from the pond directly to the young trees. This type of watering system conserves more water than a conventional overhead sprinkler system. “As we slowly change to the newer high production, higher density plantings, it’s going to make us a lot more successful for the current generation and future generations,” said Rose. “If you want to do something right, get the experts involved,” said Rose.  “NRCS has experts; they know how to do it and they know how to do it right. You’re going to get great advice and great people are there to support you.”  Category/Topic:  Conservation  Tags:  apple orchard  Conservation  harvest heroes  NRCS","What conservation practices did Al Rose, a fourth-generation farmer, implement on his Red Apple Farm in Massachusetts with the help of USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to ensure successful and sustainable apple production?","Al Rose implemented micro-irrigation systems, trellis systems for increased productivity, and solar panels to conserve water and reduce energy costs.

"USDA Economic Research Service in  Research and Science  Jun 10,  Book cover: ""Rural Wealth Creation"" edited by John Pender, Bruce A. Weber, Thomas G. Johnson, J. Matthew Fannin  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Economic Research Service (ERS) economists may not wear trench coats and fedoras, but we are investigating significant developments affecting rural America.  In a new book, Rural Wealth Creation, which I co-edited with Bruce Weber, Tom Johnson, and Matt Fannin, we examined the role of wealth, which includes physical, financial, human, natural, social and other forms of assets, in achieving sustainable rural prosperity. Strong communities depend upon strong local and regional economies, and prosperous local and regional economies depend on the creation, retention, and distribution of wealth, broadly defined. Wealth contributes to people’s well-being in many ways beyond increasing income. For example, many forms of wealth can provide resilience in tough economic times or enhance the ability of rural people to pursue innovative new opportunities. Rural communities across the United States lose wealth due to a variety of factors. For example, when people leave their communities to pursue opportunities in metropolitan regions, they take with them knowledge, skills, and labor resources that might have otherwise been reinvested in the rural setting. Research shows that creating and retaining wealth in rural areas is essential for achieving sustainable and broadly shared rural prosperity; one of USDA’s strategic goals. So how do communities retain and grow their wealth? We don’t have all the answers yet, but we are working towards solutions. Creating and maintaining a broad portfolio of wealth may be central to sustainable rural prosperity. Physical infrastructure, natural amenities, and human and social capital can attract people and businesses to rural areas. As reported in Amber Waves, communities are developing wealth creation plans to match their own needs and resource requirements. USDA administers wealth creation strategies such as providing small business loans and housing assistance and managing rural conservation programs to promote rural prosperity. Since wealth is an important gauge of rural economic well-being, understanding how wealth is changing and is distributed helps community leaders and federal policymakers manage and evaluate these programs and their alternatives. We still don’t fully understand how to achieve wealth creation or how to measure it in all rural contexts, but ERS researchers and their university-based colleagues are working to fill the information gaps. No wealth creation strategy will work in every situation. Rural regions and communities benefit from being able to identify strategies best suited to their own means and priorities. Rural Wealth Creation proposes a new framework for measuring wealth and for understanding and classifying different rural wealth creation strategies, the factors affecting them, and their implications. Rural Wealth Creation is an outgrowth of the National Conference on Rural Wealth Creation and Livelihoods, co-convened by ERS and the Ford Foundation, and supported financially by a grant from the National Institute for Food and Agriculture and by the Ford Foundation. The related ERS report, Rural Wealth Creation: Concepts, Strategies, and Measures, was released in March on the ERS website.

"Colorado USDA Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  Jan 29,  Colorado native and local business owner Bruce Longwell at his Durango, CO home on July 17, . Mr. Longwell financed the single-family house with a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development (RD) Housing Assistance loan. This provided lower monthly payments than his prior rental home. Homeownership provides potential gains through home equity. USDA photo by Lance Cheung. Homeownership became a reality twice for Bruce Longwell, thanks to USDA Rural Development.  Twice has Longwell been able to purchase a home through the USDA Direct Home Loan Program. Longwell, a local business owner, first bought a home through the former Farmers Home Administration in and then again in through its successor agency, USDA Rural Development.  The oddity in this process is that both homes were purchased with the assistance of the same realtor and both have the same floor plan. Longwell put in an offer on his home in Durango, Colorado and six weeks later moved in with his son on July 4th.  There is nothing more patriotic than homeownership and he is still busy putting on the finished look and adding his own touches to the three bedroom home.  The house is not only functional for Longwell but is utilitarian as it has a garage workshop. Longwell had previously rented for five years and is very content to be in his new home.  “I am working for myself in my own home and thank God every day to be able to do so,” said Longwell.  With his tropical fish business firmly established in the community for over 20 years, Longwell is not going anywhere.    The home is just the right size and manageable for him. He hopes to remain in this house for thirty years and is already trying to figure out how to pay the loan off early.

"in  Conservation  Rural  Jun 20,  From left: Farmers Steve Roth, Don Rief, Dale Rief, Clifford Dilts discuss topics covered during a town hall meeting with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack at the Glenwood Community High School in Glenwood, Iowa on Thursday, June 16, . Farmers, local and regional media listened and questioned Secretary Vilsack on the cause of the floodwaters along the Missouri River affecting Iowa and Nebraska. Secretary Vilsack offered advice and assistance available through the United States Department of Agriculture and other federal agencies. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack met face-to-face last week with about 40 farmers, ranchers and producers from Iowa and Nebraska impacted by flooding along the Missouri River.  The Secretary promised the group he would stay until every question had been answered and every concerned voiced – and he did just that, engaging in a dialogue that lasted more than two hours. The producers, who are watching floodwaters approach – and in some cases, inundate their fields – expressed concerns about USDA’s ability to help them weather the disaster. Vilsack promised USDA would do all it can. He pointed to the Farm Service Agency and its disaster assistance program that helps producers recover from production and physical losses due to natural disasters. The Secretary also highlighted federal crop insurance programs and their ability to reimburse producers for disaster-related losses. Asked by one farmer if he understood the broad implications of the flood, Vilsack responded by describing his experiences dealing with disasters as the governor of Iowa and his recent trips to tornado-stricken areas in the South and flood-ravaged areas in the Midwest. Moreover, at the direction of President Obama and Secretary Vilsack, USDA’s top officials have traveled to areas impacted by flooding, fires and tornadoes across the country. “America’s farmers and rural communities are vitally important to our nation’s economy and our values, and my heart goes out to all who are facing hardships because of severe weather and natural disasters,” said Vilsack. “I know this is a hard, frustrating time for folks, and I want all residents, farmers, ranchers and businesses to know that USDA will be working to make sure folks have food, shelter and necessary resources to recover from these challenges. We will continue to work with state and local officials, as well as our federal partners, to get you back on your feet.” Producers highlighted challenges with failing levees and the potential for flooded fields that could last all summer.  One Iowa farmer said there was a chance his fields may be unsuitable for planting until .  Vilsack stressed USDA’s readiness to assist and the role the federal government has already played in disaster recovery across the nation.  For instance, USDA has provided over $110 million in disaster-related food assistance to help more than 660,ates and 184 counties. To date, USDA has also provided 10 states a total of $9.6 million to restore land damaged by flooding. The Secretary also stressed his concern for the rural communities along the river and the economic impact of the flooding.  He reminded those in the room that USDA Rural Development has the ability through its Community Facilities program to assist in the construction or repair of a levee that serves to protect the general public. Vilsack also urged those in the room to be proactive. “This is the reality,” he said. “I don't think this is the last wet year we're going to have.

"Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 01,  The adult periodical cicada emerges from its 17-year nymph stage, molts and arises as a winged adult. This spring will see the return of the large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. (U.S. Forest Service photo/ Bob Rabaglia) The buzz this spring has started, and some people may think it’s fodder for a new sci-fi movie. But this year’s spring brings a drama closer to home than you think - the pending emergence of brood II of the periodical cicada. Cicadas are large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. As the male cicadas sing their intense mating songs, some brand it as the sound of summer. “Annual cicadas, known as dog-day cicadas in the U.S., are found throughout the world,” said Sandy Liebhold, a research entomologist with the U.S Forest Service’s Northern Research Station. “But the periodical cicadas emerge in massive groups known as “broods” once every 13 or 17 years and are completely unique to North America.” There are 15 brood cycles, each designated by roman numerals. In the U.S., brood II is on track to crawl out of the ground very soon after a 17-year hiatus. They’ll emerge into one of the most densely populated urban/suburban forests in the world. The mass emergence of brood II into the state and private forests of the tri-state area of eastern Connecticut, upstate New York, and northern New Jersey will sound a bit different than the familiar dog-day cicadas. Male cicadas use a special membrane to echo a series of clicks through its abdomen to attract females for reproduction. In chorus, the brood may sound like an insect-sized fleet of jets preparing for lift off, but the sound should be enjoyed as a wonderful spectacle of the mating ritual in the animal world. Once mated, females will lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind, known in the scientific world as oviposition injury, can be quite striking and lead to “flagging” -- the dieback of small limbs. Forest health aerial surveys conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation reported more than 8,700 acres with flagging left behind from the brood XIV emergence on Cape Cod in . The scarring is mostly superficial but can have a mild impact on the growth of individual host trees. However, the mass emergence can benefit the longer, overall health of eastern forests. After mating and laying eggs, adult cicadas die and fall to the forest floor. The nutrients released from the mass decay of the brood create a jolt of healthy nutrients available to forest organisms. Researchers have shown that this pulse of nutrition leads to an increase of beneficial microbes and nitrogen in soil, increased tree growth and more robust wildflowers. Finally, after three to four weeks, the eggs hatch, the larvae wander under the forest floor where they feed on roots and start the process over again. So, why every 13 to 17 years? Scientists have been pondering this ecological phenomenon for centuries. “There is no doubt that by simultaneously emerging at those long intervals, periodical cicadas are able to saturate predators thereby maintaining high population levels,” said Liebhold. Recent research also hypothesizes that periodical cicadas emerge when predator birds are at a lower density, suggesting that these amazing insects have queued into a larger ecological cycle – wow! This is what we know but there is still a lot of mystery surrounding these time-travelling bugs. So if you find yourself one of the lucky ones to experience their visit, just sit back and enjoy this remarkable wonder of eastern forests. Michael Bohne is an entomologist and forest health group leader with the U.S. Forest Service in Durham, N.H. After mating, female cicadas lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind can lead to the dieback of small limbs called flagging. Such was the case for these bur oak trees in central Iowa in after a brood emergence of the 17-year cicada.

"New Farmers and Ranchers: Ever Thought About Exporting?  The first step in running a successful farm or ranch business is identifying a product to create and connecting that product to potential customers.  For some new and beginning farmers, it can be a challenge to connect to the right market opportunities and to build a business that fits. At USDA, we are working to make sure that there is access to markets at all levels - so that whether a new or beginning farmer wants to sell locally, regionally, nationally, or globally, they have access to tools that support their business and business development.

"in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Apr 19,   As I talk to farmers across the country, regardless of what they produce or where, they all share one common challenge:  how to best move product from the farm to the marketplace.  This is especially crucial for small and midsize farmers who may not have enough capital to own their own trucks, their own refrigeration units, or their own warehouse space.  They might not have the resources to develop sophisticated distribution routes, build effective marketing campaigns or network with regional buyers and customers. Without infrastructure, logistical and marketing support, these producers might be growing the sweetest strawberries or raising the most tender beef, but they lack the infrastructure support to get their exceptional products to your table. That’s why I was delighted to be in Detroit at the Making Good Food Work conference with Senator Debbie Stabenow today announcing the USDA’s most recent findings about food hubs.  Food hubs are innovative business models emerging across the country specifically to provide infrastructure support to farmers. While food hubs are a nascent industry, and many operational food hubs are less than 5 years old, they are based on a time-proven business model of strategic partnerships with farmers, distributors, aggregators, buyers and others all along the supply chain.  The models rely on cooperation instead of competition, and ensure that the regional small and midsize producers get access to the infrastructure they need. An example of a food hub is Detroit’s own Eastern Market, which is buying directly from some of Michigan’s finest small and midsize producers and then distributing that same product across Detroit’s food deserts, into Detroit’s school and directly to consumers at one of the country’s oldest operating farmers markets. Cherry Capital Foods in Traverse City, Michigan is building sound distribution,  aggregation and marketing services for nearly 100 producers and is creating new jobs in Northwest Michigan.  Grasshopper Distribution, a farmer owned food hub, has been building a centralized distribution and aggregation service for Appalachian farmers to sell local products directly to consumers and also to regional groceries and other wholesale customers. Eastern Market, Cherry Capital Foods and Grasshopper Distribution are just three examples of nearly 100 operating food hubs in the country.  With the help of the Wallace Center at Winrock International, the National Association of Produce Market Managers, and Project for Public Spaces, the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Subcommittee on Food Hubs interviewed and analyzed nearly 70 of these innovative businesses. Our preliminary findings show that food hubs are creating economic opportunity and jobs in their communities, in addition to providing new market opportunities for producers.  There are significant clusters of food hubs in the Midwest and Northeast. The median number of small and midsize suppliers served by an individual food hub is 40, and over 40% of existing food hubs are specifically working in food deserts to increase access to fresh, healthful and local products. But here’s the most exciting part: nearly 40% of food hubs surveyed were started by entrepreneurial producers, non-profits, volunteer organizations, producer groups or other organizations looking to build a strong distribution and aggregation infrastructure for small and midsize producers.  This demonstrates that producers are helping producers. Processors are helping processors. Distributors are helping distributors, and so forth and so on. Moreover, while the USDA has been proud to offer support to nearly 30% of the nation’s operating food hubs, we are even more excited to find that food hubs are business aware and are trying hard to become economically self -sufficient and viable on their own. In short, food hubs are not a flash in the pan.  They are incredibly innovative business models specifically addressing some of our producers’ most overwhelming challenges.  This research is part of USDA’s commitment to understanding food hubs, how they serve communities and what we can do to help them succeed. When the Food Hub Collaboration completed this survey in March, we knew of over 70 food hubs. Since then, the number of identified food hubs has grown to easily over 100.

"Innovation in Conservation - A New Slate of NRCS Environmental Markets Projects  Environmental markets—the buying and selling of ecosystem services like clean air and water, and wildlife habitat—help more private landowners get conservation on the ground. Markets attract non-Federal funding to conservation, complement USDA’s work with agricultural producers, and can yield natural resource improvement at a lower cost to other approaches. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is a Federal leader in supporting the development of environmental markets, largely through its Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) program. Among CIG recipients are one of the earliest and most successful water quality trading programs in Ohio’s Great Miami River watershed and the Ohio River Basin water quality trading program, a recipient of the U.S. Water Prize this year.

"Crops Branch Chief, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Conservation  May 24,  Lance Honig, NASS' Crops Branch Chief, presenting monthly Crop Production report overview. Starting next week, the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) will reach out to tens of thousands of farmers across the United States. Our interviewers will go door to door and make phone calls to collect the most accurate information possible about farmland in each state. In addition, we’ll ask farmers to report their acres planted by crop, and total grains & oilseeds stored on their farms. We will then spend several weeks processing and analyzing the responses we receive so that we can publish some of the most anticipated by the end of the month. Let’s just say we keep things busy in June! Personally, I’ve gone through all aspects of NASS surveys. Growing up on our family farm in Kansas, I saw my father fill out surveys he received from USDA’s statistical agency. Later I joined NASS myself and got a chance to work with and survey farmers in Kansas, Indiana, and North Dakota. Over time, my career brought me to NASS’ Washington, D.C. office where I lead teams of statisticians who analyze survey and other information to publish official U.S. crop estimates. With this background, I understand how important accurate information is to many people in agriculture. And the best way to have good information is to get it directly from the source – farmers and ranchers. I saw my family make marketing decisions after looking at crop production numbers and reviewing local . Of course it wasn’t just my family. I have heard from many producers how help them make decisions on their farms. In fact, statistics have become a crucial tool in today’s agriculture. These days I don’t interact with individual farmers as much as I used to but I still see the impact of our , as I now get to talk to many ag industry groups whose representatives always point out their need for NASS . These groups rely on the numbers to demonstrate the need for policy changes and make sure that USDA and other decision-makers have an accurate picture of agriculture in every state. This year, I’ve been holding a monthly on Twitter (@usda_nass) as a newer way to answer questions following our key crop releases. It’s a great way for me to reconnect with farmers across the country, answer their questions, and witness firsthand that the interest in agricultural remains ever-strong among today’s farmers. I hope everyone contacts NASS for surveys to understand the impact their response can have on their industry both locally and nationally and takes the time to respond. I also encourage everyone to join me for our next on June 30 at 1 p.m. I’ll be online answering your questions about the highly-anticipated Acreage and Grain Stocks .

We capture for everything from cotton, fruits, vegetables and specialty crops, livestock, meats, poultry, eggs, grain and hay, to milk and dairy, and tobacco. At some point in our lives, we all wonder what it would be like if we didn’t exist.  How would things be different?  Last month, American farmers and businesses experienced what it was like to live without USDA Market News.  While the markets continued to operate, we received several phone calls and heard stories of how so many small and mid-sized producers struggled without the valuable information we provide. In the 100-year history of Market News, this was only the second time that the were not available.  The give farmers, producers and other agricultural businesses the information they need to evaluate market conditions, identify trends, make purchasing decisions, monitor price patterns, evaluate transportation equipment needs and accurately assess movement.  The information, gathered by the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and provided for free,  captures for everything from cotton, fruits, vegetables and specialty crops, livestock, meats, poultry, eggs, grain and hay, to milk and dairy, and tobacco.

But for those few weeks in October when the wasn’t available, producers – especially small farmers and ranchers – were left without a benchmark to accurately evaluate the market.  Their risk of over-paying or under-pricing their own goods increased dramatically. The loss of Market News also disrupted other agricultural stakeholders and businesses. Wholesalers and retailers appeared more cautious in making purchases, having to renegotiate contract terms without reliable about the direction of the markets. Commodity traders pulled money out of the market, slowed or halted trading, and adjusted settlement terms.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which makes calculations based on published Market News prices, temporarily suspended both its feeder cattle and lean hog indexes because the wasn’t available. Trade organizations could not provide members with economic analysis and forecasting services, and industry and market analysts found themselves without the basic needed to conduct their work.

"State and Private Forestry, US Forest Service in  Forestry  Aug 10,  Sandra Cummings. (Courtesy photo Sandra Cummings) Sandra Cummings is an African American woman who is a part owner of two forested landscapes in Georgia. Her first property, 325 acres of land with a home in the city of Madison, was passed down by her maternal great-grandmother, who was born a slave. The second property consists of 165 acres of land in the town of Portal, which was passed down by her paternal grandfather. To ensure that the family’s ancestral land remains intact, Mrs. Cummings and her family decided to put it into an irrevocable trust to prevent their children and grandchildren from dividing and selling it. “You see, they didn’t grow up in the dirt like we did,” she said. “We grew up working those farmlands, picking cotton, tobacco, planting watermelon. We were able to see the benefits of having this land. My children and grandchildren did not.” Mrs. Cummings wanted to encourage long-term stewardship of her land, and sought out resources to help achieve this goal. Amadou Diop, an Atlanta-based outreach liaison for the US Forest Service, helped Mrs. Cummings find information about forest management and stewardship plans. “If it wasn’t for Amadou’s wealth of knowledge, willingness to help people, and putting me in touch with the resources directly, I would have never been able to get any of this done,” said Mrs. Cummings. “He made sure that I was taken care of, and he deserves a lot of credit.” The Forest Service’s Forest Stewardship Program encourages long-term stewardship of important state and private forest landscapes by assisting landowners to more actively manage their forests and related resources. The Forest Service helped Mrs. Cummings through a forest management and stewardship plan created by the Georgia Forestry Commission, which laid out a 10-year plan for managing the land. Under the plan’s guidance, Mrs. Cummings now uses the land in Madison for timber management, grazing for cattle, and wildlife habitat. She manages the land in Portal for forestry, wildlife, silvopasture (with assistance from the NRCS), and a pine straw operation. As a result, she obtains additional earnings from her land by leasing it out for deer hunting and harvesting pine straw. She is enjoying the benefits of being a forest landowner. “One of the benefits for me is the extra income from the pine straw operation —extra income is always good, you know,” she said. “It also gives you some self-sufficiency,” she continued. “I will say this: if something were to happen in Atlanta—where we are living now, then we always have a place to go. If we needed to build another house or something….we can do it! So both lands give us some stability.” Mrs. Cummings intends for her family’s legacy to continue. She hopes to renovate her parents’ home into a historic site and to build a walking trail for guests, and she is exploring the potential for solar power generation on her property in Portal.

"USDA Food and Nutrition Service, Midwest Region in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Feb 08,  First graders at E. J. Brown Elementary School in Dayton, Ohio, eat cauliflower with lowfat ranch dip, as part of their school’s Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. According to school nurse Virginia Noe, the students “gobbled up” the cauliflower, with and without the dip. Recently, an interesting letter came across my desk. The letter was from an Ohio school nurse who wanted USDA to know that students at E. J. Brown Elementary School in Dayton, Ohio, LOVE their USDA-funded Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), now in its second year.  And that makes E.J. Brown’s school nurse Virginia Noe, who wrote the letter, a huge fan of the program and its many positive effects on student eating behavior, health and learning.  Noe shared her thoughts in the enthusiastic and heartfelt letter. “The positive response of our student body, staff and parents has been overwhelming. Many tasted pears, plums, jicama and spinach for the first time. Students learned that not all apples are red!” said Virginia. Besides expanding their healthy food options, the students researched where produce is grown and, with the help of school staff, started a school garden. As with some other urban districts, many E. J. Brown students have limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables. Thus, they highly value the program and are eager to see what produce is being served each day. Noe that students who were at first hesitant to try new varieties gradually became more adventuresome. And when their first year’s funding ended in March of last year, the students’ disappointment was “palpable.” One parent said, “I would rather they ran out of money for field trips than the fruits and vegetables,” adding, “No more canned pineapple for us because the fresh tastes so much better.” E.J. Brown is one of 20 schools in Dayton and 111 in the state of Ohio to receive a Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program grant this school year. Noe is grateful that the school received FFVP funding for a second year. She believes the FFVP is money well spent, as it positively affects the entire student body. “As our country struggles to fight childhood obesity, the impact of learning about and experiencing healthy snacks can be lifelong.” She notes that the FFVP is aligned with key national health and wellness initiatives, including Healthy People /, school wellness mandates, and the First Lady Michelle Obama’s Lets Move! initiative.

"Rural  Mar 29,   Tammye Treviño, USDA Rural Development Housing and Community Facilities Administrator sponsored Librarian Forum at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development headquarters in San Juan, Puerto Rico, earlier this month. Eighty nine librarians participated in the activity. Most of them work for the State & Municipal government, others for non-profit & faith based organizations. They all agreed that most of the libraries in Puerto Rico are in need of new equipments, books, and computers. In some cases the construction of a new library will be the best alternative. Ms. Treviño explained the Library Initiative Program has a $100 million budget for the nation. She urged the librarians to submit their proposal before June 30, . The reason is that if one state will not use the funds, other states could have access to them.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Apr 17,  A Conservation Innovation Grant recipient accepts award from the U.S. Water Alliance. Photo courtesy NRCS. When USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded a Conservation Innovation Grant to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in , the notion of administering the nation’s largest water quality trading program in the Ohio River Basin was a twinkle in the eye of EPRI scientist Jessica Fox. Fast forward to —the multi-state water-trading program is a reality, and the Institute was one of three entities to be awarded this year’s Water Prize by the U.S. Water Alliance. Through Conservation Innovation Grants, NRCS funds projects that develop innovative approaches and technologies for natural resource conservation on agricultural lands. These grants have funded more than 60 environmental markets projects, including a number of the nation’s leading market efforts. EPRI’s program, launched when the states of Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana signed a multi-state compact in , works with agricultural producers who voluntarily implement conservation practices that reduce nutrient runoff into local waters. Through the program’s first trades in March , three energy companies purchased these credits and retired them for associated nutrient and ecosystem benefits. On April 13, In front of a crowded auditorium at the National Geographic Society in Washington, DC, Former EPA Deputy Administrator Bob Perciasepe awarded the prize to Fox who accepted on behalf of EPRI. Perciasepe expressed admiration for EPRI’s ability to innovate and engage stakeholders from Duke Energy to the Ohio Farm Bureau, and everyone in between. In her award acceptance remarks, Fox noted that part of the project’s success is that EPRI was never satisfied with developing the nation’s largest water quality trading program, or executing the first trades. “We are always pushing and striving, looking forward to the next chapter.” The next chapter for the Institute begins on May 20 when it holds a public auction for nutrient credits in New York City. These credits were generated through the installation of cover crops, livestock fencing and other conservation practices on 30 farms last summer.

"Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 25,  Recent news articles have reported that a healthy diet is expensive if one were to consume the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables.  As the senior economist with the USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) with over 20 years of experience in the area of food economics developing food plans and market baskets, I agree.  Depending on the food choices, a healthy diet can be relatively expensive. However, there is a compelling fact that these news fail to highlight -- a healthy diet can be relatively inexpensive.  Now some readers of this blog may think that this is another case of economic double talk or spin, but healthy foods come in a variety of forms and a range of prices that likely fit just about anyone’s budget. To help consumers choose a diet that conforms to the Dietary for Americans, CNPP recently introduced a 7-day menu plan to help consumers improve their diet; you can find it at ChooseMyPlate.gov.  Averaged over a week, this menu provides food choices that meet the recommended amounts of key nutrients.  Based on national average food costs, adjusted to prices, the cost of this menu is less than the average amount spent for food, per person, for a 4-person family.  For example, the average food cost for a 2,000 calorie diet is $6.65 per person per day. According to a USDA study, the total costs for satisfying the USDA food pattern quantity and variety recommendations for fruits and vegetables in the Dietary vary from day-to-day, but average just under $2.00 per day or, approximately, 40 to 50 cents per cup-equivalent, using prices for commonly consumed fruits and vegetables. Many of the most commonly consumed fruits and vegetables - such as apples, bananas, navel oranges, fresh whole carrots, onions, and potatoes -- cost less than 40 cents per cup-equivalent.  A recent Produce Marketing Association report “The Cost of the Recommended Daily Servings of Fresh Produce” shows people can meet vegetable and fruit recommendations for about 50 cents per cup. The average price per cup-equivalent across all fresh produce is 42 cents for vegetables and 56 cents for fruits (based on -10 ).  Nationally, the average retail price for fresh vegetables and fruits recommended for a calorie diet is $2.18. In the total U.S., the least expensive fresh vegetables were potatoes, lettuce, eggplant, greens, summer squash, carrots, and tomatillos.  The least expensive fresh fruits were watermelon, bananas, apples, pears, pineapple, and peaches.  According to a USDA study, opting for frozen or canned vegetables and fruits may also lower costs. These studies show it is possible to eat a healthy low-cost diet or one that costs less than what people are presently spending.  In fact, some of the studies showing that a healthy diet is expensive, also admit in their discussion section that a healthy diet can be inexpensive, depending on the food choices a person makes. This is the key - choosing healthy, low-cost foods. For guidance, USDA has a website that helps people make these choices.  It’s called The Recipe Finder Database.  The site contains numerous recipes that are low cost and follow dietary recommendations.  Weekly household menus can be built from these recipes. In addition to selecting healthy, low-cost foods, I find that people need to build good shopping skills.  These skills include doing comparison pricing, using coupons,  buying fruits and vegetables in season, and storing produce bought in bulk in a way that preserves them safely for use over a longer period of time. Of course, the selection of healthy foods, whether they be the higher or lower cost options, depends on people having access to such foods.  This is an area of concern and one that USDA continues to address.   In addition, many people in the United States have no income or fall below the poverty threshold.  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly Food Stamps) provides these people with the means to choose low-cost healthy foods. To learn more about healthy eating, go to www.chooseMyPlate.gov.

Check out the NASS Vegetables Summary for the behind the California veggie tour. Get your foodie passport ready to tour scrumptious California veggie country! With over 970 thousand acres of harvested vegetables, melons, and strawberries, the just released USDA NASS Vegetables Summary places California at a whopping $7.85 billion in vegetable production – over half of the U.S. total of $13.8 billion. Where are all of these amazing crops grown? Let's take a trip through some of the most delicious and prosperous rural regions in the Golden State. Just as the treasured garlic clove rests behind pale, papery covers, the small farming community of Gilroy waits to be discovered off the 101 and 152 travel corridors. Gilroy is centrally located at the southern gateway to Silicon Valley, about 30 miles south of San Jose. California produced over $322 million worth of fresh market garlic. Wowzers! Gilroy may not be in the largest garlic-producing county, but its farmers might claim to be the proudest. Look closer to discover an amazing world-class garlic community touting the internationally renowned Gilroy Garlic Festival and continual celebration of all things ""garlicky."" The NASS Vegetables Summary positions California as a leading example of rural prosperity. The Golden State is the top producer of artichokes, head lettuce, leaf lettuce (yeah, it's different from head lettuce), romaine, broccoli, spinach and more. Weather, alternating between a moist marine layer from the nearby ocean and cool sunny days, provides the perfect climate to grow everyone's favorite smoothie superfoods in its verdant valleys. 'Lettuce' head over the 152 to Highway 101 for more tasty fun in Monterey County, an area often referred to as the “Salad Bowl of the World."" First stop is a Fibonacci favorite, the butter-loving artichoke (it grows according to the mathematical sequence discovered by – you guessed it – Fibonacci). Northern Monterey County features the U.S. artichoke capital in the prosperous rural town of Castroville. From bold artichoke sculptures to daring recipes, the annual Artichoke Festival celebrates California's official state vegetable. According to the Vegetables Summary, California is the sole U.S. producer of artichokes, with production valued at more than $65.5 million in . Monterey County boasts some of the most beautiful farmland east of Highway 1. Literary aficionados may know Salinas for the annual Steinbeck Festival (you may have heard of John, great American author and all that), but did you know the Salinas Valley is also recognized as one of the top leafy green producing areas in California? Some of your favorite green superfoods grew up the Salinas Valley of Monterey County. California produced over $850 million of the nation's $926 million broccoli crop and more than half, $242 million, of the nation's $401 million spinach crop. What a vegetable delight! Scrumptious strawberries make salads, cakes, and even the annual NASS Vegetables Summary more delicious. Take Highway rawberry Festival held in Oxnard. The festival celebrates the $3.1 billion California strawberry industry (out of the U.S. total of $3.5 billion). As you complete your culinary loop back north, consider a drive up Highway 5 or 99. This is the famous Central Valley, where California farmers work hard to feed the country and the world the best foods. If it's tomato harvesting season, don't be surprised to see a few tomatoes strewn along the roadside. Sometimes they fall out of the steady stream of overflowing trucks on their way to the processing plants. The Vegetables Summary suggests everyone loves tomatoes – it’s a billion-dollar crop for California and the United States. No matter which direction you drive in California, you will see a great variety of vegetable crops and a range growing conditions and seasons. You may see small organic farms supporting the burgeoning farm to fork movement. Down the road, you may come across larger farms that grow vegetables that end up on people's plates across America and the world.

"Inaugural US Forest Service International Seminar on Forest Landscape Restoration Held in Oregon  This blog post was co-authored with Aaron Reuben (International Union for Conservation of Nature) and Kathleen Buckingham (World Resources Institute). Four billion acres of degraded and deforested land world-wide—an area the size of South America—could benefit from restoration. Restoration addresses our most pressing global challenges—from protecting biodiversity to providing food, energy and water, to offering security and economic opportunity for millions of people. In the United States, a multitude of partners from all sectors, from the local to national level, initiated restoration on millions of acres of degraded land, but the United States cannot do it alone. Degradation is a global issue that requires a global response. This summer, landscape restoration professionals from 16 countries, representing government ministries, non-governmental organizations and private companies, gathered in Oregon to learn from the United States’ experience.

"Moths Aflutter in Honor of National Moth Week  Imagine wandering through your favorite botanic garden in the early evening and catching a glimpse of the moon reflected off of something lime green that moves from flower to flower while closer to the ground the yellow glow of fireflies help illuminate the night. It’s enough to make you feel like you’re in a Shakespearean forest. But the lime green is really the wings that belong to what some consider the most beautiful insect – the Luna moth. Those who do catch a glimpse of this unique moth are lucky – as they are rarely seen due to their short life span.

"National Director, USDA Farm to School Program in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Nov 19,  USDA Farm to School grants help get healthy, local foods into schools and teach children where their food comes from. (Photo Credit: Kelly Campbell) I just spent the morning calling people who had applied to receive a USDA Farm to School grant. They were fun calls to make as I was letting this year’s awardees know their project had been selected for funding. Today USDA announced awards for 71 projects spanning 42 states and the District of Columbia that support USDA’s efforts to connect school cafeterias with local farmers and ranchers through its Farm to School program. USDA Farm to School grants help schools respond to the growing demand for locally sourced foods and increase market opportunities for producers and food businesses, including food processors, manufacturers, and distributors. Grants will also be used to support agriculture and nutrition education efforts such as school gardens, field trips to local farms, and cooking classes. Selected projects will serve more than 13,000 schools and 2.8 million students, nearly 45 percent of whom live in rural communities. Projects are diverse: Sustain Floyd Foundation in Floyd, Virginia, will expand existing farm to school programs to all schools in Floyd County, and develop and implement promotional campaigns in support of farm to school initiatives while creating a model for rural communities that face particular challenges in food procurement and experiential food-based education. The project will also install a central food storage facility and hydroponic winter growing system. Alaska Gateway School District in Tok, Alaska, will enhance an existing greenhouse and garden project to increase on-site food production, as well as work with an agricultural consultant to maximize quality and quantity of food production during Alaska’s short growing season. FirstLine Schools Inc. with Edible Schoolyard New Orleans in New Orleans, Louisiana, will expand existing efforts to connect urban kindergarteners and their families to local food sources through healthy, locally procured cafeteria meals and hands-on gardening and cooking activities. The New York Botanical Garden in New York, New York, will integrate school gardening activities with hands-on workshops that are complemented by nutrition education, standards-based curricula, and farmer’s market exercises. The project will also offer professional development for teachers and workshops for parents and administrators. Center for Rural Affairs in Lyons, Nebraska, will train farmers and school food service personnel in farm product safety and usage, provide individual farm to school facilitation for ten pilot schools, and raise awareness of farm to school to lay the foundation for future expansion in Nebraska. For a complete list of FY14 Farm to School grant recipients, please see:  Without exception, people on the receiving end of my calls told me I’d made their day and thanked me profusely. USDA is very pleased to be supporting these projects. We know all the credit goes to the award recipients and we thank them for all the great work in improving the health and nutrition of the nation’s children. Editor’s Note: USDA recently released the results of the first-ever Farm to School Census, which showed that in school year -, school districts purchased and served over $350 million in local food, with more than half of participating schools planning to purchase more local foods in the future. School districts that missed the opportunity earlier in the year to respond can submit information regarding farm to school practices through November 30, .

"Senior Advisor to Secretary Vilsack for Tribal Relations in  Rural  Sep 18,   Last week it was my privilege to attend the annual United Tribes Tribal Leaders Summit and associated conferences in Bismarck, North Dakota. This annual gathering is an opportunity for tribal leaders from around the region to exchange information about current issues in Indian Country. While there, I discussed the importance of the recently-appointed Council for Native American Farming and Ranching.   The Council was selected by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to suggest changes to USDA regulations and to provide internal guidance or propose measures that would promote the participation of American Indian farmers and ranchers in USDA programs and support government-to-government relations between USDA and tribal governments. The Council is a discretionary advisory committee established in furtherance of Keepseagle v. Vilsack, which was a lawsuit alleging past discrimination by USDA against Native American farmers and ranchers in the way it operated its farm loan program. I also met with Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Charles Murphy and shared that USDA will fund a water quality project to rehabilitate and expand a failing sewage treatment system serving members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.

This project builds on the commitment of the Obama Administration and Secretary Tom Vilsack to improve the quality of services being provided to Native Americans and Alaska Natives. This project will greatly improve public health, and allow for future expansion of homes and businesses in the area. The Tribe will receive a grant which will be used to rehabilitate and expand an existing lagoon treatment system and construct a 24 acre wetland. The new system will meet Environmental Protection Agency standards and replace a deteriorating 40-year old lift station. The Tribe received design funds from USDA for the project in . While in Bismarck, I also toured the United Tribes Technical College, participated in the United Tribes International Powwow, and met with Tribal Leaders from the Great Plains region.

While in the region, I announced, on behalf of the Secretary, that USDA will fund a water quality project to bring water and sewer services to new homes being built on Minnesota’s Red Lake Reservation. Without this project, a number of residents of Red Lake would not have access to safe drinking water and reliable sewer services.  The Tribe will receive a grant and a 40-year loan to extend water and sewer service to 45 new homes being constructed near Red Lake. While in Minnesota, I also convened a White House Rural Council Roundtable on Native Food and Agriculture hosted by the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe.

"in  Conservation  Rural  Dec 28,   Over the course of , farm families and rural communities faced a number of challenges. A record drought impacted much of the country and many were impacted by a major hurricane, flooding and severe storms. However, thanks to the resilience of rural Americans, our communities are still going strong. Over the course of this year, USDA continued our record efforts to help folks across our nation, and I am proud of the work we carried out. We supported agriculture. This summer, USDA convened the White House Rural Council to help America’s farmers and ranchers overcome drought. We provided unique flexibility for crop insurance that saved producers more than $20 million, expanded emergency lending for producers, opened more than 2.8 million acres of conservation land for emergency forage and more. We promoted exports, with agricultural exports hitting a near-record level this year, and staying on track to set a new record in . New, fully implemented trade agreements promise more than $2 billion in additional agricultural trade every year, and over the course of we broke down even more unfair trade barriers to U.S. products. We supported conservation efforts. In America’s National Forests, we adopted a modern planning rule that will conserve the forest while creating more jobs. We protected more communities, clearing more than 4 million additional acres of flammable brush from forests. We continued our work with more than half a million private landowners to conserve America’s soil and water. We built up communities. USDA provided an additional 10,000 loans and grants for rural businesses.  We helped 150,000 more families achieve the dream of homeownership and carried out more than 1,500 new community facility projects. Meanwhile we expanded our efforts to improve rural infrastructure, with 10,000 new miles of electric line and more than 1,500 water improvement projects. We ensured a safe food supply, and nutritious food for Americans. USDA took historic action this year to further inspect ground and raw beef products, and tighten standards for poultry. We continued our efforts to help one in four Americans put food on the table, while maintaining the integrity of food assistance programs. And we helped provide emergency food assistance for Hurricane Sandy victims – just one of more than 100 disasters for which we have provided this assistance since . I’m proud of these efforts. From supporting farmers to furthering business, our wide range of accomplishments stand as proof that USDA touches the lives of every American, every day.  Since , we’ve achieved record results in almost every part of what we do – and I look forward to accomplishing even more in the year to come.

"and Shahla Shapouri, Economists, Food Security and Development Branch, Economic Research Service in  USDA Results  Health and Safety  Aug 02,  Woman farmers in Kenya, a country where food security is projected to improve over the next decade Photo: World Food Programme The Economic Research Service (ERS) has, since the late s, reported annually on food security in a number of developing countries. A key indicator is the number of food-insecure people (those who each consume less than a nutritional target of 2,100 calories per day). In the latest report, we estimate food security in 76 countries, in four regions. For , we estimate the situation overall to improve slightly, with the number of food-insecure people declining to 802 million people, from 814 million in .  The decade ahead presents a different picture, with food-insecure numbers rising by 37 million, although this 4.6 percent increase is below the 16.7-percent rise in population. The key factors we measure in determining the level of food security are countries’ domestic food production and their import capacity. In the Asian and Sub-Saharan African regions studied, domestic food production generally plays the most critical role in food security, so increasing output of staple crops will be crucial in improving food security. The countries studied in Latin America and North Africa import a large share of their food supplies, so the capacity to pay for imports is more significant. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the region where food insecurity is generally more concentrated, the number of food-insecure people is estimated to decline by 4.3 percent between and .  That slight improvement can be almost entirely attributed to higher expected food production levels. But over the next decade a sizable increase in food insecure people – 15 percent - is projected for the region. The bright spot for the decade is that the share of the population that is food insecure in sub-Saharan Africa is projected to fall from about 42 percent in to 38 percent in . Conditions vary within regions, and even within Sub-Saharan Africa, the food security situation is expected to improve for some countries. Among the factors in raising food production levels are a country’s ability to make needed investments in new technologies, and farmers’ skills and willingness to adopt the provided technologies. Our latest International Food Security Assessment contains on another key indicator of food security: the distribution gap, or the quantity of food needed for each income decile within a country to reach the nutrition target of about 2,100 calories per day. Overall, the distribution gap is projected to hold constant over the next decade. Our report also points out differences among and within regions.

"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way from the Summit: How REE is Using New Strategies to Reach Even Newer Poultry Handlers  During a walk along tree-shading sidewalks in the “burbs”; you’re accustomed to seeing games of hopscotch, bike rides, and maybe even the occasional Golden Retriever. However, one residential backyard, nearly 6 miles from downtown Atlanta, calls into question whether this is suburbia at all. There were swings, a tree house, and even patio furniture. Yet one feature certified this was not your mother’s suburban home: over a dozen chickens living comfortably in a custom made “Coop de Ville.”    The rise of “backyard poultry” is one of many agricultural phenomena tied to a growing food consciousness and increased urbanization. And while USDA’s fundamental job doesn’t change, the Department does because the challenges do.  The recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at increasingly popular backyard chicken coops underscore this. While this concern was not clearly expressed in the Act of Congress that created the Department, the mandate was. USDA still works to “acquire and to diffuse…information” towards facilitating the protected growth of American agriculture. That service is what brought Research, Education, and Economics Undersecretary Dr. Catherine Woteki to this residence in Decatur, GA. Accompanied by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service officials and a man known best as the “Chicken Whisperer,” Dr. Woteki toured the site and helped to shed light on current HPAI research and important biosafety measures.

"Supporting Regional Economic Development Strategies in Oklahoma's Tribal Communities  Rural Oklahoma is home to many important tribal communities.  Among these, the Choctaw Nation spans over ten counties in southeastern Oklahoma, while the Cherokee Nation runs along the state’s northeast border, and Muscogee (Creek) Nation lies farther west. These communities play a critical role in developing businesses, affordable housing, and infrastructure like water, roads, and telecommunications. However, these areas endure chronic poverty, limited opportunities and countless other economic challenges.  For instance, most of the 1,100 residents of Boley, Oklahoma – located in the heart of Creek nation – live on less than 25 dollars per day.

"New Land Ownership Add Value to Many Policy and Research Questions  Whether they farm the land themselves or rent it out to others to farm, those who own agricultural land are taking measures to keep the land in their families. This is good news for those who worry about the United States losing agricultural land to competing pressures. At USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, we just released the findings from a survey of agricultural landowners conducted earlier this year. It confirmed some things we know already and generated lots of new information that farmers, policymakers, businesses and others will use to understand more about who owns farmland, who has and will have access to farmland in the future, what kinds of conservation and production decision landowners are making, and lots more.

USDA photo by Dawn Bonsell USDA Rural Development Deputy Under Secretary Doug O’Brien recently spent a few days in Pennsylvania talking with flourishing businesses in charming trail towns along the Great Allegheny Passage (GAP), a rail trail that runs from Pittsburgh to Washington D.C. Many businesses along the trail have received funding through The Progress Fund, a non-profit community development lender.  The Progress Fund is the recipient of several Rural Development Business Program loans and grants which were passed on to the trail town businesses to help spur economic development in distressed rural areas. The trail affects the local economy in many ways, including an increase in property values, jobs, investment and general consumer spending. According to the Great Allegheny Passage Economic Impact Study, approximately 800,000 trips are taken on the GAP annually, 76 new trail-related businesses have opened and over 93 new jobs were created. In addition to the economic impact, trail towns are vibrant places where people come together. Some travelers pass through on short day trips and others are on multi-day trips, including a bicyclist from Vancouver who shouted, “Hello” to O’Brien as he headed South on the GAP toward Maryland.  A cycle shop in Confluence proudly displays the hometowns of cyclists who stop while travelling through the small town. For several years, a U. S. map display worked, but now the shop uses a globe adorned with thumb tacks representing world-wide visitors.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Nov 27,  Navajo Tech Veterinary Technology Program uses NIFA grant to teach students animal care. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research profile. USDA honors the achievements of American Indians during Native American Heritage Month and year-round.  With educational funding and support from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), Navajo Technical College in Crownpoint, N.M., is one of the many tribal colleges and land-grant institutions doing considerable work in the scientific fields. When veterinarian Germaine Daye became a professor at Navajo Tech in , the teaching veterinary clinic had been closed for a long time. Recognizing its importance to farmers and ranchers in Navajo Nation, Daye re-opened the clinic’s doors to 50 Navajo Tech students majoring in animal science. Last year, six Navajo Tech Veterinary Technology Program students passed their internship training last year, gaining invaluable veterinary technician experience in three clinics throughout the Navajo Nation.   So far, the program has graduated 10 students, some of whom are pursuing college programs that will lead them to vet school, and sparked the interests of 16 excited, new students enrolling this year. The reservation has a  shortage of veterinarians, the clinic’s small animal care supports many people bringing sick animals and also offers ranch calls to ranchers in need.  Daye plans to keep the momentum going by starting a high school animal science program in the future so more American Indian youth can begin a career of caring for animals. The Navajo Tech Veterinary Technology Program is supported in part through NIFA’s Tribal College Equity Grant program. “The Equity grant allowed us to purchase small animal scales, radiology equipment, and materials for comparative anatomy and physiology courses for student use and instruction,” she said. “We also purchased ultrasound and anesthesia equipment and our student are learning to use them in our working teaching hospital. In addition, we purchased patient warmers for the animals that come to us for care.” The Equity Grant program provides the Tribal Colleges with funding to provide students with quality education in the food and agriculture sciences. The nation’s 32 tribal colleges take pride in the hands-on learning they provide students through this grant and Navajo Tech is no exception. You can see a video of the students on an actual farm on NIFA’s website. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education and Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .15  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  WASHINGTON, Sept. 11, — Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced the release of a new report that shows that USDA's Farm to School Grant Program, established and funded through the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, has helped 12,300 schools improve nutritious meal options made with local ingredients for 6.9 million students, while expanding market opportunities for family farmers and ranchers in their communities. Recent studies published in Childhood Obesity and Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior indicate that strong farm to school programs can impact consumption of fruits and vegetables, leading to reductions in plate waste.""Farm to school partnerships have a proven track record of encouraging kids to eat more healthy foods and creating new market opportunities for the farmers that grow them,"" said Vilsack. ""Congress should act quickly to reauthorize the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act to build on the success of farm to school and the healthier school meals and continue our momentum towards a healthier next generation of Americans.""Through its Farm to School Grant Program, USDA has awarded ates, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands over the past three years. Fifty percent of funded projects included expanding healthy menu options offered in the cafeteria; 46 percent included training for food service staff about menu planning, meal preparation, and cooking with local and regional foods; and 65 percent included nutrition education activities. Forty percent of farm to school grants were awarded to rural schools or districts, and rikeForce states and territories to address challenges associated with rural poverty.Nationwide, more than 40,300 schools have farm to school programs that impact 23.5 million children. According to USDA's first-ever Farm to School Census, released in , school districts participating in farm to school programs purchased and served over $385 million in local food in school year -, with more than half of participating schools planning to increase their purchases of local food in the future. Later this fall, USDA will release updated Farm to School Census .Under the new standards, children are now eating healthier meals at schools. Farm to school programs are one of many tools and resources USDA offers to help schools successfully serve healthier meals. For example, USDA recently launched an initiative called Team Up for School Nutrition Success that allows the schools that still face challenges to pair up and learn best practices from schools that are already successfully serving healthier meals. The program has provided training for more than 3,500 individuals and has been enthusiastically received by schools and school officials.For the past three years, kids have eaten healthier breakfasts, lunches and snacks at school thanks to the bipartisan Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, which made the first meaningful improvements to the nutrition of foods and beverages served in cafeterias and sold in vending machines at schools in 30 years. Over 95 percent of schools report that they are successfully meeting the updated nutrition standards, and a recent poll shows that more than eight in ten Americans support the healthier school meals.Factsheet: Schools Serving, Kids Eating Healthier School Meals Thanks to Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

But the reality is there is still a big discrepancy in quality of life between the elite and the majority of students I serve as food services director at Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), the second largest school district in the country. Of the 650,000 students we serve daily, 80 percent qualifies for free and reduced meals, which means the students and their families live in circumstances of poverty.  In addition, 14,000 of our students are certified homeless with no fixed address. The problem for many of these children is that the meal in school is often times the only source of nutrition available.  Many of them live in food deserts where the corner liquor store or the nearby fast food restaurant is the only place to purchase food. The need to change the way students eat in Los Angeles was driven home due to alarming obesity rates from -. There was almost a vertical incline in the rates of morbidly obese children. As a result, our Former Board President Marlene Canter appeared in the Morgan Spurlock movie “Supersize Me,” sharing that we should be teaching children lifelong healthy learning habits and not feeding them “carnival food” like nachos and corndogs on a stick, consequently making them addicted to cheap, processed foods. In , the LAUSD Board of Education made a bold move by restricting access to carbonated beverages to students.  In , the choices of snacks in schools were changed to healthier products and in came the “Cafeteria Reform” motion and “Obesity Prevention” motion, which restricted meal offerings.  Restrictions included no additives or preservatives, no artificial dyes and a focus on serving more fresh fruits and vegetables. In , the LAUSD Board of Education unanimously passed the “Improving Food and Nutrition Policy” and the “Good Food Procurement Resolution” led by Board Members Steven Zimmer, Monica Garcia and Nury Martinez.  These policies included local sourcing, animal welfare, farm and industry workers rights, as well as the elimination of any added sugars to any food service item by .

"Rural  Apr 15,   - Public Information Coordinator, USDA Rural Development Although Earth Day won’t be celebrated until April 22nd, the dedication and blessing of the Eastern Navajo Waterline at Counselor, New Mexico on Monday epitomized the very essence of what former Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson envisioned 40 years ago when he established the first celebration of Earth Day. The new water line will serve 10,000 members of the Navajo Nation with another 10,000 to be served within the next decade.  Currently, 4,500 residents that will be served by the waterline drive up to 100 miles round trip to haul water for their home use and to provide water for their livestock. The Navajo Chapters of Huerfano, Nageezi, Burnam, Counselor, Ojo Encino, Torreon, Pueblo Pintado and Whitehorse Lake are in the midst of a major water crisis. The residents of these communities do not have a sustainable long-term water supply and the aquifer in this harshly arid region is pumped much more quickly than it can be recharged by rainfall. USDA Rural Development, the State of New Mexico, the Navajo Nation, the Indian Health Services and these eight Navajo Chapters to be served by the waterline, partnered to fund the $28.6 million to construct the water supply system. Rural Development provided $8.7 million in Tribal Set-Aside Water and Environmental Program funds for the project.  When completed in two years, the water line will stretch 70 miles across four counties to provide clean, healthy water to those living in this remote area of New Mexico. During the dedication ceremony, Earl Herrera the Hataalii (medicine man) asked the officials from each of the agencies, including RD State Director Terry Brunner, to participate in the traditional blessing of the water system.  Each sprinkled corn pollen on themselves and the earth to give thanks for the construction of the water system. A weaver from the Pueblo Pintado Navajo Chapter created a USDA rug commemorating the ceremonies that said “Ahehee” or “Thank you” in Navajo. A Navajo rug was presented to State Director Terry Brunner during the dedication and blessing of the Eastern Navajo Waterline ceremonies. The rug was crafted by a local artesian. The word “Ahehee” means ““Thank you” in Navajo.

"Nutritionist, Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 06,  Dave’s Herb-Stuﬀed Mushrooms The MyPlate Team offers the final “Makeover Monday” recipe this week on the USDA blog and the MyPlate Facebook page. I love mushrooms and could probably eat them every day. They come in a variety of sizes, shapes, , textures, and flavors and can be worked into every meal. On their own, mushrooms are pretty healthful – very low in calories, free of cholesterol and (almost) free of fat. They are also naturally low in sodium, high in potassium, and are generally high in vitamins and minerals. Stuffing mushrooms just makes something wonderful ever better!  But what you stuff in these tasty little vegetables can make or break the dish. Typically, mushrooms are stuffed with foods containing saturated fats and sodium. So, if you’re trying to watch one or both of these in the New Year, consider various herbs and spices! Herbs and spices do a nice job of seasoning many of my favorite foods. When I decided long ago to reduce my intake of saturated fats, I knew that my taste buds would miss the flavors of these fats and the foods that contain them, but I didn’t want to settle for a bland diet. So, I invested in several healthy cookbooks and read (and reread) the chapters on herbs and spices. The results have been quite impressive. They say that “variety is the spice of life,” but I like to think that “spices add variety to life.” Along with the spices came exciting and unlimited flavor combinations. Now, I choose whatever suits my mood. (Is there anything more inviting than a kitchen that smells of sautéed fresh rosemary?) Start adding more flavor to your plate in and you’ll see what I mean.

This competition empowers students to have a voice about school meals and nutrition. On top of that, it’s a lot of fun for everyone involved! The day of the competition I prepared by reviewing the rules, reading meal requirements, and skipping lunch. When I arrived at the event, I was impressed to see how many fellow judges there were and the wide range of food experts sitting around me. The competition got started and teams from fourteen schools started presenting their meals to us. The students brought in three or four cafeteria trays and gave each judge a sample. Judging was based on visual appearance, taste, presentation, and originality. Some students set themselves apart by being very well-polished when explaining the dishes, or by adding some creativity with music and costumes that reflected the meal’s ethic background. The competition was really tough, and ranking thee dishes was no easy task. Every meal had something that stood out, and often I found myself saying “I would order this at a restaurant!” Each dish was so delicious that by the end I could not eat one more bite!

"in  Conservation  Aug 16,  Dr. Shirley Heymon-Parker and Dr. Ralph Nobel at at the North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University in Greensboro, NC Throughout the country, many schools and communities are teaching the importance of environmental stewardship, energy conservation, and reducing waste through innovation and creativity.  I came across one of these places recently at North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University in Greensboro, NC, the nation’s largest Historically Black College. Their School of Agriculture and Environmental Science has embraced the Obama Administration’s commitment to protecting the air we breathe, water quality, and land that supports and sustains us. The President has taken unprecedented action to build the foundation for a clean energy economy, tackle the issue of climate change, and protect our environment.  He stated that “As we recover from this recession, the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of jobs - but only if we accelerate that transition. Only if we seize the moment."" As the Risk Management Agency’s Associate Administrator, representing USDA, I recently carried the message to A&T that we recognize and applaud the innovation and technology used on their research farm to safely and responsibly develop biofuels from animal waste solids, and for using that fuel to power vehicles used on the farm.  On the university farm biofuels are used extensively as replacements or additives for gasoline or diesel, and the educational value it provides is proving to be beneficial to producers and end users alike, thus strengthening small farm communities. As hog operations in North Carolina increase in size, so does the amount of waste and the need for innovative strategies for its disposal and treatment, particularly as water quality regulations improve. Additionally, with the state’s growing population, more people are living near swine operations which increases the level of concern about environmental issues like water pollution and odor. In step with the Chancellor’s vision for an institution that is ‘outwardly engaged,” the university farm uses “constructed wetland cells” containing plant life such as cattails and bulrushes to remove nitrogen, phosphorus and ammonium from swine wastewater, while water in the cells coverts nitrogen to nitrogen gas which is released harmlessly into the air.  Before reaching the wetland cells, swine wastewater flows through two anaerobic lagoons.  After treatment in the cells, wastewater is held in storage prior to land application.  The water is then filtered to the point that it can be used for land application or for washing down swine parlors, the effluent can be applied back onto the fields, and the solids used for Biofuels, essentially completing the renewable cycle. Wetlands remove excess nitrogen and other waste from the water through filtration, plant uptake, sedimentation and other biological processes.  With soil and plant resources occurring naturally in the wetland environment, wetlands provide a natural buffer between waste and the valuable resource of clean water. I was very impressed with the accomplishments at North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University in Greensboro, NC and applaud their efforts. With the considerable environmental challenges our country faces, it is encouraging to meet a talented group of people committed to doing something about it.

"Risk Management Tools Help Farmers Create a More Environmentally Sustainable Future  American producers know that crop insurance is a proven tool for managing the risks of farming.  But many folks may not be aware that it also promotes sound practices that encourage environmental sustainability. One of the primary reasons the Federal crop insurance program is good for conservation is that it requires producers to exercise good farming practices in order to be eligible for coverage.  Good farming practices vary from crop to crop and from region to region, but follow the principle that the farming practices carried out are considered prudent and responsible by local extension agents and certified crop consultants. And this means planning for the long-term future, not just the current crop year.  Brandon C.

"U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 25,  The air is clean above and the water is clear below in the Allegheny National Forest’s Allegheny Reservoir in Pennsylvania. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service Something we do every day for survival is something we often take for granted – breathing.  And a very important component of breathing is clean air. Air quality has a direct effect not only on the health of people, but also ecosystems. The Air Program in the Eastern and Southern regions of the U.S. Forest Service oversees a resource that affects and integrates with other resources, from smoke management to watersheds and wilderness to recreation and vegetation. Air Program staff work with federal, state, local, tribal, and non-government agencies to improve air quality and by extension, ecosystem health. The ways they accomplish this include: smoke monitoring; providing input in developing and maintaining state smoke management programs; providing input and analysis to projects with activities that could affect air quality; air quality monitoring; and ensuring that forest management plans include activities to meet national standards set by the Clean Air Act. And, we are seeing results. In the midst of news about worsening environmental degradation due to climate change, air quality in the Eastern and Southern regions is improving. compiled by the Air Program from to shows that rain became less acidic, wilderness views became clearer, and tropospheric ozone levels dropped on our national forests. That means residents from Minnesota to Missouri to New Hampshire in the East, and from Virginia to Florida to Puerto Rico in the South are breathing easier and enjoying more scenic views. These findings are attributed to decades of work by the Forest Service and partners from state and federal air regulatory agencies. It’s hoped that additional positive findings will stem from this, such as improvements in soil productivity and health of aquatic organisms. Environmental scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have already collected showing improvements in acid neutralizing capacity in some Adirondack and Catskill streams and lakes, a key environmental indicator of aquatic health. We expect similar findings will soon be discovered in streams in the Eastern Region. We can all celebrate by looking for opportunities to contribute to clean air in our communities.

"New Web Application Helps Families Find Summer Meals in Their Communities  USDA’s Summer Food Service Program, a federally-funded, state-administered program, last year served more than 187 million meals to children in low-income areas to ensure that they continued to receive proper nutrition throughout the summer when schools were closed. But that number represents just a small fraction of the children who are eligible to receive summer meals. Many families may not have taken advantage of the program because they didn’t know where meals were served near them.

"Assistant to the State Director and Public Information Coordinator Rural Development, USDA in  Rural  Oct 21,  Under Secretary Tonsager and Worton farmer Frank Dill inspect a field of soybeans grown with the assistance of the County's spray irrigation system. Earlier this fall, USDA Rural Development Under Secretary Dallas Tonsager traveled to Delaware and Maryland to tour two USDA funded wastewater system projects located in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. The first stop on the tour was to Laurel, Delaware where the Mayor outlined the desperate need for the extension of wastewater to the businesses located on the U.S. 13 artery.  The businesses have marginal at best onsite wastewater systems.  The water and sewer expansion project will lay the groundwork for the town’s recovery.   Many businesses have been waiting for a long time for the wastewater infrastructure in hopes of expanding their stores.  The expansion project is currently in design stage and will remove an estimated 52,300 gallons of nutrients per day from the watershed.  The project is not only good for the Bay; it will be a shot in the arm for the local economy. The next stop on the tour was to Frank Dill’s farm in Worton, Maryland.  The Dill family stepped up to help their local community with a solution for the disposal of treated effluent (wastewater).   Worton, Maryland is an unincorporated community governed by the Kent County Commissioners. Because of more stringent environmental regulations the County was able to work with the Dill family to apply treated effluent to the grain crops grown on their fields through spray irrigation.  Under the new environmental regulations, single point discharge of treated effluent is allowed in a tributary from November 1 – April 30.  And, the new call for land application of treated effluent from May 1 – October 31; however, weather permitting – spray irrigation may occur all year.   Between 50% and 100% of effluent is removed from the Chesapeake watershed.  This is a win-win for all involved.  There is no charge to the County for the land to apply the wastewater, the farmer has a source of water for his crops during a drought, and the project is good for the environment.

An intensive two day public meeting wrapped up earlier this week in Washington, D.C., as the recently appointed members of the Council for Native American Farming and Ranching met face-to-face for the first time. The Council, appointed by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack as part of the Keepseagle settlement, is charged with making recommendations to improve access by Tribes to USDA programs and services. On the first day, members received extensive briefings from 17 agencies in the 7 USDA mission areas.  On the second day, officers were elected, protocol issues were handled and the Council took two hours of public testimony. Major topics included:  Access to credit by Native farmers and ranchers; how to support Native youth who desire a future in farming and ranching, food and agriculture; subsistence concerns among Alaskan Native communities; special challenges for small farm owners and operators in Indian Country; the need for agricultural infrastructure, such as efficient irrigation systems and business incubation; education and extension needs; and agency-specific issues, such as finding ways for Native livestock producers to build out slaughter capacity and boost economic development and job creation in their communities. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Deputy Under Secretary Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) Arthur “Butch” Blazer speaks at the conclusion of the first business meeting of USDA’s Council for Native American Farming and Ranching (CNAFR) held at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Aug. 15, .

"State Executive Director, Hawaii State & Pacific Basin, Farm Service Agency in  Energy  Aug 15,  Diane Ley, State Executive Director, Hawaii Farm Service Agency, prepares to depart Hickam Air Force Base for the Great Green Fleet demonstration. USDA Photo.  WOW! The word “wow” only moderately conveys the historic events that unfolded this summer during the Department of Navy’s Rim of the Pacific Exercises (RIMPAC) Great Green Fleet (GGF) demonstration. The might and power of the United States Navy coupled with that of scores of other Pacific Rim counties was impressive, but moreover a number of the great ships and aircraft were fueled by a mix of algae and animal fats. Yes, advanced biofuels produced from American grown algae and waste animal fats powering the all-powerful military platforms! The man with the vision behind this innovation, Secretary of Navy Ray Mabus, would proudly note the Navy’s continuing global leadership as an innovator – having led maritime vessels from sails to coal-fired steam, from coal to oil and nuclear; and now the transition to advanced biofuels. Tom Vilsack, Secretary of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) would later expounded upon that message of innovation, “We can, as a nation, change the fuel production and distribution paradigm in the world, if we are consistent in our efforts to increase our production and use of domestic biofuels which are important to our energy and national security as well as create jobs.” For nearly four years, Secretaries Mabus and Vilsack have made a coordinated and concerted effort to support the development and stand-up of a domestic biofuels sector. The USDA has lent support to furthering research and business start-ups for biomass production and waste stream diversion, and the Navy has sought to test, demonstrate and accelerate investments in advanced biofuels for use in its many platforms. Both secretaries have identified the importance of establishing geographically diverse supply sources of biomass and biofuels and noted that the State of Hawaii has a strategic role to play; hence, the RIMPAC exercises off-shore from Honolulu Hawaii was a perfect match to demonstrate the capacity advanced biofuels in the GGF. On the designated day for the GGF demonstration, I represented the USDA and traveled with navy and congressional staff and representatives of the several airlines; assembling before daybreak for briefings and preparations for transport on a propeller-driven aircraft out to the USS Nimitz, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. We donned military issue life jackets, goggles and cranial helmets with ear muffs; yet, the ear protection only afforded limited attenuation of the excessive noise throughout much of the day. We headed out onto tarmac of Hickam Air Force Base and took seats facing the back of the no-frills plane. Squinting to see in the suddenly dark space as the back hatch closed, a mixture of 50 percent biofuels and fossil fuels raced through the aircraft’s engines, and the roar became deafening. The engines, gorged with the algae and animal fat mix; and the plane roared down the runway and into the sky. Traveling 45 miles due north of Honolulu, through the aircraft’s single viewing pane, naval vessels could be seen dotting the sea and the horizon. Cruisers, destroyers and then the USS Nimitz came into view. Ships and planes off the coast of Hawaii, participating in the Great Green Fleet demonstration. After we landed on the Nimitz and scrambled out of the aircraft, we were hit by the full might of steel upon the sea – the carrier’s deck 1,100 feet in length and 250 feet wide with a 10-story high bridge for observation and traffic control. Jets everywhere, attended to by squadrons of seamen grabbed in Navy Working Uniforms, colored light-weight turtle necks defining each squad’s role in the GGF demonstration. Keeping to an aggressive schedule, we viewed various operations including radar and navigation rooms; a tactical operation room for RIMPAC led this year by the Chilean Navy; and anchors the size of an office. Secretary Mabus heralded the multi-day GGF demonstration, which was supported with the purchase of 450,000 gallons of non-food waste (used cooking oil) from Louisiana-based Dynamic Fuels LLC, included algae produced by Solazyme. Meeting the Navy’s criteria, the fuel was: 1) “drop-in” and compatible with existing technology; 2) derived from non-food sources; and 3) its combustion would not increase the carbon footprint. Back at the Flag Deck, the GGF demonstrations ramped up with a dozen jets in high idle, rocking and trembling with a deafening roar of engines each waiting to be catapulted from the deck of the USS Nimitz. Once air-born, the 50/50 biofuel blend kicked in and the jets soared and flashed by the carrier at great speed and in tight formation. Flying the world’s most advanced aircraft with precise precision, the pilots accomplished mid-air refueling and touch and go maneuvers. The crew on deck and the spectators were enveloped fumes from fuel, oils and metallic dust; combined with heat emanating from the engines and the thunderous rumble, and everyone agreed that this was as Secretary Mabus stated, “A historic day.” For more about the Navy’s Great Green Fleet visit the Green Fleet website, or to read or listen to secretaries Mabus and Vilsack debrief on the Great Green Fleet visit the USDA website.

"Food Safety Marketing Helps Pave Path to Success at Produce Auction  Finding new ways to market the safety and quality of your food is the key to success in the agricultural industry. This is especially true for our small and mid-sized growers who are looking to expand to various outlets. These growers are now turning to produce auctions as a way to sell their food to a wider range of customers such as retail wholesale buyers and farmers markets outside their local communities.  In a recent trip to the Shenandoah Valley Produce Auction in Dayton, Va., I saw approximately 400 growers use this auction to share their bountiful harvest. Taking place several times a year, the largest wholesale auction in Virginia is an excellent alternative market for small growers. Prospective buyers bid intensely to procure large lots of fruits, vegetables, flowers, bedding plants, trees and shrubs, fall decor (pumpkins, mums, gourds), and compost, to name a few.

"Chief Scientist and Under Secretary, Research, Education and Economics in  Research and Science  Sep 06,   With food, agriculture, and natural resources at the center of many of the biggest challenges we face today, nothing is more critical than making sure our agricultural system is based on sound science.  As USDA’s Chief Scientist one of my responsibilities is making sure our Department’s research system maintains the highest standards of what is known as “scientific integrity.”  Scientific integrity includes making sure that scientific research proceeds free of outside influence or coercion, and that scientific findings are not suppressed or altered. I am pleased to say that Secretary Vilsack has recently released a policy on scientific integrity, and charged me to implement it across the Department.  This policy follows directly from the guidance provided by President Obama and the further guidance from Dr. John Holdren, Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The policy directs everyone at USDA – career employees, political appointees, and contractors who are involved in developing or applying science – on the proper conduct and use of science. The elements of the USDA policy include: promoting a culture of scientific integrity; utilizing information based on well-established scientific processes, including peer review; reflecting scientific information appropriately and accurately in regulatory actions; making scientific findings public; establishing mechanisms to resolve disputes involving scientific processes and integrity; protection for “whistleblowers” policies for Federal Advisory Committees that give scientific advice; communications by scientists with the media; and professional development of scientists and engineers. We will be working over the coming months to implement this policy by developing a Departmental Regulation and training for all affected employees, so that everyone understands the policy and has all of the knowledge that they need to comply. I invite your comments on the policy, posted here, which we will take into account in developing the Departmental Regulation and training.  Please send your comments to scientificintegrity@osec.usda.gov by October 31, .

"Acting Under Secretary for Food Safety in  Health and Safety  May 16,   As grilling season heats up, the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service is enhancing our food safety testing program for ground beef.  While FSIS has a range of safeguards to reduce E. coli in ground beef, this summer we will begin new testing to improve the safeguards against Salmonella as well.  Salmonella is commonly found in ground beef and, in fact, caused an illness outbreak in January in six states.  Salmonella is an especially difficult bacteria for food safety experts to address because it is so prevalent in almost all food sources. Recognizing that we need more information about the prevalence of Salmonella in ground beef to better prevent food-borne illness, FSIS is “super-sizing” our pathogen testing program to include Salmonella every time our laboratories test for E. coli in samples of ground beef and ground beef sources. Because the samples taken for E. coli testing are much larger than those we have taken in the past for Salmonella, there is higher likelihood that we will be able to detect the bacteria if it is present. Once FSIS has collected enough about the prevalence of Salmonella in ground beef, we will create a new standard to encourage ground beef processors to strengthen their Salmonella controls, resulting in safer products and fewer foodborne illnesses.  The collection process will take some time, but it is critical that the new standard is supported by meaningful .  Of course, we will continue to analyze any positive samples for multi-drug resistance and specific serotypes to determine whether they are contributing to human illnesses. Salmonella is the most urgent issue facing FSIS when it comes to protecting consumers and it is why we developed our Salmonella Action Plan.  This plan details our strategy for reducing the number of Salmonella-related illnesses, and this enhancement to our sampling and testing programs is part of that comprehensive effort.  Another part of our war on Salmonella is encouraging consumers to take steps to protect themselves from illnesses, including cooking all ground beef to 160 °F (poultry should be cooked to 165 °F).  For more information on ways to keep your family Salmonella-free this summer, we invite you to check out FoodSafety.gov or AskKaren.gov before your next cook out.

"USDA Office of the Chief Information Officer in  Technology  Feb 20,   Developing a modern USDA for a stronger rural America means equipping USDA’s employees who work in every American state and U.S. territory, as well as in over 50 countries, with information technology tools that ensure they are better informed, better engaged and better able to provide critical feedback to policy makers in real-time. Mobile devices, enterprise e-mail, video teleconferencing, online employee forums, social media and instant messaging allow employees who fight against hunger, food-borne illness and wildland fires to deliver their mission as well as serve the American public, while coordinating efforts with co-workers and decision makers across vast geographic distances. By remaining connected to both customers in the field and to regional and national government leaders, the on-the-ground knowledge of customer needs can much more quickly drive needed changes in policies and procedures that make USDA’s programs more accessible to the American public. These tools also make it possible for employees to more effectively work outside the normal office environment. Increasingly, employees are “tele-working” on a regular basis, which drives down the cost of government facilities leases and transit subsidies, and also enables managers and employees to continue their service during inclement weather conditions that force government offices to close. Just a few of the innovative tools in use today at USDA include: Your Two Cents, an online platform developed by USDA to serve as a virtual space for employees to talk about innovative solutions to difficult challenges, leading to the increased efficiency and effectiveness of program processes. Your Two Cents and other USDA sites like it are enabling leaders to better harness the collective experience of employees, and to foster an exchange of knowledge between co-workers who might not otherwise have had the opportunity. USDA Connect is a collaboration tool available to all USDA employees. Equipped with powerful social networking capabilities, it enables teams to work collaboratively on projects, regardless of location. When employees in the field work virtually with colleagues, they are better stewards of taxpayer dollars, saving on travel without sacrificing the ability to share knowledge in the pursuit of innovative solutions. AgLearn, a virtual university for USDA’s employees, is a low cost, one-stop shop for employee development and training that can be accessed from anywhere in the world. Employees are encouraged to set individual development goals and to take advantage of the more than courses, 20,000 professional development books, and hundreds of videos that are available at a cost of less than 10 dollars per employee per year. These and many other innovative tools helped develop the modern USDA for a stronger rural America. Employees are able to get the training they need cost-effectively, to share expertise and knowledge of local conditions with decision-makers and with each other, and to collaborate on projects anywhere, any time. The information technologies USDA has acquired, developed, and managed are making it all possible.

"Oregon USDA Public Information Officer in  Rural  Nov 06,  For Martin Paredes and his family (pictured here), Castle Rock Apartments provide good quality rental housing for working families, while serving as a stepping stone to home ownership. Boardman, Oregon, is a port town of just over 3,000 on the banks of the Columbia River surrounded by productive farm lands. These resources have helped the community generate above-average economic growth through its agricultural, food processing, manufacturing, and shipping sectors. As these industries have grown, however, a significant shortage of affordable workforce housing has made finding and keeping skilled employees difficult and hinders further economic development in this promising community. In order to secure affordable housing, many who work in Boardman have had to endure long commutes from outlying towns or settle for homes that simply did not meet their families’ needs. Martin Paredes, Olgalibia Rosales Rivera, and their four children are one such family. Due to a lack of rental options in the community, the family was living in a two-bedroom apartment in a part of town that offered few family-friendly amenities and services. Last month, the Umatilla County Housing Authority and CASA of Oregon opened the doors to Castle Rock Apartments, with 40 brand-new rental units located adjacent to schools, a grocery store, health care, churches, transportation, a safe playground, and more. To develop a quality housing facility with “built to last” standards, a number of federal, state, local and nonprofit partners worked together to identify financing options that included funding and tax credits provided by the State of Oregon and the federal government. USDA Rural Development provided a $2.4 million low-interest loan through the Farm Labor Housing Program, which offers low-interest financing to develop housing for those working in agriculture and food processing. The program also offers a rental subsidy to ensure housing and utility costs do not exceed 30 percent of a household’s income. Today, Martin Paredes and his family live in a new, four-bedroom apartment with plenty of room for the children. In addition, the rent is lower, allowing the family to start saving for the future. “We hope to buy our own home someday,” Paredes said. Another resident, Lisa Garcia Mendez, explains that before the new complex was built, apartments in Boardman were too expensive for farm worker families and, even then, the options were just not good. Moving to Castle Rock has changed things for her family of six. “I just feel safer here with my kids,” Mendez said. To find out more about USDA Rural Development Housing programs click here. Dancers wearing indigenous Mexican regalia perform a traditional blessing at the grand opening of the Castle Rock Apartments in Boardman, Oregon, where 62 percent of the population is of Hispanic descent.

"First Lady Michelle Obama and U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announce proposed school wellness standards and roll out of breakfast and lunch programs for schools that serve low income communities  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .14  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  WASHINGTON, Feb. 25, – Today, First Lady Michelle Obama joins U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to announce proposed for local school wellness policies. The bipartisan Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of mandated that the USDA set for what needed to be included in local school wellness policies in areas such as setting goals for nutrition education and physical activity, informing parents about content of the policy and implementation, and periodically assessing progress and sharing updates as appropriate. As part of local school wellness policies, the proposed would ensure that foods and beverages marketed to children in schools are consistent with the recently-released Smart Snacks in School standards. Ensuring that unhealthy food is not marketed to children is one of the First Lady's top priorities; that is why it is so important for schools to reinforce the importance of healthy choices and eliminate marketing of unhealthy products.""The idea here is simple—our classrooms should be healthy places where kids aren't bombarded with ads for junk food,"" said First Lady Michelle Obama. ""Because when parents are working hard to teach their kids healthy habits at home, their work shouldn't be undone by unhealthy messages at school.""This action comes after the White House Summit on Food Marketing to Children last fall where Mrs. Obama called on the country to ensure children's health was not undermined by marketing of unhealthy food.""The food marketing and local wellness standards proposed today support better health for our kids and echo the good work already taking place at home and in schools across the country. The new standards ensure that schools remain a safe place where kids can learn and where the school environment promotes healthy choices. USDA is committed to working closely with students, parents, school stakeholders and the food and beverage industries to implement the new and make the healthy choice, the easy choice for America's young people,"" Secretary Vilsack said.To help schools with the implementation of the school wellness policies, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched a new ""School Nutrition Environment and Wellness Resources"" website, which includes sample wellness policy language for school districts and a dedicated page of resources for food marketing practices on the school campus.These new resources will complement a second announcement which highlights the nationwide expansion of a successful program that was piloted in 11 states with the goal of ensuring children who are in need of nutritious meals are receiving them. Beginning July 1, , more than 22,000 schools across the country—which serve primarily low-income students—will be eligible to serve healthy free lunches and breakfasts to all students. This will help as many as 9 million American children eat healthy meals at school, especially breakfast, which can have profound impacts on educational achievement. Research shows that kids who eat breakfast in the classroom preform over 17% better on math tests and have fewer disciplinary problems.For more information, go to is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

"ARS Office of Communications in  Research and Science  Mar 28,  Pitchers are on the mound and warming up for this season’s opening day of baseball. Ninety feet away, batters, armed only with a wooden stick, prepare to face them. Many parts of America’s national pastime have changed over the years, but the two key elements – putting bat to ball – have remained at its core. Until recently, though, this was taken for granted. An invasive beetle, the emerald ash borer (EAB), has been bearing down on North American forests like a pitch from Justin Verlander. This pest beetle has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees since they were discovered near Detroit in . Ash is one of the main sources of wood for bats used in Major League Baseball. But there is hope: scientists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Forest Service (FS), and Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) have found and unleashed several predators of the EAB that unsettle the insect like a high-and-tight fastball. “We have four parasitic wasps from the pest’s native home (Northeast Asia) approved and released,” said Jian Duan, entomologist with the ARS Beneficial Insects Introduction Research unit in Newark, DE. “The beauty of these wasps is that they are specialized to feed only on the eggs or larvae of the EAB. They do not feed on the ash tree itself, or any other trees or crops, and they haven’t bothered pollinators or other beneficial insects.” While the wasps alone will not eradicate the EAB, they have controlled them to the point that they are killing far fewer trees. That’s a win for baseball because it may keep bats in the hands of hitters from T-ball through the big leagues for years to come.

"APHIS Area Veterinarian in Charge Trainee, Fort Collins, CO in  Animals  Plants  Oct 06,   Hi, I’m Dr. Sunny Geiser and I’m in the Area Veterinarian in Charge (AVIC) trainee program in USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s (APHIS) Western Region.  I’m currently stationed in Fort Collins, CO. I grew up with horses and livestock and always enjoyed working with them.  The medical aspect of their care fascinated me, so I decided to pursue a career in veterinary medicine.  After vet school, I worked in both private practice and state regulatory medicine before joining APHIS.  There’s a broader role to regulatory medicine and it feels like you are doing a greater service. My APHIS career began as an import/export veterinary medical officer in New Jersey.  When the AVIC trainee program opportunity arose, I jumped at the chance to participate.  I’m in the middle of the 18 - 24 month program where I get to gain experience, bolster my supervisory capabilities and prepare for a career as an AVIC. Some of the things I’ve done recently include  working with the administrative team at the Western Region Office to develop a vacancy tracking database, delineating opportunities for cost savings, and coordinating with other APHIS groups on a survey for horse owners related to the recent Equine Herpes Virus 1 outbreak.  I’ve been able to spend a good deal of my time acting as a temporary AVIC in several states to cover for vacations and retirements.  Every day is a valuable learning experience for me right now. One of the most rewarding things I’ve done here at APHIS was to participate in a bovine TB outbreak.  I’d never done TB testing before, but I got the opportunity to travel to Oregon to be part of the team that tested a very large dairy.  In addition to the actual testing, I gained a new appreciation for the size and scale of such an operation and the impact a disease like TB could have on it.  The team was well coordinated and completed our task in roughly half the time originally estimated! Some of my best experiences in veterinary medicine have been collaborating with our intelligent and hardworking state and federal veterinarians, who work together to protect animal health.  I love the people I work with, as well as that feeling of being a part of the overall picture of animal health.

"Writer and Editor, Farm Service Agency in  USDA Results  Feb 07,   A passion for agriculture is what brought 50 young farmers to the Washington, D.C., area this week, as part of a national networking forum for the next generation of producers. “We want to let young producers know that their voice is important and they shouldn’t be hesitant or bashful about communicating with policymakers,” said Gordon Stone, executive vice president of the National Young Farmer Educational Association, or NYFEA, which sponsored Agriculture’s Promise: The Washington Forum. Undersecretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services Michael Scuse joined several speakers on day two of the three-day event — held Monday, Feb. 4 at National Harbor — to provide an overview of the Farm Service Agency, Risk Management and Foreign Agricultural Service and encourage discussion about USDA’s programs and policies. Scuse mentioned a new microloan program designed to help small and family operations, beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers secure loans under $35,000. Microloans will help producers through their start-up years by providing needed resources and helping to increase equity so that farmers may eventually graduate to commercial credit and expand their operations. Scuse also spoke about the importance of communicating effectively with rural America. “We need to work together to make agriculture strong, to make rural America strong, so that when we speak, our voice is heard,” said Scuse. “That's the message we are trying to get out. That's the message we would ask all of you to get out.” From -, U.S. agricultural exports alone generated more than $478 billion that supported more than 1 million jobs in communities across the country. According to Scuse, for every 1 billion dollars in trade, 7,800 jobs are supported. “Agriculture has been part of the backbone of this nation’s economy for the last several years,” he said. “Our rural communities faired far better than the big cities did.” Jami Willard has been attending the forum for the past four years and wants her work in the field to positively impact others. “I want to make big changes and help set people up to succeed,” said Willard, a Penn State graduate who grew up on a farm in Pennsylvania but currently works at Northwest Harvest, a non-profit food bank distributor in Washington state. “I understand the complexity of the industry and I can talk to producers and do something to impact people positively. [Through this program] my voice is being heard.” Participants heard from representatives from the Farm Credit Administration, National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and Tyson Food. They also had round table discussions, receptions with congressional leaders and took a trip to Capitol Hill for a Congressional briefing. This is Kathryn Shallenberger’s third year attending the program. An agriculture teacher in Illinois, Shallenberger grew up on a 200-acre corn and soybean farm. “This program has provided a network of people for guidance and support,” said Shallenberger. “It offers an opportunity for me to take back the message to my students that the world is so much bigger than them and what we do in agriculture now won’t only affect them, but their parents and their children.”  Category/Topic:  USDA Results  Tags:  Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program  FAS  FSA  Michelle Obama  microloans  National Young Farmer Educational Association  RMA  Rural America","What are some effective ways for young farmers to communicate their needs and concerns to policymakers, as emphasized by the speakers at Agriculture's Promise: The Washington Forum?","The speakers at Agriculture's Promise: The Washington Forum emphasized the importance of young farmers communicating effectively with policymakers.

"Education and Section 508 Service Area Manager, USDA TARGET Center in  Technology  Nov 19,  In today’s workplace, technology has such an immense impact that most of us take it for granted. Yet there was once a day when you sat at your desk and wrote letters by hand, waited for the mail to be delivered and connected calls through an employee-operated switch board in your office.  If you were lucky, at least you could use a typewriter.  Today, we can type letters using our voice, constantly have access to email on our Smartphone and video chat to anyone in the world almost instantly. While we certainly all benefit from advances in technology, individuals with disabilities have probably benefited most of all. Through our Profiles in Technology video series, we want to share brief stories from the individuals and demonstrate how technology has impacted them in the workplace. Through these stories, we hope you will see how individuals with disabilities can achieve the same level of success as everyone else in the workplace. In our first episode, we introduce Dr. Denise Decker, an NRCS employee who has a successful career at Agriculture during which she has travelled the world and written a published book about her guide dog, all with the help of assistive technology.

"Director of Sustainability Development, USDA in  Conservation  Dec 15,  Researchers at USDA Agricultural Research Service help reduce food waste by developing new ways to extend food shelf life and by creating new food products, biobased plastics, and animal feed from food waste. USDA photo by Stephen Ausmus. Less than 2 years ago, the USDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched the U.S. Food Waste Challenge, with the goal of reducing food waste in the United States.  We set an ambitious goal of having at least 400 businesses, schools, and/or organizations join the challenge by letting us know what they are doing to reduce food waste in their operations.  USDA also committed to finding ways in which its 33 agencies and offices could help reduce food waste through policy, partnerships, and research. As of today, we have surpassed our membership goal by signing up 1,313 participants in the U.S. Food Waste Challenge. The number and diversity of participants joining the challenge are indicative of a growing movement to reduce food waste that is spreading across the country. Founding members, Rio Farms, Unilever, General Mills, and the Food Waste Reduction Alliance have been joined by members from across the food supply chain.  Hannaford, a supermarket chain in the Northeast, recently joined the U.S. Food Waste Challenge and shared the many ways in which it keeps food from ending up in landfills.  Using the “food recovery hierarchy,” Hannaford tries to reduce food waste at the source by having fresh products delivered on a daily basis instead of 3-4 times per week.  Daily deliveries lead to more accurate ordering, less food waste, and improvements in quality.  Safeway, another supermarket chain participating in the U.S. Food Waste Challenge, donates the wholesome, edible food that goes unsold in their stores to feed hungry people.  In , Safeway recovered and donated 72 million pounds of food to hunger relief organizations. Other participants in our challenge like K-12 schools, universities, and sports teams are also involved in food recovery and donation activities.  With the help of organizations like Campus Kitchens and Food Recovery Network, over 120 colleges and universities have started food recovery efforts in their dining facilities to donate wholesome unsold food to local food pantries.  Sports teams like the Milwaukee Brewers and movie studios like NBC Universal have also signed up for the challenge because of their work with Rock and Wrap It Up!, an organization that recovers and donates unsold food at sporting events and movie shoots. Moving down the food recovery hierarchy, some participants in our challenge keep food from landfills by converting it to livestock feed.  Four Minnesota schools in the Chisago Lakes School District have their food waste picked up by Barthold Pig Farm, where it is then heated and fed to pigs. The 72 McDonalds’ in Hawaii now sell their used cooking oil to Pacific Biodiesel, where it is then recycled into fuel. Not to be outdone by all of our U.S. Food Waste Challenge participants, the USDA also delivered on reducing food waste through our policies, partnerships, and research.  USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) continues to study and provide estimates on how much food goes uneaten at the retail and consumer level.  The estimated pounds, monetary value, and calories of food loss that USDA ERS helps policymakers, the food industry, and nonprofits better explain the food waste issue to the public, make recommendations, and set targeted goals. Through the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the USDA is researching and developing new products that help 1) reduce food spoilage; 2) reuse waste from food processing to produce new value-added products; and 3) recycle food waste into livestock feed or biobased products such as biodegradable plastics. ARS, for example, helped Gorge Delight, a grower-owned business, develop a 100% fruit bar that uses blemished or damaged apples and pears from their orchards that would have otherwise been discarded.  Not only does ARS’s work help reduce food waste, but it also creates new economic opportunities in rural areas. For consumers and families, USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has updated the “Ask Karen” website, which is visited over 10 million times a year, to answer people’s questions on how to safely handle, prepare, and store food.  FSIS, which is responsible for ensuring that the nation’s commercial supply of meat, poultry, and egg products is safe and correctly labeled, recently streamlined procedures for donating wholesome misbranded meat and poultry products.  In April , as a result of this directive, FSIS was involved in the donation of approximately 84,310 pounds of misbranded pork sausage.  The misbranded product was donated to the Westmoreland County Food Bank and Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. Finally, here at USDA headquarters in Washington, D.C., the cafeteria, which serves up to 3,000 people a day, has found some innovative ways to reduce food waste.  The dining service company, IL Creations, holds “Happy Hour” from 2:30 pm – 3:00 pm, at which food is sold at a 30% discount to reduce the amount of unsold leftovers.  For people with eyes bigger than their stomachs, USDA has promoted composting and made it easy for employees by placing composting bins all over the building.   In , USDA headquarters composted about 2,650 pounds of food waste per week.  This represents about a 10% increase from , which is double our original goal of a 5% increase. The goal we had for launching the U.S. Food Waste Challenge was to help inspire organizations and individuals across the food supply chain to start reducing, recovering, and recycling food waste in their day-to-day operations.  What we didn’t expect was how much your energy, passion, and support would push us to do more.  Indeed there is so much more work to be done to reduce food waste in America, and we want to continue working on this issue for years to come. USDA FSIS recently changed on donation of mislabeled meat and poultry products. In April , this new directive led to 84,310 pounds of misbranded pork sausage being donated to local food pantries instead of being dumped into a landfill.

"NRCS California in  Initiatives  Conservation  Rural  Sep 30,  Recovery Act funds helped install riparian fencing on Elizabeth Cunningham’s ranch.  Three family farms in California’s Stemple Creek Watershed recently received much-needed conservation assistance from the Natural Resources Conservation Service through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of (Recovery Act). I am excited about one historic ranch in particular, where we helped a third-generation rancher make her operation more sustainable. On this ranch, located outside of Petaluma, California, Elizabeth Cunningham raises free-range chickens and pigs for the local market. Elizabeth is the granddaughter of the original homesteader and the first in her family to seek NRCS conservation assistance. NRCS oversaw the installation of riparian fencing to on the ranch to protect a creek on the property—a tributary of Stemple Creek—from over-grazing and erosion, improving water quality. We also partnered with a local conservation organization to plant native vegetation for improved wildlife habitat, hiring local contractors to do the work. With the $200,emple Creek Watershed improvement, NRCS completed similar work on two other farms, a conventional chicken farm and a small family-run dairy. The Recovery Act, was created by the Obama Administration to boost the economy, in part by developing and improving the Nation’s infrastructure. The Stemple Creek work (on these three properties, but also many others) is part of a continuum of proactive partnership and voluntary conservation that developed after the EPA declared the watershed impaired under Section 303d of the Clean Water Act in due to high sediment loads. The creek flows to California’s northern coast, where it empties into the Gulf of Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. The sanctuary provides habitat for threatened species such as the California freshwater shrimp. The Recovery Act funds granted to these three projects has contributed to the tremendous conservation improvements in the Stemple Creek Watershed over the past 20 years, which have resulted in dozens of miles of restored stream banks and almost every dairy in the watershed completing water quality improvements. Every day, I am inspired and impressed by the work of our local landowners and conservation partners in this watershed. Learn more about NRCS Recovery Act Programs here. Follow NRCS on Twitter.

"Are Frogs on the Edge of Survival?  A lethal fungus is killing frogs and other water-dwelling amphibians all over the world, but a team of international scientists led by U.S. Forest Service scientist Deanna Olson is working to understand why. Olson, who works at the agency’s Pacific Northwest Research Station, and her colleagues have the daunting task of tracking the disease, known as the amphibian chytrid fungus. Unlike the clearly visible white-nose syndrome killing bats in the U.S., the frog fungus cannot be seen except with a microscope. That makes scientists’ jobs that much more difficult. Since the discovery of the malady is so recent, scientists still don’t understand a great deal about the fungus except that it affects the skin and ultimately leads to cardiac arrest in amphibians.

"WIC Program Integrity Branch Chief, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 05,  FNS has taken a range of steps to ensure the highest level of integrity in WIC. For more than 40 years, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has provided supplemental foods and nutrition services vital to the health and nutrition of vulnerable moms, newborns and young children. And throughout those four decades, we’ve had a long-standing history of working with WIC state agencies to ensure program resources and taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently. While a study found a relatively low rate of improper vendor payments, (representing less than 1.5 percent of WIC food expenses), FNS has and will continue to intervene when problems arise and to require state agencies to improve the integrity of their programs. FNS is vigilant about the integrity of all of its food assistance programs, including WIC. That’s why in , FNS established the Program Integrity and Monitoring Branch to oversee WIC integrity initiatives. This new branch plays a key role in WIC monitoring and oversight and it is paying close attention to vendor management practices to ensure the program pays only fair prices to retailers for WIC foods. It provides technical assistance to address areas of concern and to disseminate information about noteworthy initiatives. The branch also supports electronic benefit transfer (EBT) implementation efforts, which vastly improves integrity by simplifying the benefit transaction for participants and cashiers and improving states’ ability to track prices stores are charging and redemption patterns.  Here’s a list of some of our steps we’re taking to ensure integrity: Providing Direct Technical Assistance In September , FNS completed reviews on vendor management practices in each state with a retail food delivery system, including the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.  FNS is working with state agencies to correct all problems identified through these reviews. In December , FNS launched a process to assess the strength of vendor management practices nationwide.  We’re now developing technical assistance materials on paying competitive prices for supplemental foods to help state agencies improve their vendor management practices. The first set of topic-specific tools are expected by the end of June and rolled out later this year. FNS is also developing a comprehensive Vendor Management Handbook to improve the quality and consistency of vendor oversight activities. FNS staff have recently provided web-based program integrity trainings in two priority areas—income eligibility and certification, as well as vendor management.  To date, two vendor management webinars have been presented and several more are in the planning stages.  Addressing WIC Foods Sold Online In , WIC began working with major social media sites (Amazon, Craigslist, eBay and Facebook) to address the potential online sale of WIC foods.  Amazon strengthened its policies on prohibiting certain types of sales not only for WIC, but also for SNAP, as a direct result of our request.  Craigslist also has policies prohibiting the sale of WIC and SNAP cards or foods and eBay has a warning for sellers that it is a violation of federal law to sell food and infant formula obtained through the WIC Program.  We also wrote to every state agency encouraging them to place the following statement on all WIC checks, EBT cards or their accompanying folders or sleeves:  “Buying or selling WIC benefits is a crime.  To report suspected abuse, call 800-424- or visit www.usda.gov/oig/hotline.htm.”  FNS is continuing its efforts to guard against the potential sale of WIC foods.    Conducting Research We are conducting a range of studies to help inform future integrity efforts. One study examines EBT to identify an approach to develop high-risk vendor indicators in both the current and future (all-EBT) WIC environments. Another looks at effective methods for establishing vendor groups based on common characteristics that affect food prices, competitive price criteria and allowable reimbursement levels. Findings from both studies are expected in and will be used to inform future actions. FNS is committed to working with our partners in the 90 WIC state agencies to use evidence to strengthen the integrity of the program.

"An Airport is No Place for an Owl  Seeing a short-eared owl in November on the Pittsburgh International Airport, where I work as an airport wildlife biologist, was a unique occasion. However, as the number of owls grew to eight, I recognized the challenge ahead:  Like all birds of prey, short-eared owls are a recognized potential aviation hazard. Their low rolling flight and difficult-to-disperse reputation means they pose an aviation safety threat.  From -, short-eared owl strikes with aircraft in the United States caused over $1 million in damage, and often are fatal to the birds.  Convincing them to leave would be difficult but important. The task would be harder because short-eared owls are listed by the State as an endangered species.  Common in many areas globally, Pennsylvania is the southernmost edge of their breeding range.  These owls likely migrated from Canadian breeding grounds to winter in Pennsylvania.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Jun 07,   Dr. Joanna Zablotsky Kufel discovered community and public health at Tufts University in Massachusetts. Afterwards, she worked in public health for a couple of years and then moved to Baltimore, Md., where she earned her Masters in and Ph.D. in at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “After learning all about food safety at the state and local level, I still wanted to learn more about food safety at the federal level, where you can influence food safety throughout the entire food chain,” said Dr. Zablotsky Kufel. Dr. Zablotsky Kufel began her career with USDA as a summer intern working for the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS). Today she works as a Public Health Food Safety Analyst with FSIS, analyzing from across FSIS gathered by inspectors in the field, and partner agencies to evaluate FSIS policies and performance. The analyses performed and produced allow FSIS to effectively use science and to understand foodborne illness and emerging trends, respond to those risks and ensure that food safety inspection aligns with decreasing those risks. Dr. Zablotsky Kufel and her colleagues developed the “All Illness Measure”, a key measure of FSIS’ performance that helps assess whether the work that FSIS employees perform is having an effect on how often people get sick from food that FSIS regulates. “We use a public health approach that involves Assurance – Measurement – Refinement to ensure the food supply is safe,” she explained. “FSIS Inspection Program Personnel work to make sure that regulated product is safe and produced in accordance with FSIS policies (Assurance). We then measure FSIS’ impact on the public's health and determine whether our policies and activities are having a positive effect (Performance Measurement). This allows FSIS to evaluate existing policy methodologies and create new and innovative approaches to further prevent foodborne illness (Policy Development/Refinement).” The cycle, incorporated in FSIS’ - Strategic Plan, creates a feedback loop that helps FSIS modernize and better address existing and emerging food safety threats. Dr. Zablotsky Kufel also works with CDC and FDA analysts on the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration to determine what foods cause human illness. “In the next 5 years, I see CDC, FDA and FSIS working together even more closely to prevent illness and having a more real-time understanding of what causes illness—with the ability to react much more rapidly to emerging trends,” Dr. Zablotsky Kufel explained. “I really enjoy working with some of the best minds in public health and food safety to figure out how best to use the we have, identify new sources of , understand why people get sick and learn how we can prevent outbreaks in the future.” Faces of Food Safety is an initiative by FSIS to introduce Americans to the real people who work every day to keep the food in their own homes and yours safe.

"Alaska Beavers Entertain Web Cam Viewers Around the World  Two beavers sleep peacefully in their den on Steep Creek in Juneau, Alaska, never realizing they are being watched via a hidden infrared camera. Hundreds of viewers tune-in to a live video feed on the U.S. Forest Service YouTube Channel throughout the day to see the beavers come and go, breathing rhythmically as they nap and then stretch, chew and scratch an occasional itch. Although the beaver cam is now an established fixture at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center, it started out of simple curiosity according to Pete Schneider, a natural resource specialist for the Tongass National Forest. He and fisheries biologist Don Martin first experimented with a beaver cam in after they saw a cache of food in front of a beaver lodge on Steep Creek. It was a sure indication that beavers, who have a tendency to move around, were actually using the lodge at the time. They decided to run electricity through a conduit to that location in order to power an infrared camera.

"State and Private Forestry, US Forest Service in  Forestry  Aug 10,  Sandra Cummings. (Courtesy photo Sandra Cummings) Sandra Cummings is an African American woman who is a part owner of two forested landscapes in Georgia. Her first property, 325 acres of land with a home in the city of Madison, was passed down by her maternal great-grandmother, who was born a slave. The second property consists of 165 acres of land in the town of Portal, which was passed down by her paternal grandfather. To ensure that the family’s ancestral land remains intact, Mrs. Cummings and her family decided to put it into an irrevocable trust to prevent their children and grandchildren from dividing and selling it. “You see, they didn’t grow up in the dirt like we did,” she said. “We grew up working those farmlands, picking cotton, tobacco, planting watermelon. We were able to see the benefits of having this land. My children and grandchildren did not.” Mrs. Cummings wanted to encourage long-term stewardship of her land, and sought out resources to help achieve this goal. Amadou Diop, an Atlanta-based outreach liaison for the US Forest Service, helped Mrs. Cummings find information about forest management and stewardship plans. “If it wasn’t for Amadou’s wealth of knowledge, willingness to help people, and putting me in touch with the resources directly, I would have never been able to get any of this done,” said Mrs. Cummings. “He made sure that I was taken care of, and he deserves a lot of credit.” The Forest Service’s Forest Stewardship Program encourages long-term stewardship of important state and private forest landscapes by assisting landowners to more actively manage their forests and related resources. The Forest Service helped Mrs. Cummings through a forest management and stewardship plan created by the Georgia Forestry Commission, which laid out a 10-year plan for managing the land. Under the plan’s guidance, Mrs. Cummings now uses the land in Madison for timber management, grazing for cattle, and wildlife habitat. She manages the land in Portal for forestry, wildlife, silvopasture (with assistance from the NRCS), and a pine straw operation. As a result, she obtains additional earnings from her land by leasing it out for deer hunting and harvesting pine straw. She is enjoying the benefits of being a forest landowner. “One of the benefits for me is the extra income from the pine straw operation —extra income is always good, you know,” she said. “It also gives you some self-sufficiency,” she continued. “I will say this: if something were to happen in Atlanta—where we are living now, then we always have a place to go. If we needed to build another house or something….we can do it! So both lands give us some stability.” Mrs. Cummings intends for her family’s legacy to continue. She hopes to renovate her parents’ home into a historic site and to build a walking trail for guests, and she is exploring the potential for solar power generation on her property in Portal. Cattle like these graze Mrs. Cummings property in Portal, Georgia.

"The U.S. Food Safety System Has Come A Long Way in 50 Years  July is the height of summer grilling season and throughout the month USDA is highlighting changes made to the U.S. food safety system over the course of this Administration. For an interactive look at USDA’s work to ensure your food is safe, visit the USDA Results project on Medium.com and read Chapter Seven: Safer Food and Greater Consumer Confidence. By the time this blog posts today, most readers will have already enjoyed at least one meal. Over their breakfast—fresh fruit, a bacon and egg sandwich, or maybe a grab-n-go energy bar—Americans were probably thinking about all the tasks that meal would fuel them to do for the day, and not whether their food could make them ill. But a strong and diligent network of public servants at the federal, state and local levels were thinking about how to protect you from foodborne illness over their breakfasts this morning, and they’re still thinking about it now. Their job day in and day out is to make sure the food on America’s tables—including yours and theirs—is safe to eat. They are the best in the world at what they do, and they’re constantly getting better. I have proudly been a part of this team since , when I accepted a job with USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) as an inspector in a Dalhart, Texas beef facility. FSIS is the federal agency charged with ensuring the safety of America’s meat, poultry and processed egg supply, and we work hand in hand with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as state and local departments of health and agriculture. Over the years, I worked my way up from that entry level position in Dalhart, to managing FSIS' Dallas District, to eventually managing the entire agency as Administrator. In my nearly 40-year career, I have seen major changes in the U.S. food safety system.  Alfred V.

"USDA Research Progress Towards Global Food Security  Most of us living in the United States are fortunate enough not to wonder where our next meal will come from. Yet across the globe, at least some time during the year, nearly 800 million people do. Not having access to stable and nutritious food sources – or food insecurity — negatively impacts people’s lives. Food security, on the other hand, means access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.

"Deputy Under Secretary of Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  Feb 11,  USDA Deputy Undersecretary Ann Mills (ninth from left) visits with Leopold Conservation Award winners at USDA last week. USDA photo. “Water conservation begins where the first drop of rain falls…most likely on private working lands.” This is a favorite saying of Tom Vandivier, a Texas cattle rancher and recipient of the Sand County Foundation’s Leopold Conservation Award (LCA). Tom was one of more than two dozen recipients of the LCA – which recognized landowners for achievement in environmental improvement on agricultural land – in Washington, D.C. last week.  I was fortunate to meet with them here at USDA headquarters to talk about the importance of conservation and the need to spread the message that investing in conservation practices on our farm and ranch lands not only protects water, air and wildlife – it also makes economic sense. Jill Giacomini Basch is a LCA recipient who, with her father and three sisters, owns a family dairy in Marin County, Calif.  I had a chance to meet with the Giacomini family during my tour of several California farms last month. Jill explained that conservation improves the way they run their business. Partnerships with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and others have helped them protect their land and water resources, and ensure their dairy will be prosperous for the next generation. “We have very close ties with NRCS and other programs,” Jill said. “They have helped us with our water allocation -- above ground storage pond facilities and spring well drilling.  With the USDA we were able to utilize new technology to install a methane digester to help mitigate waste run off into the nearby lagoon, but also eventually the Point Reyes National Seashore.  Because of the methane digester, we generate about 65 percent of our on farm energy needs.” “Much of the work we’ve done has been through NRCS programs,” Tom added. “NRCS is very important to us.  We’re very much about conservation. The stewardship practices that we’ve accomplished on our property have enhanced water resources in the state of Texas.  I think it’s a message that needs to be spread so others can take similar stewardship practices and hopefully have the same results in their perspective states.” Jon Bednarski, LCA recipient, shared his story as well.  He started farming 12 years ago outside of Louisville, Ky.  After meeting with NRCS, he discovered he was farming a “sensitive” piece of land, upstream of Louisville’s drinking water source. Since then he has managed his operation to help protect water quality. The group discussed the need for conservation in the face of extreme weather – including the significant drought conditions in 11 western states.  As we were meeting, the U.S. Senate was in the process of voting on the Agricultural Act of . I talked about how important this legislation is to providing the tools and programs necessary for USDA to help farmers, ranchers and forestland owners manage the risk and uncertainty associated with extreme weather and climate change.  Conservation programs will be streamlined to better target limited resources to areas of highest need, while building on record conservation and stewardship efforts already underway.  I also previewed Secretary Tom Vilsack’s announcement of USDA’s new regional hubs to help agriculture and forestry mitigate the impacts of a changing climate. The group also discussed the importance of passing on to the next generation the passion for agriculture and land stewardship.  There is a new energy in America around opportunities in agriculture. The Agricultural Act of will provide our communities with additional support to attract new economic opportunity and create jobs.  We all agreed that outreach and education is crucial.  USDA will continue to work with the LCA recipients and other partners to make that happen.  To view a video about the meeting click here.

"APHIS Public Affairs, Riverdale, MD in  Animals  Plants  Nov 13,  Animal Care inspector Bob Markmann conducts an inspection at a commercial dog breeding facility. USDA/APHIS’ Animal Care program enforces the federal Animal Welfare Act, which sets standards for humane care and treatment that must be provided for certain animals that are exhibited to the public, bred for commercial sale, used in biomedical research, or transported commercially. Individuals/entities that operate facilities using animals in these ways must provide their animals with proper veterinary care, adequate housing, appropriate nutrition, etc. In Bob Markmann’s own words: “Our job can be smelly at times. I’ve been urinated on by a tiger while inspecting a circus. I’ve been sneezed on by an elephant. I’ve had a chimpanzee throw feces at me. And too often, I come home smelling like guinea pigs and dogs. But the worst was when I came home smelling like a prehensile-tailed porcupine. That smell takes the cake. I have not found a good way to describe it.” Hazards of the trade, no doubt. But a small price to pay to make a difference in the lives of thousands upon thousands of animals each year. Animal Care’s veterinary medical officers and animal care inspectors cover a particular geographic area across the country. They inspect animals and facilities licensed and registered with USDA under the Animal Welfare Act and Horse Protection Act. These dedicated souls spend a lot of time on the road, driving from facility to facility. Their duties include: observing animals for signs of poor health, abuse, or any kind of mistreatment or inadequate care; determining if animal enclosures are appropriate for the species and will not cause harm to the animals; inspecting horses at horse shows, auctions and sales; responding to complaints at USDA-licensed facilities; interviewing suspected unlicensed operators to determine if they need a license; and educating licensees and license applicants on the proper procedures in the humane care, handling and transportation of animals. It’s a varied job description indeed. And it’s that daily variety, along with an innate desire for the welfare of the animals they regulate, which led these individuals to become APHIS inspectors. Asked why they chose this career, here’s what a few of them had to say. Veterinary medical officer Gloria McFadden conducts an inspection at a research facility.  “I became an inspector to make a difference for animals. Over my 22 years with Animal Care, I have found that, although we can’t help them all, we do make a big difference in the lives of the ones we can help.” - Elizabeth Pannill, veterinary medical officer, Texas “Previously, I had worked four years in private practice and four years for the Food Safety Inspection Service in a chicken plant in North Carolina. I applied for a position with Animal Care in South Carolina and was hired 19 years ago. We have made a lot of really good changes over the decades, especially in our training and our consistency. In the beginning, I had a licensee who was literally starving his cougars before my eyes, but all I could do was cite him. Today, we would have those cougars confiscated and taken to a better place.” - Lisa MacElderry, veterinary medical officer, South Carolina “I’ve been with APHIS more than 25 years. I’ve always been interested in animal welfare, and joined the agency hoping to make a difference.” - Bob Markmann, animal care inspector, Pennsylvania  “I’ve been with Animal Care since Dec. 30, . My purpose then is the same as it is today: to provide better environments for animals by helping their owners understand the importance of proper care. I wanted to be a part of an organization that would be searching for and utilizing new scientific approaches to improve the environment and care of the animals that are listed under the Animal Welfare Act.” - Nancy Ellifrit, veterinary medical officer, Oklahoma  Category/Topic:  Animals  Plants  Tags:  Animal Care  Animal Welfare Act  APHIS  Horse Protection Act  Pennsylvania  Plant and Animal Health  South Carolina  Texas","What are some of the key responsibilities and hazards faced by USDA/APHIS' Animal Care inspectors, such as Bob Markmann, who inspect animals and facilities licensed under the Animal Welfare Act?","USDA/APHIS' Animal Care inspectors, like Bob Markmann, have key responsibilities including observing animals for signs of poor health or mistreatment, ensuring animal enclosures are suitable, inspecting horses at events, responding to complaints, interviewing suspected unlicensed operators, and educating licensees on humane care.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Mar 04,  Mark Jennings plants sunflowers in wheat stubble. Attending a no-till conference forever changed the way North Dakota farmer Mark Jennings farmed. He started using basic conservation practices for conserving moisture. For the past decade he’s been sowing cover crops and reaping rich returns. Working closely with the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, Jennings has become a devoted no-till farmer. At the Agricultural Outlook Forum, the North Dakota farmer presented his story to a crowded room at the “Economics of Conservation” seminar. USDA hosts the two-day forum. “I’m working towards sustainability by copying Mother Nature, and Mother Nature doesn’t till,” said Jennings, who grows wheat, sunflowers, corn, soybeans, peas, flax, oats, canola, barley and a variety of cover crops. “The biological livestock in the ground can do tillage for you,” Jennings said. “There are over a billion organisms in a teaspoon of healthy soil. Tilling destroys them. Jennings had to overcome obstacles when he switched to no-till. In addition to learning a new way of farming, he faced pressure for trying something different. “They told me that’s not the way you’re supposed to farm,” Jennings said. He smiled as he clicked through a series of before-and-after pictures of his land. The results speak for themselves. Showing a picture of layered organic matter covering his soil, he said: “This is money in the bank, and dollars sitting on the soil. The exact value might be hard to measure, but it’s very real.” Mark Jennings plants corn using no-till, and this harvest is the result. Since switching to no-till, Jennings has seen increased water holding capacity and better infiltration. He saves money on fuel and fertilizer. He saves time. His soil is healthier, and his yields are larger. Asked by a member of the audience how cover crops help soil maintain moisture, Jennings replied: “Imagine a wet towel lying on the ground. If you cover that towel with a blanket, the water won’t evaporate nearly as fast. Cover crops are an organic blanket that helps soil retain water.” Jennings encourages farmers interested in conservation to visit NRCS. “They helped me create a conservation plan for my land, and their financial assistance helped me get started by sharing the costs,” he said. “Also, the online Web Soil Survey is a great tool for learning about your soil. I use it all the time.” Jennings ended his presentation with this advice: “Don’t work the soil, let the soil work for you.” Mark Jennings plants sunflowers in corn residue on his North Dakota farm.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Florida in  Conservation  Aug 04,  Nancy Mims tests a batch of cheese. NRCS photo. John and Nancy Mims never imagined they would be running a dairy when they met at the University of Florida and married 40-some years ago.  He was going to be an architect and a pilot, and she was going to be a nurse. They were going to move to the Caribbean. But then John was drafted.  After a six-year stint in the Navy, Nancy’s father died, and they went home to help her mother on the dairy where Nancy grew up. They ended up buying the dairy in . It is a lifestyle the two have grown to love and they have worked with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service to protect their way of life. With the help of the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program they have put their land in a conservation easement, which provides compensation for relinquishing the development rights to the land and protecting it for agriculture, wildlife and the environment. The goal of this program is to help farmers and ranchers keep their land in agriculture. “We want it to remain a small family dairy and a wildlife refuge. Just last night we saw 22 deer and 52 turkeys out in the winter pasture,” John said. The Mims’ Rex Run Farm and Cypress Point Creamery is a few miles east of Gainesville, Fla., where some of their 200 prized brown Jerseys might be seen grazing in fields surrounded by small stands of cypress. For years John and Nancy have thought about making artisan cheeses and bottling their own milk. They made it a reality in . They approached learning how to make cheese methodically: visiting other cheese makers, training with a New England cheese maker and even tasting European cheeses to get an idea what kind of product they wanted to create. John and Nancy worked with expert Canadian cheese maker Margaret Morris, who helped them purchase supplies and equipment and shared recipes. They began with gouda and havarti, then added baby swiss and tomme. Making cheese turned out to be as much of an art as a science. Nancy makes small batches that must be tested through each step of the process because they are using raw milk. Local climate, molds, temperature, acidity level and cattle health can make or break a batch. Unlike big cheese companies, a customer may have to wait a while for an order. When making a new recipe, they first test it at farmer’s markets. If people like it, Nancy and John name it. The loblolly gets its name from the coarseness of the rind that resembles the tree’s bark.  A dry feta-like cheese is named Salty Dog after their dachshund. The two look forward to trying blue, feta and brie next. The newest flavors Cypress Point Creamery offer are a chocolate and cayenne pepper coated cheese, popular at the farmer’s markets.  Another favorite is rubbed with coffee and coconut oil. The word is out about Cypress Point Creamery cheeses. They are sought out by chefs from top hotels and restaurants.  But Nancy and John enjoy the customers they meet face-to-face at the Alachua County and Haile Village Plantation farmers markets because they tell them first-hand what they like and why. John refers to his free-stall barn where his cows stay as the “Rex Run Resort.” The open-sided barn gives the cows’ freedom to move around and space where they can sleep in clean sand beds. The stalls are outfitted with fans and misters that keep cows at least 20 degrees cooler than the outside temperature in the summer. “Happy cows make great cheese,” John said. Making cheese is not an easy job. John and Nancy typically put in a 12-to-16 hour day, seven days a week.  They employ three others who assist with milking, feeding and mechanical operations. The Mims raise brown Jerseys on their farm. NRCS photo.

"AMS Commodity Procurement Financial Analyst in  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Jan 08,  AMS Commodity Procurement Financial Analyst Keven Valentin talks about contracting opportunities through the AMS Commodity Procurement Program. In any business venture, the key to reaching a new market is starting with accurate and comprehensive information. For American agricultural producers and suppliers looking at USDA feeding programs as a potential market, having a clear understanding of the rules, regulations and requirements is the best start on the path to success. USDA encourages new businesses to participate by providing information through our websites, publications, and conferences. Recently, we attended Puerto Rico’s Market Expansion Conference to encourage new businesses to consider our programs. My agency, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), is part of a team of seven USDA agencies that attended this conference to strengthen Puerto Rico’s agriculture sector. From to , the number of farms on the island decreased by 30%, the amount of land being farmed decreased by 33% and the amount of livestock and poultry products sold dropped by nearly 19%. The agriculture sector also experienced a 33% reduction in hired workers. As a result, Puerto Rico is importing about 85% of its food, driving prices higher for residents. The goal of the conference is to try to reverse these trends. Working together, conference attendees plan to encourage producers and processors to participate in USDA programs, increase local fresh produce in school feeding programs, and strengthen the bond between the community and its farmers. I went to the conference to show Puerto Rican farmers and businesses that AMS commodity purchasing programs are a viable market for their products. Last year, the AMS Commodity Procurement Staff purchased nearly $1.6 billion of food from our nation’s producers. These purchases supported USDA feeding programs like the National School Lunch Program. By informing Puerto Rican businesses about the federal procurement processes and how to become approved vendors, we will set them up to compete for contracts to supply one of 250 foods offered in our programs. It appears that the Market Expansion Conference is making a difference. Since the inaugural event in , the island’s local producers have increased business with its schools. There has also been an increase in the number of jobs in the agriculture sector. This progress is especially exciting for me—a graduate of the University of Puerto Rico at Aguadilla who hopes to see even more economic opportunities created for the island. I had the pleasure of hearing first-hand what USDA’s programs mean to the island’s producers and businesses. During my presentation, one of the conference attendees thanked me for assisting him during a phone call several months ago. He told the audience that, because of my help he is now one step closer to becoming an approved vendor. It is gratifying to know that I may have opened a door for his business. While it may seem small, each new opportunity strengthens the island’s economy and helps to decrease an unemployment rate that hovers around 16%. AMS is committed to supporting our nation’s producers in Puerto Rico and the rest of the country. Through this and other events like the upcoming Industry Meeting, we maintain a continuous dialog about our commodity purchasing programs with vendors, industry organizations and other stakeholders. Together, we will continue to create opportunities for American agricultural producers. The Market Expansion Conference enabled attendees to hear from a panel of experts. Since the inaugural Market Expansion Conference, the island’s local producers have increased business with its schools.

"Biotechnology Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Agricultural Biotechnology? Agricultural biotechnology is a range of tools, including traditional breeding techniques, that alter living organisms, or parts of organisms, to make or modify products; improve plants or animals; or develop microorganisms for specific agricultural uses. Modern biotechnology today includes the tools of genetic engineering. 2. How is Agricultural Biotechnology being used? Biotechnology provides farmers with tools that can make production cheaper and more manageable. For example, some biotechnology crops can be engineered to tolerate specific herbicides, which make weed control simpler and more efficient. Other crops have been engineered to be resistant to specific plant diseases and insect pests, which can make pest control more reliable and effective, and/or can decrease the use of synthetic pesticides. These crop production options can help countries keep pace with demands for food while reducing production costs. A number of biotechnology-derived crops that have been deregulated by the USDA and reviewed for food safety by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have been adopted by growers. Many other types of crops are now in the research and development stages. While it is not possible to know exactly which will come to fruition, certainly biotechnology will have highly varied uses for agriculture in the future. Advances in biotechnology may provide consumers with foods that are nutritionally-enriched or longer-lasting, or that contain lower levels of certain naturally occurring toxicants present in some food plants. Developers are using biotechnology to try to reduce saturated fats in cooking oils, reduce allergens in foods, and increase disease-fighting nutrients in foods. They are also researching ways to use genetically engineered crops in the production of new medicines, which may lead to a new plant-made pharmaceutical industry that could reduce the costs of production using a sustainable resource. Genetically engineered plants are also being developed for a purpose known as phytoremediation in which the plants detoxify pollutants in the soil or absorb and accumulate polluting substances out of the soil so that the plants may be harvested and disposed of safely. In either case the result is improved soil quality at a polluted site. Biotechnology may also be used to conserve natural resources, enable animals to more effectively use nutrients present in feed, decrease nutrient runoff into rivers and bays, and help meet the increasing world food and land demands. Researchers are at work to produce hardier crops that will flourish in even the harshest environments and that will require less fuel, labor, fertilizer, and water, helping to decrease the pressures on land and wildlife habitats. In addition to genetically engineered crops, biotechnology has helped make other improvements in agriculture not involving plants. Examples of such advances include making antibiotic production more efficient through microbial fermentation and producing new animal vaccines through genetic engineering for diseases such as foot and mouth disease and rabies. 3. What are the benefits of Agricultural Biotechnology? The application of biotechnology in agriculture has resulted in benefits to farmers, producers, and consumers. Biotechnology has helped to make both insect pest control and weed management safer and easier while safeguarding crops against disease. For example, genetically engineered insect-resistant cotton has allowed for a significant reduction in the use of persistent, synthetic pesticides that may contaminate groundwater and the environment. In terms of improved weed control, herbicide-tolerant soybeans, cotton, and corn enable the use of reduced-risk herbicides that break down more quickly in soil and are non-toxic to wildlife and humans. Herbicide-tolerant crops are particularly compatible with no-till or reduced tillage agriculture systems that help preserve topsoil from erosion. Agricultural biotechnology has been used to protect crops from devastating diseases. The papaya ringspot virus threatened to derail the Hawaiian papaya industry until papayas resistant to the disease were developed through genetic engineering. This saved the U.S. papaya industry. Research on potatoes, squash, tomatoes, and other crops continues in a similar manner to provide resistance to viral diseases that otherwise are very difficult to control. Biotech crops can make farming more profitable by increasing crop quality and may in some cases increase yields. The use of some of these crops can simplify work and improve safety for farmers. This allows farmers to spend less of their time managing their crops and more time on other profitable activities. Biotech crops may provide enhanced quality traits such as increased levels of beta-carotene in rice to aid in reducing vitamin A deficiencies and improved oil compositions in canola, soybean, and corn. Crops with the ability to grow in salty soils or better withstand drought conditions are also in the works and the first such products are just entering the marketplace. Such innovations may be increasingly important in adapting to or in some cases helping to mitigate the effects of climate change. The tools of agricultural biotechnology have been invaluable for researchers in helping to understand the basic biology of living organisms. For example, scientists have identified the complete genetic structure of several strains of Listeria and Campylobacter, the bacteria often responsible for major outbreaks of food-borne illness in people. This genetic information is providing a wealth of opportunities that help researchers improve the safety of our food supply. The tools of biotechnology have ""unlocked doors"" and are also helping in the development of improved animal and plant varieties, both those produced by conventional means as well as those produced through genetic engineering. 4. What are the safety considerations with Agricultural Biotechnology? Breeders have been evaluating new products developed through agricultural biotechnology for centuries. In addition to these efforts, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) work to ensure that crops produced through genetic engineering for commercial use are properly tested and studied to make sure they pose no significant risk to consumers or the environment. Crops produced through genetic engineering are the only ones formally reviewed to assess the potential for transfer of novel traits to wild relatives. When new traits are genetically engineered into a crop, the new plants are evaluated to ensure that they do not have characteristics of weeds. Where biotech crops are grown in proximity to related plants, the potential for the two plants to exchange traits via pollen must be evaluated before release. Crop plants of all kinds can exchange traits with their close wild relatives (which may be weeds or wildflowers) when they are in proximity. In the case of biotech-derived crops, the EPA and USDA perform risk assessments to evaluate this possibility and minimize potential harmful consequences, if any. Other potential risks considered in the assessment of genetically engineered organisms include environmental effects on birds, mammals, insects, worms, and other organisms, especially in the case of insect or disease resistance traits. This is why the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the EPA review environmental impacts of such pest-resistant biotechnology derived crops prior to approval of field-testing and commercial release. Testing on many types of organisms such as honeybees, other beneficial insects, earthworms, and fish is performed to ensure that there are no unintended consequences associated with these crops. With respect to food safety, when new traits introduced to biotech-derived plants are examined by the EPA and the FDA, the proteins produced by these traits are studied for their potential toxicity and potential to cause an allergic response. Tests designed to examine the heat and digestive stability of these proteins, as well as their similarity to known allergenic proteins, are completed prior to entry into the food or feed supply. To put these considerations in perspective, it is useful to note that while the particular biotech traits being used are often new to crops in that they often do not come from plants (many are from bacteria and viruses), the same basic types of traits often can be found naturally in most plants. These basic traits, like insect and disease resistance, have allowed plants to survive and evolve over time. 5. How widely used are biotechnology crops? According to the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), biotechnology plantings as a percentage of total crop plantings in the United States in were about 88 percent for corn, 94 percent for cotton, and 93 percent for soybeans. NASS conducts an agricultural survey in all states in June of each year. The report issued from the survey contains a section specific to the major biotechnology derived field crops and provides additional detail on biotechnology plantings. The most recent report may be viewed at the following website: www.ers.usda.gov/-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us.aspx For a summary of these , see the USDA Economic Research Service feature at: www.ers.usda.gov/-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us.aspx The USDA does not maintain on international usage of genetically engineered crops. The independent International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), a not-for-profit organization, estimates that the global area of biotech crops for was 170.3 million hectares, grown by 17.3 million farmers in 28 countries, with an average annual growth in area cultivated of around 6 percent. More than 90 percent of farmers growing biotech crops are resource-poor farmers in developing countries. ISAAA various statistics on the global adoption and plantings of biotechnology derived crops. The ISAAA website is www.isaaa.org 6. What are the roles of government in agricultural biotechnology? Please note: These descriptions are not a complete or thorough review of all the activities of these agencies with respect to agricultural biotechnology and are intended as general introductory materials only. For additional information please see the relevant agency websites. Regulatory The Federal Government developed a Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology in to provide for the regulatory oversight of organisms derived through genetic engineering. The three principal agencies that have provided primary guidance on the experimental testing, approval, and eventual commercial release of these organisms to date are the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Department of Health and Human Services' Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The approach taken in the Coordinated Framework is grounded in the judgment of the National Academy of Sciences that the potential risks associated with these organisms fall into the same general categories as those created by traditionally bred organisms. Products are regulated according to their intended use, with some products being regulated under more than one agency. All government regulatory agencies have a responsibility to ensure that the implementation of regulatory decisions, including approval of field tests and eventual deregulation of approved biotech crops, does not adversely impact human health or the environment. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is responsible for protecting U.S. agriculture from pests and diseases. APHIS regulations provide procedures for obtaining a permit or for providing notification prior to ""introducing"" (the act of introducing includes any movement into or through the U.S., or release into the environment outside an area of physical confinement) a regulated genetically engineered organism in the U.S. For more information on the regulatory responsibilities of the FDA, the EPA and APHIS visit usbiotechnologyregulation.mrp.usda.gov.","There are six questions in this text about agricultural biotechnology.

"Perennial Grains are Getting Bigger  President Obama stressed the importance of innovation in his State of the Union address – and reminded us, “We do big things.”  Wes Jackson, who lent USDA the banner pictured here, founded The Land Institute around the “big idea” of using nature as a model for agriculture, including perennial grain crops whose deep roots hold soil in place and take up water and nutrients year-round, rather than the more typical annual grains that produce a big harvest and then die each year.  But perennial grains generally lack big seeds and high yields, and it has been difficult to breed grains that are both perennial and high-yielding.

"Breakfast – Making a Big Difference in Milwaukee  There is much we adults can learn from children, and one of them is being able to appreciate the simple things. I was at the Milwaukee Sign Language School in Milwaukee for a celebration of School Breakfast Week. I was thrilled by the students’ delight as Active Apple (Milwaukee Public Schools’ nutrition and fitness mascot) and Power Panther (USDA’s nutrition and fitness mascot) strolled into their classrooms. The hearing-impaired students watched with rapt attention as their teachers signed to them about the mascots and special guests.  All the children seemed thrilled with the Active Apple pins and bookmarks the special guests distributed to them. Best of all, they clearly liked the calming routine of picking up their breakfast bags and eating at their desks.

". Janey Thornton in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Nov 05,  FNCS Deputy Under Secretary Dr. Janey Thornton eats lunch with Grenada Upper Elementary School Students after their school was awarded the HealthierUS School Challenge Gold Award, Grenada, Miss., Nov 3. Recently, I had the privilege of visiting Northern Mississippi to recognize two schools for meeting USDA’s HealthierUS School Challenge (HUSSC). I stopped at Pope Elementary/Junior High School in Pope, Miss. and met with and congratulated the cafeteria and other staff for achieving a Bronze Award.  I then traveled to Grenada Upper Elementary School in Grenada, Miss., for an assembly where I recognized the school for earning a Gold Award. I was impressed with these two schools for achieving the HUSSC Awards, but was also impressed by the way the schools were innovative at educating the children about agriculture and where food comes from with the use of a garden and an on-campus green house. Grenada Upper Elementary School even raises funds for the school’s programs through selling the plants they grow in their on-campus green house instead of selling sugary snacks. Again this benefit is two-fold – students are learning about healthy food choices and they are learning important lessons about where their food comes from and the hard work that goes in to producing a safe and reliable food supply. Also of note was Grenada’s physical education program that gets the children moving in a fun way, twice a day, which falls in line with First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! initiative to end childhood obesity within a generation.  We cannot understate the importance of physical activity because our efforts to combat hunger and obesity must also include encouraging our children to get out and get some exercise. As I have traveled around the country in promotion of the HUSSC I have seen so many unique and innovative examples of what schools can do to achieve award status.  And these awards are one of the highest honors a school nutrition program can achieve and reflects a strong commitment to provide students with additional healthy food options throughout the school campus, and to emphasize nutrition education and physical activity in the school curriculum. These two Mississippi schools have set a high standard of excellence for others to follow.  I’m thankful to all who helped make these achievements possible—they are making a positive difference in the lives of our nation’s children. With the help of these Mississippi schools, we are making progress.

"USDA Michigan Public Information Officer in  Rural  Oct 12,   USDA Rural Development Michigan State Director James Turner joined Senator Debbie Stabenow and local officials this summer in celebrating the opening of the largest commercial-scale anaerobic digester in the United States. The Fremont Community Digester is an ambitious new use of a proven technology.  Once used chiefly in farms, anaerobic digesters are now coming into their own. The facility will convert organic waste products – such as farm and food waste – and process it into biogas.  Approximately 1,500 local families will derive their power from this previously untapped energy source. Just as importantly, the digester will greatly reduce pollution.  As NOVI Energy President Anand Gangadharan noted during his remarks, the bacteria colonies within the tanks are voraciously hungry and can process more than 100,000 tons of waste. The byproducts of this process can be used for fertilizer, soil amendments and cow bedding. USDA provided a $12,825,000 Rural Development loan guarantee to finance the project, which has a total cost of $22 million. Anaerobic digesters are in concert with an agreement with U.S. dairy producers signed by the Secretary in Copenhagen, Denmark in to accelerate adoption of innovative manure to energy projects on American dairy farms. The agreement represents a dynamic public/private partnership and is another demonstration of the Obama Administration's commitment to curb the emissions of greenhouse gases.

Pictured left to right, Dr. Rhoda Burrows and Chris Zdorovtsov, SDSU Extension; and State Director Meeks. The second annual South Dakota Local Foods Conference was held recently to continue the dialogue on local foods among producers, consumers, farmer’s markets, retailers, schools and others.  The conference provided attendees from across the state two days of breakout sessions, networking, and instruction. USDA Rural Development State Director, Elsie Meeks attended the conference, taking the opportunity to award South Dakota State University (SDSU) Extension a Rural Business Opportunity Grant of $50,000.  The Rural Development funds will be used to build capacity in South Dakota’s local food system through the establishment of an online Local Foods Center which will create structured connections between local growers and resource providers. “The online Local Foods Center and Local Foods conference are examples of how USDA Rural Development is dedicated to supporting economic growth in rural areas.  It has been a USDA-wide focus to provide resources and support to American farmers and ranchers,” said Meeks.  “Supporting local and regional food systems provides an economic boost to rural communities in South Dakota.” An example of locally produced food served to attendees at the South Dakota Local Foods Conference. The first day of the conference focused on production of specialty crops with sessions on herbicide drift, marketing of food, insect pest management and winemaking. The second day of the conference began with Diana Endicott, founder and director of Good Natured Family Farms' Alliance in Kansas. Endicott gave an overview of the Alliance's collaboration model with a supermarket chain, highlighting aspects of the system, including production, processing, distribution and marketing strategies. Other topics at the Local Foods Conference included fruit and vegetable consumption; regulations facing specialty crop producers; business planning; Farm to School; social media; farmers' markets; local foods on Native American reservations; and preservation of specialty foods. Attendees enjoyed locally grown foods provided at the breaks and luncheon. “Consumers in South Dakota want to know where their food comes from. We've found that producers are excited to share their food and their story with their customers,” said Alison Kiesz of the South Dakota Department of Agriculture. “This conference was a great way to bring everyone together to promote local foods in South Dakota.” The conference was a collaborative effort of the South Dakota Department of Agriculture, SDSU Extension Service, USDA Rural Development, Dakota Rural Action, Buy Fresh Buy Local South Dakota and the South Dakota Specialty Producers Association.

"Women Partners Power Innovation in Nutrition Assistance in the Midwest  Last summer I witnessed an amazing group of partners – the majority women, coincidentally - making a big difference in the lives of those who suffer from hunger. It all started with USDA’s effort to expand the availability of wireless technology at farmers markets not currently accepting SNAP benefits. It’s sometimes difficult for markets to accept SNAP, because they need Electronic Benefit Transfer equipment and electricity to process benefits from the card. The funding can be used to help markets purchase the processing equipment, and to pay for wireless service so the equipment can be used without a power source. This is really exciting because it means more SNAP participants can access fresh, affordable and local produce and more American farmers can expand their client base.

"USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Food Safety in  Health and Safety  USDA Results  Jul 05,  In nearly eight years, the federal government has spurred a remarkable rise in consumer knowledge. July is the height of summer grilling season and throughout the month USDA is highlighting changes made to the U.S. food safety system over the course of this Administration. For an interactive look at USDA’s work to ensure your food is safe, visit the USDA Results project on Medium.com and read Chapter Seven: Safer Food and Greater Consumer Confidence. By the time this blog posts today, most readers will have already enjoyed at least one meal. Over their breakfast—fresh fruit, a bacon and egg sandwich, or maybe a grab-n-go energy bar—Americans were probably thinking about all the tasks that meal would fuel them to do for the day, and not whether their food could make them ill. But a strong and diligent network of public servants at the federal, state and local levels were thinking about how to protect you from foodborne illness over their breakfasts this morning, and they’re still thinking about it now. Their job day in and day out is to make sure the food on America’s tables—including yours and theirs—is safe to eat. They are the best in the world at what they do, and they’re constantly getting better. I have proudly been a part of this team since , when I accepted a job with USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) as an inspector in a Dalhart, Texas beef facility. FSIS is the federal agency charged with ensuring the safety of America’s meat, poultry and processed egg supply, and we work hand in hand with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as state and local departments of health and agriculture. Over the years, I worked my way up from that entry level position in Dalhart, to managing FSIS' Dallas District, to eventually managing the entire agency as Administrator. In my nearly 40-year career, I have seen major changes in the U.S. food safety system. When I first began as a food inspector, because of the tools available to us and our understanding of what caused foodborne illness at the time, FSIS relied almost exclusively on visual inspection of animals, products, and plant operations.  With experience and better technology, our focus as an agency has shifted. Today, we're able to prevent invisible hazards, such as bacterial and chemical contamination. Under the Obama Administration, the U.S. food safety system has seen some of the most significant updates since the s, adopting a risk-based, -driven approach to prevent foodborne problems, rather than reacting after something goes wrong. At FSIS, we have accomplished this in the form of tighter and more strategic food safety requirements for food companies, enhanced consumer engagement, and smart innovations to our internal processes. In the past seven years, we’ve adopted a zero-tolerance policy for six dangerous strains of E. coli. We’ve instituted several improvements to poultry inspections that together are expected to reduce Salmonella and Campylobacter illnesses by 67,000 per year. We’ve prevented tons of mislabeled food from entering commerce, and worked with companies to tighten their labeling protocols. And above all, we’ve moved the needle on foodborne illness, watching cases attributed to USDA-regulated product drop by 12 percent. All of this is possible because every day, 7,500 food safety inspection personnel go to work in more than 6,000 regulated food facilities and 122 ports of entry, where last year they inspected 145 million hogs and cattle, and 9 billion chickens and turkeys, verifying that FSIS regulatory requirements are met. Another 2,000 food safety professionals go to work in three public health laboratories, 10 district offices, and our headquarters office. These employees run test results, dispatch outbreak investigators, and unpack to reveal telling trends and inform proactive, prevention-based policies that will lead to safer food and fewer illnesses. Today, USDA is highlighting their work, and that of partners outside of FSIS, in the newest chapter of our Results project at  Because their jobs are done largely behind the scenes – at laboratories, alongside private employees in food processing facilities, and sometimes undercover—you may be surprised at the scrutiny given your favorite food products. I encourage you to visit our new chapter to see what we’re doing, and know that we will only continue to improve.

"Mudding On National Forests Is Illegal and Destructive  Mudders, take note: It is against the law to tear up forest roads and meadows for fun, and the legal and financial consequences can be steep. Tearing up high-country meadows with four-wheel-drive and off-road vehicles destroys wildlife habitat and ecosystems.

"Deputy Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics in  Rural  Research and Science  Apr 04,   Recently, I visited Tohono O’odham Community College, in Sells, AZ, one of the tribal colleges that the Department of Agriculture supports around the country to level the playing field and open the doors of higher education to more young people. The Tohono O’odham or “Desert People” live in the Sonoran Desert on tribal lands in the southern part of the state, bordering Mexico. The terrain is flat, dry desert and presents numerous agricultural challenges that USDA helps students address through research and hands-on training, teaching traditional scientific disciplines – but through the lens of the tribe’s needs and culture. The college is doing a lot of work to keep their tribal language alive, providing language classes for all students. But science professor Dr. Teresa Newberry has taken that to a whole new level by building a Web-based database of plants that is built in three languages: English, Latin and Tohono O’odham. It’s the kind of project that integrates the native culture into learning in a practical, living way. They’re also looking for ways to guarantee they’ll always be able to grow their traditional foods even in the hotter and drier climate that may lie ahead. Faculty and staff are gathering over 30 different varieties of tepary bean and working with the NRCS plant material center, propagating these varieties so they can be planted out in the field. This is a real example of connecting traditional knowledge, science and providing options to adapt to a changing climate. In another study funded by USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture, students from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell are working with Tohono O’odham students and local plumbers, electricians, and others from the reservation to build a house that is totally powered by solar energy. The house has been a great success, proving to be so energy-efficient that it’s feeding energy back to the grid. Students at Tohono O’odham Community College are happy that they have an option to get an education in science, and in other professions that affect agriculture, right there at home and can take the skills they learn back to their community to help solve local problems. My visit to Tohono O’odham Community College was a good reminder of how our work at USDA is really woven into the fabric of the communities we serve. It also showed me how valuable it is to enhance the culture that exists in every corner of the country we touch with the advanced education, training and research support that USDA offers every day.

"USDA Rural Development-Iowa in  Initiatives  Rural  Aug 18,  Left to right, Bill Menner, State Director in Iowa; Congressman Leonard Boswell and Administrator Canales. Canales was in Iowa to discuss business development issues.  “Today the conversations I have with my business colleagues, family and friends are focused around the best ways to rebuilding the U.S. economy,” said Jerry Lorenzen, President of World Food Processing, in his opening remarks at a public event at his company’s headquarters in Oskaloosa, Iowa, last week. One of Lorenzen’s top concerns, like many Americans, has been how to stimulate the economy now and how to strengthen it for the future.  Lorenzen believes that the way to build long-term growth is to ignite the manufacturing sector and he isn’t the only one who feels this way. President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) of into law with a vision of knowing it will help America.  One part of this act is to help businesses with startup, expansion and refinance costs to ensure businesses will continue to flourish despite the recession. USDA Rural Development was tasked with investing $1.6 billion in Recovery Act guaranteed loan funds to support local economic development. More than $80 million of that has come to help Iowa businesses. On August 11, federal, state and local leaders, including Congressman Leonard Boswell, attended a funding event at World Food Processing to congratulate them on an $8 million loan guarantee to accommodate the company’s growth into the food ingredient market. Since the company’s founding in , World Food Processing has gone a long way to fulfilling the company’s mission of being the premier supplier of non-genetically modified organism (GMO) food ingredients in the world.  The company contracts with farmers to grow non-GMO and organic food grade soybeans, yellow peas and other identity-preserved grains.  The quality and quantity of nutrients contained in soybeans makes them an excellent food base for many different countries and a variety of different foods and food ingredients. USDA Rural Development has worked with World Food Processing’s lenders during the past 10 years to help build and equip facilities and provide working capital.  This has assisted the company in broadening their capabilities and reach to provide a healthier food source to countries around the world. “USDA Rural Development is pleased to have such a long relationship with World Food Processing,” said Judith Canales, USDA Rural Development’s Business Programs Administrator.  “The company’s success has been made possible, in part, through the formation of local, state and federal partnerships, along with strategic private-sector business relationships. We also want to thank Bank Iowa for their participation in this loan guarantee,” Canales said. “One of our agency’s key roles is to assist lenders in their efforts to invest in our local communities.  Our business and industry guaranteed loan fund is a great way to make this happen.”  Category/Topic:  Initiatives  Rural  Tags:  ARRA  Judith Canales  Rural develoment","What role does USDA Rural Development play in supporting local economic development through initiatives such as guaranteed loan funds, particularly in the context of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act?","USDA Rural Development invests $1.6 billion in Recovery Act guaranteed loan funds to support local economic development, providing over $80 million for Iowa businesses, including World Food Processing's $8 million loan guarantee, to stimulate growth and strengthen the economy."

"Posted by Dennis O'Brien, Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service in  Animals  Plants  Research and Science  USDA Results  May 25,  Goldenrod pollen is a key protein source for honey bees in the fall. Photo by David C. Smith, Williams College All this month we will be taking a look at what a changing climate means to Agriculture. The ten regional USDA Climate Hubs were established to synthesize and translate climate science and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers who are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA's Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate. Honey bee health and climate change would both rank high on anyone’s list of hot topics in agriculture these days. Lewis H. Ziska, an Agricultural Research Service (ARS) plant physiologist, with what is part of the Northeast Climate Hub in Beltsville, Maryland, knows this. He also knows that any study involving both honey bees and climate change should be carefully conducted and cautiously interpreted.  Ziska has been studying the effects of climate change on plants since . He has been focusing on how rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels accompanying climate change are affecting a wide range of plants—from important food crops to noxious weeds. So Ziska and his colleagues were extremely thorough in their analysis of how rising CO2 levels are affecting the pollen of Canada goldenrod (Solidago Canadensis), the most widespread source of fall protein for honey bees. It’s considered crucial in helping honey bees survive through winter. To confirm the honey bees’ fall feeding habits, the researchers went out to a field in the Berkshires, identified the number of goldenrod plants there, and then counted honey bee “visits” to each plant. To mimic the effects of climate change over the past 150 years, they exposed goldenrod growing in chambers of undisturbed soil in Texas to graduated levels of CO2. To get an historical perspective, they analyzed goldenrod pollen from across the United States collected as far back as and stored at the National Museum of Natural History. Study results showed that the pollen protein levels have declined by up to a third since the s, when atmospheric CO2 levels began rising, and that the most serious declines have occurred since , when CO2 levels began rising dramatically. It was the first study to document the effects of rising CO2 levels on honey bee diets. The results appeared in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Scientists say the results are consistent with the rules of basic plant biology. Plants exposed to higher CO2 levels produce more starch and sugar but less protein. Scientists have consistently found the same trend—diminished protein content with increased CO2 levels—in studies of human food crops. In fact, it is precisely the trend in food crops that prompted Ziska to conduct his study. But there could be a silver lining. The results may help scientists address increases in mortality rates in managed honey bee colonies by coming up with ways to improve diets and ensure that the bees get sufficient protein in the fall to survive through winter. Ziska also is working with other scientists on ways to adapt food crops, such as wheat and rice, to climate change by using traditional breeding techniques to tap into the genes that make their wild, weedy relatives more adaptable to rising CO2 levels. “We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I think people are more aware of the challenges being presented by climate change, and that’s an important step,” he said.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Illinois in  Conservation  Initiatives  Oct 28,  Students and teachers at Ready School, Prosperity Garden’s staff and volunteers tend the gardens to provide fresh produce to the surrounding community. On a small parcel of land in the heart of the City of Champaign, Illinois, are two gardens that offer opportunities for neighbors and the community to learn about growing food, eating nutritious food and earning a living. The Prosperity Gardens are educational, bringing at-risk students to work the ground, grow the plants and sell the produce at local farmer’s markets. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) was able to help support this important endeavor through The People’s Garden, USDA’s collaborative community garden initiative with more than 1,300 local and national organizations all working together to establish community and school gardens across the country. Nicole Bridges, University of Illinois Extension Service employee and local Garden Programmer, oversees the activities at the Prosperity Gardens and has been instrumental in gaining neighbor and community support. Bridges did a lot of research when she first started with the garden. She attended local meetings to become familiar with the people who live there and listened when they said, “Our youth need jobs.” Nicole Bridges, garden programmer, sits next to one of the many garden beds. Working with a friend from the Ready School, a school for at-risk high school students, a plan was created to get students to the garden as a class project and then, “The project just exploded,” said Bridges. Josephine Tritsch, Instructor and Program Coordinator at Ready School, teaches agricultural classes and is expanding the curriculum to include business classes. “I am teaching agribusiness this fall, which includes selling vegetables to staff and harvesting for the cafeteria in our nascent Farm2School program,” Tritsch explained. “Class content includes marketing, grain and vegetable production, national and international ag practices, and so forth, through guided team projects and the use of Google apps.” Next spring, Tritsch plans to teach a horticulture class and will co-teach classes in job skills and nutrition. The students worked in the garden and sold their produce at markets during the summer and early fall. Tritsch said, “The community seemed to enjoy buying from us at both the downtown Champaign market and through our Mobile Market program.” The Prosperity Gardens staff is also starting a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) option to be managed by students. In addition to the garden contributing agricultural education and business aspects year-round, during the summer the garden serves as a job site. With the help of Master Gardeners and volunteers, the Prosperity Gardens hosted children from the Boys and Girls Club, who call their group the “Garden Club,” for nine weeks in the summer. Each student, ranging from six-to-eight years old, had their own plot about two-foot square. They planted a bean and watched it grow. “Each student takes ownership of their plot to understand what is happening during the growing season,” said Bridges. “They learn about bugs, both good and bad.” They also learn about different types of soil and other science facts. The beds were color coordinated and contained “garden maps,” that helped students understand what plants look like from garden to plate. There was a sensory garden full of herbs to stimulate more of their senses and they learned about nutrition. “We have kid-friendly knives and they learn how to peel carrots and chop celery, peppers and herbs,” said Bridges. “So each week, they learn to pick, wash and prepare their snack, like toasted wheat bagels and they made the veggie cream cheese.” Some children have been coming for three years and now mentor the younger ones. Bridges’ goal for these neighborhood gardens is to close the gap between the older generation and younger generation. “The garden club does just that – it gets these kids at a young age and reintroduces a traditional way of life.” The rest of the planting beds, including a lot across the street, are for the students to grow, harvest and sell a wide variety of produce that neighbors could enjoy. “They grew produce that is culturally relevant with the neighborhood taste, such as collards, green beans, okra, jalapeno peppers, and other items that people in the community enjoy,” said Bridges. The Prosperity Gardens are a non-profit and they have received donations and grants from local businesses, hospitals, a church and the University of Illinois Extension Service. “With NRCS’ contributions we purchased items we’ve needed for some time,” said Bridges. They were able to purchase produce crates for harvesting, storing and use at the market. “They sanitize well, collapse for storage, and have made us more productive where we meet agriculture food safety requirements to attend the farmers markets,” she adds. They currently lease the two garden lots from the city. A new grant will help build a wash and pack facility and they are searching for another acre of city land to house that facility and potentially install high tunnels to extend the growing season. Bridge’s goal is to establish the city’s first commercial urban farm. Currently the gardens are split between education, nutrition, and marketing the produce. Once the farm and facility is built and functioning, the current gardens will be dedicated to education. The future hope for Prosperity Gardens is to expand the Farm2School Program and include other youth organizations. “The Boys and Girls Club would like to expand their program beyond the six-to-eight-year-olds as well, making it a great place to learn and have fun,” said Bridges.

"Kentucky Rural Development State Director in  Coronavirus  Rural  Technology  Apr 01,  A 3D printer is adjusted by a technician at Somerset Community College as they print personal protective equipment in response to the lack of safety gear for medical professionals. Photo courtesy Somerset Community College. As Kentucky does its best to battle the spread of COVID-19, state officials and medical providers have been looking for ways to answer the increasing need for medical personal protective equipment. One of those responding in a big way here in Kentucky is a somewhat unlikely source: Somerset Community College. Somerset Community College was the first higher education institution in Kentucky to offer a statewide certificate in additive manufacturing, also called 3D printing, and thanks to the passion of Additive Manufacturing Professor Eric Wooldridge and Rural Business Development Grants in both fiscal year and , the program has earned a reputation as a leader in the state in 3D printing education and technical assistance. Here in Kentucky, parts manufacturers in both the aircraft and automobile industries are big employers, and additive manufacturing–and the associated jobs–is growing across those as well as many other industries because it has a number of advantages over traditional manufacturing. Eric told me one of those is the ability to quickly transition between products. In fact, it only took a few hours to go from printing student projects to printing and assembling the first face shield prototypes, and when there was a requested design change, an updated prototype was ready in less than 20 minutes with finished versions coming out within the hour. Now that they have a finalized design, they are printing and assembling over 100 face shields per hour. Eric, who is basically living out of his office to continue the process 24/7 with the help of some rotating staff members, said they’ve also shared the specifications with networked additive manufacturers so they could also begin production. This rapid response to a supply chain shortcoming is just another advantage of additive manufacturing. “We couldn’t be doing this without the support of the National Science Foundation and Rural Development,” Wooldridge told me. “NSF and Rural Development grants were essential in getting the equipment and materials and training people how to use it all.” At Rural Development, our mission is to improve the economy and way of life in rural America, and partners like Somerset Community College remind me there are good stories like this all across this great country. Time and again, when America is united in attaining a common goal, we band together, and that is part and parcel to rural culture. Whether it’s family helping family or neighbor helping neighbor, rural America knows that together, America prospers. Partially completed faceshields await assembly at Somerset Community College’s Additive Manufacturing workshop. Photo courtesy Somerset Community College.

"Market and Trade Economics Division, Economic Research Service in  Research and Science  Aug 20,   In , 19.3 percent of the 3.8 billion people in 76 low- and middle-income countries are projected to be food insecure, meaning they do not have access to sufficient food for an active and healthy lifestyle. By , their food security situation is projected to improve, leaving 9.2 percent food insecure (assuming rising per-capita incomes, stable or declining food prices, and no new major crises). USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) recently released the annual International Food Security Assessment -, in which they assess the food security status and outlook for 76 low- and middle-income countries that are former or current food aid recipients. This report presents the number of food-insecure people, the share of the population that is food insecure, and the food gap projected for and based on projected food price and income changes. The ERS food security indicators are forward-looking and provide a measure of expected progress in food security. The share of populations experiencing food insecurity is not spread evenly across the regions and countries included in the study. Projections of food insecurity in the 22 Asian and 11 Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries show it is relatively low at 13.9 and 17.4 percent compared to Sub-Saharan Africa’s (SSA) 35.3 percent. This regional disparity is projected to widen by . Sub-Saharan Africa, while expected to improve, is still projected to have 22.5 percent of its population classified as food insecure. The share of populations that are food insecure is projected to improve, but with widening regional disparity across the four regions studied Projections for 76 low- and middle-income countries show that food insecure people in is relatively low in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) compared to 35.3 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This disparity is projected to widen into when Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to improve but still have 22.5 percent of its population classified as food insecure. Photo credit: USDA, Economic Research Service based on results from the International Food Security Assessment model Several countries are projected to not make significant progress in their food security situation. For these countries, income growth prospects are poor, and food prices are expected to remain relatively high due to ongoing armed conflicts or recent devastation from natural disasters, which tend to displace a large portion of the population and disrupt economic and agricultural activities. This results in limited access to food and increased food insecurity. For example, most of Yemen remains food insecure, and repeated port closures hinder food imports. Over half the populations in Central Africa and parts of East Africa are projected to be food insecure in , following years of civil conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.

"Eastern Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Conservation  May 05,  Birdseye (Hiawatha) Bird’s-eye primrose (Primula misstassincia) is found on the Hiawatha National Forest’s Pointe Aux Chenes Natural Area. It is the only true primrose native to the region with concentrations found near the shores of the Great Lakes. Inland, it is found in local fens, calcareous banks and sandstone cliffs. (U.S. Forest Service/Sara Davis) Hyacinth (Hoosier) The wild hyacinth are native perennial wildflowers that love full sun to slight shade and moist, rich soil. (U.S. Forest Service) Walking along the peaceful Hunter Creek Road in the Charles C. Deam Wilderness, in the Hoosier National Forest, you catch a glimpse of beautiful periwinkle flowers swaying in the warm spring air. A short hike uphill and you are immersed in the full bloom of wild hyacinth, along with other delightful wildflowers such as twinleaf and trout lily.  While getting caught up in the beauty and serenity of this colorful scene, you may observe a white-tailed deer, raccoon, fox squirrel, red-shouldered hawk or scarlet tanager. This enchanted corner of the Hoosier National Forest is its only congressionally designated wilderness. It boasts plentiful spring flora thanks to its proximity to a geologic feature known as the Mount Carmel Fault. And, this is just one of 82 Wildflower Viewing Areas in the Forest Service’s Eastern Region Beyond their aesthetic beauty, wildflowers support entire ecosystems for butterflies, birds and small animals by providing a source of seeds, nectar and pollen for their food supply and life support system. Wildflowers and native plants also help conserve water, reduce mowing costs, protect the soil from erosion and provide habitat for wildlife.  Many wildflowers are in danger from habitat loss caused by plants that are not indigenous to an area. These invasive plants or non-native plants grow aggressively and compete for resources, often causing great harm and even destruction to native plants.  You can help protect native wildflowers by volunteering for an invasive plant removal project on a national forest or grassland in your area.  Trillium (Alleghany) Trilliums prefer the filtered light of a maturing forest. National forests and grasslands are great wildflower viewing destinations spring, summer and fall.

"USDA NASS Intern in  Equity  Research and Science  Sep 15,  As we enter Hispanic Heritage Month (Sept. 15-Oct.15), we acknowledge and appreciate the contributions the U.S. Hispanic community has made to advance our economic and agricultural growth. According to the Census of Agriculture, there were 112,451 Hispanic producers (, 1.3 ) in the United States. The Prieto family, who migrated from Mexico, runs one of the nation’s 86,278 Hispanic-operated farms in Somis, Calif. They specialize in growing Hass avocados and Meyer lemons in their orchards. California has a total of 14,597 Hispanic producers and is the second top state for Hispanic producers (Texas being the first with 41,143 Hispanic producers). Between and the previous Census of Agriculture in , the total number of U.S. producers increased 7%, while the number of Hispanic farmers increased 13%. Growing up in Mexico, Salvador Prieto watched his father work on their family farm. He migrated to the United States with a passion for music, but once in America, fell in love with agriculture. His wife, Martha Romero, grew up in Los Angeles, and with their shared love for agriculture, the future of the Prieto family farm began.

USDA photo. Cassopolis, located in southwest Michigan, recently celebrated the ground-breaking for the new USDA Rural Development supported Cassopolis Family Clinic.  Like many rural communities, Cassopolis has limited facilities for health care, particularly for low-income residents.  The Cassopolis Family Clinic was founded more than 50 years ago to serve the surrounding community and the facility will bring that service into the future. USDA Rural Development was represented at the event by Paw Paw Sub-Area Office Team Leader Lisa Epple, who was joined by local leaders and U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow. “This is an excellent example of how USDA Rural Development is working with partner agencies to improve access to health care for Michigan residents,” Epple said.  The agency is providing a Community Facilities direct loan to fund the project which is being combined with a grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration of the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services. “Today’s groundbreaking is welcome news for families in Cassopolis and across Cass County,” said Stabenow, chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee.  “For almost 50 years, the Family Clinic has served as the family doctor for so many residents in need of basic medical care. I am pleased that this brand new clinic will provide physical, mental, and dental health services to thousands of additional patients for years to come.” For rural areas, a local clinic can mean the difference between a lengthy drive to the emergency room and timely care.  By partnering with the Cassopolis Family Clinic and HRSA, USDA Rural Development is helping to keep quality health care close to home.

"Economic Research Service in  Research and Science  Apr 16,  USDA is working to better understand food loss at the farm level and ERS research is an integral part of the process, as ERS adjusts national estimates of food supplies for nonedible parts of foods (bones, peels, etc.) and losses from farm to fork in its Food Availability System. USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) estimates that about ates goes uneaten at the retail and consumer level. Most consumers are aware of the food they throw out in their home kitchens and in restaurants, but food loss occurs throughout the supply chain. USDA is working to better understand food loss at the farm level and ERS research is an integral part of the process, as ERS adjusts national estimates of food supplies for nonedible parts of foods (bones, peels, etc.) and losses from farm to fork in its Food Availability System. There are several reasons edible crops do not make it to market. In some cases, market prices for those crops may be too low to justify the cost of making additional passes through the field or orchard to harvest crops. In other cases, not being able to find labor to harvest the crops mean that they are left to rot. Finally, since fruits and vegetables ripen at different times across regions, growers may struggle to find buyers for their produce towards the end of their harvest period, as wholesale buyers switch to other suppliers when better quality produce becomes available in other regions. Food loss is a particular problem in the produce industry, as produce is more perishable than some crops such as grain crops. Overripe fruit that must be consumed within 1-2 days does not enter the wholesale market, and may be marketed directly to consumers at farm stands. In the absence of these markets, overripe fruit or “cosmetically challenged” fruit can end up in landfills or is simply dropped to the ground by field workers during harvest. Industry and entrepreneurs have come up with various solutions to reduce food loss at the farm level. A market for “seconds” has emerged, referring to crops that do not receive the top grade needed to enter the conventional wholesale market but are still edible. Specialized companies with a mission to reduce food waste have entered the market to collect and deliver to consumers produce that is too big, small, or blemished for the conventional market. However, when harvested produce is not of high enough quality to be purchased by a wholesaler, diverting crops away from the wholesale supply chain could avoid wasting further resources. In this instance, food loss at the farm level would be preferable to loss at a later stage in the supply chain. Why do people care about food loss? Food that is grown but not consumed uses resources all along the farm-to-fork chain – in its production, transportation, storage, and marketing. Growing food uses fertilizer, arable land, pesticides, energy, and water; and can degrade the environment through nutrient runoff or effects of pesticides on non-target organisms. In addition, an estimated 11.8 percent of American households were food insecure at least some time during the year in , meaning they lacked access to enough food for all household members to enjoy an active, healthy life. USDA is working on solutions. Through workshops, research, and other programs, such as USDA and EPA’s call for a 50-percent reduction in food loss and waste by , USDA continues in its mission to reduce food loss and waste with the goal of ending hunger, enabling farmers to financially benefit from all of the crops they grow, and reducing resources spent on growing food that is not consumed.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  USDA Results  Research and Science  Jun 24,   June through September is wildfire season in the United States and on June 18 there were already 16 active major fires consuming more than 102,000 acres.  As much damage and destruction these fires cause, even more may be on the way when future rains cause mudslides from soil erosion on barren hills.  That’s where “Woodstraw” comes in. WoodStraw® is a wood-based erosion control product that was developed by Forest Concepts, in Auburn, WA, using a Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) grant administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).  This material is made from low-grade waste wood veneer and resembles oversized pick-up sticks.  Wood-based erosion control products have many advantages over traditional grass straw as an erosion-control material because it is heaver and will not blow away, is 100 percent seed and weed-free, and is effective on slopes of up to 70 percent grade. SBIR grants come in two forms: Phase I and Phase II.  A 6-month Phase 1 grant allows grantees to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed projects – and gives the government a chance to determine the quality of the grantee’s performance before awarding Phase II funding.  Phase II provide funding to awardees to continue their research and development efforts for up to 2 years. Forest Concepts proved its wood-based erosion control theory in initial field trials, where the product reduced erosion by more than 98 percent; it proved to be especially effective in reducing erosion in areas that have been impacted by forest fires.  Since , the company has produced more than 14,000 tons of material for projects managed by the U.S. Forest Service; the Bureau of Land Management; national parks; and state, county, and city departments of transportation and parks.  It has been used in more than 30 post-wildfire erosion control projects. In , Forest Concepts sold a license to Mountain Pine Manufacturing, Inc., to produce wood-based erosion control materials in Steamboat Springs, CO.  Mountain Pine uses dead, beetle-kill trees to produce material.  This process helps answer the region’s beetle-kill problem and provides engineered mulch that promotes regeneration of new live trees.  Production at both facilities creates sustainable jobs in the erosion control and biomass production and supply industries. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education and extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.  More information is available at: www.nifa.usda.gov.

Due to volcanic ash in Europe, my arrival was delayed by 36 hours.  I tried to outmaneuver the cloud by taking the scenic route -- Washington to Boston to Amsterdam to Paris to Nairobi.  While I enjoyed my multi-airport tour, Mother Nature still got the best of me.  She added further insult by holding my luggage in a city other than Nairobi. During my time in Africa, I gained an appreciation for the excellent results that the World Food Program (WFP) and private voluntary organizations are producing with resources provided by the U.S. food aid programs. Senator George McGovern and I visited programs that are helping adults and children with HIV and AIDS. While it was heartbreaking to see so many infants, children, and adults with this disease, U.S. Government programs are providing relief and hope to these children and families.

"Communications Staff Intern, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Aug 27,  A poultry producer checks the broiler hens in one of his chicken houses. (USDA photo by Bob Nichols) A major war was fought in -, with more than ates alone. You may not have seen much of it on the news, but there’s a good chance your wallet felt it. The outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in 17 states caused the American poultry industry to lose about 51.5 million chickens and turkeys. During this outbreak, the infected flocks cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1 billion in depopulation, cleanup, disinfection, and insurance payments. This also caused the egg-laying population to dramatically decrease. Poultry producers lost $1.1 billion in broiler exports (a 26-percent decrease from the previous year), $41 million in lost egg export income (down 13 percent), and $177 million in turkey export income (a 23-percent decline). The law of supply and demand, naturally, caused consumer prices to increase at grocery stores and restaurants. The danger of infectious disease outbreaks in the agricultural community is real and preventing them is critical for maintaining the supply of safe, nutritious, and affordable food. This is where biosecurity comes into play. USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supports agricultural biosecurity by providing funding and national program leadership to projects that secure and protect the integrity, reliability, sustainability, and profitability of the American food and agricultural system against catastrophic hazards, whether natural, emerging, accidental, or deliberate. Non-animal agricultural biosecurity issues include spotted wing drosophila, which caused $715 million of damage in berry and stone fruit crops, and the brown marmorated stink bug, which caused $37 million in damage to the apple industry across the mid-Atlantic region. Citrus greening disease, arguably the greatest current threat, is devastating the citrus industry in Texas, Arizona, California, and Florida, where about 80 percent citrus trees are affected. NIFA’s fight against citrus greening began in February with a $20.1 million investment in research and extension. The projects included the University of Central Florida testing a bactericide to kill the citrus greening bacteria and the University of California, Riverside developing disease resistant varieties of citrus. NIFA-funded projects advance our understanding of biosecurity and provide solutions for protecting the food supply from intentional and natural threats and hazards. The National Animal Health Laboratory Network, National Plant Diagnostic Network, and the Citrus Greening Research and Extension manage many of these projects. NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .12  Contact:USDA Office of Communications 256-  CINCINNATI, Ohio, June 27, - Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today highlighted USDA's collaboration with General Electric (GE) Aviation, the Ohio Aerospace Institute, air carriers and producer groups to develop a Midwest-regional strategy to provide renewable-jet fuel at GE Aviation's Cincinnati-area facilities. Vilsack discussed how this effort is helping grow local jobs by bringing together agricultural producers, processing and transportation entities, refiners and finishers, academics and researchers, and analysts and financial entities. GE Aviation anticipates purchasing up to 5 million gallons of renewable-jet fuel beginning in .""We have an incredible opportunity to create thousands of new jobs and drive economic development in rural communities across America by developing innovative ways to use agricultural products to help reduce our reliance on foreign oil,"" said Vilsack. ""USDA's collaboration with General Electric Aviation will bring together multiple sectors of Ohio's economy, including agricultural producers, to foster new innovations in the field of renewable fuels while bolstering new economic opportunities in the Midwest. USDA is proud to work alongside private and public institutions to support the research, creation and distribution of next generation energy solutions.""USDA recently awarded a Value Added Producer Grant to the Ohio Soybean Council to help initiate a pilot project through Ohio State University's Bioproducts Innovation Center to refine bio-jet fuel from soybean oil produced by farmer-owners of Ohio's Mercer Landmark cooperative in western Ohio. Renewable-jet fuel produced from various plant oils (e.g. camelina, pennycress, inedible corn oil, algae) has been certified by the American Society of Testing and Materials for aviation use, and is currently being used in limited commercial service. Such a pilot project could provide the basis for commercializing renewable-jet fuel production for future aviation purchases.In addition, USDA's Farm Service Agency also has a groundbreaking energy crop production initiative underway in northeastern Ohio and northwestern Pennsylvania through the agency's Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP). About 115 contracts are signed to grow nearly 3,700 acres of the energy crop Miscanthus, a perennial grass that grows on previously underutilized lands in the area. Aloterra Energy has agreed to provide farmers technical assistance in planting and to purchase the new crop for future use in energy production-- possibly as a feedstock for Midwest renewable fuel initiatives.Vilsack also highlighted how USDA is working with federal partners like the Department of Energy (DOE), Department of the Navy and the Federal Aviation Administration to improve our country's energy security and provide sustainable jobs in communities across the country. Last August, President Obama announced a partnership between USDA, DOE and Navy to invest up to $510 million during the next three years in partnership with the private sector to produce advanced, drop-in aviation and marine biofuels to power military and commercial transportation.At Secretary Vilsack's direction, USDA is working to develop the national biofuels industry producing energy from non-food sources in every region of the country. Working with private and government partners, USDA is supporting research into innovative energy technologies and processes, helping companies build biorefineries - including the first ever commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol facilities - and supporting farmers, ranchers, and businesses taking risks to pursue new opportunities in biofuels.Creating new markets for the nation's agricultural products through biobased manufacturing is one of the many steps the Administration has taken over the past three years to strengthen the rural economy. Since taking office, President Obama's Administration has taken historic steps to improve the lives of rural Americans, put people back to work and build thriving economies in rural communities. From proposing the American Jobs Act to establishing the first-ever White House Rural Council - chaired by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack - the President is committed to a smarter use of existing Federal resources to foster sustainable economic prosperity and ensure the government is a strong partner for businesses, entrepreneurs and working families in rural communities.Additional information on USDA's energy accomplishments can be found here. is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

"Deputy Undersecretary, Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  Forestry  Sep 09,   Standing in a disturbed patch of forest, Menominee forester Jeff Grignon looks around and explains, “My role is to regenerate the forest, maintain the forest, create diversity, and look toward the future.” This task is becoming increasingly challenging as growing forest health issues intersect with additional stressors brought about by climate change in the forests of the Menominee Nation and elsewhere. As a leader in forestry and natural resource conservation, USDA has a long history of working with tribes to address their management issues and concerns. Climate change is an active part of that discussion, and has been increasing through development of the new USDA Regional Climate Hubs. The network of Hubs deliver science-based knowledge, practical information, and program support to help natural resource managers, producers, and landowners make climate-informed decisions and then implement those decisions. The Menominee Forest provides one example of this type of support. There, the non-native oak wilt fungus has killed thousands of red oak trees across 220,000 acres of forest managed by Menominee Tribal Enterprises. Over 300 pockets of forest affected by oak wilt have been found and treated so far. The treatment is disruptive to the site because all affected or potentially affected oak trees must be removed completely, and their stumps pulled to avoid transmission of the fungus through roots. Responding to the disease also provides opportunities. Some of the sites have been identified as demonstration sites that will be reforested, while also increasing forest diversity and introducing species that are expected to be better-adapted to future climates. Over the past few years, foresters at Menominee Tribal Enterprises have prepared the forest soil and begun planting an array of plant and tree species, informed by a combination of the traditional ecological knowledge and the latest climate change science. The Menominee adaptation demonstration was supported by the Forest Service through its leadership in a collaborative effort called the Climate Change Response Framework. The Framework provides useful information, resources, and tools to help natural resource professionals and woodland owners consider climate change as they make decisions about how to manage their land. Adaptation demonstrations are critical for providing real-world examples of how climate change adaptation actions can be planned and implemented. To date, hundreds of natural resource managers have used the same process that was used at the Menominee Forest—an adaptation workbook—to integrate climate change information into dozens of on-the-ground projects. The project with Menominee Tribal Enterprises is a great example of the kind of climate-informed management that emerges from combining local judgment and traditional knowledge with the latest applied climate science, and it shows how USDA can help land owners and managers respond to climate change. This demonstration project was also featured in the September issue of the Journal of Forestry.  Learn more about Tribal Demonstration Projects using the Climate Change Response Framework.

"How to be a Savvy Shopper with Savory Leftovers  Thanksgiving is finally over, and now comes the biggest weekend for holiday shopping.  According to the National Retail Foundation, the average shopper spends about $380 from Black Friday to Cyber Monday.   When planning out your battle strategy shopping budget, you may forget to account for the meals you eat before, during, and after a long shopping trip.  Those lattes, sandwiches, garlic knots, and smoothies you may buy to fuel your shopping can really start to add up and will put a damper on your holiday shopping budget.   Kristina E Beaugh, MPH, Food Safety Education Staff, Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA  Posted in  Health and Safety  Nov 25,   Respond to this story",What are some effective ways for a shopper to save money by being mindful of meal expenses during Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping?,"To be a savvy shopper and save money on meals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, consider packing your own snacks and meals instead of buying them at stores or restaurants.

"USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Nov 19,   Uh, oh! Thanksgiving is right around the corner. You bought a turkey on sale last year and froze it. You know it’s safe because you recently read that frozen turkeys are safe indefinitely and keep good quality for a year. But what you don’t know is how or when to thaw it. First of all, turkey should never be thawed on the counter or in hot water. These methods are NOT considered safe and may lead to foodborne illness. Also, never thaw a turkey in a garage, basement, car, on the kitchen counter, outdoors or on the porch. Turkey, as any perishable food, must be kept at a safe temperature during ""the big thaw."" If not, once the turkey begins to thaw and becomes warmer than 40 °F, bacteria present before freezing can begin to multiply. Even though the center of the bird may still be frozen as it thaws on the counter, the outer layer of the turkey could be in the ""Danger Zone,"" between 40 and 140 °F — temperatures where bacteria multiply rapidly. Now that you know how NOT to thaw, let’s talk about the safe ways to thaw a turkey. Refrigerator Thawing Plan ahead. A frozen turkey will require at least 24 hours for every 5 pounds of weight. After thawing in the refrigerator, a turkey should remain safe and good quality for an additional day or two before cooking. A bird thawed in the refrigerator can be refrozen without cooking, although there may be some loss of quality. Cold Water Thawing This method is faster than refrigerator thawing but requires more attention. The turkey must be kept in its original package to keep bacteria from the air or surrounding environment from being introduced and to keep the turkey from absorbing water. The turkey should be submerged in cold tap water, changing the water every 30 minutes so it continues to thaw. It should take about 30 minutes per pound to thaw. Once thawed by the cold water method, cook your turkey immediately. Check out the Turkey Thawing Chart for proper timing. Microwave Thawing After thawing turkey in a microwave oven, cook immediately because some areas of the food may become warm and begin to cook during the thawing process (bringing the food to ""Danger Zone"" temperatures). Holding partially cooked food is not recommended because any bacteria present wouldn't have been destroyed and the food may have reached optimal temperatures for bacteria to grow.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA, Agricultural Research Service in  Animals  Plants  Research and Science  Sep 13,  The brown marmorated stink bug, a winged pest from Asia that is eating crops and infesting U.S. homes. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists are launching a campaign to ask volunteers to count the number of stink bugs in their homes. USDA-ARS photo by Stephen Ausmus. Calling all insect enthusiasts and frustrated gardeners!  USDA scientists need your help in documenting Brown Marmorated Stink Bugs (BMSB) in your home. Beginning September 15th through October 15th, we’re asking citizens across the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States to record daily counts of this pest on the exterior of their homes, along with their location and the time of each count. While USDA scientists are focusing on the Mid-Atlantic region, any they can get from other U.S. regions would also be helpful to their research. The quest to find out just how many stink bugs there are, and how they behave, is the brainchild of a consortium of researchers from USDA, the University of Maryland, Pennsylvania State University, Rutgers University, Virginia Tech, the Northeastern IPM Center, Oregon State University, North Carolina State University, Cornell University, the University of Delaware and Washington State University. This project is represented on the website, “Stop BMSB (www.stopbmsb.org),” which was launched in . The project involves more than 50 scientists who are investigating the impact BMSB have on grapes, orchard crops, small fruits, ornamental crops and vegetables, as well as ways to prevent or minimize the pest’s impact. BMSB have been found in 40 states and have caused the most damage in the Mid-Atlantic region. The value of at-risk crops where BMSB have been established or identified exceeds $21 billon. Because landscape features such as woodlands, structures, roads and different land use types affect the spread of the insects, it is important to collect related to BMSB locations. BMSB survive cold winter temperatures near farmland in homes, office buildings and warehouses. Scientists are just beginning to understand how landscape features will be a key component in combating stink bugs. Volunteers willing to count their stink bugs can contact USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) entomologists Tracy Leskey (tracy.leskey@ars.usda.gov), Doo-Hyung Lee or Torri Hancock at 725-, at the ARS Appalachian Fruit Research Laboratory in Kearneysville, West Virginia.

"and CiCi Williamson, USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Nov 25,   The need for speed. Lack of oven space. Family traditions. Power outages. All are reasons many cooks might look for ways to roast a whole turkey outside the usual oven. Consider the following methods suggested by the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline. But first, a message about food safety. No matter which method you choose to get your turkey to the table, have a food thermometer handy so you can make sure the turkey has reached the safe minimum internal temperature of 165 °F in the innermost part of the thigh, wing and the thickest part of the breast.  If your turkey is stuffed, the center of the stuffing should also reach 165 °F. After cooking, let the turkey stand for 20 minutes before carving. Outdoor Methods (from fastest to slowest) NOTE: DO NOT stuff turkeys cooked by these outdoor methods. Also make sure the turkey is completely thawed. Follow the appliance manufacturer’s directions. Deep Fat Turkey Fryer Size of turkey: 12 to 15 pounds. Cooking time: 3 to 5 minutes per pound. Requires 2 ½ to 3 gallons of oil. The appliance should be large enough to hold the turkey without the oil spilling over. Measure the capacity of the fryer first by placing the raw turkey in the cold fryer and filling it with water, which should cover the turkey by 1 to 2 inches. Remove the turkey and measure the amount of water in the fryer. Use that amount of oil and preheat the fryer until the oil reaches 350 °F before submerging the turkey. Infrared Oil-less Turkey Fryer Cooking time: approximately 10 minutes per pound. Size of turkey: 16 pounds or smaller. This appliance comes in either an electric or a gas version that must be connected to a 20-pound propane tank. ""Big Green Egg"" (Ceramic Egg-shaped Cooker) Size of turkey: 12 pounds. Cooking time: approximately 12 to 13 minutes per pound. Use only lump charcoal and always cook with the lid closed. Set the cooker temperature to 350 °F. Covered Gas or Charcoal Grill Size of turkey: 12 to 15 pounds. Cooking time: approximately 15 to 18 minutes per pound. Place a pan of water under the grate to insure indirect heat, catch the turkey drippings, and prevent flame-ups. If the grill has two or three burners, turn off a burner and place the turkey away from the flame for indirect cooking. Smoker Size of turkey: 12 to 15 pounds. Cooking time: approximately 25 to 30 minutes per pound. A smoker may be electric or charcoal. Cooking times depend on the size and shape of the turkey and the outside air temperature. Make sure that the smoker maintains an internal temperature of 225 °F to 300 °F.  Indoor Methods (fastest) Microwave Cooking Size of turkey: 12 to 14 pounds. Cooking time: approximately 9 minutes per pound on 50% (medium) power level. Use an oven cooking bag for more even cooking. Rotate the turkey every 15 minutes. Timing can vary because microwave ovens vary in wattage. Do not stuff the turkey. Cook stuffing in a separate casserole. Electric Roaster Oven Size of turkey: 12 to 20 pounds. Cooking time: approximately 3 to 4 ½ hours. Add 30 minutes for stuffed turkeys. Generally, the cooking time and oven temperature setting in this tabletop appliance are the same as for conventional cooking. Set the roaster temperature to 325 °F. Do not lift the lid during cooking or it will increase the cooking time. Power Outage If your electricity goes off while you are cooking a turkey indoors, you can transfer the turkey immediately to an outdoor appliance, and continue cooking it until safely done.

"USDA Agricultural Research Service Information Staff in  Conservation  Research and Science  May 20,  Preventing movement of agricultural chemicals from crop fields to streams is a key part of protecting our water quality. Here, an ARS scientist examines a farmer’s subsurface drain pipe. Photo by ARS. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. There’s no farming without water. Recent droughts in the United States and elsewhere underscore our need to conserve water in agricultural production, and studies have identified agricultural management practices that help protect water quality.  USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) researchers are making key contributions to these efforts. For instance, ARS scientists use moisture information collected by satellites to develop the Evaporative Stress Index.  In , this tool predicted that drought conditions were developing weeks before other drought monitoring networks made the same call. ARS researchers also use satellite to design methods of estimating rainfall amounts in regions where setting up sampling stations would be a challenge, work that has long-range potential for improving precipitation estimates globally. Our scientists have improved crop models that farmers can use to manage water more efficiently.  One of these models, the Phenology Modular Modeling System decision support tool, has already been downloaded by more than 1,500 researchers, farmers, and agribusinesses.  ARS scientists also periodically update another model called the Water Erosion Prediction Project; the latest version includes new methods for estimating the movement of water on top of and through the soil, as well as through subsurface tile drainage, which is common in Midwest crop fields. Protecting water quality is just as important as tracking how much there is and where it’s going.  One ARS scientist developed a method to identify where growers can use different types of surface and below-ground management practices to reduce the movement of agricultural chemicals and improve water quality.  Other ARS scientists used field studies and computer models to study the movement of the pesticide atrazine in water bodies next to Puerto Rico’s Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, information that can help farmers develop practices to protect estuarine ecosystems from agricultural chemicals. From the smallest stream to the largest bay, we’re doing everything we can to conserve our precious—and finite—water resources.

"Deputy Administrator of the AMS, Livestock, Poultry and Seed Program in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Aug 12,  USDA worked with academia and industry over the past several years to develop a system to determine beef tenderness, using an objective scale to ensure that cuts with the new label consistently meet consumer expectations. Tenderness is one of the most significant factors affecting the overall consumer acceptance of beef cuts.  Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Beef Quality Grading program is a useful tool in predicting overall consumer acceptance of beef, other factors besides those assessed by the USDA Quality Grading System affect beef tenderness.  In other words, beef that may not grade to the highest USDA Quality Grade (USDA Select or Choice vs. USDA Prime) may in fact be rated just as tender by consumers.  Similarly, certain cuts of beef, no matter how high their USDA Quality Grade, may not be as tender for some consumers. To address these issues and provide consumers with a more useful purchasing tool, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) worked with academia and industry to develop an accurate system to determine when consumers perceive beef cuts to be either tender or very tender.  Based on an objective scale, the system ensures that specific beef cuts consistently meet these established thresholds.  Thanks to the collaborative efforts between AMS and these groups, approved beef processors can now market products as USDA-Certified Tender or Very Tender through product labeling, advertisements, and promotions. “USDA is pleased to offer this new verification program that provides American producers with another marketing tool to promote their quality products,” said AMS Administrator Anne Alonzo.  “The tenderness label also gives consumers additional information to use when making their purchasing decisions.” On June 30, , Cargill became the first processor to have a program certified by USDA.  There are two other programs under review – one other beef processor and a major grocery store chain. “We know that beef attributes such as tenderness, flavor and juiciness are important to consumers and the long-term health of the American beef industry hinges on our ability to consistently deliver the best possible beef eating experience,” stated John Keating, president of Cargill. Consumers should start to see beef cuts labeled as USDA Certified Tender or USDA Certified Very Tender as early as Fall .

The USDA-AAPI Roundtable brought together over 70 participants, including over 35 AAPI community organizations and leaders, 6 Congressional offices, 5 AAPI business leaders and chambers of commerce, 3 media outlets, various academicians and 25 USDA officials. Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Chair Judy Chu opened the event applauding USDA's efforts to establish partnerships between Congress and USDA to better increase AAPI outreach. USDA Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan made introductory remarks discussing the need for diversity at USDA and the developments at USDA to address greater outreach to AAPI communities.  USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack provided keynote remarks highlighting USDA’s plan to increase diversity efforts to better reflect the face of America through the implementation of the USDA Cultural Transformation Initiative. The USDA-AAPI Roundtable included USDA presentations on issues ranging from the White House Initiative on Asian American Pacific Islanders, Rural Development, Farm Loans and Programs, Higher Education and the Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institutions, Workforce Diversity, Procurement, and Food and Nutrition. Participants traveled as far as California and Minnesota to attend the Roundtable to share stories of the existing needs that AAPI populations are faced with around the country, including Hmong poultry farms, access to USDA loans and grants, and food and nutrition initiatives for low-income minority communities. USDA looks forward to the September 20 USDA-AAPI roundtable as the first in a series of roundtables to better connect AAPI community leaders, organizations, and members with USDA programs, opportunities, and services, in line with Secretary Vilsack's priority mission of cultural transformation at USDA.

"USDA Mississippi Public Information Coordinator in  USDA Results  Rural  Mar 29,   Earlier this week, USDA Rural Development Deputy Under Secretary Doug O’Brien met with local and regional officials in Mississippi to discuss ways USDA can help businesses create jobs and stimulate local economies. Mississippi was one of the first states in the nation to be designated a StrikeForce state by USDA and last Tuesday, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will launch its ""StrikeForce"" initiative in ten additional states. The primary goal of the StrikeForce initiative is to increase partnership with rural communities and leverage community resources in targeted, persistent poverty areas. Vilsack noted that through the StrikeForce initiative, USDA will do more to partner with local and state governments and community organizations on projects that promote economic development and job creation. “I am proud to support and highlight the great work under way here to bring economic opportunity to Mississippi’s rural communities,” O’Brien said during a Rural Jobs and Innovation Accelerator event at Mississippi State University. “Public-private partnerships are some of the best ways to leverage resources for job creation and business development.” Mississippi State University received a $1 million award from the Rural Jobs and Innovation Accelerator challenge. It is a partnership among 13 federal agencies and bureaus. The Jobs Accelerator is a critical component of the Obama Administration’s efforts to support small businesses.

"Colorado’s Agencies Create Recipe Frameworks for Communities through the Healthy Corner Store Partnership  Small community-based stores, such as corner stores, are convenient places to shop for simple food items. However, smaller stores often have limited inventory – especially for nutritious options. Cooking Matters Colorado and Rocky Mountain Prevention Research Center’s School Wellness Programs engaged with three corner stores in Denver to pilot a SNAP-Ed campaign designed to improve healthy eating. The campaign focused on step-by-step recipe frameworks and offered supportive, educational, and practical examples for a flexible approach to recipes that better resonate with community members.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Oregon in  Conservation  Jan 08,  Becoming a certified organic producer presents a unique set of restrictions and challenges. Oregon Farmer Chris Roehm overcomes those challenges with the help of a powerful ally: healthy soil. Photo by Bob Stobaugh For agricultural producers, it’s an age-old question: How do you grow the largest, healthiest, most-profitable crops possible? Oregon organic farmer Chris Roehm says the secret is in the soil. Co-owner and operator of Square Peg Farm in Forest Grove, Roehm is among a growing number of producers, both conventional and organic, who are realizing the benefits of improving the health and function of their soil through working with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). ""Investing in soil health is fundamental to good organic growing. They are essentially one and the same,"" he says. Roehm says he and his wife Amy Benson plan for the long-term, and he thinks healthy soil is the best way to maximize their returns over time. Farmers like Roehm realize that healthy soil is a complex ecosystem teeming with life. The healthy soil nourishes and supports the plants that grow from it. In fact, plants and soil feed and protect each other. By alternating between growing and grazing, Roehm fertilizes his land in a natural, sustainable way that improves the health of his livestock, soil, and vegetables. Photo by Bob Stobaugh According to Roehm, ""By investing in the soil...you see payoffs in lower weed pressure, better fertility, less pest pressure and healthier plants that are able to deal with disease pressure and insect pressure that less healthy plants are not able to deal with."" Non-organic farmers have several short-cuts available. They can apply conventional fertilizers, which directly feed the plants, but that can harm the soil or adversely affect water quality. Organic farmers, restricted from using synthetic fertilizers, must rely on natural systems. That is why Roehm mimics nature by integrating grazing into his practice. Grazing is a valuable part of Chris Roehm's soil management plan. Photo by Bob Stobaugh ""One of the components of our soil health management plan that we are happiest with is the integration of growing forage crops for grazing animals with our annual vegetable production,"" he says. By alternating between growing and grazing, Roehm fertilizes his land in a natural, sustainable way that improves the health of his livestock, soil and vegetables. The results are impressive. ""The first year after that foraged ground has been turned over is like magic, everything just flies up out of the ground, there are hardly any weeds, the bugs don’t know what to do, it’s really fantastic,"" Roehm says.

Photo by Ron Nichols When you're looking for the best answer on how to grow your crops, think long-term, like Chris Roehm and so many others, and unlock the secrets in the soil. As Roehm says, “If your long-term strategy is to grow organically, the only successful way to achieve that is to work on feeding the soil.” ""[Our customers] noticed we have a lot more stuff to sell and that's not because we increased the acreage, it’s because the plants are making more saleable produce for us.""

"Needing a Clearer Crystal Ball  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.  If you think the local weather forecaster has trouble predicting if it will rain tomorrow, imagine how hard it is to forecast crop production world-wide. If there is too little rain in Brazil in August, it could delay planting of the country’s summer maize crop and subsequently diminish that harvest. If the decrease is big enough, it could possibly have implications for international commodity prices and might even impact global food security. This in turn can translate into the need for policy makers to respond to economic and trade issues and problems in countries where food insecurity is a persistent threat.

"Florida State Statistician, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Conservation  Jun 26,  The Sunshine State is seeing spectacular growth in organic crops. Check back next Thursday for more facts from the Census of Agriculture. The Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture. As the new Florida State Statistician, I am excited to start digging into the agricultural here in the Sunshine State. One of the first things anybody would notice upon glancing over our stats is the wealth of fruits, vegetables, and other unique commodities. According to the Census of Agriculture, almost 64% of Florida’s total market value of agricultural products sold comes from three categories: fruits and nuts, nursery, greenhouse, floriculture, and sod, and vegetables, melons, potatoes, and sweet potatoes. We are one of the top three states nationwide in sales in all three of these categories, and Florida is also the top producer of sugarcane for sugar. Thus, the Sunshine State definitely lives up to its bright nickname by harvesting a rainbow of commodities. If one crop defines Florida, it’s oranges. There are over 465,000 acres of orange farms in our state, accounting for almost 70% of all the orange acreage in the nation. To top it off, we are the only state to grow the delectable Temple orange. In addition to oranges, Florida has over 850,000 acres of farmland dedicated to other commodities: over 250,000 acres to growing vegetables, and over 598,600 acres producing more fruits, nuts, and berries. Interestingly, peaches in particular are coming into the Florida agricultural spotlight.  Peach trees require chill hours to jolt their flowering process effectively, and while peach producing states like Georgia and New Jersey receive adequate chill hours for traditional cultivars, Florida usually does not. However, researchers have developed new cultivars with low chill hours which are more conducive to Florida’s growing season. On another note, Florida’s farm demographics clearly reflect the dynamic and diversifying U.S. population. Since the last census of agriculture in , there has been an increase in the number of Asian, black or African American, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino origin operators. Furthermore, while around 20% of farmers nationwide have been operating a farm for fewer than ten years, this proportion is almost 26% in Florida, reflecting a younger group of operators. Finally, about 35.7% of all farm operators in Florida are female. Florida is also keeping pace with the recent trends toward renewable energy and organic products. At over $83 million, Florida’s total organic product sales was almost five times higher than in . In addition, 748 farms in Florida have renewable energy producing systems. As you can see, Florida agriculture is as vibrant as ever, and I am excited to see how our state continues to live up to its bright nickname.

"Initiatives  Aug 11,   The Obama administration has called on Americans from all backgrounds and walks of life to work to improve their communities as part of the United We Serve project. Here at USDA, many of our more than 100,000 employees are doing their part. They are driven to serve, and proud to identify ways to use their skills to support their own communities. Here's some work two USDA employees are doing to improve the health of their communities: Horseback riding for people with special needs — Mike (Annandale, VA) Mike and his family have long been involved with the equestrian sport of vaulting (gymnastics on horseback). Over the past year they have hosted a regular outing for special needs children and adults from their church, giving each an opportunity to ride a horse and to learn the freedom of movement and confidence the experience brings. Nothing can compare with the sheer pleasure of seeing these individuals, often initially nervous and scared, beaming as they ride triumphantly...and often for the first time in their lives. Perhaps the most meaningful experience was last October when, during local pony rides Mike was helping with, he saw a mother with an infant whose many tubes and blank stare evidenced the severity of his condition. He asked the mother if her baby wanted a chance to ride and he was soon up on a horse in the secure arms of an experienced rider. After a 5-minute ride his mother thanked Mike and later told him that her baby was normally mostly uncommunicative, but that after riding he seemed to be alert and aware for days! Raising money for a cure — Nancy (Steele, ND) Nancy coordinated the local USDA Service Center’s team for the American Cancer Society’s ""Relay for Life"" fundraiser in Steele, North Dakota. They named their group ""Team USDA"" and over a few short months raised over $. ""Team USDA"" was the top fundraising team from within the 23 teams that participated. Some of the ways they raised funds were by serving dinners for local events, selling sweets and treats, and family and friends making donations. The 23 teams for this event raised over $40,000. It was a great success and they plan to participate again next year.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Apr 25,  Jorge Dubcovsky, professor of plant sciences at University of California–Davis, is co-winner of the Wolf Prize in agriculture. Photo courtesy of Jorge Dubcovsky During the month of April we will take a closer look at USDA’s Groundbreaking Research for a Revitalized Rural America, highlighting ways USDA researchers are improving the lives of Americans in ways you might never imagine.  Today we look at USDA support for a researcher striving to improve wheat through developing better disease resistance, nutritional value, and yield. One of America’s most renowned agricultural researchers, a man who has already collected two of the USDA’s top honors, has now earned international recognition with the Wolf Prize in Agriculture.  The Wolf Foundation began awarding six prizes – agriculture, the arts, chemistry, mathematics, medicine, and physics – in to recognize outstanding scientists and artists for achievements in the interest of mankind and friendly relations among peoples. Jorge Dubcovsky, a professor of plant sciences at the University of California–Davis and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute–Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation investigator, is sharing the Wolf Prize with Leif Andersson, from Uppsala University in Sweden.  Dubcovsky’s previous awards include USDA’s National Research Initiative Discovery Award and the USDA Secretary’s Honor Award.  Dubcovsky will receive the Wolf Prize June 1 at Knesset Israel (the Israeli Parliament) from Israeli President Shimon Peres. Dubcovsky is a plant geneticist who works with wheat to improve disease resistance, nutritional value, yield, and adaptability to a changing environment.  Over the years, USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) has provided more than $15 million to fund more than 20 of Dubcovsky’s research projects. “NIFA funding has been the central pillar in the support of my research,” Dubcovsky said.  “These grants support critical crop research and crop improvement and provide valuable resources for the public breeding programs to organize themselves at a national level through Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP) grants.” One of his recent NIFA grants is a $5 million Triticeae CAP (TCAP) project to improve barley and wheat germplasm.  Triticeae is from the family of grasses that includes wheat, barley, and rye.  Wheat products alone account for about 20 percent of calories consumed by humans. Dubcovsky’s TCAP team used markers to identify the gene variants that control the most desirable of the plant’s traits.  They then created a “Triticeae Toolbox” to provide this information to plant breeders so they can develop improved wheat and barley lines.  Further, the team is developing a national education network to train 29 doctoral candidates in plant breeding. TCAP also features collaborations with minority-serving institutions to attract new students to the agricultural sciences, which is important to the professor.  “I hope (that the Wolf Prize) will help my program attract brilliant and enthusiastic young researchers,” he said. As a side benefit, growers of follow-on crops may also profit from Dubcovsky-led wheat research.  According to an article published May 14, , in Crop Science, three bread wheat varieties created by TCAP carry a gene that is resistant to root-knot nematodes (plant-parasitic worms).  The wheat encourages the nematodes to grow, but the worms cannot eat the wheat.  As a result, they starve, do not reproduce, and die out – which allows the next crop to grow in a relatively nematode-free field. Looking to the future, Dubcovsky – who was born and raised in Argentina and received his bachelors and doctoral degrees in biological sciences from the University of Buenos Aires – is enthusiastic about employing new high-throughput sequencing technologies.  “We will continue pushing hard to complete the sequencing of most wheat genes across our mutant populations,” he said.  “We expect to have a public database where people can search for available mutations and then request the seeds.  We think this will be a fantastic resource to study gene function in wheat.” Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and Cooperative Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Feb 17,  What is the Lorax? And why do we care? And why had the U.S. Forest Service taken us  from the far reaches of the forests to the carpets of Hollywood? Ask the Chief. He will be there. He knows. U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell will travel to California for the premier of the animated movie Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax, which includes the agency’s first Honorary Forest Ranger Betty White.  In the movie, a 12-year-old boy (Zac Efron) tries to win a young girl’s heart (Taylor Swift) by going in search of the Lorax, a grumpy yet charming character who fights to protect the world played by Danny DeVito. Betty White plays the role of the grandmother. The movie is adapted from the book of the same name, written in by Theodor Seuss Geisel, known by millions simply as Dr. Seuss. The book is narrated by the Once-ler, a faceless character who tells a young boy the story of the lost Truffula trees, which are nowhere to be found. But as he tells his story, the Once-ler says to the boy: Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot nothing is going to get better It’s not.* The Lorax then tosses the last Truffula tree seed, urging the boy to set out and plant the seed and help bring back a forest of Truffula trees as well as the Barb-ba-loots, Swoomee-Swans and Humming-Fish that relied on a healthy forest to survive. “Given the many threats to America’s private and public forests due to a changing climate, pests and pathogens, and land conversion, this children’s story can spur conversations about what has to happen today to restore the health and productivity of America’s forests,” Tidwell said. “This is an opportunity to start a dialogue about the inherent value of forests and the importance of sustainable management.” The nation’s 193 million acres of forest and grasslands provide a wealth of public benefits: clean air and water, wildlife habitat, recreation and the wood and paper products Americans use every day. “Forests matter to everyone, and we must use and care for them responsibly and sustainably,” Tidwell said. “The Forest Service, our state partners, family forest owners and the many partner organizations we work with are helping to protect more than 751 million acres of forest land in America. Ensuring that trees are part of America’s landscape is a goal we all share with The Lorax.” The Lorax also is an integral part of a public service campaign with the Forest Service and the Ad Council. The two agencies have worked together since on a public service campaign designed to inspire children and their families to unplug and reconnect with nature. The Ad Council helped the Forest Service join forces with Universal Pictures, which created pro bono a series of new English and Spanish television, radio and outdoor public service advertisements that feature characters from the movie, which will open nationwide March 2, Dr. Seuss’ 108th birthday. The PSAs encourage viewers to go Discover the Forest, an online site that helps children learn about how to discover the wonders of forests around them. *Excerpt from The Lorax by Dr. Seuss, Random House, .

"Farm Service Agency in  Conservation  May 12,   The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which has protected the nation’s natural resources since , is celebrating its 25th anniversary. CRP was signed into law by former President Ronald Reagan – who’s centennial is being celebrated this year – as part of the Farm Bill that was reported to be one of the most massive agricultural reform bills in the nation’s history. It was touted by then Agriculture Secretary John Block as the “agricultural recovery program to put this industry back in the business of prosperity in the years to come.” A portion of that prosperity came in section of the bill, which gave birth to the Conservation Reserve Program. CRP allowed USDA to enter into contracts with owners and operators of highly erodible cropland and assist them in conserving and improving soil and water resources on their farms and ranches. In March , the first CRP contract was signed, igniting a movement that has helped reduce soil erosion by 622 million tons, provided natural habitats for wildlife, restored more than 2 million acres of wetlands and removed millions of tons of carbon dioxide from the air. “Although it was designed to address soil erosion, CRP has become one of the standouts in the USDA arsenal of conservation programs by continuing to provide significant economic and environmental benefits beyond its original intent,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.

In Washington, about 70% of the trees are from species native to North America, while 1% is native to the state or district. Species exotic to the District of Columbia make up 30 percent of the population. Most exotic tree species have an origin from Asia .  This urban forest removes an estimated 492 tons of air pollution per year with an associated value of $2.30 million, and reduces energy-related costs from residential buildings by $3.45 million annually. This study gives us a better understanding of the real value trees bring to our nation’s capital. But the benefits don’t stop there – urban trees across the U.S. are working for us every day. Key findings of our Washington, D.C., study • Number of trees: 2,584,000 • Tree cover: 28.1% • Most common species: American beech, Callery pear, Tulip tree • Percentage of trees less than 6"" diameter: 62.6% • Pollution removal: 492 tons/year ($2.30 million/year) • Carbon storage: 596,000 tons ($12.3 million) • Carbon sequestration: 19,000 tons/year ($393 thousand/year) • Building energy savings: $3.45 million / year • Avoided carbon emissions: $129 thousand / year • Structural values: $3.99 billion U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell will unveil i-Tree v.4 tomorrow in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia.

"Public Affairs Assistant, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Sep 03,   A Florida grapefruit by any other name would surely taste as sweet. Recently, agencies across the U.S. Government worked with representatives of the Florida grapefruit industry to protect the grapefruit industry while underscoring the value of U.S. engagement in international organizations. A proposed entry of an Inspection Manual by the European-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development Scheme on Agricultural Quality (OECD Scheme) initially threatened specific U.S. grapefruit exports to the European Union (EU), which buys one of every two exported grapefruits in the world. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) interpretive brochures serve as the handbook for all national produce inspection agencies within the EU as well as for many other countries. When the new interpretive brochure rejected grapefruit with a certain kind of surface skin defect or discoloring (which naturally occur in tropical and subtropical regions like Florida), U.S. grapefruit growers could have faced a serious challenge. Last year, the United States exported 20 percent of the world’s grapefruit, $47.7 million of which went to the European Union! Experts from the U.S. citrus industry have been working with an OECD Technical Working Group to ensure that the brochure included sub-tropical grapefruit. When the draft failed to include photos and explanatory language for surface defects associated with sub-tropical zones (such as Florida), the USDA and the Florida Citrus industry worked closely with the OECD Scheme to plan a meeting in Geneva to revisit the issue in May . ""A technical rule in a brochure could have cost real jobs and exports in the Florida grapefruit industry,"" says U.S. Ambassador to the OECD Karen Kornbluh. ""We could not let this stand."" At the meeting, the U.S. government and the citrus industry presented its position on the interpretive brochure, and after a lively debate, the U.S. position was adopted. The United States is both a founding member of the OECD, an international organization composed of 32 democratic countries with market-based economies, and of a separate organization - the OECD Scheme - from which the U.S. subsequently withdrew. The OECD seeks to achieve a higher standard of living in member countries as well as engage   non-members to contribute to the development of the world economy. Through its public policy research, ‘soft law,' and peer reviews, the OECD--which turns 50 years old later this year-- provides the U.S. with an opportunity to engage other countries on economic regulatory issues.

"AMS Deputy Administrator, Livestock and Seed Program in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 28,  USDA is as American as baseball and apple pie. Almost anything and everything about U.S. food – and in some respects, baseball – is somehow connected to USDA. Curious? Read on to see how USDA ties in to the World Series. “The Ryan Express” Delivers the Goods Major League Baseball Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan pitched 27 years in the big leagues, tossing a league record seven no-hitters. In that span Ryan was comfortably pumping 100 mile-per-hour fastballs past hitters until he was 40 years old, registering 95 mph on the radar gun until retirement. Nicknamed “The Ryan Express” for his baseball exploits, he went on to become a successful business owner. Ryan knows a good deal when he sees one. In he became a principal owner, president and CEO of the Texas Rangers baseball club. The team has made it to the World Series the last two seasons: losing to the San Francisco Giants in and participating in the thrilling, nail-biting autumn classic of against the St. Louis Cardinals. Ryan also knows the value of the USDA shield. He’s the head of the Nolan Ryan Guaranteed Tender Beef Program, a marketing program verified by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). AMS relies on university-researched and industry-recognized standards to determine which marketing claims it chooses to verify. Companies like Ryan’s can approach AMS and request the agency verify marketing claims such as “guaranteed tender” to assure customers that the products listed on packaging are exactly what they claim.  This is an important service to consumers who desire a certain quality of beef and want third-party assurance that their beef purchases meet exacting requirements. _________________________________________________________________________________________ USDA Certified – St. Louis (Cardinals) Style If you bellied-up at a local sports bar and ordered a plate of St. Louis Style ribs while watching the World Series, thank a former USDA employee for naming the cut of pork. In the late s Steve Olson, an agricultural marketing specialist in the USDA Livestock and Seed Program’s Standardization Division, wrote meat standards for the Agricultural Marketing Service’s Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications (IMPS). Last June Olson shared his story about naming the cut of meat with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He explained how some butchers fancied carving off the breast bone and brisket bones from pork spareribs. “We did a survey to find out if there was a consensus for what this was called,” Olson told the Post-Dispatch. A majority of the respondents called it a St. Louis cut. “The only reason I went ahead and put the term into the IMPS is because I happen to be an avid St. Louis Cardinals baseball team fan, and they had just defeated the San Francisco Giants in a playoff,” Olson said. For more specifications, you can view the latest IMPS report. On pages 11 and 32, Item No. 416A is listed as “Pork Spareribs, St. Louis Style.” St. Louis ribs, ready to eat.

"Safeguarding the Food Supply and Protecting Human Health  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.  What began as a program to ensure the safe production of a diverse food supply is now providing a value-added application of its core expertise: protecting honeybees from parasites and people from vector-borne diseases. USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) funds the IR-4 Program (“Inter-Regional Project ”), which was established more than 50 years ago and is headquartered at Rutgers University. The IR-4 funds laboratories that test pesticides intended to protect specialty crops. That testing generates that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires for pesticide registration.

"Secretary Vilsack: One of the world's oldest building materials is now also one of its most advanced  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .14  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  WASHINGTON, D.C., March 18, - At a meeting hosted by the White House Rural Council today, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced a new partnership to train architects, engineers and builders about the benefits of advanced wood building materials, and plans for a forthcoming prize competition to design and build high-rise wood demonstration projects. Innovative use of wood products is already beginning to change the face of construction across the country, and USDA is undertaking efforts to support these advancements. These efforts also support President Obama's Climate Action Plan goal of preserving the role of forests in mitigating climate change.Wood may be one of the world's oldest building materials, but it is now also one of the most advanced, said Vilsack. Building stronger markets for innovative new wood products supports sustainable forestry, helps buffer reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and puts rural America at the forefront of an emerging industry. Presently, the market for wood and other related forest products supports more than one million direct jobs, many in rural America. As these markets expand, so will the economic opportunities.The new training program Secretary Vilsack announced today will include a $1 million investment from the Forest Service and will be done in partnership with WoodWorks, a non -profit organization that provides technical support, education, and resources related to the design of modern wood buildings for architects, engineers, and developers.The Secretary also announced plans to launch a new prize competition, expected to begin later this year, for developers, institutions, organizations and design teams competing to demonstrate the architectural and commercial viability of using sustainable wood products in high-rise construction. The Department is planning to invest up to $1 million to launch the competition. One non-profit partner, the Binational Softwood Lumber Council, has committed an additional $1 million for the competition. The competition will help spur increased sustainability in construction and will give priority to applicants that source materials from rural domestic manufacturers and domestic, sustainably-managed forests.Emerging engineered wood technologies can be used in industrial building projects such as tall buildings and skyscrapers, as well as other projects. By some industry estimates, a 3-5 story building made from emerging wood technologies has the same emissions control as taking up to 550 cars of the road for one year. Wood-based designs have also been demonstrated to improve energy efficiency, thereby reducing energy consumption for heating and cooling.Today's announcements were made as part of a the Building With Wood: Jobs and the Environment workshop hosted by the White House Rural Council, which included architects, builders, designers, wood manufactures, foresters, state officials, university leaders and representatives from the USDA, General Services Administration, Department of the Interior, Federal Emergency Management Agency and Department of Defense. They also are part of USDA's overall strategy to promote the use of wood as a green building material. USDA's Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin has invested over $2 million in research and technical support for emerging wood technologies. The Forest Products Laboratory has created additional opportunities for emerging wood technologies to be used in housing developments and other green building demonstration projects.When President Obama signed the Farm Bill in February he directed his Administration, working through the White House Rural Council, to lead a new Made in Rural America export and investment initiative. This initiative is charged with bringing together federal resources to help rural businesses and leaders take advantage of new investment opportunities and access new customers and markets both at home and abroad. White House Rural Council leadership on advanced wood products is an example of how the Administration is moving forward on dual goals of domestic production and sustainability. is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

"""USDA Tender"" - A Cooperative Effort with the U.S. Beef Industry  Tenderness is one of the most significant factors affecting the overall consumer acceptance of beef cuts.  Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Beef Quality Grading program is a useful tool in predicting overall consumer acceptance of beef, other factors besides those assessed by the USDA Quality Grading System affect beef tenderness.  In other words, beef that may not grade to the highest USDA Quality Grade (USDA Select or Choice vs. USDA Prime) may in fact be rated just as tender by consumers.  Similarly, certain cuts of beef, no matter how high their USDA Quality Grade, may not be as tender for some consumers. To address these issues and provide consumers with a more useful purchasing tool, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) worked with academia and industry to develop an accurate system to determine when consumers perceive beef cuts to be either tender or very tender.  Based on an objective scale, the system ensures that specific beef cuts consistently meet these established thresholds.  Thanks to the collaborative efforts between AMS and these groups, approved beef processors can now market products as USDA-Certified Tender or Very Tender through product labeling, advertisements, and promotions.  Craig Morris, Deputy Administrator of the AMS, Livestock, Poultry and Seed Program  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Aug 12,   24 Responses",What is the primary goal of USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) in developing an objective system for determining beef tenderness?,"The primary goal of USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is to provide consumers with a more useful purchasing tool by ensuring that specific beef cuts consistently meet established thresholds of tender or very tender, allowing approved processors to market products as USDA-Certified Tender or Very Tender."
"Agricultural Marketing Service Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Mar 26,  The Chicago Public Schools System has incorporated locally-grown produce into school menus, providing students with fresh, healthy food. (Administrator Anne Alonzo, 4th from right) USDA Photo Courtesy of Peter Wood. March is National Nutrition Month, and local food plays an important role in providing Americans with fresh, healthy fuel for their bodies. From farmers to financiers to schools and hospitals, there is a lot of passion for sharing good food by supporting strong local and regional food systems. I experienced this firsthand during my trip to Chicago, Ill., where I spoke at last week’s Good Food Festival & Conference. The trip came on the heels of a recent announcement that USDA is making $97 million available to expand access to healthy food and support rural economies.  Grants from my agency -- the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) – make up over $90 million of that funding.  AMS was a sponsor and exhibitor at the trade show, where we shared information with stakeholders about the many resources we have to support local and regional food systems. Through our Specialty Crop Block Grant Program and Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program (comprised of the Farmers Market Promotion Program and the Local Food Promotion Program), AMS supports producers, local food entrepreneurs, and rural and urban communities across the country. At the conference, I met many local food producers and stakeholders who have directly benefited from AMS support for local food systems. I emphasized USDA’s continued commitment to this valuable sector and thanked the conference host, FamilyFarmed.org, for their inspired leadership in advancing local foods. Last year, FamilyFarmed.org received an AMS grant for their Good Food Business Accelerator Program, which leverages an impressive collection of partnerships to provide local food startups in the Chicago area with strategic, operating, and financial support. The FarmLogix team, Aramark and the Chicago Public Schools have worked together to add locally-grown produce onto school menus. During the visit, students at Cyrus H. McCormick had a lunch featuring local apples and carrots. (Administrator Anne Alonzo, 2nd from right) USDA Photo Courtesy of Peter Wood. Another highlight of the trip was a visit to my old elementary school, Cyrus H. McCormick, in the urban Latino community where I grew up on Chicago’s South Side. Chicago Public Schools and FarmLogix, another AMS grantee, organized the visit to highlight how school districts are incorporating locally-grown produce to provide kids with fresh, healthy food. We visited the students over their lunch that included local carrots and apples. Later, at a school assembly, they asked me all about my career, education, and working in government. I was in their shoes 30 years ago – it was incredibly moving to connect with them and hopefully inspire them to pursue careers in public service and agriculture. USDA continues to support the local food sector and has identified strengthening local food systems as one of the four pillars of our commitment to rural economic development and job creation. All of us here at USDA are doing all we can to support this sector via the Know your Farmer, Know your Food initiative.

"Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 30,   Today, USDA proposed the establishment of minimum national professional standards and training requirements for school nutrition professionals who manage and operate the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. The standards, another key provision of the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of (HHFKA), aim to institute education and certification standards for school nutrition professionals. These new standards will ensure that school nutrition personnel have the training and tools they need to plan, prepare and purchase healthy products to create nutritious, safe and enjoyable school meals. As a former school nutrition director I can tell you that school nutrition professionals across the country are pleased with the new meal patterns established by the HHFKA, which requires schools to prepare healthier meals for 32 million children each day. Schools are at the forefront of national efforts to improve nutrition and reduce obesity in our Nation’s children. Since the start of the - School Year, I have visited dozens of schools and witnessed students embracing healthier meal options as schools successfully implement the latest lunch, breakfast and snack standards.  In fact, our most our most recent show that roughly 90 percent of schools are reporting that they are meeting the new standards, a 12 percent increase from June . Many school nutrition professionals already complete annual training that is similar to what we are recommending; for others, the standards will be new. These proposed standards will ensure that all school nutrition professionals meet the same national requirements as they prepare healthy meals served in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. The professional standards proposed by USDA will focus on training opportunities and strengthen the school nutrition profession. This proposal would: Create minimum hiring standards for school food authority directors based on a school district’s size; Establish minimum hiring standards for State directors of school nutrition and State distributing agencies; and Require minimum annual training for all new and current school nutrition professionals. School nutrition professionals, educators, and members of the nutrition community from around the country have voiced their support for strengthening school meals programs by setting professional standards. We received a tremendous amount of feedback from State agencies, school districts, and several professional associations as we developed the proposed standards; we now look forward to receiving additional comments that may help us fine tune these standards to ensure the greatest benefit. USDA is committed to working closely with school nutrition directors, managers and staff to meet the proposed requirements once they are in place. Our Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) will continue collaborating with partners to identify free and low-cost training at locations that are convenient and easily accessible. FNS will also be working with our partners to develop an easily accessible national database that will list available trainings by State. As our nation continues to fight childhood obesity, we commend our schools for making so much progress in offering healthier options during the school day.  Many of our kids spend the majority of their waking hours each day in school, and consume half their daily calories from school meals. By enhancing school nutrition careers, we are giving our hard-working and caring professionals the tools and training needed to create a healthy school environment where our children are healthy, engaged, and productive learners. The school nutrition community has expressed their support for establishing professional standards. Click to enlarge.

"NRCS Mississippi in  Conservation  May 05,   Every year a low-oxygen, or hypoxic, area forms in the northern Gulf of Mexico, just below the mouth of the Mississippi River. Fish and other wildlife often avoid hypoxic zones, which can be deadly to marine organisms. Known contributors to the Gulf’s hypoxic zone include runoff from urban areas, land development and agriculture. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) works with farmers and ranchers to help reduce agricultural runoff that may contribute to the hypoxic zone, in part through the Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative (MRBI). This reservoir and drainage ditch are part of a water recycling system in place on Shivers Farm to reduce the amount of sediments that run into the Sunflower River, a tributary of the Mississippi River.  The Mississippi River Basin drains a huge portion of the United States, including parts or all of 31 states. As water drains off land and enters the river, it can transport nutrients from soil, fertilizer, animal wastes and sewage. The river carries water down the continent to the Gulf of Mexico, where any excess nutrients the water contains can stimulate the growth of algae, which consume large amounts of oxygen in the water—creating a hypoxic zone. The zone in the Gulf varies in size, but is often 7,000 or more square miles. Scientists have been studying the area since the s and mapping it since the mid-s.  Shivers Farms, located outside of Indianola, Miss., is one of the farms participating in MRBI to reduce nutrients transported to the Mississippi River and, ultimately, the Gulf of Mexico, with the goal of increasing water quality in both bodies of water. The farm sits on 300 acres along Porter Bayou, and runoff from its lands enters the Sunflower River, eventually flowing into the Gulf. But now about half of the water used on the farm stays on site when it drains off the fields, because the farmer has installed a series of underground pipes, ditches and a storage reservoir, funded in part by  NRCS. This system allows time for nutrients and sediments to settle in the reservoir, which provides irrigation water for the crops. Reusing water improves water quality by reducing the amount of runoff entering the river and helping filter out nutrients and sediments. It provides benefits for farmers, too: the nutrients in the water fertilize the plants, which prefer the warmer reservoir water to cold aquifer water, since the latter takes more energy for them to process. And the reuse of water means that less water is drawn from the aquifer. The farm’s manager is happy with the benefits, and says that he hopes other Delta farmers take advantage of MRBI. In the future, he plans to look into other NRCS conservation programs. MRBI was launched in , and Mississippi is one of 13 states participating. The effort stretches across the 2,350-mile basin from Lake Itasca, Minn. to the Gulf. Find out more about the Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative. Check out more conservation stories on the USDA blog. Follow NRCS on Twitter. This reservoir retains and recycles nearly half of the water used on Shivers Farm. Crops benefit from the warmer surface water, and the Gulf benefits because this reservoir allows time for the sediments and nutrients to settle out of the water.

"APHIS Veterinary Medical Officer, Ames, IA in  Animals  Plants  Research and Science  Jun 30,  Dr. Amy Winter, a Veterinary Medical Officer with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Since childhood I’ve always wanted to be a veterinarian, which makes my position at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) the perfect job for me.  I’m Dr. Amy Winter, a Veterinary Medical Officer with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).  I’m stationed at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.  I joined the staff in Ames in October – only five months after I graduated from veterinary school. My job is to coordinate and perform the testing for the fraudulent specimen surveillance program.  The goal of this program is to ensure that samples submitted for disease testing are accurately represented by the associated submission form(s).  For example, if a submitter sends in 10 samples and the paperwork indicates each sample was from a different animal, tests in our lab verify the documentation.  This helps prevent misrepresentation of the identity or health status of livestock and increases the confidence other countries have in our ability to export healthy, quality American livestock.  The work my colleagues and I do every day is very important.  While we help maintain the confidence and safety of our export markets, we make sure movements of animals within the country are safe, as well. Not all of my work has been done in the lab.  I’d only been with the USDA for a few months, when I was sent out in the field to assist in a disease outbreak.  I spent time in California working as part of the team controlling the Exotic Newcastle Disease outbreak in poultry.  As a relative newcomer, I performed inspections of egg processing facilities, so they could obtain permits necessary to maintain operations.  Such learning experiences have resulted in my longstanding career in veterinary medicine. APHIS and USDA are joining with organizations around the world to celebrate World Veterinary Year by highlighting the work of veterinarians on the USDA blog.  This post is part of a series underscoring the important and diverse work of APHIS veterinarians.  Check back each Thursday as we showcase the work of a different veterinarian.

Facilities like Daisy Hill are going to be especially important, as the demand for elder care facilities increase with the aging of our baby boomer generation. In Kentucky, we have seen an increase in the last decade of nearly 45 percent in the boomers who reached the age of 55-64 – this is according to the U.S. Census.   Their share of the state total population rose from 9.2 percent to 12.ate Center. Kentucky Rural Development State Director Tom Fern (right) speaks at the opening of the Daisy Hill Assisted Living facility in Versailles. USDA Rural Development guaranteed a loan for the facility, creating jobs and providing a quality facility for area seniors. USDA photo. This dramatic increase is only the first wave of “becoming of age” for the baby boomer generation.  We can anticipate the ‘second wave” of boomers to be even more dramatic.  There is no question the demand for assisted living facilities like Daisy Hill will continue the upward trend over the next decade. While the primary focus of assisted living facilities is about providing residents and families with quality services.  There is an equally important secondary focus, and that is to bring opportunities for economic development and jobs to the community. The jobs being created by the opening of Daisy Hill is just the beginning of job creation opportunities for Versailles and surrounding communities.  New opportunities for local businesses to provide products and services will also bring greater economic growth to the community – and hopefully will result in the creation of even more local jobs. The new Daisy Hill Assisted Living facility in Versailles, Ky., provides a bright, welcoming setting for senior citizens. The building was funded with a USDA Business Loan Guarantee. (USDA Photos) USDA Rural Development is multi-faceted in what funding programs it offers. In addition to providing financing for facilities like Daisy Hill, we can work with businesses and economic development organizations to help them secure financing for a variety of business development purposes.

"MPH CHES, Food Safety Education Staff, Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA in  Health and Safety  Dec 16,  Roasting is the recommended method for cooking tender meats. To roast, meat is placed on a rack in a shallow, uncovered pan and is cooked by the indirect dry heat of an oven. The traditional centerpiece of many holiday meals served this time of year is the roast. Whether you use pork, beef, goose, turkey, or chicken, the most popular means to cook your meat of choice is in the oven. The roasting recipe that was handed down to you from your great grandmother may need a little updating though. Whether it asks you to marinate at room temperature overnight, or cook until ‘the juices run clear,’ some instructions in heirloom recipes might be outdated. To help you make the dish your great grandmother intended, we pulled together a list of holiday roasting tips. Beef, Veal, Pork and Lamb: To avoid overcooking beef, veal, pork and lamb roasts use a meat thermometer. These roasts should be removed from the oven when they reach an internal temperature of 145 °F. For safety and quality, allow meat to rest for at least three minutes before carving or consuming. If you’re concerned about serving a dry roast, use a continuous read thermometer or start checking the temperature of your meat earlier then the recipe’s cooking directions. Turkey, Duck, and Goose: Domestic ducklings and geese have a great deal of fat. While it helps them float when swimming, fat is undesirable in a cooked duck. Therefore, it’s recommended to prick or score the skin of a whole duck before cooking so that most of the fat will render out. These birds should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 °F as measured by a food thermometer. Temperatures should be taken in three areas of the bird: the thickest part of the breast, the innermost part of the wing, and the innermost part of the thigh. For more information on safe poultry handling and cooking, read our Thanksgiving material. For approximate cooking times to use in meal planning, visit FoodSafety.gov. For reasons of personal preference, consumers may choose to cook meat to higher temperatures but at the recommended temperatures the food is safe to eat. Following the at FoodSafety.gov will ensure that your roast brings you back to holidays past.

"Director, Supplemental Food Programs Division, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Jul 31,  USDA developed the Loving Support Award of Excellence to recognize and celebrate local agencies that provide exemplary breastfeeding programs and support services. USDA’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, popularly known as WIC, is once again celebrating World Breastfeeding Week, August 1-7. This year’s theme is Sustaining Breastfeeding Together, emphasizing the importance of family and community support for breastfeeding women. And important it is. In fact, thanks to that support along with the dedication and efforts of WIC staff, WIC breastfeeding initiation rates have been steadily rising. We now have two out of three WIC moms initiating breastfeeding. WIC promotes and supports breastfeeding among WIC moms through counseling and educational materials and mother-to-mother peer counseling. The program also provides healthy food packages and referrals to other needed health and social services.  USDA’s national breastfeeding promotion campaign, Loving Support Makes Breastfeeding Work, highlights how family, friends, the health care system and the community are essential for a mom to reach her breastfeeding goals. As part of the celebration for World Breastfeeding Week, 90 WIC local agencies will receive Loving Support Awards of Excellence. These awards recognize exemplary local WIC breastfeeding programs, as well as highlight models to motivate other agencies to strengthen their breastfeeding promotion and support activities. Six state agencies which have achieved the greatest improvement in their breastfeeding rates will receive a breastfeeding performance bonus award. At WIC, breastfeeding promotion and support are a key part of our mission.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Feb 12,  Volunteer snow ranger Conradt Fredell shares his love of skiing and the beautiful landscape of the Arapaho National Forest by taking Loveland Ski Area visitors on an educational tour. The ski area is entirely on Forest Service land. (U.S. Forest Service) Forget the high-priced dinner, artificial moon glow and hurried wait staff this Valentine’s Day. Try, instead, something very different from the tried and true red roses that wilt away or those earrings that she really had hoped would be a ring. Plan a visit to a national forest or grassland. Let a photograph or video be the record of your everlasting love. Please do not carve your names into a tree or other object or in another way deface the beauty of our national forests and grasslands. And if the weather for the recreational activity you would like to pursue makes a Valentine’s Day visit out of the question, consider designing and printing a “Let’s Love the Outdoors Together” coupon with a promise for a hike, bike or other activity during a more heart-warming time of year. Make your Valentine’s destination Love Lake picnic site on the Rio Grande National Forest in Colorado. Open year round, a lovely hike around the small impoundment at the head of Middle Creek can do a heart good. Of course, it is winter. But you could bundle up and cuddle together as you take the snowmobile for a refreshing ride over the snow. Can’t get away from that diamond? Then try Diamond Lake on the Umpqua National Forest in Oregon is a breathtaking mile-high lake that is perfect for a couple who enjoys swimming in the cold yet refreshing waters, fishing in a lake stocked annually with thousands of Rainbow trout or biking along an 11-mile paved trail around the lake. The campground has more than 200 sites to accommodate tents, RVs and trailers. The season begins in May, so don’t forget to make your reservation through Recreation.gov. For a warmer climate, head to Heart Rock on Seeley Creek Trail on the  San Bernardino National Forest in California. The easy hike follows Seeley Creek to the overlook that marks the trails’ end. It is here you will see a heart-shaped hole in the cliff next to a picturesque 20-foot waterfall. Just don’t get too close. You could make Valentine’s Day a family affair at Heart Bar Campground, also on the San Bernardino. The area has tent and camping trailer spaces, picnic tables, toilets, drinking water and parking. Everything you need except for the s’mores. Bring those for a sweet ending to your day. We all know love is fickle, so how about Heartbreak Ridge on the Superior National Forest? The steep ridge, once used for logging, broke many a logger’s heart because during the winter he could not haul up or down the rise. Maybe for this one, you might want to give your loved one a coupon for a spring or summer hike. The forest is in Minnesota, and it’s pretty frigid this time of year. National forests are home to 122 ski areas, like Loveland Ski Area on the Arapaho National Forest in Colorado. Loveland Basin is on the eastern slope of the Continental Divide about 53 miles west of Denver. The ski area, operated under a special-use permit with the agency, has three quad chair lifts, two triple chair lifts, three double chair lifts and one poma surface lift to service 1,570 acres of skiable terrain. Of course, a visit there on Valentine’s Day might just come with a commitment. The ski area is staging its 23rd annual mountaintop matrimony day. The Valentine Lake Northshore Campground has 14 campsites, six of which are located along the shoreline of the lake on the Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana. The three-mile Valentine Lake Trail starts and ends at the campground and is good for a leisurely stroll and a bit of fishing from the pier. Don’t have a valentine? Maybe Cupid shot a few misdirected bows at Double Arrow Lookout on the Lolo National Forest in Montana. The 20-foot tower has amazing views of Seeley Valley and the adjacent Swan Mountains with accommodations for a wonderful stay. But don’t be disheartened. No Valentine’s Day is complete without a special hug. And when it comes to special hugs, there is no better bear hug than from our own Smokey Bear.

"Illinois USDA Public Information Coordinator in  Initiatives  Rural  Technology  Sep 08,  USDA Rural Development’s Illinois State Director Colleen Callahan along with Gov. Pat Quinn, Gibson City contractor Mike Sizemore, and school technology director Terry Sullivan talk about the benefit of high-speed Internet coming to 11 rural Illinois counties thanks to a Recovery Act Broadband award.  The excitement was readily apparent when Rural Development Illinois State Director Colleen Callahan and Governor Pat Quinn announced Aug. 31 that 66,000 Cellular One customers in 11 east central Illinois counties would be getting high speed Internet service.  Cellular Properties CEO/GM Cassy Carter said the company would not be able to provide the high-speed service without the award made available through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  Thanks to this funding, she said they will be bringing one of the best wireless broadband networks in the country to an area that has minimal or no high speed Internet service. We celebrated the Rural Development broadband announcement at the Cellular One store in Danville’s Village Mall with two members of the state senate and scores of others.  Heads nodded in agreement as guests spoke of the benefit broadband will have for rural businesses, schools, health and public safety services, and community and economic development. Terry Sullivan, technology director for a rural school system served by Cellular One, attested to the value of broadband access, saying it will put rural schools on equal footing with larger schools.  State Director Callahan said that seven Illinois projects have been funded through Rural Development’s Broadband Initiative Program in the last two months, affecting tens of thousands of rural Illinois residents.  She told the crowd that USDA is transforming rural America today by providing access to high speed Internet in the same way it transformed the rural landscape with telephone and electric service. Better access to information and improved services are only part of the good news.  Broadband will mean jobs, imminently and down the road.  Mark Sizemore is a local contractor with 30 employees who build telecom towers.  He told me what broadband expansion in this area will mean for his employees and for many others.   Cellular Properties, a privately owned and locally operated company, is providing an additional $11.2 million of private funding for the project.  The State of Illinois also pledged $1 million to the project through the Illinois Jobs Now! public works program. At the close of the celebration, people left in high spirits.  Everyone was united by their hope for the economic future of the area and the spirit of cooperation that made this project happen.

"On September 12, , the Biden-Harris Administration announced key steps to advance biotechnology and biomanufacturing in the United States through the Executive Order on Advancing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Innovation for a Sustainable, Safe, and Secure American Bioeconomy. USDA supports the development of circular bioeconomies, where agricultural resources are harvested, consumed, and regenerated in a sustainable manner. This approach can also create new revenue streams for agricultural producers and ensure that wealth and other economic benefits in the form of jobs and other opportunities are created, and stay, in rural communities. USDA released a fact sheet outlining the Department’s bioeconomy accomplishments (, 128 ), which include $772 million in investments for research, development and infrastructure involving biofuels, fertilizer production, crop innovations, biobased products and more. Enabling the American Bioeconomy Through Building a Resilient Biomass Supply President Biden's Executive Order charged USDA with delivering a plan to support the resilience of the U.S. biomass supply chain for domestic biomanufacturing and biobased product manufacturing, while also advancing food security, environmental sustainability, and the needs of underserved communities. Secretary Vilsack announced the report, “A Plan to Enable the Bioeconomy in America: Building a Resilient Biomass Supply (, 2.8 ),” in March . In developing the Plan, USDA consulted with public stakeholders — as well as federal partners in the Departments of Defense, Energy, Commerce, and Transportation, as well as the National Science Foundation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency. This plan begins with an assessment of the biomass availability and current uses and includes a detailed analysis of biomass supply chain systems, revealing considerations – climate change, food security, environmental justice, and others – that could affect biomass availability. Finally, the Plan presents recommendations for programs, research, development, and demonstration, and policies that could increase biomass availability, build supply chain systems resilience, and expand the use of domestic biomass within the bioeconomy. Alongside the Plan, USDA released an Implementation Framework (, 196 ) that identifies actions USDA will take in the next year to increase the resiliency of the biomass supply chain. The National Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative The Biden-Harris Administration launched the National Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative, informed by a September Executive Order, to advance American biotechnology and biomanufacturing in health, climate change, energy, food security, agriculture, supply chain resilience, and national and economic security. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is working with agencies across the federal government on and strategies on strengthening America’s bioeconomy, and supporting the nation’s innovation ecosystem. OSTP has released a new report, co-authored by USDA, called Harnessing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Research and Development (R&D) to Further Societal Goals (, 2.4 ). The report outlines a vision for what is possible with the power of biotechnology and biomanufacturing, and R&D needs to achieve this ambitious vision.

"USDA Agricultural Research Service Information Staff in  Food and Nutrition  Research and Science  Oct 22,   This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research portfolio.  Americans love, love, love their spuds:  In , per capita consumption of potatoes in the U.S. hit almost 114 pounds, according to USDA’s Economic Research Service. One of our favorite ways to dish up this versatile veggie is in the form of French fries. Of course, deep-frying those potato slices to golden crispness adds extra calories from the oil.  But what if you could indulge your French fry craving with fewer calories? And what if the technique to achieve that was more environmentally friendly than conventional fry preparation? That’s not just some chef’s pipe dream; the scientists of the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) have cooked up a way to do it. After the potatoes are peeled and sliced into strips, but before they’re dunked in the deep-fat fryer, the scientists prep them with three minutes of infrared (IR) heat.  The IR preparation forms a nice, microscopic crust on the fries, which helps reduce their oil uptake. In the ARS experiments, fries that were prepped with three minutes of IR heat at 120 kilowatts per square foot, then deep-fried at about 295 degrees Fahrenheit for seven minutes, had 37.1 percent less oil than fresh-cut fries that didn’t get the IR treatment. As for the flavor of the finished product, more than half of 77 volunteer taste-testers said they found the taste and color of the IR-prepped fries to be no different from conventionally prepared fries.  More than half of the panelists said they preferred the IR fries’ extra crispness. Fries prepped with infrared heat before frying have less fat than conventionally prepared fries, ARS scientists have shown. The IR process is also suitable for fries that are partially processed at a potato processing plant, then frozen and shipped for later “finish-frying.”  Those fries are typically blanched with hot water or steam to inactivate enzymes in the spuds that might otherwise cause undesirable browning. The IR heating blanches the potato strips and gets rid of the unwanted enzymes without using water.  That eliminates the need to air-dry the strips, so processors who opt for the IR method could reduce their water use and maybe their energy bills, too. That means the IR fries could be good news for potato processors, the environment—and our waistlines!

"for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services Kevin Concannon in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Sep 23,  Under Secretary Kevin Concannon discusses SNAP benefits at Park Heights Community Farmers’ Market in Baltimore. I recently visited the Park Heights Community Farmers’ Market in Baltimore, Maryland.  At USDA we’re enthusiastic about farmers markets because they help fulfill two of our primary missions – promoting good nutrition and supporting United States agriculture, especially family farmers.  Farmers’ markets also boost local communities through increased outlets for local farmers. Park Heights is one of nine farmers’ markets in Maryland to accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and one of 97 that accept WIC and Senior Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program checks.  Like thousands across the country, the Park Heights market provides access to farm-fresh, affordable foods for low-income individuals, seniors, children and families. Increasing the number of farmers’ markets that participate in our federal nutrition programs, especially SNAP, is a priority for USDA because farmers markets help introduce low-income families to a wide variety of nutritious foods and help them get into the habit of making healthier choices. I am pleased to say that over the past five years, the number of farmers’ markets participating in SNAP has increased by 250 percent, with over farmers markets participating nationwide. Farmers’ market foods are also important in getting our youngest children off to a healthy start – even before they are born.  In Maryland, more than 42,000 WIC participants have access to fresh, healthy food through the WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program, which serves low-income pregnant women, nursing mothers, their infants, and young children. Nearly 7,000 low-income seniors in Maryland have used Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program benefits at local markets. I really enjoyed my time at the Park Heights Community Farmers Market.  When I think about the time I lived in Maine, Oregon and Iowa, I remember the delicious blueberries, crisp pears and fresh sweet corn – all grown locally.  Hopefully, working together, we can help ensure that all Americans can experience the health and well-being that comes with supporting farmers markets.

Participating in programs like USDA’s Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), is one way that farmers and producers of all sizes can demonstrate to buyers that they are adhering to industry food safety standards.  By making this program more accessible to businesses of all sizes, USDA is creating opportunities for our nation’s small and mid-sized farmers.  Last week I traveled to Atlanta, Ga., for the Produce Marketing Association (PMA) Fresh Summit to discuss the expansion of our GroupGAP Program this coming spring. The program is an expansion of our Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) Audit Program, which provides third-party certification services to verify that operations are following industry-recognized food safety practices as well as recommendations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The pilot was supported by funding and technical expertise from the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and the Wallace Center at Winrock International.

"Posted by L.F. Chambers, Office of Communication, and Michael Fracasso, Minerals and Geology Management, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Apr 05,  A Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth found by Barb Beasley during a Passport in Time excavation in the Late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation on the Custer National Forest in South Dakota on June 22, . Unlike mammals that only possess two sets of teeth during their lifetime, dinosaurs replaced worn teeth by shedding them continuously throughout their lives. A single Tyrannosaurus may have shed hundreds or even thousands of teeth during its lifetime. U.S. Forest Service photo by Rhonda Fore. The big female sniffed at the dry Late Cretaceous air as she trotted – delicately, considering her 7-ton frame – along a game trail through a stand of towering conifers, whose needled lower branches trembled slightly at her passing. Tiny mammals scurried in the underbrush of magnificent ferns and little blue flowers. A small flock of red birds rose from the scant cover of a magnolia as the dinosaur passed, their calls carried on the wind, sending other distant flocks to flight in this corner of what is today the Custer National Forest in South Dakota. The Tyrannosaurus rex in her prime was the undisputed queen of her forest. Pausing to sniff the breeze, her nostrils flared as she determined that the rotting carcass she’d been tracking all morning was close now. She continued on toward the river – in just a few more miles she would find the delicious remains of an Edmontosaurus. As she ate, her jaws rending tendon and bone with more than 5 tons of pressure on the dead duck-billed dinosaur’s thigh, several of her teeth – built like a cross between a steak knife and a railroad spike – broke loose and came to rest along the debris-strewn shore of the river. Soon after that driving rains flooded the riverbed and washed the teeth and other bones downstream where they separated and settled out onto sandy point bars forming at bends in the river. There, they were covered more and more deeply through succeeding years in sediments laid down by floods, volcanism and the dust of ages. As millennia passed, the strata above piled higher and the organic material in the teeth and bones was slowly replaced by minerals. The sand that surrounded them became cemented to form a rocky matrix known today as the Hell Creek Formation. The cycads and conifers of the Late Cretaceous gave way to new trees, birds, flowers and mammals. Species evolved and disappeared, leaving imprints of their own in the strata above the dinosaur remains. Millions more years of wind and rain then began to erode the stone away, finally exposing a time-blackened tooth to sunlight for the first time in 66 million years. That’s how one of those new mammals, a Homo sapiens, who happened to work for the U.S. Forest Service, came to find it. Barbara Beasley, regional paleontologist, was leading a crew of 20 volunteers when she found the tooth just a few inches away from where she had been swinging an awl moments before. “These teeth are so rare, at first you aren’t totally sure it’s what you’ve found,” said Beasley. “Then once you pick it up, you’re just in awe. It’s a real adrenaline-pumping moment.” Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton is on display in the Dinosaurs hall at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.

A local 4-H group was visiting the dig site, and the kids clambered to touch the serrations, a visceral connection to an ancient world and the some of the wonder that can be found on the national forests and grasslands. Fossils of various types have been found on nearly two-thirds of Forest Service lands, most notably in the western United States. Beasley and her colleague Bruce Schumacher have been coordinating volunteer-staffed Passport in Time paleontological excavations to conserve fossil resources in various locations in Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Nebraska and Colorado since . “For a lot of volunteers, working on a dig is a dream-come-true,” said Beasley. “One of the best parts of working for the Forest Service is getting to provide these sorts of opportunities – our volunteers have been 10-year-old kids with their parents, all the way up to people in their 80s.”  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Tags:  Custer National Forest  Forestry  FS  South Carolina","What geological processes contributed to the discovery of a 66-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth in the Hell Creek Formation, including the erosion of stone and exposure to sunlight?","Volcanism, floods, dust accumulation, and millions of years of wind and rain erosion led to the formation of the Hell Creek Formation, which ultimately exposed a 66-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth to sunlight."
"Farm Loan Officer, Winchester, TN in  Initiatives  Rural  Apr 18,   Across our communities, young farmers are taking out loans, rolling up their sleeves and taking part in the American Dream in hopes of becoming future farmers with the ability to own a farm of their own one day. Rebecca Hatcher and Jake Broadway are members of the Grundy County High School Future Farmers of America. When they decided to participate in the 4-H market steer project they contacted the Winchester Farm Service Agency (FSA) office about a youth loan.  After receiving the loan, each purchased a market steer to show in 4-H shows in the area and the nearby county fair. Their plan is to market and sell the steers this summer and save the profit for college. Rebecca’s father, Wade Hatcher, is sponsoring both steers at his farm. Rebecca Hatcher and Jake Broadway got their first taste of the cattle business through an FSA Youth Loan.  Rebecca had three years of FSA Youth Loans for the 4-H Market Swine program in Florida before relocating to Tennessee where her family purchased a farm. Although this will be Jake’s first experience entering the market steer project, he has three years of farming experience helping his uncle with chickens and working with his dad, Jeffery Broadway, performing daily farm chores. The market steer project is designed to give the applicant a sense of responsibility and instill a love for cattle as well as an appreciation for the importance of the individual’s role in agriculture and society. Participation in this project was made possible when Rebecca and Jake each applied for and received a FSA Youth Loan through the Farm Service Agency. Rebecca is the daughter of Heidi and Wade Hatcher. Jake is the son of Debbie and Jeffery Broadway. The Farm Service Agency’s Youth Loan program provides opportunities through financial assistance and business planning to help rural youth in building their future in agriculture, while ensuring the future of family farms.  FSA Youth Loans are available for youth between the ages of 10 and 21, who are involved with 4-H, FFA or other similar agriculturally focused organizations. The project must be agriculturally related and produce a modest income. Rebecca and Jake are proud to say that they got their start in the cattle business with help from the FSA Youth Loan program.

"Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Aug 14,  The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) annual report on the Expenditures on Children by Families has found that a middle-income family with a child born in can expect to spend about $241,080 for food, shelter, and other necessities associated with child rearing expenses over the next 17 years. How much will that little bundle of joy cost? According to USDA’s Cost of Raising a Child report, the answer for a child born in is $241,080 for food, shelter and other necessities over the next 17 years, which translates to about $301,970 when adjusted for inflation! Speaking as a father and a grandfather, I know how much we as parents want to give our children the tools they need to excel at anything they set their minds to—from the essentials, like a roof over their heads and a quality education, to the fun stuff, like a brand new soccer ball, piano lessons or a trip to summer camp. We work hard to ensure our children’s future happiness and success each and every day. But this next generation faces a unique challenge that threatens their future health and well being: a growing health crisis, in the form of diet- and obesity-related diseases. And despite encouraging recent on declining rates of early childhood obesity, nearly a third of our nation's young people are at risk for preventable diseases like type-2 diabetes and heart disease. Preventable diseases have serious consequences – which is why health experts tell us that our current generation of children may well have a shorter lifespan than their parents. In light of this, perhaps the most important leg up we can give to our children is a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, whole grains and other nutrients they need to grow up healthy and strong. We at USDA have been doing our part by making it a top priority to improve child nutrition and provide science-based nutrition information and advice so that the healthy choice is the easy choice for American parents and children. Thirty two million American students now have healthier and more nutritious school breakfasts, lunches and snacks due to improved nutrition standards implemented as a result of the historic Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of .

"Director, Supplemental Food Programs Division, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 01,  USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack declared August 1-7 “National WIC Breastfeeding Week” World Breastfeeding Week is celebrated around the world each year during the first week of August to promote breastfeeding and highlight its importance to the health of mothers and babies. This year’s theme is “Breastfeeding: A Key to Sustainable Development.”  USDA’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) joins the celebration as WIC promotes breastfeeding all year long as the optimal choice for moms who are medically able.  We support breastfeeding WIC moms through counseling and educational materials, peer counselors, a specially-tailored food package, and breastfeeding aids like breast pumps.  USDA’s successful national breastfeeding promotion campaign, Loving Support Makes Breastfeeding Work, serves as the foundation of our breastfeeding activities.  It emphasizes the importance of support from family and friends, from the health care system, and from the community. All have key roles to play in providing the support a breastfeeding mother needs. To recognize and honor the diligent and dedicated efforts of the state and local WIC Programs that promote and support breastfeeding, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack declared August 1-7 “National WIC Breastfeeding Week.”  During this time, USDA will honor 83 WIC local agencies that provide exemplary breastfeeding programs and support services with a “Loving Support Award of Excellence.” In addition, eight WIC state agencies will receive a “WIC Breastfeeding Performance Bonus Award” for outstanding achievement in improving breastfeeding rates among WIC participants.  Due in large part to the dedication and efforts of WIC staff across state and local agencies, two out of three WIC moms are now initiating breastfeeding. If you are interested in resources to celebrate World Breastfeeding Week/National WIC Breastfeeding Week, visit WIC’s Loving Support website.

"Announcing the U.S. Tall Wood Building Prize Competition to Innovate Building Construction  Cross-posted from the White House Rural Council:  As part of the Obama administration's commitment to mitigate climate change, USDA, in partnership with the Softwood Lumber Board and the Binational Softwood Lumber Council, is announcing the U.S. Tall Wood Building Prize Competition. This competitive prize, open to teams of architects, engineers, and developers, will showcase the architectural and commercial viability of advanced wood products like Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) in tall buildings. Advanced wood products are becoming the latest innovation in tall building construction. Products like CLT are flexible, strong, and fire resistant. In construction, wood products can be used as a successful and sustainable alternative to concrete, masonry, and steel. Using wood also reduces greenhouse gas emissions by storing carbon and simultaneously offsetting emissions from conventional building materials. By some estimates, the near term use of CLT and other emerging wood technologies in buildings 7-15 stories could have the same emissions control affect as taking more than 2 million cars off the road for one year.

"in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Oct 02,   This October, just like every other month during the school year, school menus will feature an array of products from local and regional farmers, ranchers, and fishermen. Kids of all ages will dig up lessons in school gardens, visit farms, harvest pumpkins, and don hair nets for tours of processing facilities. Science teachers – and English, math, and social studies instructors, too – will use food and agriculture as a tool in their classrooms, so that lessons about the importance of healthy eating permeate the school learning environment. An investment in the health of America’s students through Farm to School is also an investment in the farmers and ranchers who grow the food and an investment in the health of local economies. In school year -, schools purchased $386 million in local food from farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and food processors and manufacturers. And an impressive 56 percent of school districts report that they will buy even more local foods in future school years. Farm to school programs exist in every state in the country. For example, the Lake County Community Development Corporation in Ronan, Montana a 40 percent increase in revenues to farmers based on school sales alone. The Southwest Georgia Project, a community development non-profit, notes that “We’re actually seeing our farmers have hope. The farm to school program allows them to see an opportunity for a sustainable living for themselves and their families.” Testimonials in a USDA video released this week highlight the degree to which farm to school programs support healthy eating behaviors among children and provide positive economic impacts to local communities. Strengthening local food systems is one of the four pillars of USDA's commitment to rural economic development, and Farm to School programs can play an important role. To support the expansion of Farm to School programs into more schools and expand opportunity for farmers and ranchers, USDA offers grants, training, and technical assistance. Since the start of our Farm to School Grant Program in fiscal year , for example, USDA has awarded grants to 139 projects spanning 46 states and the District of Columbia, serving more than 16,200 schools and 4.55 million students, nearly 43% of whom live in rural communities. Just this week, I visited the George Washington Carver Elementary School in Richmond, Virginia and the Virginia State Fair to announce more than $52 million in new USDA grants nationwide to support the development of the local, regional and organic food sectors. You can learn more about USDA’s investments at www.usda.gov/results. At USDA we’re transforming school food and creating a healthier next generation. We’re happy to celebrate in October, but we’re going to be cheering for schools with farm to school programs all year long. When students have experiences such as tending a school garden or visiting a farm, they’re more likely to make healthy choices in the cafeteria. I see the change every time I visit a cafeteria; students light up when meeting their farmer. They are piling their trays full of healthy foods, they are learning healthy habits that they will carry with them for life, and they are learning an appreciation for the American farmer that they will carry with them their entire lives.

"USDA Signs Three International Agreements Supporting Animal Health and Global Trade  International trade is a key factor in the economic and financial stability of many countries.  Trade restrictions resulting from an animal disease outbreak can have devastating economic effects.  With this in mind, USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service signed three international agreements on this very topic last month at a meeting of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) in Paris, France.  These agreements will make it easier to maintain safe and fair trade of animals and animal products if an animal disease outbreak occurs. They emphasize the cooperation and understanding of the countries involved to promote shared knowledge, and resources, which can be crucial during an animal health event. The three arrangements, signed by the United States, relate to the International Animal Health Emergency Reserve (also signed by Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom), the Sharing of Vaccines for Foot and Mouth Disease (Australia, Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand), and Supporting the Recognition of Zoning for Foreign Animal Disease Outbreaks (Australia, Canada, and New Zealand).

"USDA Office of Communications in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 03,  A portrait of Dr. Joan Younger Meek, Master of Science (MS), Registered Dietician (RD), International Board Certified Lactation (IBCLC) Fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics (FAAP), Chair, American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Breastfeeding. Throughout August, we will be sharing stories and resources on the importance of a healthy start for our children and families. The following guest blog highlights the important work of our partner the American Academy of Pediatrics. The association is dedicated to the health and well-being of infants, children, adolescents and young adults. In honor of National Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program Breastfeeding Week, Dr. Joan Younger Meek discusses the benefits of breastfeeding and the role WIC plays in supporting mothers and newborns. By Joan Younger Meek, MD, MS, RD, IBCLC, FAAP, Chair, American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Breastfeeding Breastfeeding is the most beneficial way a mother can nourish her baby. Breastfed infants have reduced risk of infections, asthma, obesity, diabetes, certain childhood cancers, and SIDS, compared with formula fed infants. In addition to its nutritional benefits, breastfeeding supports the baby’s developing immune system and helps to protect against respiratory and intestinal infections.  This is especially important for babies born prematurely. Breastfeeding may be linked to lower obesity rates in adolescence and adulthood. And the benefits extend to mothers as well—breastfeeding moms have a reduced risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, heart disease, and postpartum depression compared to mothers who don't breastfeed. These are just some of the reasons why the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends mothers exclusively breastfeed for about the first six months, and to continue doing so as other foods are introduced, for 1 year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infant. One of the most powerful programs to support breastfeeding is WIC, the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. In existence for 40 years, WIC serves more than 8 million pregnant women, infants and children, including more than half of all infants born in the United States. WIC provides nutritious foods, nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and referrals to health care and social services for millions of low-income women, their infants, and young children who are determined to be nutritionally at-risk. Among the ways WIC helps promote breastfeeding is through its peer counseling program, where women receive support and counseling on how to initiate breastfeeding from trained peer counselors, many of whom were former WIC participants themselves. WIC also provides lactation consultants, classes and support groups, education materials and hotlines for questions. These support systems work; the rates of women who initiate breastfeeding in WIC have risen dramatically from 44.5% in to 67.1% in , higher rates than non-WIC participants. Additionally, WIC provides breastfeeding mothers with a larger and more varied food package, and to encourage mothers to begin breastfeeding, WIC no longer routinely provides formula for the first month after birth. As we celebrate the benefits of breastfeeding and WIC’s role encouraging breastfeeding, we must also make sure that WIC has the support it needs to continue providing children the best possible start in life. That means increasing the federal investment in the breastfeeding peer counseling program. That also means maintaining the parts of WIC that work best—its evidence-based food packages, its adjunctive eligibility with Medicaid, and its vital link with the health care system — and making improvements to strengthen its reach, like allowing states to extend eligibility through age 6 and streamlining enrollment. As a pediatrician, I have the benefit of seeing the importance of WIC firsthand, in the new mother who is able to meet her breastfeeding goals through the support of a peer counselor or in the healthy toddler whose mother can provide more fruits and vegetables to enrich her diet. I am proud to celebrate National WIC Breastfeeding Week by recognizing the many ways WIC helps families to ensure that their babies get the healthiest possible start in life.

"Conservation  Jun 16,   Illinois NRCS  The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Illinois is working to get the word out on the new Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and encourage signup by landowners who may have heard about the program but are still “on the fence.”  CSP is a voluntary conservation program that encourages producers to address resource concerns in a comprehensive manner by undertaking additional conservation activities and improving, maintaining, and managing existing conservation activities. Kevin Green, conservation farmer and partner of both NRCS and the local Soil and Water Conservation District, is a strong supporter of CSP and helped spread the word about the program by hosting a “CSP Field Day” on his farm in Vermilion County, Illinois. He values CSP because it rewards him for the conservation work he’s already done on his farm and it helps him do even more. Devin Brown of the Illinois Stewardship Alliance (ISA) helped organize the event. ISA is a strong NRCS partner in Illinois that supports conservation and conservation programs. The group observed some of Kevin’s easy-to-implement conservation practices and asked Kevin and local NRCS District Conservationists many questions. As a result, NRCS expects to receive a few more CSP enrollment applications from the local field office. Kudos to Mr. Green and Mr. Brown for a great CSP field day! Kevin Green (center, pointing) points out one of the many conservation practices on his Vermilion County Illinois farm, which is currently enrolled in NRCS’ Conservation Stewardship Program.

"Agricultural Marketing Services Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Aug 05,  Click to enlarge image. Farmers markets have become a critical ingredient to our nation’s economy, food systems, and communities. Connecting rural to urban, farmer to consumer, and fresh ingredients to our diets, farmers markets are becoming economic and community centerpieces in cities and towns across the U.S. Over the weekend, I had the opportunity to kick off National Farmers Market Week at a wonderfully diverse and thriving market—the Columbia Heights Community Marketplace in Washington, DC.  Columbia Heights represents what I envision many farmers markets are like– a market with a deep sense of community that provides local residents with access to fresh, locally produced fruit, vegetables, meats, baked goods, and much more.  It’s also a place where neighbor meets neighbor, and the many benefits of having a farmers market nearby are felt throughout the community. When food is produced, processed, distributed and sold all within the same region, more money stays in the local economy.  This leads to economic development and job creation.  Farmers markets provide opportunities for small farmers and businesses to sell their products, and they help meet the growing demand for locally produced food.  Being able to quickly and directly market to the consumer gives farmers important income opportunities without the added costs of shipping, storage and inventory control. Another growing feature for markets across that nation is the acceptance of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Women, Infants and Children (WIC) benefits.  By accepting SNAP benefits, farmers markets are providing access to a wide variety of fresh, healthy products.  In fact, in over $16 million in SNAP redemptions were made at farmers markets across the country! Beyond the economic and business benefits, farmers markets give communities across the country access to fresh, healthy foods, especially in urban and rural areas where shopping options may be limited.  What began as a business necessity for many small farmers has evolved into a social event for entire communities, with many families and patrons viewing a trip to the Saturday morning market as the start of their social weekend. As markets grow, new features like live music, cooking demonstrations, gardening tips and educational opportunities are added.  Businesses that surround farmers markets also benefit from the additional foot traffic that the market brings. As of today, there are over 8,000 markets listed in our National Farmers Market Directory, demonstrating the continued demand for these community-oriented markets and the many contributions they make to their local economies. I hope you’ll join us in celebrating them all during National Farmers Market Week. Visit and support your local farmers market or find a new one to visit. Try new foods and enjoy the wonderful, fresh produce offered. Watch as your children learn more about the food they eat and where it comes from.  And reconnect with your local farmers, vendors, neighbors and community.

"Introduction: The Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) is an annual organizational climate survey administered by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that assesses how employees jointly experience policies, practices, and procedures characteristic of their agency and its leadership.  It offers insight into whether, and to what extent, workplace conditions characteristic of successful organizations are present at their organization by tracking employee perceptions in many critical areas including workplace experience, agency leadership, and employee engagement, among other things. At an agency-wide level, FEVS is an important tool for USDA to assess the success of improvement initiatives, identify aspects for workplace improvements, and shape human resource policies and programs.  Additional information about the FEVS can be found on the OPM website. OPM administered the FEVS to all non-political, full-time, part-time, permanent, and intermittent Federal employees onboard as of November .  Per the Annual Employee Survey (AES) regulations (5 CFR Part 250; Subpart C - Employee Surveys), USDA is posting our FEVS results. This brief provides an assessment of the results and highlights our employee engagement improvement strategy. Interpretation of USDA’s Results: The OPM FEVS was conducted at USDA for 8 weeks starting the week of May 8th and closing on July 7th. OPM sent a survey invitation to 84,437 eligible USDA employees, of which, 48,358 employees responded, resulting in a final adjusted response rate of 55.34%. USDA saw a 5% increase in its FEVS final adjusted response rate when compared to (50.06%) – outpacing Very Large Agencies and Government-wide percentages by double digits. Table 1: USDA vs. Government-wide FEVS Response Rates  Fiscal Year  USDA Response Rate  64%  55%  51%  46%  46%  51%  55%  Government-wide Response Rate  46%  41%  43%  44%  34%  32%  39%  Very Large Agencies  41%  37%  39%  41%  29%  35%  35% The OPM FEVS results are reported across five indices: 1) Employee Engagement, 2) Global Satisfaction, 3) Performance Confidence, 4) Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA), and 5) Employee Experience. The Employee Engagement Index consists of three sub-indices: Leaders Lead, Supervisors, and Intrinsic Work Experience. The DEIA index is designed to align with Executive Order 5: Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce and consists of four sub-indices: Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility. The Employee Experience Index is new to the OPM FEVS and measures the extent to which employees are engaged by their work and their organization. This index seeks to understand employees' perceptions relative to their experiences at work in response to their interactions with the organization (i.e., job and organizational attachment). This index gives agencies another tool for assessing whether actions to improve engagement have had the intended effect. When compared to the prior year's results, USDA’s results indicate an improvement in FEVS scores across all 4 historical indices (Employee Engagement, Global Satisfaction, Performance Confidence, and DEIA). Notably, the results show a substantial increase in the Global Satisfaction Index (60.71%), which increased by 1.86% compared to the score (58.85%). The Leaders Lead sub-index (59.05%) continues to be the lowest-scoring Employee Engagement sub-index. However, the results show a significant improvement in the sub-index score, which increased by 3.65% compared to the score (56.41%). Although the score remains below the 65% positive response rate strength threshold, USDA is trending in the right direction. Conversely, the Supervisors sub-index (82.09%) was the highest-scoring Employee Engagement sub-index. The following tables show USDA’s through FEVS results across all five key indices, including an analysis of how USDA performed compared to Government-wide and Very Large Agencies’ results.

"Deputy Administrator, AMS Transportation and Marketing Program in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Nov 20,  An infographic looking at how food hubs are building businesses and sustaining communities. Click to view a larger version. Food is a great equalizer.  Whether sharing it with loved ones around our holiday table or worrying about how we’re going to fit lunch in to our busy work days--food is something we all have in common.  But we don’t always think about the path it takes to get to our plates or even the store shelves.  And while there are many different ways it gets to us, we’re seeing food hubs play an increasingly important role for everyone along the way--farmer to corner store, chef to school lunch. Food hubs are innovative business models emerging more and more across the country. They bring farmers and suppliers together, with 81 percent of food hubs focusing on increasing opportunities for local farms and allowing smaller producers to pool their products and fulfill larger contracts. Ninety-one percent of food hubs are near cities, connecting rural farmers to larger suburban and urban communities.  Oftentimes, farmers who work with food hubs offer a wider variety of products and are able to continue selling their goods later into the growing season.  That translated into an average of over $3.7 million in sales in the last year.  And USDA’s efforts have helped expand the number of regional food hubs operating around the country.  There are over 230, a 65 percent increase since . Seventy-six percent of food hubs work almost exclusively with small-to-mid-sized growers. Without that support, many of these farmers would not have enough capital to own their own trucks, refrigeration units or warehouse space. By working together through the food hubs, they support each other while building their business.  It’s a recipe for financial success that helps sustain the local community in a major way. USDA’s Regional Food Hub Resource Guide, released by the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) in , gives lot of good information on food hubs and how they support the growth and development of regional food systems. For many food hub participants, there’s an understanding that the growth of their business can be tied to the improving health of their local community.  And they take the opportunity to put that belief into practice.  For example, 75 percent donate food to hunger relief organizations and food banks.  Forty-seven percent offer cooking and nutrition education within the community.  And 52 percent believe that supporting area farmers is their primary mission.  They also contribute to their state’s economic bottom line, returning 55 to 95 percent of their spending locally through bank services, employee benefits, supplies and utilities. That’s not to say that there aren’t some challenges.  Like any modern business, food hubs face some common challenges.  Managing smart growth while balancing supply and demand is a tough line to walk.  Part of that includes increasing staff when needed and securing enough product.  But the entrepreneurial spirit that sustains the innovation of most food hubs is a great foundation to work from to better address these challenges. Food hubs are helping producers of all sizes grow and thrive, which in turn supports the economic health and well-being of our diverse local communities. USDA is a proud supporter of food hubs and other players in the local food effort.  We’re committed to understanding this model, how they serve communities and how we can help them continue to succeed. To help show the rapid growth of the local food market across the nation, USDA created the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass – an online tool illustrating the many places USDA has supported these opportunities nationwide. In addition to creating a food hub portal, that includes a collection of research news and information, AMS released its report: Moving Food Along the Value Chain: Innovations in Regional Food Distribution report.  The report provides information on how producers can tap into the growing commercial demand for local and regional food, create additional economic opportunities and expand access to healthy food. You can also delve deeper into the food hub facts and figures cited in this blog and our infographic by reading the survey results published by Michigan State University. The growth of our local markets also has an impact on folks who are new to the business of agriculture. As the average age of the American farmer increases, we need more new folks on the farm. Local and regional markets help these new farmers – who include returning veterans, immigrants and more women than ever before – get started and sell their product. USDA intends to continue our record support for food hubs and other regional and local food systems and we’re committed to programs that serve all Americans. Whether it’s through offering loans, engaging industry leaders in policy discussions or helping open doors to new business opportunities, our goal is to make sure that we support all of U.S. agriculture. But to do so, we need a Food, Farm and Jobs Bill as soon as possible.

"in  Initiatives  Feb 24,   This week young people across the country are celebrating FFA Week.  During this time, members of Future Farmers of America (FFA) get a chance to educate the public about agriculture, but also to learn more about the industry themselves. In January, in his State of the Union address, President Obama focused on the importance of providing a world-class education to all American youth.  He called on us to out-educate our global competitors so that we keep great jobs here and strengthen the American economy in the long-term. FFA is playing an important role in providing that education for hundreds of thousands of America’s young people. FFA is providing opportunities for young people to learn about food and agriculture, to help them become community leaders, and to prepare them to compete for the jobs of the 21st century.  It is teaching younger generations how to make informed choices in agriculture and natural resources systems – a skill set that will grow our next generation of farmers. It is preparing students for successful careers in agriculture that stimulate the economy and supply our nation with food, feed and fiber we rely on. I am proud to say that in addition to FFA, and other youth organizations like 4H, USDA supports universities that are training the next generation of innovators.  America has an aging farming population, and as the folks running our farm lands grow older, we look toward the future for a group that is ready and able to take over this important sector of the American economy. Last month I visited with FFA to talk to the students that comprise this year’s National FFA Officer Team. I challenged them to spend time with their friends and other FFA members to think about what they envision for the future of agriculture.  I told them that USDA was committed to continuing our work in educating the next generation of producers and agricultural professionals.  And I signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to deepen USDA’s involvement with FFA and to supplement its important mission. At the end of the day, we need to cultivate a community of young people who pursue a future in agriculture so together we can revitalize not only rural America, but the country as a whole. Today’s students must become tomorrow’s farmers, ranchers, growers, scientists and agriculturalists.  These folks will guarantee us a safe and affordable food supply, and preserve our land for generations.  It is for these reasons that groups such as FFA are integral to our success as a nation.

A webinar next Thursday will show Spanish-language producers how to get pricing, shipping, volume and other detailed information for hundreds of commodities. Photo courtesy Marty Ringlein This month, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is holding a webinar about agency services and programs in Spanish.  The webinar, entitled, An Introduction to USDA's Fruit and Vegetable Market News, will be Thursday, Nov. 15, , from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. Eastern time.  The webinar will provide insight and information on using the Market News portal.  Through the portal, users can generate free, customized on pricing, shipping, volume and other detailed information for hundreds of agricultural commodities at domestic and international wholesale markets, production areas and ports of entry.  Dr. Luis Fernando Palmer, AMS Fruit and Vegetable Market News international branch chief, will explain how the portal works and how your business can benefit from the information. This is the second in-language AMS webinar since October.  The first, entitled, An introduction to the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA), provided information to help fruit and vegetable growers, packers, shippers, processors, wholesalers and retailers better understand how PACA establishes and enforces fair business practices across the industry.  Patrick Romero, PACA’s Western regional office director, hosted the webinar and shared insights into how PACA helps companies resolve business disputes while protecting the industry and, ultimately, your business. This particular set of webinars is timely, given that the U.S. recently celebrated National Hispanic Heritage month.  According to the most recent National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Census of Agriculture, more than 66,600 farms covering over 24.6 million acres of U.S. farmland are operated by individuals of Hispanic, Latino and Spanish origin.  The fact is, more and more farmers, producers and others in the industry have asked for Spanish-language resources and AMS is making every effort to meet their needs.  It’s not the first time we’ve held in-language webinars and I’m pleased to say that it won’t be the last.  As the produce industry continues to diversify, USDA will look for more ways to engage these growing audiences. The webinars, part of a series of free, interactive information tutorials about AMS programs and services, will also include an interactive question and answer section.

"Research Microbiologist, Agricultural Research Service, National Animal Disease Center in  Animals  Health and Safety  Research and Science  Nov 20,  ARS remains committed to conducting research to our overall understanding of antimicrobial resistance in swine pathogens. This week is World Antibiotic Awareness Week and USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) remains committed to using a “One Health” approach in conducting research that will identify solutions to help prolong the usefulness of a very precious resource—antibiotics. For example, ARS research includes understanding how common production practices might impact antimicrobial resistance and understanding whether certain animal pathogens may be a public health concern. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one bacteria type that is a public health concern because of its resistance to some antibiotics which can make it difficult to treat. MRSA has been found in livestock – mainly in swine. One particular MRSA strain, called ST5, has raised additional public health concerns because it is a major cause of human infections globally. To address these public health concerns, ARS conducted research to determine whether production practices like using in-feed zinc as an antidiarrheal agent contribute to the emergence and spread of MRSA in U.S. swine populations, and if ST5 bacterial isolates from swine and from humans are genetically related. ARS demonstrated that applying zinc in feed does not play a role in the prevalence of livestock-associated MRSA ST5 in the U.S. swine population. More importantly, ARS found that ST5 isolates from agricultural sources are genetically distinct and separate from clinical MRSA ST5 isolates obtained from human clinical settings. Specifically, isolates from agricultural sources were found to be extremely similar to each other within farms and lacked genes typically carried by human isolates. Collectively, ARS indicate that livestock-associated MRSA and clinical MRSA ST5 isolates are genetically distinct and transmission and/or genetic exchange between them is not currently occurring based on the findings in this study. ARS researchers are continuing to build on these results to further determine the distribution and impact of livestock-associated-MRSA ST5 outside of the livestock setting. As we celebrate World Antibiotic Awareness Week, we remain committed to a “One-Health” approach to prevent, not just react to, complex public and animal health issues. The information gained from these studies is important to our overall understanding of animal pathogens, and any potential risks to public health.

"Chief, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Nov 12,  NRCS is working with farmers and ranchers to create and enhance habitat for monarchs. NRCS photo by Gene Barickman. No matter where you grew up, you are likely familiar with monarch butterflies. You may have childhood memories from science class when you watched those peculiar green caterpillars transform into beautiful butterflies. Depending on where you live, you may have seen masses of their orange-and-black wings fluttering in the sky while the butterflies were on their annual cross-country migratory journey. Today, the iconic monarch butterfly is under pressure. Habitat loss has led to a steady decrease in their numbers. We’re working to reverse that trend. This year, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is launching a targeted effort in ten key states to create and enhance habitat for the iconic monarch on private lands. Through this effort, we’re partnering with farmers and ranchers to voluntarily establish habitat for the monarch on working lands while ensuring America’s farms and ranches stay productive. Because monarch butterflies are often on the move, they need to have the right plants at the right time along their migration route, including milkweed, which is the sole food source for monarch caterpillars. We worked with butterfly experts across the United States to choose the best plant species for monarchs based on geographic location and value to monarchs. We’re focusing efforts in the southern Great Plains and Midwest – two regions at the heart of the monarch’s migration. In the southern Great Plains, our work will focus on rangelands and ways to improve the health of pastures so they provide good forage for livestock and food for monarchs. In the Midwest we’re focusing on integrating plantings into croplands and making improvements to wetland areas. We’re looking for private landowners in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas and Wisconsin who are interested in making monarch-friendly improvements to their land. These efforts not only benefit butterflies, they also strengthen agricultural operations, support other beneficial insects and wildlife and improve our natural resources. When we designed this effort, we pulled together a variety of tools from the Farm Bill toolbox. In fiscal year , we’re making available $2 million through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and $2 million through the former Wetlands Reserve Program for existing wetland easements. Additionally, we created new enhancements through the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) to establish monarch habitat. The CSP enhancement assistance is available nationwide. We’re also working with the broader federal family on this effort. NRCS’ effort contributes to a multi-agency, international strategy to reverse the monarch’s population decline in North America. The Obama administration, through the National Strategy to Protect Pollinators and Their Habitat, has a goal of increasing the eastern population of monarchs to 225 million by .

"What is a native plant? A native plant is a plant that is a part of the balance of nature that has developed over hundreds or thousands of years in a particular region or ecosystem. Note: The word native should always be used with a geographic qualifier (that is, native to New England [for example]). Only plants found in this country before European settlement are considered to be native to the United States. There are many benefits of landscaping and gardening with native plants including conserving water, protecting soil from erosion, and creating habitat and providing food for many different animals including birds, pollinators, and small mammals. Simply by growing native plants gardeners can bring enormous beauty to a community and joy to its residents. In addition, native plants are easy-to-grow and require minimal maintenance. Fall is widely considered the best time of year to plant native trees, shrubs, grasses, vines and perennials.

"National Coordinator for Local and Regional Food Systems in  Health and Safety  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Apr 08,   Lou’s Gourmet Sausage, a small family business run by the Vinciguerra brothers of Cleveland, Ohio, takes sausage seriously.  For over fifty years, the company has been supplying Cleveland restaurants and grocery stores with Sicilian, Andouille, Cajun, mild and hot chicken and veal sausages. But despite strong demand for its products, it took a USDA program to make Lou’s sausage available outside Ohio. In , Ohio was the first state to join USDA’s Cooperative Interstate Shipment program (CIS).  The program, authorized under the Farm Bill, allows inspected and approved small state-inspected meat processors, like Lou's Gourmet Sausage, to bear an official USDA Mark of Inspection and ship meat and poultry across state lines. Previously, only products from federally inspected plants could be sold in other states. To participate in the program, state certified plants like Lou's Sausage work with USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) to integrate their systems to meet federal inspection standards.  Once inspected and approved for compliance, these smaller plants can ship across state lines and are poised for bigger market opportunities. This week, Indiana followed Ohio's lead and joined North Dakota and Wisconsin to become the fourth state to participate in the Cooperative Interstate Shipment program. Each time a state works with FSIS to participate in the program, it is expanding market opportunities for the region's small meat and poultry producers – many smaller producers process their animals at small state-inspected plants – while strengthening state and local economies and increasing consumer access to safe, locally-produced meat. In Indiana, it will mean that meat processed by selected smaller operations will be available beyond the Hoosier state. Interstate shipment may not sound like a local food issue, but CIS actually has important implications for local food producers and consumers – especially when one state has a major market right across its border, as is the case with southern Wisconsin and Chicago. Implementing CIS is part of USDA's broader strategy to strengthen local and regional food systems and to help small and midsize producers access new market opportunities. USDA coordinates its work on these issues under the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative, which includes a variety of resources to help producers and businesses tap into consumer demand for local foods. One such resource, a guide called Tools for Small and Midsized Livestock and Poultry; USDA Resources for Producers and Processors, was released in March as part of a wider package of support for America's small and mid-sized farmers and ranchers. FSIS' Small Plant Help Desk, a customer service phone line at 1-877-FSIShelp, is also a valuable resource for small and midsize meat and poultry plants and can address issues and answer questions specific to smaller meat processors. The Small Plant Help Desk has fielded over 10,000 inquiries since . For businesses like Lou's Gourmet Sausage, USDA’s commitment to local food and to small and midsize producers is epitomized by efforts such as the Cooperative Interstate Shipment program and the Small Plant Help Desk. With these resources and opportunities, small processors are accessing new markets – and consumers are happily digging in.

"USDA Office of the Chief Information Officer in  Technology  Feb 20,   Developing a modern USDA for a stronger rural America means equipping USDA’s employees who work in every American state and U.S. territory, as well as in over 50 countries, with information technology tools that ensure they are better informed, better engaged and better able to provide critical feedback to policy makers in real-time. Mobile devices, enterprise e-mail, video teleconferencing, online employee forums, social media and instant messaging allow employees who fight against hunger, food-borne illness and wildland fires to deliver their mission as well as serve the American public, while coordinating efforts with co-workers and decision makers across vast geographic distances. By remaining connected to both customers in the field and to regional and national government leaders, the on-the-ground knowledge of customer needs can much more quickly drive needed changes in policies and procedures that make USDA’s programs more accessible to the American public. These tools also make it possible for employees to more effectively work outside the normal office environment. Increasingly, employees are “tele-working” on a regular basis, which drives down the cost of government facilities leases and transit subsidies, and also enables managers and employees to continue their service during inclement weather conditions that force government offices to close. Just a few of the innovative tools in use today at USDA include: Your Two Cents, an online platform developed by USDA to serve as a virtual space for employees to talk about innovative solutions to difficult challenges, leading to the increased efficiency and effectiveness of program processes. Your Two Cents and other USDA sites like it are enabling leaders to better harness the collective experience of employees, and to foster an exchange of knowledge between co-workers who might not otherwise have had the opportunity. USDA Connect is a collaboration tool available to all USDA employees. Equipped with powerful social networking capabilities, it enables teams to work collaboratively on projects, regardless of location. When employees in the field work virtually with colleagues, they are better stewards of taxpayer dollars, saving on travel without sacrificing the ability to share knowledge in the pursuit of innovative solutions. AgLearn, a virtual university for USDA’s employees, is a low cost, one-stop shop for employee development and training that can be accessed from anywhere in the world. Employees are encouraged to set individual development goals and to take advantage of the more than courses, 20,000 professional development books, and hundreds of videos that are available at a cost of less than 10 dollars per employee per year. These and many other innovative tools helped develop the modern USDA for a stronger rural America. Employees are able to get the training they need cost-effectively, to share expertise and knowledge of local conditions with decision-makers and with each other, and to collaborate on projects anywhere, any time. The information technologies USDA has acquired, developed, and managed are making it all possible.

"Animals  Plants  Nov 24,   I have had an eventful couple of weeks since my last post. I spent a day two weeks ago in Riverdale, Maryland at the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services building learning more about some of their programs.  I particularly enjoyed meeting with two economists, as many of my college classes related to economics. At a meeting in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, right next to the White House, I took part in an interagency discussion about increasing participation in youth sports across the country.  I played soccer, basketball and baseball as much as I could when I was younger and believe it is important for children to have these opportunities.  I probably never would have made it to the Major Leagues without them. USDA has a program called HealthierUS Schools Challenge to recognize schools that excel in fostering healthy eating and physical activity among students.  As a professional athlete, I am very concerned with nutrition and exercise in my own life, and I believe it is important to promote their importance to our nation’s youth. Last week, I was honored to accompany First Lady Michelle Obama and Secretary Vilsack to Hollin Meadows Elementary School, a recipient of a HealthierUS Schools Challenge Silver Star.  We met teachers, students, parents and administrators in learning about the programs that have made the school such a success. Ross Ohlendorf is joined by First Lady Michelle Obama and Secretary Tom Vilsack at Hollin Meadows Elementary School I have several interesting tours lined up over the next couple of weeks, while I also work on putting the finishing touches on my projects here at USDA.

"NRCS Oregon in  Conservation  Jan 18,  Sarahlee Lawrence inspects a row of organically grown flowers on her organic farm in the high desert of Central Oregon. Business is blooming for Sarahlee Lawrence and her organic food-and-flower-growing operation, Rainshadow Organics, in the Central Oregon high desert. The 28-year old organic pioneer is proud of her venture and credits USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) as a key component to her success. Lawrence approached NRCS several years ago to start the process of making her farm organic. NRCS helped her plan and implement a nutrient management program and address irrigation issues on both a two-acre vegetable-and-flower plot and a 25-acre field where she grows a mix of cover crops like wheat and clover. NRCS provided assistance to Lawrence through two Farm Bill programs. The Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) Organic Initiative is a nationwide special effort to provide financial assistance to National Organic Program (NOP) certified organic producers, as well as producers in the process of transitioning to organic production. And the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP) is a cooperative program to improve irrigation efficiency and reduce energy consumption. Drip irrigation system made possible by the NRCS Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP). Lawrence is especially pleased with the newly installed drip irrigation system that supplies water to more than 100 varieties of produce and a colorful assortment of flowers on her two-acre parcel. “I could not have afforded or done that by myself,” she explains. To be certified organic, a U.S. agricultural operation has to be approved by a USDA Accredited Certifying Agent. Applicants must comply with USDA Organic regulations and submit documentation on their property and farming practices. Transitioning to organic is often a lengthy process, as Lawrence knows. Fields may require preparation to support organic production, including the planting of cover crops, incorporating compost and other soil-enhancing practices. While it takes a while to transition an operation to a Certified Organic one, Lawrence is pleased with her progress. The market for fresh, locally grown food continues to expand in Central Oregon, and her customers include a local hospital, schools and restaurants. Over 100 different types produce are grown on this two-acre organic operation, ranging from beets and beans to cabbage and strawberries. She has also generated a new, dedicated client base through community supported agriculture (CSA). CSA is a way for consumers to directly invest in local farms and receive a regular delivery of fresh fruits, vegetables and other local products. Lawrence looks forward to a bright, rewarding and sustainable future. Find out more about the EQIP Organic Initiative. Check out more conservation stories on the USDA blog. Follow NRCS on Twitter.

"Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area and Jane Knowlton, U.S. Forest Service Washington Office in  Forestry  Aug 10,  Christina Harper engages in a pine stand inventory on the Bienville Ranger District which is home to scarce communities of red-cockaded woodpeckers (Monday, July 30, ). Her is used to develop the necessary forest prescriptions to treat stand structures to meet the forest’s land management objectives including activities such as timber sales or herbicide treatments. Christina Harper, a new forester on the Bienville National Forest in Mississippi, has travelled a busy road from a special student training program to a full-time U.S. Forest Service employee. Harper graduated from the Student Career Experience Program, which provides work experience directly related to students’ academic programs or career goals. The program exposes students to public service while enhancing their educational goals. During her first summer in the Student Career Experience Program in , she performed interpretation and naturalist duties for the U.S. Forest Service at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitors Center in Juneau, Alaska. “I was definitely out of my normal element, both geographically and professionally,” said Harper. “The experience demanded understanding customer-service responsibilities that were different from my forestry training skills and gave me a different outlook from my city-girl perspective on connecting with nature.” Harper started her college education at Florida A&M University and then received a scholarship and transferred to Alabama A&M University, the only historically black college and university with an accredited forestry program. She began working at the Land Between The Lakes National Recreation Area in the summer of . After she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in forest management in , she became a fulltime forester trainee. At Land Between the Lakes, she learned the basic skills a professional forester needs for the job: marking timber, designing a timber sale, building maps, working with other agencies, developing timber appraisals and understanding contracting procedures. She also learned shovel-testing techniques to search for cultural artifacts in historical areas where there might be relics. “Because Land Between the Lakes is a small forest, it was an all-hands-on deck environment where every pair of hands was needed to push a project. This meant I got to experience every department so my experience was above and beyond my expectations.” In May , she moved to her prescription forester position on the Bienville National Forest where she is learning the ropes involved in understanding a new landscape comprised of different types of tree species and vegetation. “I’m collecting on a predominately pine forest so I can write prescriptions for the kinds of treatments needed for optimum forest health. Is a specific type of thinning needed?  Would timber removal aid restoration? Would an herbicide treatment improve a timber stand? I’m working to enhance the forest condition to its desired condition as part of a management plan.” As Harper  completes her transition to professional forester, she plans to share the training opportunities she has enjoyed and hopes to inspire others. “I want to know that the work I do today has no glitches in it so that down the road, the landscapes I’ve worked on will continue to offer the public opportunities that are part of the Forest Service multiple-use mission,” she said. Harper was recently spotlighted in Faces of the Forest, a periodic Forest Service web feature which showcases the people, places and professions within the agency.

Nature High Summer Camp, an annual high-energy environmental learning experience for high school students in Utah, was held in July at the historic Great Basin Environmental Education Center in central Utah’s Ephraim Canyon. For more than 20 years, several federal natural resource agencies and state partners have sponsored the event to help students of all walks of life learn the importance of science-based natural resource conservation and consider related careers at organizations like the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). This year, 28 students from across the state came together to learn about natural resources, meet natural resource professionals, learn the value of teamwork and have fun making new friends. For hands-on learning, the students were divided into resource interest groups, under the direction of a camp counselor. They were presented with a scenario that the development of a resource management plan to balance competing interests on both public and private lands in Ephraim Canyon.

The five resource interest groups—representing livestock producers, environmentalists, hikers, all-terrain riders and sportsmen—met together at the conclusion of the camp, in a lively town hall-like setting, to come up with an agreed-upon  resource management plan as a solution to the scenario. During the camp each group spent time with resource professionals to learn about relevant subjects like aquatic ecology, hydrology, entomology, soil science and forest ecology. Other time was spent learning about career options related to natural resources and visiting nearby Snow College. Camp attendees also accomplished a service project, clearing weeds and brush around an education center building. This firewise barrier will help protect the 100-year-old historic structure, originally used as a sheep range experiment station, from wildfire. The sponsors are the NRCS, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Geological Survey, Snow College and the Utah Association of Conservation Districts.

(USDA photo by Scott Bauer) February is traditionally a month of celebration for our nation’s  land-grant universities (LGUs) in commemoration of Black History Month. These institutions are historically-black universities that were established in under the Second Morrill Act.  Now, as the month draws to an end, the LGUs are setting their sights on August 30, which marks the 125th anniversary of the Congressional action that created a network of historically black colleges and universities dedicated to providing educational opportunity for all through innovative scientific research and community-minded Extension programs. “One of the ways we can best honor black history is by providing a proper foundation to support future achievement. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education and Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future,” said Cathie Woteki, USDA’s Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics. Today, there are 19 land-grant universities in 18 states. Central State University in Ohio is the latest LGU, as established under the Farm Bill. USDA’s  National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) administers a number of LGU education grant programs that support projects that strengthen teaching, research, Extension, and facility programs in the food and agricultural sciences. These include: The Institution Teaching, Research, and Extension Capacity Building Grants program that strengthen teaching and research programs in the food and agricultural sciences through cooperative linkages with federal and non-federal entities; The Evans-Allen Research Formula program that supports basic and applied research at the institutions in the food and agricultural sciences; The Extension Formula program that supports Extension education programs that respond to the changing needs of limited resource clientele; and The Facilities Grant program that provides funds for the acquisition and improvement of agricultural and food sciences facilities and equipment, including libraries, so that the institutions may participate fully in the production of human capital in the food and agricultural sciences. The Institution Capacity Building Grants program has been the LGU’s “bread and butter,” according to Dr. Antoine Alston, professor at North Carolina A&T University and third-generation LGU graduate. “Both as a student and faculty, I have been able to use NIFA funding to train farmers in Farmer Safety and have taught secondary agricultural Extension personnel about hydroponics technology,” he recalled. The LGUs, he said, are able to take a little and do a lot. “Dedicated funding gave the land-grant universities an opportunity to specialize their research,” said McKinley Mayes, former coordinator of College Programs at NIFA’s forerunner agency, the Cooperative State Research Service. “For example, Lincoln University (Mo.) focused their research on human nutrition, Alcorn State University (Miss.) worked on aquaculture, and Fort Valley State University (Ga.) became known for goat research. This provided significant economic benefits for the local communities.” NIFA's investment in research, education and Extension is helping to train tomorrow’s agricultural leaders and workers today.  “The institutions are places of cutting-edge research and technology, no doubt, but they also empower limited-resource students and turn them into leaders,” Alston explained. “These are universities in the business of transforming lives.” Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Customer Support Communications Specialist, USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in  Animals  Plants  Mar 14,  Scott Kravetz participates in the Bird Health Awareness Week webinar. USDA photo. As part of Bird Health Awareness Week, USDA recently hosted a webinar on “Growing Chicks into Healthy Chickens.”  Dr. Martin Smeltzer, Andy Schneider (aka the “Chicken Whisperer”) and Dr. Claudia Dunkley spent an hour helping backyard bird owners learn more about keeping their flocks healthy.  Around 300 people participated in the webinar, most of who are just getting started with backyard birds. The goal of Bird Health Awareness Week is to help protect backyard birds from disease. The webinar focused on the cute little baby birds known as chicks. Now, I am not a poultry person, but I love eggs, so I thought this would be something interesting to learn.  I found out that raising backyard poultry is a growing trend.  People like to raise chicks into adults for their eggs, and for the entertainment value of having birds in their backyard. I didn’t know there were so many rules when it comes to starting a flock. You need to think about why you want to raise backyard birds and what you intend to do with them.  You also need to find out if it is legal where you live - check city and local ordinances and find out if you need a permit.  If you have one, you should also check with your Homeowners Association.   Look to see if inspections or other steps are to start a flock, and be sure to buy chicks from a National Poultry Improvement Plan- approved source to ensure they start out healthy. I was surprised to find out that young chicks must be separated from older birds, for them to be secure and safe from disease.  Let chicks grow into birds in a separate, clean environment before introducing them into your flock that contains older birds. There are two major diseases that can threaten backyard birds - Avian Influenza and Exotic Newcastle Disease. The webinar discussed six simple steps to help protect your birds from disease.  We also learned what potential signs of illness might include and what to do if you think your birds might be sick. Are you considering raising birds or want some tips for adding to your current flock?  The full webinar is available online, including nutrition tips and other information to help you grow a healthy and happy flock in your own backyard!

"Director, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Research and Science  Jun 13,   Tomorrow, Secretary Vilsack and I will participate in the Future of Food, Food Security for the 21st Century conference, which is sponsored by The Washington Post. I am pleased to see the topic of food security getting such attention, as I believe it’s one of the biggest challenges we face now and in the next 50 years. As director of USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), I believe NIFA has a crucial role to play in addressing these challenges. We are facing a “9 billion challenge,” in that the global population is projected to hit 9 billion by the year . This challenge presents what I call wicked problems that require us to find ways to feed, clothe, shelter all people, and meet their energy needs, without wreaking havoc on the environment. The 9 billion challenge also has major implications on the way we fund science at NIFA. We must align our science with the challenges of the day. There are five major areas that are affected by the rising population that must be addressed beginning now: food security and hunger, sustainable energy, food safety, childhood obesity, and climate change. These problems also require us to rethink how we deploy the best science and resources to address the challenges. The federal and state governments, while having a primary and significant role, do not have the monetary and intellectual resources needed to tackle these wicked problems. It’s going to require a renewed and different compact of public/private partnerships. No one entity has the market cornered on dealing with these challenges. The public partners will include local, state, and federal agencies within the United States. The private partners must include the non-governmental organizations, commodity groups, small private sector firms, and the corporate sector. The academic partners will not only include our traditional partners and Land-Grant universities, but will also bring in the entire educational system from K-12 to all public and private universities. Since we are addressing global challenges, we need to crowdsource—leveraging the monetary and intellectual resources of global partners, public or private. I’ve only been at NIFA for a little more than a month, but my long career within the Land-Grant university system has demonstrated to me that NIFA serves as a one-stop shop for our nation’s food, agriculture, energy, fiber, shelter needs, and the environment. By making the right investments in science at the right time, NIFA enables the scientific community to make great discoveries that can be turned into innovations to help us meet our future food needs, while promoting jobs and the economy.

Referring to statistics detailed a short time earlier by USDA Chief Economist Joseph Glauber, the Secretary pledged to continue to aggressively promote the export of American agricultural products.  He said trade will help create American jobs – especially in the agriculture sector.  Especially important, said the Secretary, are growing economies like those in Indonesia and Vietnam, both of which the Secretary is scheduled to visit later in the year.  The Secretary also noted that American farmers have tremendous opportunities represented by the growth of biobased products and biofuels.  And he told the audience that American agricultural producers deserve our utmost respect and appreciation, for continuing to produce food that costs the average American consumer less than 10 percent of his or her paycheck. The Secretary was preceded by Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow, Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, who discussed the upcoming Farm Bill.  The Senator noted that agriculture is very important to Michigan’s economy, second only to California in crop diversity.  Agriculture in Michigan, she said, represents one in four jobs which is why she thinks of the next farm bill as “a jobs bill.” Following the Senator and the Secretary, Former President Bill Clinton began with stories about his childhood in rural, agriculture-centered Arkansas and then talked about the central role that agriculture plays in solving the issues facing the world’s population.  “We’re living in a highly complicated environment,” the former President said.  He went on to note that a billion people go to bed hungry every night, while in urban areas of developing countries there is an increasing problem of obesity and diabetes.  Noting that no country ever moved ahead without first developing a strong agricultural base, he spoke of efforts in Africa to pull people out of poverty through rural development and education. The former President also noted the importance of elevating the status of women in developing countries, educating them, and giving them job opportunities.  He said that agriculture will be at the “vortex” of major global issues. The forum continues through tomorrow. For more information click here.

"WIC Program Integrity Branch Chief, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 05,  FNS has taken a range of steps to ensure the highest level of integrity in WIC. For more than 40 years, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has provided supplemental foods and nutrition services vital to the health and nutrition of vulnerable moms, newborns and young children. And throughout those four decades, we’ve had a long-standing history of working with WIC state agencies to ensure program resources and taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently. While a study found a relatively low rate of improper vendor payments, (representing less than 1.5 percent of WIC food expenses), FNS has and will continue to intervene when problems arise and to require state agencies to improve the integrity of their programs. FNS is vigilant about the integrity of all of its food assistance programs, including WIC. That’s why in , FNS established the Program Integrity and Monitoring Branch to oversee WIC integrity initiatives. This new branch plays a key role in WIC monitoring and oversight and it is paying close attention to vendor management practices to ensure the program pays only fair prices to retailers for WIC foods. It provides technical assistance to address areas of concern and to disseminate information about noteworthy initiatives. The branch also supports electronic benefit transfer (EBT) implementation efforts, which vastly improves integrity by simplifying the benefit transaction for participants and cashiers and improving states’ ability to track prices stores are charging and redemption patterns.  Here’s a list of some of our steps we’re taking to ensure integrity: Providing Direct Technical Assistance In September , FNS completed reviews on vendor management practices in each state with a retail food delivery system, including the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.  FNS is working with state agencies to correct all problems identified through these reviews. In December , FNS launched a process to assess the strength of vendor management practices nationwide.  We’re now developing technical assistance materials on paying competitive prices for supplemental foods to help state agencies improve their vendor management practices. The first set of topic-specific tools are expected by the end of June and rolled out later this year. FNS is also developing a comprehensive Vendor Management Handbook to improve the quality and consistency of vendor oversight activities. FNS staff have recently provided web-based program integrity trainings in two priority areas—income eligibility and certification, as well as vendor management.  To date, two vendor management webinars have been presented and several more are in the planning stages.  Addressing WIC Foods Sold Online In , WIC began working with major social media sites (Amazon, Craigslist, eBay and Facebook) to address the potential online sale of WIC foods.  Amazon strengthened its policies on prohibiting certain types of sales not only for WIC, but also for SNAP, as a direct result of our request.  Craigslist also has policies prohibiting the sale of WIC and SNAP cards or foods and eBay has a warning for sellers that it is a violation of federal law to sell food and infant formula obtained through the WIC Program.  We also wrote to every state agency encouraging them to place the following statement on all WIC checks, EBT cards or their accompanying folders or sleeves:  “Buying or selling WIC benefits is a crime.  To report suspected abuse, call 800-424- or visit www.usda.gov/oig/hotline.htm.”  FNS is continuing its efforts to guard against the potential sale of WIC foods.    Conducting Research We are conducting a range of studies to help inform future integrity efforts. One study examines EBT to identify an approach to develop high-risk vendor indicators in both the current and future (all-EBT) WIC environments. Another looks at effective methods for establishing vendor groups based on common characteristics that affect food prices, competitive price criteria and allowable reimbursement levels. Findings from both studies are expected in and will be used to inform future actions. FNS is committed to working with our partners in the 90 WIC state agencies to use evidence to strengthen the integrity of the program.

"Will COVID-19 Threaten Availability and Affordability of our Food?  As the COVID-19 virus continues to spread in the U.S., its impacts have reached every aspect of our lives and shook all sectors of the economy. Amid this crisis, there have been widespread worries that the disease could threaten the nation’s food production and supply systems and stoke inflation. Many began to wonder whether the food they need will continue to be available and affordable as we work our way out of the outbreak.

"Program Analyst, U.S. Codex Office in  Health and Safety  Jun 08,  This year’s World Food Safety Day theme is “food safety is everyone’s business.” One group with members around the world is focused on the business of science-based food standards to protect consumer health. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) was established in by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. Codex drafts international food standards, , and codes of practice collectively known as Codex Alimentarius, meaning “food code” in Latin. One hundred and eighty-seven member countries and organizations compose the membership of Codex. Additionally, Codex has more than 200 intergovernmental and international nongovernmental observer organizations. Altogether, Codex membership represents about 99% of the world’s population. Public concerns about food safety issues often place Codex at the center of global discussion. The United States Codex Office (USCO), housed in USDA’s Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, leads the U.S. Codex Program. Each day, USCO international issues analysts work with regulatory scientists and experts from various U.S. government agencies and nongovernment stakeholders to facilitate coordination, strategic planning, and outreach events on food standards. “We strive to make the world a safer place through safer food” said Marie Maratos Bhat, an analyst for the USCO who covers pesticide residues and food hygiene issues. Ultimately, these efforts benefit consumers by providing greater assurance of the safety of imported foods. Trade organizations and agricultural producers also benefit because Codex standards open markets to fair trade in safe food. It is the USCO’s mission to engage stakeholders in the development and advancement of science-based food standards for the benefit of the United States and the worldwide community. The United States Codex Office is proud to support World Food Safety Day.

"Arizona USDA Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  Sep 16,   The folks in the small community of Taylor, Arizona, have a reputation for creative problem solving. Back in the late ’s local blacksmith Joseph Hancock came up with an ingenious solution for celebrating the Fourth of July in the tiny town. The tradition then was for towns to fire their cannons to celebrate Independence Day. But the Town of Taylor was without a cannon. So Hancock offered up two historic anvils and the tradition of “firing the anvil” became an annual event for the town. At dawn every Fourth of July, the Jennings Band members climb onto a flatbed truck and ride up and down the neighborhoods in Taylor, stopping on street corners while the anvil is fired and patriotic music is played for the sleepy residents. Decades after Joseph Hancock donated his anvils, descendents of those first settlers continue to farm and ranch in the fertile valley on the Silver Creek. One family, the Salines, have a ranching operation located just outside Taylor. As a young boy Alma Saline would be up early milking cows, fixing fences and harvesting crops. It’s what the family had to do to keep their -acre farm/ranch running. Silver Creek Farms is in the Little Colorado River Basin in northeastern Arizona. It was homesteaded by Alma’s grandfather around . About 400 acres of the ranch is in alfalfa hay, silage corn and a little bit of sweet corn and sunflowers. They have black Angus cows pastured in the river bottom and the open range land that spreads across the high plateau.It’s an idyllic life…but not an easy one. When Alma’s father died in he left the ranch to his family as a trust. Alma assumed the responsibility of managing the assets and the day-to-day operation of the farm. “Much of the equipment that Dad left was old,” Alma says. “We had just a minimum of cattle and only 70 acres in crop production.” For the past 11 years, Alma and his family have been building the ranch back into a higher production operation. They now irrigate 230 acres with two center pivots and have an 80 acre field where all waste water is recycled back into the irrigation system. Another 100 acres is irrigated with water from the Silver Creek Irrigation district. In the family drilled an irrigation well, which irrigates about 300 acres. The well requires about 155,00kW of electricity per year to operate.The cost of the electricity to run the well is the single largest expense on the farm. Alma and his family had considered alternative energy sources, but the 54KW per hour requirement was too large for a solar-powered system that would be within their budget. Two years ago, in the old tradition of Taylor creative problem solving, the Saline’s neighbors at the Elkins Ranch put in wind-turbines to generate electricity. Alma and his family were intrigued. Today, thanks in part to a $53,000 Renewable Energy for America Program grant from USDA Rural Development, the Salines have installed a 155,000kW Vestus V-19 wind turbine. The unit is expected to generate all of the electricity needed to run the well…and maybe a little extra to hedge against the rising cost of electricity. The ranch has a contract with the local utility company to “net meter”—feed power into the utility grid during production months and use power as needed in the off-wind summer months. “At the end of each year, we’ll settle the differences,” explained Alma. Today it’s not just flying anvils that punctuate the Taylor skies. Turbines are taking a spin there too.

"Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  Conservation  Aug 26,  During the North American Indian Days Celebration in Montana, Under Secretary Ed Avalos (foreground), witnessed the pride and commitment of youth as they celebrated their cultural and agricultural roots. Agricultural producers in rural America represent less than 1% of the U.S. population, yet they produce almost 75% of the food we eat in this country and much of the food eaten throughout the world. Among that 1%, the average age of the American farmer is 57 years old—making it imperative for us to engage and encourage young people to pursue agricultural careers. Earlier this summer, while visiting Browning, Montana, I had the opportunity to meet with Dr. Billie Jo Kipp, President of the Blackfeet Community College (BCC) and Mr. Terry Tatsey, Director of Agricultural Programs at the college.  Their efforts and commitment to educate local students and keep young people in agriculture is inspiring. At BCC, programs like the Native Science Field Center use outdoor classrooms to give students hands-on experience in cataloging native plants and their relationships to nearby water sources.  The experience, supported through the Blackfeet Community College Extension, is a marriage of cultural and agricultural studies. It passes knowledge between generations and encourages young people to pursue a future in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers as well as agricultural fields. The trip also gave me a chance to participate in the North American Indian Days Celebration. Here I met with tribal members, attended a 4-H livestock sale, participated in the rodeo and witnessed the pride and commitment of the young people as they showcased both their cultural and agricultural traditions.  At USDA, we are committed to providing American Indians and Alaska Natives equal access to all of our programs.  Our Office of Tribal Relations works with Indian Country, providing support across all USDA programs for tribal consultation, sacred site efforts, cross-agency federal programs and the recently created White House Council on Native American Affairs. On my recent visit to Wisconsin, I had the honor to attend the opening day festivities at the Wisconsin State Fair.  Originating in the early mid-s, state fairs are a celebration of foods and the rural communities that produce them.  They are a showcase of rural America—shining a spotlight on farmers, ranchers, dairy producers, agribusiness and the communities that surround them. Having been in agriculture in one form or another all of my life, going to the state fair is still exciting and fair season is one of my favorite times of the year. Along with attending a dairy show, touring the agriculture pavilion—not to mention stopping to enjoy some potato pancakes, sweet corn and a traditional crème-puff—I was able to attend the Wisconsin fair’s lamb show.  This gave me an opportunity to visit with some of the state’s young producers who were striving to win their class and make the sale. These young people represent the future of agriculture, and are just one example of the up-and-coming farmers and ranchers who will feed our nation in the years ahead. Through programs like USDA’s Start2Farm initiative, funded through the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA),  and opportunities like the Specialty Crop Block Grants (SCBG) and Farmers Market Promotion Program, managed by the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), we are committed to creating opportunities in rural America. By cultivating a passion for agriculture in students and supporting beginning farmers and ranchers, we will help build the future of agriculture and show that we do not take for granted the work they do to feed us all. We are dedicated to keeping families on the farm and creating opportunities for future generations.

"Agricultural Statistician, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Research and Science  Dec 27,  Make sure these “good luck” foods and all food count. Be a part of the Census of Agriculture. The Census is a complete count of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. The holidays are often a time for family, fun, and food. New Year’s is no exception. One thing many nations around the world have in common is the belief that eating certain foods on New Year’s will bring good luck and prosperity in the 12 months to follow. One New Year’s tradition the South is especially known for is eating black-eyed peas and collard greens. It is believed that a meal with black-eyed peas and collards symbolizes humility and a new year full of coins and “green” (money). Lentils are another popular legume on New Year’s for the same reason. How do our farmers contribute to this traditional fare? According to the Census of Agriculture, our nation’s 1,407 collard operations harvested 12,542 acres. North Carolina ranked first for number of farms , but Georgia led in collard acreage . The for collards are only available every five years in the Census of Agriculture, and it’s that time again. Census questionnaires have been mailed to farmers and ranchers across the nation. By participating in the Census of Agriculture, producers can influence decisions that will shape the future of American agriculture.  In , California ranked first in black-eyed pea production, accounting for 31.9 million of the 57.2 million pounds produced nationally. Texas ranked first in harvested acres, with 23,000 of the nation’s 35,300 total harvested acres of black-eyed peas. In the same year, farmers produced 1.3 billion pounds of lentils on 908,000 harvested acres. Montana ranked first in lentil production, with more than 737 million pounds. Pork is another popular New Year’s tradition. In various cultures, pigs are perceived as representing progress because they look and root forward. In , U.S. farmers produced more than 35 billion pounds of pork, with Iowa, at more than 12 billion pounds, accounting for almost a third of U.S. production. According to the Census of Agriculture, there were 63,246 hog operations across the country. Iowa led the nation with 6,266 operations. What will the Census of Agriculture tell us? A fun New Year’s tradition is trying to eat 12 grapes at midnight. Some believe that each chime of the clock represents a month of the year and that the reveler must eat one grape with each chime for 12 months of good luck. Some even say you should make a wish with each grape. According to the Census of Agriculture, our nation had 23,420 grape bearing operations and more than 1 million bearing acres. In , the United States produced 7.7 million tons of grapes, of which about 1 million were utilized as fresh grapes. California is consistently first in grape production. The census will provide additional information on number of grape operations and acres. Across the United States and around the world, people incorporate a variety of other New Year’s food traditions, including eating noodles to symbolize a long life, ring-shaped cakes to represent the year coming full circle, and many more.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Apr 17,  A Conservation Innovation Grant recipient accepts award from the U.S. Water Alliance. Photo courtesy NRCS. When USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded a Conservation Innovation Grant to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in , the notion of administering the nation’s largest water quality trading program in the Ohio River Basin was a twinkle in the eye of EPRI scientist Jessica Fox. Fast forward to —the multi-state water-trading program is a reality, and the Institute was one of three entities to be awarded this year’s Water Prize by the U.S. Water Alliance. Through Conservation Innovation Grants, NRCS funds projects that develop innovative approaches and technologies for natural resource conservation on agricultural lands. These grants have funded more than 60 environmental markets projects, including a number of the nation’s leading market efforts. EPRI’s program, launched when the states of Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana signed a multi-state compact in , works with agricultural producers who voluntarily implement conservation practices that reduce nutrient runoff into local waters. Through the program’s first trades in March , three energy companies purchased these credits and retired them for associated nutrient and ecosystem benefits. On April 13, In front of a crowded auditorium at the National Geographic Society in Washington, DC, Former EPA Deputy Administrator Bob Perciasepe awarded the prize to Fox who accepted on behalf of EPRI. Perciasepe expressed admiration for EPRI’s ability to innovate and engage stakeholders from Duke Energy to the Ohio Farm Bureau, and everyone in between. In her award acceptance remarks, Fox noted that part of the project’s success is that EPRI was never satisfied with developing the nation’s largest water quality trading program, or executing the first trades. “We are always pushing and striving, looking forward to the next chapter.” The next chapter for the Institute begins on May 20 when it holds a public auction for nutrient credits in New York City. These credits were generated through the installation of cover crops, livestock fencing and other conservation practices on 30 farms last summer.

"Market and Trade Economics Division, Economic Research Service in  Research and Science  Aug 20,   In , 19.3 percent of the 3.8 billion people in 76 low- and middle-income countries are projected to be food insecure, meaning they do not have access to sufficient food for an active and healthy lifestyle. By , their food security situation is projected to improve, leaving 9.2 percent food insecure (assuming rising per-capita incomes, stable or declining food prices, and no new major crises). USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) recently released the annual International Food Security Assessment -, in which they assess the food security status and outlook for 76 low- and middle-income countries that are former or current food aid recipients. This report presents the number of food-insecure people, the share of the population that is food insecure, and the food gap projected for and based on projected food price and income changes. The ERS food security indicators are forward-looking and provide a measure of expected progress in food security. The share of populations experiencing food insecurity is not spread evenly across the regions and countries included in the study. Projections of food insecurity in the 22 Asian and 11 Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries show it is relatively low at 13.9 and 17.4 percent compared to Sub-Saharan Africa’s (SSA) 35.3 percent. This regional disparity is projected to widen by . Sub-Saharan Africa, while expected to improve, is still projected to have 22.5 percent of its population classified as food insecure. The share of populations that are food insecure is projected to improve, but with widening regional disparity across the four regions studied Projections for 76 low- and middle-income countries show that food insecure people in is relatively low in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) compared to 35.3 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This disparity is projected to widen into when Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to improve but still have 22.5 percent of its population classified as food insecure. Photo credit: USDA, Economic Research Service based on results from the International Food Security Assessment model Several countries are projected to not make significant progress in their food security situation. For these countries, income growth prospects are poor, and food prices are expected to remain relatively high due to ongoing armed conflicts or recent devastation from natural disasters, which tend to displace a large portion of the population and disrupt economic and agricultural activities. This results in limited access to food and increased food insecurity. For example, most of Yemen remains food insecure, and repeated port closures hinder food imports. Over half the populations in Central Africa and parts of East Africa are projected to be food insecure in , following years of civil conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.

"Deputy Assistant Secretary for Rural Outreach, U.S. Department of Education in  Initiatives  Rural  Technology  Jan 04,  Secretary Duncan, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and their agencies are working together to support community colleges as they provide postsecondary education and career training in rural areas. Cross posted from the Department of Education blog: It’s no secret that community colleges are leading the way to achieving the President’s goal for the United States to once again have the highest college attainment rate in the world by . Community colleges are hubs for career-training, re-training, adult education and for recent high school graduates seeking a pathway into the careers of their choice. For many residents of rural areas, community colleges also provide the closest access to postsecondary education and a way to obtain the skills needed for existing jobs.  However, like some of their students, many rural community colleges are doing more with less as state budgets are being cut and new resources are becoming harder to find. During the rural community colleges conference in Oklahoma, many attendees asked about funding and resources available from the Department of Education but few were as familiar with opportunities in other federal agencies. Some rural community college administrators were unaware of the significant infrastructure of support available through their USDA Rural Development state and local offices. As the American Jobs Act languishes in Congress, preventing an infusion of $5 billion for modernization from reaching community colleges, the U.S. Departments of Education and Agriculture are working together to guide campuses serving high-poverty rural communities to existing federal resources. During a recent conference call with members of the Rural Community College Alliance and the American Association of Community Colleges, nearly 100 participants learned about USDA Rural Development programs and funding opportunities that can be used to improve facilities, support distance learning, and provide home ownership assistance as a recruitment and retention tool for faculty. The USDA Community Facilities Program can be used for construction and renovation of classrooms and dormitories, and even to purchase transportation vehicles to serve campus facilities. The USDA Single Family Housing Programs provide homeownership opportunities to low- and moderate-income rural Americans through several loan, grant, and loan guarantee programs. USDA Distance Learning and Telemedicine grants can cover the cost of equipment for video conferencing and other distance learning equipment. USDA’s Community Connect program provides grants to build broadband Internet infrastructure and establish community centers to offer free public access in rural areas where broadband service is least likely to be available, but where it can make a tremendous difference in the quality of life for citizens. These are a few of the ways that USDA can support rural communities, and the Department of Education is working to increase awareness of how college leaders can access these opportunities.

"Legislative and Public Affairs, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in  Animals  Plants  Sep 25,  Ready, set, hike! With football season upon us, we want to help you “kick off” your citrus’ health. Whether you are a rookie or seasoned veteran when it comes to growing fruit, following these simple tips can help your citrus have a winning season. 1. Draft an all-pro citrus team Dwarf varieties are often preferable for backyard growing because they take up less space, do not grow as tall, and are easier and safer to pick. When purchasing citrus trees, buying a healthy tree from a reputable seller is critical. If you are ordering a citrus tree, make sure the nursery or shipper is in compliance with federal quarantine restrictions. 2. Prep your home turf  Citrus trees can grow in the ground or in containers. They are happy in practically any soil, as long as there is adequate drainage.  In more clay-like soils, small amounts of gravel or sand can promote improved drainage. 3. Water with complete coverage If the leaves on your citrus tree start turning yellow and fall off, this could be a result of under watering, but it is more likely from overwatering. To ensure that you are watering adequately, water trees in the ground deeply once a week and trees in containers as soon as the soil becomes dry. 4. Have a strong defense against the cold (how to prevent the freeze) Citrus trees typically thrive in warmer states, such as California, Florida and Texas, because of their intolerance of freezing temperatures. With some exceptions depending on the variety, citrus freezes around 27-28 degrees Fahrenheit. If you suspect a freeze, cover your plants with blankets, towels, or plant covers from a nursery. 5. Don't fumble on fertilizing Citrus/fruit tree fertilizer should be applied every three months for maximum growth and fruit production. In addition to following these five tips, it is also very important for at-home citrus growers to regularly inspect their plants for diseases. There are four significant diseases threatening U.S. citrus: citrus greening, citrus canker, sweet orange scab and citrus black spot. If you suspect your citrus may be diseased, report it immediately to the USDA.  The USDA’s Save Our Citrus iPhone App offers a convenient way for people to identify and report suspected citrus disease.

"Posted by USDA’s Research, Education, and Economics Communications Team in  Research and Science  Sep 20,  You could say that Andreya Dupree is flying high with the USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), partially due to being a licensed drone pilot. “USDA was the place that gave me a chance to continue to learn and grow. I've received many opportunities with USDA,” said Dupree. Dupree is a Biological Science Technician with USDA-ARS in Tifton, Georgia, where she started after earning her Agricultural Sciences degree with a concentration in Plant and Soil Science from Alcorn State University. While in school, she interned with the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center through the National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program and interned with USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service. During that experience Dupree learned about instrumentation that she uses currently. Dupree credits USDA with supporting her in achieving her career goals. Her alma mater — Alcorn State University—is a USDA, National Institute of Food and Agriculture ’s land-grant university partner. Dupree received a full academic scholarship and vital career development support. “USDA has impacted my life by putting me on the path that I am on now,” Dupree said. Andreya is also a licensed drone pilot and was able to do that through a National Resources Conservation Service scholarship. Dupree became a licensed drone pilot at Hinds Community College. She sees the agriculture sector moving toward agricultural technologies, especially drone technology since drones can take surveys and pictures and make maps. Dupree credits USDA with providing her enriching career preparation and experiences that have only continued since joining ARS after earning her Plant and Soil Science degree. Dupree also participated in a USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Extension program while attending Alcorn State University. USDA-NIFA’s Extension programs that help underserved communities are a Justice40 covered program (, 222 ), which is a type of federal program that falls within the scope of the initiative because it includes investments benefitting underserved communities.

"Taking the Summer On: AMS Interns Gain Valuable Experience  Without farmers and the agricultural businesses that support them, no one can eat. This is a simple concept, but it implies that people will continue to choose careers in agriculture. Here at USDA, one of the ways that we encourage younger generations to choose these careers is offering grants to institutions that offer agricultural curriculums.  Through the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), USDA enables students to expand their knowledge of the agricultural industry. NIFA provides grants to schools such as the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez (UPRM) through the Hispanic Serving Institutions Program.

This summer I had the honor of organizing the Feds, Farmers and Friends Feed Families Food Drive for the Southwest Region Food and Nutrition Service.  As the human resources liaison for the region, I don’t get the opportunity to work directly with partners or clients so this food drive gave me a very unique perspective on hunger.  I collected food items, sent out reminders to staff and ensured delivery of the food to the North Texas Food Bank. The Feds, Farmers, and Friends Feed Families program was USDA's contribution to the federal government-wide effort Feds Feed Families, led by the Office of Personnel Management. From June through September , USDA employees, farmers, and friends joined together to combat hunger and help children and families in need. This year's goal was to collect 1.2 million pounds of food from federal offices nationwide. I am proud to report that the Southwest Regional Office (SWR) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) staff donated 518 pounds of non-perishable food during the months of July and August.  We kept track of the donations by program area throughout the drive.  I am happy to report that the SWR Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children staff surpassed the donations made by all other program areas.  We have wrapped up our food drive for the summer and it has been a positive experience for everyone involved, especially FNS staff who had the opportunity to show who much they care about the community we serve – either on the job or through our volunteer efforts.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Forest Products Laboratory in  Forestry  Oct 09,  Research Microbiologist Carol Clausen discusses wood durability and protection research with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack during his visit to the Forest Products Laboratory. The Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) recently guided USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack through its unique set of research facilities. Basic and applied research at FPL supports a number of objectives, including forest management and restoration, the wise use of forest resources, job creation, and expanding economic opportunities through public-private partnerships on a national scale. Throughout his tour, Secretary Vilsack talked with lab leadership about FPL’s diverse and innovative research efforts. Project leaders used the opportunity to field questions from the Secretary and explain work ranging from wood preservation and durability to advances in “green” building strategies and technology, use of beetle-killed trees, work on historic timber bridges, and advances in nanocellulose-related materials and applications. In FPL’s unique weather testing facility, project leader Carol Clausen described how wall assemblies can be tested for a range of harsh conditions, from heavy rain and extreme heat to high humidity and strong winds. “Developing durable building materials for green construction is a win-win situation for the Nation’s forests and the American people,” Clausen told Vilsack. “Utilizing beetle-killed trees to create value-added products, improves forest health, reduces the wildfire threat and creates jobs.” In the Engineering Mechanics and Remote Sensing Laboratory, project leader Bob Ross brought out the big gun—an air-powered debris launcher used to develop protective safe-rooms in hurricane and tornado-prone areas. The Secretary watched as the unique air-cannon blasted an eight-foot, 2x4 board into a test wall of cross-laminated material at over 100 miles per hour. The board didn’t shatter but the test-wall took quite a dent. In the world renowned Nanocellulose Pilot Plant, project leader Alan Rudie walked the Secretary through some of FPL’s most advanced equipment. High-strength and extremely versatile, nanocellulose materials can be used for a variety of applications including ballistic glass; small, powerful transistors; and heat-resistant additives for concrete, among many other uses. Zhiyong Cai, project leader for FPL’s engineered composite science unit, demonstrated uses for cellulose nanofibrils material in bio-degradable electronic parts, high performance insolation aerogel material, and regenerated cellulose braided reinforced fabric. “The Secretary was very interested in nanotechnology applications in forest products research,” said Cai. “He was impressed with the impact that cellulose nanomaterial could bring to not only the forest products industry, but also electronics and other industries.”  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Tags:  Forest Products Laboratory  Forestry  FS  Nanotechnology  Tom Vilsack",What is one of the potential applications of nanocellulose materials highlighted in the article?,One of the potential applications of nanocellulose materials highlighted in the article is heat-resistant additives for concrete.

"Collaboration Key to Aiding Hurricane Sandy Victims  Tough times and dire circumstances have a longstanding history of bringing America’s communities and organizations together.  The recent storms that descended on much of the nation’s Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions have underscored these important partnerships. For many of the stricken areas, including the urban centers in the Northeast, natural disasters of this scale are relatively rare.  And households containing the very young, elderly and those with special needs are of particular concern to USDA and our many partners engaged in these emergencies. To aid those in Hurricane Sandy’s crosshairs, USDA swiftly coordinated with FEMA, States, and partner organizations to provide disaster nutrition assistance in 13 states.  By issuing automatic, mass replacement of SNAP benefits to certain households hit by the storm – for instance – SNAP individuals and families currently participating in SNAP will be able to replace their food purchased with SNAP benefits that spoiled due to flooding and power outages.  In the severely affected areas of New Jersey and New York SNAP recipients will be granted a waiver to purchase hot foods with their benefits.  In addition, USDA has worked with retailer trade associations to ensure SNAP authorized stores are aware of this waiver and eligibility for the purchase of hot foods through the month of November.  Meanwhile, several other States have been granted extensions to report loss of food purchased with their SNAP benefits and to request replacement benefits.

"Senior Policy Advisor for the Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Aug 18,  Tribal nations across what we now consider the Great Plains relied for millennia on their buffalo relatives for food, medicine, clothing, tools, and shelter. Yet today it is hard to find buffalo meat on school meal trays in the very areas where they once sustained Native communities. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is working with tribal partners to figure out why and to remove the barriers we can. The Biden-Harris Administration and Secretary Vilsack have made it a priority to better meet our federal trust and treaty responsibilities. Historically, the U.S. government played a significant role in the decimation of the buffalo population in the North American continent, with a policy of destroying buffalo in order to starve Native Americans into submission. We recognize the weight of these actions and our obligation to better support tribes in restoring buffalo across their lands. On Monday, June 6, my colleagues at FNS, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Rural Development, Agricultural Marketing Service, and the USDA Office of Tribal Relations, and I were honored to be invited by the InterTribal Buffalo Council (ITBC) and members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to participate in a traditional buffalo slaughter and field harvest. ITBC is a coalition of 69 federally recognized tribes that has led the work to restore buffalo to Indian Country since . Our traditional harvest was led by Lisa and Arlo Iron Cloud who work with Makoce Agriculture Development, an Indigenous agriculture organization led by Nick Hernandez on Pine Ridge. Ms. Iron Cloud is also partnering with USDA’s Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative to help create resources on sustainable, Indigenous food foraging practices. This “hands-on” experience was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for which we are so grateful to Lisa, Arlo, the ITBC, and the Oglala Lakota Nation Tribal leadership to get a glimpse into the cultural, spiritual, and practical contributions of buffalo to the Lakota people. We saw first-hand the importance of providing opportunities for American Indian children to engage in hands-on nutrition education about buffalo and to be able to taste and regularly eat buffalo as part of their school meals. FNS has worked to address some of the barriers that make it challenging for schools to serve buffalo, but we recognize that we must do more. We look forward to continuing to partner with ITBC and tribal leaders to advance Indigenous food sovereignty priorities and restore buffalo in Indian Country.

"USDA Agricultural Research Service Information Staff in  Research and Science  Nov 05,  ARS researchers have compiled a comprehensive set of rankings for flavor traits for tomatoes to give breeders a better chance to improve the taste of supermarket tomatoes. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. If you want to stir consumers’ passions about produce, just mention tomatoes. There’s no shortage of outrage about those supermarket tomatoes that look as pretty as a picture, but sometimes aren’t much tastier than the carton in which they’re shipped. It’s not like consumers aren’t willing to give store-bought tomatoes a try; tomatoes are a $ates.  But there’s a tug of war between large-scale producers and consumers: The producers need firm tomatoes that can withstand long-distance shipping and long-term storage, while consumers want that garden-fresh taste. Fortunately, the scientists of USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) are working on resolving the conflict.  They’ve been exploring tomato’s genetic diversity to uncover information that could help breeders develop a tastier tomato. To do this, the scientists raised 173 varieties of tomatoes on test plots in North Carolina, trained 10 “taste-testers” and asked them to rate the tomatoes on a scale of one to five in the areas of odor, taste, flavor and texture. The tomatoes were selected from the approximately 6,000 accessions in the ARS Tomato Germplasm Collection in Geneva, New York, because they represent a cross-section of the world’s tomato diversity. The answer was surprisingly simple:  Although thousands of components go into determining a tomato’s flavor and other characteristics, the key players are the amounts of sugar and acid.  There’s also a positive correlation between sweetness and flavor:  the sweeter the tomato, the more flavorful it is. The results of this study represent a treasure trove for tomato breeders, offering a comprehensive set of rankings on various tomatoes’ flavor qualities, sweetness, vitamin C content, sugar and acid content, and other characteristics. The findings also are good news for breeders because they demonstrate the vast variation and the broad range of possibilities for adjusting sugar levels and developing more flavorful tomatoes.  This means “building a better tomato” shouldn’t be that difficult because both sugar and acid content in the fruit can be reliably and inexpensively measured as the breeders work their magic to deliver backyard-tomato flavor on the supermarket shelves.

"Wisconsin USDA Public Information Officer in  Energy  Rural  Mar 28,  USDA funding of biodigester technology, coupled with nearby wind turbines, produce enough renewable energy to power an entire Wisconsin county. The escalation in prices for energy from fossil fuel has set the stage for the domestic production of renewable energy as a national priority. Not only can the production of renewable energy reduce fossil fuel dependence, but it has the potential to create quality American jobs, combat global warming, and lay a strong foundation for a robust rural economy. This point was not only emphasized in President Obama’s State of the Union address in January, but again upon the President’s recent visit to two Manitowoc, Wisconsin, businesses; showcasing them as leaders in solar power and energy-efficient technology. Manitowoc is not the only place in Wisconsin that is leading the way in renewable energy and energy efficient systems. Just to the north, in Kewaunee County, they, too, are on the cutting edge of the renewable energy race. Kewaunee County is home to 20,300 residents and agriculture is the third leading employer for county residents; has become a forerunner, a model, in the generation and use of renewable energy on a large scale within the last seven years. Today, there are two anaerobic digesters, both on cattle dairy farms, and three wind farms in operation throughout Kewaunee County.  Collectively, these systems generate enough power to support and sustain 8,000 households. With a total of 8,900 households located in the entire county, renewable energy is powering Kewaunee County, Wis. The revolution began in when both Wisconsin Public Service (WPS) and Madison Gas and Electric (MG&E) constructed winds farms in Kewaunee County. Then in , John Pagel of Pagel’s Ponderosa Dairy, LLC was awarded a renewable energy grant from USDA Rural Development for the purchase and installation of an anaerobic digester. That anaerobic digester takes mainly livestock manure, and processes that waste into energy. Pagel Ponderosa, the largest dairy farm in the state at 4,200 head of cattle and the largest employer in the area, generates enough energy to power more than 800 homes. One year later, Pagel’s partner and co-owner of Dairy Dreams, LLC, Don Niles, was also approved for a USDA grant. Grant funds were again used for the purchase and installation of an anaerobic digester on the Dairy Dreams Farm. Dairy Dreams is a 2,800 head dairy farm located in Casco, Wis. With the addition of this new digester that started production late in , Dairy Dreams generates enough green energy to power 600 homes in Kewaunee County, producing approximately 780 kilowatts an hour. Anaerobic Digesters process and ultimately produce energy from livestock manure. In addition to the production of energy, solid byproducts of the system are dried and used on the farm as livestock bedding material, and liquid byproducts are used as high-quality organic fertilizer in place of chemical fertilizers. “The decision for the digesters was an easy one for us,” said Niles.  “As a nation we saw that we’re becoming more dependent on foreign oil, and we were concerned with fuel being available locally. Looking all around us we had a renewable resource available. This was the right thing to do for both the nation and our neighbors.” The green energy produced by the digesters is ultimately sold back to the grid at WPS, helping to lower energy costs for area residents throughout the county. “Not only is this good for energy independence, but we do try to be mindful of our neighbors and area residents.  The anaerobic digesters allow us to use a high quality organic fertilizer that is produced right here, generated directly from the digester and the energy producing processes, helping us to eliminate odor problems and the need to spread liquid waste,” added Niles.  “We are a blue collar and agricultural county, we pride ourselves on the many ways that we are self-sufficient, and this is just another means of supporting ourselves and our neighbors.” Partners on these projects include GHD, Inc. in Chilton, Wis., Focus on Energy, and Wisconsin Public Service. USDA supports deployment of anaerobic digesters through Rural Development, Farm Service Agency and NRCS programs.  To find out how to fund renewable energy projects for your farm or business click here.

From water lines, broadband networks, wastewater treatment plants, single and multi-family housing, electric lines, senior centers, hospitals and small businesses, Rural Development helps build communities from the ground up working in partnership with local groups. Last year, 73 Kentucky counties enduring some of the state’s toughest economic challenges were designated to receive targeted USDA support through USDA’s StrikeForce for Rural Growth and Opportunity Initiative. Soon thereafter, President Obama designated a region of eight counties in the state’s southeast corner as one of the country’s first five Promise Zones.  Under these designations, USDA works with local partners to leverage federal resources to address the area’s chronic poverty challenges and improve the overall quality of life in the region.

"Public Affairs Officer, Inyo National Forest in  Forestry  Oct 23,  The Mary Road Bike Path gains nearly 1,000 feet of breathtaking elevation over 5.3 miles of Inyo National Forest land. US Forest Service photo. A ceremony Oct. 20 in Mammoth Lakes, Calif., marked the completion of a series of important federal, state, and locally funded trail projects, the official grand opening of the Mammoth Lakes Trail System, and the celebration of the agency partnerships that supported it. The project helped to create a network of trails from within the town of Mammoth Lakes going out to the surrounding public lands. Several noteworthy long-term trails projects were honored including the completion of the Lakes Basin Path, and the wayfinding and interpretive signage that was installed along paths and trails in the area. The Inyo National Forest, the Town of Mammoth Lakes, the Eastern Sierra Interpretive Association, and the Mammoth Lakes Trails and Public Access Foundation teamed to commemorate the occasion with tours, Summer of Stewardship volunteer trail projects, and a ribbon-cutting and dedication ceremony at the Mammoth Lakes Welcome Center. Construction of the Class Bike Path began in August of and opened to the public four years later. In the intervening years it grew to a larger, partner-funded project. On its way to Horseshoe Lake, the path gains nearly 1,000 feet of breathtaking elevation over 5.3 miles of Inyo National Forest land. The signs’ locations and placements are being jointly managed by Inyo National Forest and Town Public Works Department personnel through a Challenge Cost Share Agreement. US Forest Service photo. Both the bike path project and a road rehabilitation project were funded through a variety of sources including the Recovery Act. The construction included 5.7 miles of asphalt bike path (separated from traffic) for bikes and pedestrians, 27,000 sq. ft. of retaining walls, several prefabricated bridges, a pedestrian/bike tunnel, concrete curbs and gutters and 1.3 miles of roadway improvements and  erosion control. A total of 125 wayfinding signs and 16 interpretive exhibits were also installed along various Mammoth Lakes paths and trails. The design, fabrication and installation of these signs on national forest land was made possible by Forest Service Recovery Act funds.  Their location and placement is being jointly managed by Inyo National Forest and Town Public Works Department personnel through a Challenge Cost Share Agreement. The new interpretive exhibits panels have been designed to help travelers along the bike path learn more about the cultural and natural history of the Mammoth Lakes area.  They are meant to improve the quality of the recreation experience and are a key component of an effort to grow the local tourism economy. Integral to this new signage are QR (quick response) codes that will, when scanned with a smartphone, connect visitors with additional information about the surrounding area. This enhanced content is channeled through the new Mammoth Lakes Trail System Web site, which offers detailed trail, destination, activity and experience information for the entire 300-plus miles of trails. It also connects users to nationally renowned forests, parks, wilderness areas, and other outdoor attractions. The U.S. Forest Service is waiving fees at most of its day-use recreation sites over the Veterans Day holiday weekend, Nov. 10-12.

"NRCS Helps to Keep Native American Traditions Alive  The 567 federally-recognized Native American Tribes are unique in their own way—from their languages and family structure, to their clothing and food. Tribes are working hard to revive their roots to help reconnect their heritage to the land, rekindle their spiritual bonds and cultural traditions, and raise awareness amongst future generations; especially tribal youth in line to inherit the land. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) works with the tribes like the Choctaw Indians, comprised of nearly 10,ates, to farm and harvest hickory king corn and other heirloom white varieties, and process them to make hominy. Hominy is made from dried corn kernels, but it is expensive to purchase. NRCS provides the tribe with technical assistance to help transform idle land into a hominy-making enterprise–enabling the tribe to provide their own locally-grown, fresh produce, and cut their expenses by growing the corn.  Jocelyn Benjamin, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service  Posted in  Conservation  Nov 04,   Respond to this story",How does NRCS assistance help Native American tribes revive their cultural traditions and spiritual bonds by farming heirloom corn varieties and making hominy?,"NRCS provides technical assistance to transform idle land into a hominy-making enterprise, enabling tribes like the Choctaw Indians to grow heirloom corn varieties locally, reducing expenses, and promoting food self-sufficiency."
"Conservation Program Pre-Proposals Due July 8  This summer, 40 organizations from Michigan, Ohio and Indiana will work together to help agricultural producers reduce phosphorus runoff that ends up in the western Lake Erie basin, affecting water quality and contributing to algae blooms. This is an example of how the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) can be used to solve natural resource challenges in a community, state or region. Eligible conservation coalitions nationwide have about a week to submit pre-proposals to improve soil health, preserve clean water, combat drought and protect wildlife habitat. The deadline is July 8th. USDA is investing up to $235 million through RCPP to improve the nation's water quality, combat drought, enhance soil health, support wildlife habitat and protect agricultural viability.

"Director, USDA Office of Tribal Relations in  Food and Nutrition  Feb 03,  From the beginning of the Biden-Harris administration, Secretary Vilsack has challenged our team to rethink USDA initiatives from an indigenous perspective. One of the most important things we do at USDA is publish the Dietary for Americans (DGAs) with our partners at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). These evidence-based nutrition are informed by recommendations from a committee of nutrition science experts and updated every five years. For the DGAs, USDA and HHS sought an advisory committee that would be reflective of the full diversity within the United States, with the understanding that our backgrounds can affect our nutritional needs. The broader composition of the committee will ensure the resulting reflect the nutritional and cultural needs of all Americans. We are pleased that the recently announced committee moves us closer to this goal. As USDA Director of Tribal Relations, I want to particularly note the historic appointment of the first tribal citizen of which we are aware to serve on a DGA advisory committee, Dr. Valarie Blue Bird Jernigan, a member of the Choctaw tribe. Dr. Blue Bird Jernigan’s extensive qualifications include a doctorate and master’s public health and serving as executive director of the Center for Indigenous Health Research and Policy at Oklahoma State University, where she is a professor of Rural Health. In addition to the DGAs, USDA is committed to providing technical assistance and removing barriers to serving traditional foods in our food and nutrition programs, as part of our Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative. This work is part of the Biden-Harris administration’s commitment to recognizing Indigenous Knowledge in federal policy, research, and decision-making processes.

"Communications Staff Intern, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Aug 01,  Researchers at the University of Illinois found that elements of purple corn might help fight several diseases. From left, food science professor Elvira Gonzalez de Mejia, postdoctoral researcher Diego Luna-Vital and crop sciences professor John Juvik. Photo by L. Brian Stauffer, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Purple corn is more than tasty and eye-catching. Scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have discovered a game-changing element of purple corn – it may help reduce the risk of major health diseases. While developing new types of purple corn, the researchers found some with elevated levels of a naturally occurring chemical that may fight obesity, inflammation, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain types of cancer. They also found that the outer layer of kernels might be used as natural food coloring. USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture is supporting this research with funds through the Hatch Act. Hatch funds support agricultural research to solve problems that concern more than one state. The research team, led by food science professor Elvira Gonzalez de Mejia and crop sciences professor John Juvik, created 20 varieties of the Apache Red maize strain, each with a different amount and type of anthocyanins, the element that gives the maize its distinct color. Studies have shown that eating anthocyanin-rich foods may reduce the risk of disease. In one finding, the scientists tested purple corn’s phenolic compounds against insulin resistance. They induced insulin resistance in the mouse fat cells, treated the cells with the anthocyanin compounds, and monitored the glucose uptake. They found that insulin resistance decreased by 29-64 percent. Although more studies are needed, the research suggests that phenolic compounds might improve the insulin profile of people who are obese. Juvik also described an extra benefit of purple corn. He noted that the natural color of purple corn could potentially be used as a food color replacement for red dye No. 40 – one of the major dyes used in the United States. People could then easily gain some health benefits through a natural, anthocyanin-rich pigment dye that is added to foods and beverages. NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

"Getting Geeky at the 3rd Annual USA Science and Engineering Festival  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. When you think of agriculture do you think of science and engineering? You should! Farmers are some of our original scientists, tinkering with plant varieties and farming techniques to find ways to reliably grow food. At USDA, we still do that kind of research in a never-ending effort to find better ways to produce food, fuel, and fiber. We also do a lot of research you might not think of when you think about agriculture: from forensic genetic analysis to track down unwanted pests to figuring out how to turn spent grain from distilleries into biodegradable kitty litter.

"Interim Director, National Agroforestry Center in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Sep 16,  Nicola Macpherson is the owner of Ozark Forest Mushrooms in Salem, Missouri. With the assistance of her state’s forestry agency, a Forest Stewardship Plan was developed to help her sustainably manage the forest and produce wholesome mushroom products at the same time.  Imagine an open field of vegetables and greens, exposed to the sun and the wind on the outskirts of your town.  Now imagine a row of trees sheltering the crops from hot dry winds and producing more marketable melons than in open fields; more snap beans earlier and later in the season when prices are higher. Now imagine a row of shrubs next to the trees bearing fresh fruits such as plums, chokecherries, and elderberries that become jams, jellies, pies, and wines.  Imagine another row of trees producing a bounty of healthy and delicious nuts such as black walnuts, pecans, and chestnuts. There may be woods nearby, thick with dense undergrowth.  Imagine these woods providing income for generations to come, for thousands of forest landowners.  The bounty of foods these woods can produce include delectable mushrooms and tasty ramps (a wild leek); materials such as bittersweet vine and curly willow for creating home decorations; and medicinals such as ginseng and goldenseal. Nicola Macpherson is the owner of Ozark Forest Mushrooms in Salem, Missouri.  With the assistance of her state’s forestry agency, the Missouri Department of Conservation, a Forest Stewardship Plan was developed that helped her business to sustainably manage the forest and produce wholesome mushroom products at the same time.  Using branch wood from trees that are selectively thinned, she inoculates them with mushroom spawn and has built a profitable forest farming business in shiitake mushrooms. Nicola Macpherson, agroforester, with her mushrooms and a lot more on her Missouri forestry farm. “With assistance from the USDA Forest Stewardship Program, we are able to harvest a renewable supply of mushroom bed logs to grow shiitake mushrooms while at the same time keeping our Ozark forest healthy,” says Nicola. This is agroforestry...blending trees and agriculture to enhance the sustainable production of food and other useful products while protecting our soil and water, diversifying and expanding local economies, providing wildlife habitat, and ensuring a more pleasing and healthy place to work and live.  Agroforestry takes advantage of the interactive benefits from combining trees and shrubs with crops and/or livestock, and practices include alley cropping, forest farming, riparian forest buffers, silvopasture, windbreaks, and other special applications.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Kentucky in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Nov 05,  Chris and Tracy Adams with their daughters Ashley and Abigail. Similar to the old adage, when Chris Adams married the wife, he married the family – and the family farm. Lucky for him, he loves farming and enjoys working with his in-laws to manage the 4,000-acre farm of soybeans, wheat and corn.  Now it’s his full-time job, working with his brother-in-law to raise fields of commodity crops each year. But recently, Chris and Tracy Adams, and the rest of the family, began experimenting with farming at a much smaller scale. They built a seasonal high tunnel, a greenhouse-like structure that produces a plentiful supply of strawberries, raspberries, tomatoes and peppers. High tunnels are made of plastic or metal pipe and covered with sheeting, typically made of plastic. Unlike greenhouses, they require no energy to heat, instead relying on natural sunlight to create favorable conditions for growing vegetables and other specialty crops. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service offers technical and financial assistance for landowners, like the Adams family, to build seasonal high tunnels. Sandra Voils, Adams’ mother-in-law, serves on the Russell County Soil and Water Conservation District board of supervisors, so she first told her family about high tunnels and how they could benefit from one. Chris and Tracy Adams did extensive research on strawberries and raspberries and decided they would focus on these fruits for the high tunnel’s first year. Chris and Tracy Adams with their daughters Ashley and Abigail in front of their high tunnel. The Adams family, with NRCS’ help, also installed drip irrigation and planted a row of wildflowers next to the high tunnel to attract pollinators to help the plants in the garden to flourish. The drip irrigation allows them to apply water at the base of plants, ensuring water is used wisely. Local buyers who have heard about the delicious berries give their phone number to Tracy, asking her to let them know when they’re ready. “I like my produce fresh, and we pick the day we sell them, that way the berries are at the freshest possible condition,“ she said. Thanks to the seasonal high tunnel, her new morning staple has become Greek yogurt with fresh raspberries. “It is rewarding to go pick your breakfast fresh,” she said. “It is a great way to start the day.” The stages of the growth on the plants in the high tunnel are evident.

"Administrator, Mid Atlantic Region, Food and Nutrition Service, USDA in  Initiatives  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Aug 02,   Puerto Rico’s agriculture has been steadily declining and imports total 85 percent of the food consumed on the island. Additionally, almost all of the $11 million per year that USDA purchases for use in Puerto Rico’s school meals are purchased from companies in the continental United States.  What’s more, each year the island’s School Food Authority purchases about $80 million in food to be served in school.  We saw these as opportunities for local farmers and decided to do something about it. The Market Expansion Conference, held June 23-24 in San Juan, teamed seven U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agencies and other Commonwealth and federal partners to show over 250 farmers how to sell food to local schools, expand their businesses and increase their participation in USDA programs.  Puerto Rico’s milk farmers, cattle ranchers, pineapple growers and many others eagerly listened to USDA experts explain grading and licensing, and provide information in the areas of funding and procurement. Juan Ortiz Servia, State Executive Director for the USDA Farm Service Agency, greets a local farmer at the Market Expansion Conference held June 22 & 23 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. USDA has many diverse constituencies and, as part of our cultural transformation, we are working to reach and serve those constituents in the most effective way possible.  In this case it meant conducting the entire conference in Spanish.  Juan Garcia, Acting Deputy Administrator for Farm Service Agency (FSA)’s Farm Programs, even delivered the keynote address in Spanish. Meanwhile, an interpreter helped me and other linguistically-challenged participants understand the discussions through headphones. It was worth it.  The two-day conference held the farmers’ attention, the media covered the event and the evaluations sheets gave us rave reviews.  Our commitment didn’t end with the conference; we’ll continue to help local agriculture flourish and Puerto Rico’s children will benefit from locally-grown, nutritious foods.

"Director, USDA/HSINP Future Scientists Program and Senior Research Associate, Center for Mathematics and Science Education, College of Science, Texas A&M University in  Research and Science  Jun 14,  Future Scientists Program teachers in the field with ARS research entomologist John Goolsby, learning about his research on bio-control for Giant Reed (Arundo donax) in the Rio Grande Valley. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. The goal of USDA’s Hispanic-Serving Institutions National Program (HSINP) Future Scientists Program is to enhance the scientific knowledge of teachers, helping them to become more effective in encouraging student interest and progress in science. Teachers in the program attend two-day summer institutes at Agricultural Research Service (ARS) labs nationwide, where scientists introduce them to various research projects. ARS researchers share scientific knowledge with the teachers, who then share it with their students to encourage them to become future scientists. One of the catalysts for this lofty goal is a tiny, inconspicuous and innocuous caterpillar—the corn earworm that wreaks havoc in corn fields nationwide as an agricultural pest.  This program began in .  I brought 10 teachers into the ARS Southern Plains Agricultural Research Center (SPARC) in College Station, Texas, for a summer institute that included teachers studying in corn research plots searching for corn earworm caterpillars in 100-degree heat! It was the first time I made caterpillars the focus of this program. Since then, the program has expanded to include students visiting various ARS research labs. I have also harnessed the caterpillar’s “intrigue factor,” since students are intrigued by insects.  They are intrigued by the magic of metamorphosis—particularly when the caterpillar transforms into a beautiful moth.  They are intrigued that they can learn by observation.  They are intrigued enough to ask questions about the worm and then conduct research projects to find answers. The ARS Southeast Area insectary in Stoneville, Mississippi, generously supplies the program with all the worms we need. Students conduct research on the worms and then make presentations at the end of their school year at their local ARS lab at a Future Scientists Student Research Presentation Day. They also take tours and learn about other research projects at the labs. One student who presented in subsequently became a student summer worker at SPARC while in high school, continued working while studying entomology at junior college, and has just received a scholarship to attend Texas A&M University. This year, his teacher brought four of her current fifth-graders to present their research on the worm.  These are just four of the 86,000 students (grades K through 12) whom we have interacted with in the past 21 years of the Future Scientist Program. During that time, 5,600 teachers have studied Ag Science at 36 of the ARS labs nationwide.

"Assistant National Fisheries Program Leader, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Aug 27,  The Twelvemile Creek restoration monitoring crew and Fish Tech Boot Camp students and instructors pose for a photo in front of a screw trap, which captures coho and steelhead smolt that our migrating out to the ocean. The fish are released after being measured and marked with a coded wire tag. Students from Port Protection, Thorne Bay, and Klawock, Alaska, joined the crew composed of staff from the U.S. Forest Service, Sitka Conservation Society and the University of Alaska Southeast Fish Tech Program. Photo credit: Scott Harris, Sitka Conservation Society This post was co-authored with Andrew Thoms, Executive Director of the Sitka Conservation Society. “The thing that our forests grow best is salmon!” is the local phrase that a visitor is most likely to hear when visiting some of the 32 communities that live near the Tongass National Forest of Southeast Alaska.  Tongass National Forest staff, local school districts, a local conservation organization, and the University of Alaska have undertaken a joint project to figure out how a forest can be managed to create jobs and other economic opportunities and guarantee the long-term sustainable yield of the Tongass’ fisheries resources. For thousands of years, the Tongass has been occupied by humans, supported by the bounty of salmon and other marine and forest resources of the Pacific coast.  Today, salmon and fisheries continue to be the core of Southeast Alaska’s economy.  Staff at the Tongass National Forest estimate that the Tongass produces over 25 percent of all salmon harvested in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean and is responsible for over $1 billion of economic activity a year. Given the historic and current cultural and economic importance of salmon, it is only logical that entities within the region are thinking about a salmon future. “The Forest Service, the University of Alaska Southeast Fisheries Technologies Program, school districts on Prince of Wales Island and the Sitka Conservation Society came together to host the ‘fisheries technician boot camp,’” said Andrew Thoms, executive director of the Sitka Conservation Society.  “Our goals were two-fold: first, we wanted to give youth on-the-job experience by working as part of a team monitoring salmon returns and spawning in a recently restored river. Second, we wanted to give students an idea of the jobs and careers available to them as land managers, essentially serving as stewards of the amazing salmon resource that the Tongass National Forest produces.”  In the program, students received hands-on training in fish capture, fish identification and tagging of juvenile salmon out-migrating to the ocean. Students received both college and high school credits for the experience. Not only does the project collect valuable for the Forest Service, but the students are also gaining a great deal. Tamar Theurer, from Port Protection, Alaska, was one of the students selected for the program. “I learned how to clip adipose fins and I learned how to identify different types of salmon and other fish,” Theurer said. “I learned more about the environment and habitats of fish and birds; and oh, I also learned my trees! Some of them at least. I want to go into fisheries, so not only will I have knowledge of how to do these things but I can also use this experience on my resume.” This project is one of many collaborative efforts currently taking place on the Tongass National Forest and one of a wealth of programs to restore and protect wild Pacific salmon runs and fisheries stocks. Awareness is growing of the important role that National Forest System lands and watersheds play in producing wild Pacific salmon stocks. This program, and many others like it, will be integral to ensuring that salmon stocks continue to run thousands of years into the future.  The program received support from the National Forest Foundation.

"Washington Office, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Mar 12,  Robert Stovall, the deputy district ranger on the Seward Ranger District on Alaska’s Chugach National Forest, takes a moment to relax at the Russian River Falls Overlook. As a sport fisherman he enjoys hooking the big, aggressive silvers, also known as coho salmon. (U.S. Forest Service photo) To be a wildlife biologist and to be in Alaska … it’s not a question, it’s the good life for this Forest Service land manager. Just ask Robert Stovall, the deputy district ranger for the Seward Ranger District since for Alaska’s Chugach National Forest. There are no roads into the forest’s interior. Beyond a two to three-mile road journey, you’ll find yourself in back country with no improved roads, a land full of beautiful scenery, lots of native wildlife, adventures and challenges. Stovall is engaged in managing the various resources on the district and assists with overall forest management activities such as the effects of a large bark beetle outbreak 10 years ago that today involves restoring about a third of the district. As a line officer focused on managing the agency’s multiple use mission, he feels he’s found his niche. “The opportunity to focus on programs that involve multiple resources is very rewarding,” said Stovall. “It’s the chance to work in timber, minerals, fire programs, wildlife and fisheries, heritage, and watersheds which involve working with interdisciplinary teams to help guide the projects.” Stovall has spent his 35-year career as a land management steward for national wildlife refuges and national forests across the nation.  During that time, he’s experienced some of the most soul-refreshing and adventure-inspiring scenery, beheld eye-to-eye encounters with moose and bear, weathered the vagaries of changes in Alaska’s yearly snowfalls, and helped residents and visitors enjoy their national lands. Part of his focus is also helping the next generation learn to appreciate the many ways to enjoy getting outside. The forest is known as the Chugach Children’s Forest which provides opportunities for outdoor educational activities and expeditions to help children learn about nature. “We’re working with schools and other young adults and youth-oriented employment groups,” he said. “This is very important because these folks are eventually going to be doing my job and I love to see them get interested in doing my job the way I did by going out and being in the woods.” One of those activities involved exploring a snowfield that was used by native Alaskans in prehistoric times. Stovall accompanied a youth expedition for an ice patch survey which involved a 10-mile horseback ride to the edge of ice fields on Devil’s Creek Trail to look for prehistoric signs of hunted caribou. While the kids learned more about their culture, Stovall experienced a different kind of adventure. Chugach Deputy District Ranger Robert Stovall’s horse ride on the Chugach National Forest’s Devils Pass Trail to accompany youth on an archaeological survey expedition proved a courage-inducing experience leaving him a bit ‘astounded’ by this first-time horseback encounter. (U.S. Forest Service photo) “With a steep drop off, you kind of want the horse to hug the inside of the trail. For the old rangers of , or , it was their standard operating procedure to ride a horse,” he said. “Fast forward 100 years and I’m there getting on a horse for the first time in my life, and for me, it was not one of those experiences I was immediately ready to repeat. This particular ranger was kind of astounded by it. I’m glad I can say that I’ve done it.” Fishing is a major industry and recreational activity on the Chugach.  A world-renowned fishery for sockeye salmon sits on the clear waters of the district’s Russian River where sportsmen can see the fish and a personal use fishery is located on the lower portions of the Kenai River, the major river on the Kenai Peninsula which flows out of the glacially-fed Kenai Lake. Dip net fishing with a four to five-foot diameter net is popular with fishermen who stand in the river and wait for the fish to swim into the net.  One of Stovall’s hobbies is mastering the joy of ‘catching the big one. “My favorite pastime is of course fishing, especially salmon fishing. Fishing for silvers, also known as coho, salmon fishing is probably the most fun because they bite at the lures, they’re a big fish, and they’re relatively aggressive,” said Stovall. “They’re not an easy fish to catch unless you have a lot in an area and you can use a snagging hook method to make them easier to catch.” When he’s not fishing, he’s exploring the trail system for hiking, biking and bird watching, nervously watching for black and brown bears while fishing, and watching the wildlife. “As a wildlife biologist, I think moose are probably the most stunning animal to observe. It’s amazing how an animal that large can all of a sudden be right before you. You come around a corner and there’s a moose. Your first instinct is to run, which if you have to do it, run in a zigzag fashion,” he cautioned. “Remember, with a bear just back away or let it go where it wants to go and then you go somewhere else.” The Chugach was also chosen as this year’s national forest to provide the Capitol Christmas Tree and it will most likely come from the Seward Ranger District.
