It would be difficult for a traveler not to find a site worthy of a great painting or a great photograph. USDA Photo by Bob Nichols. One of the best destinations to visit in New England is the White Mountain National Forest, with its campgrounds, hiking trails, scenic drives, beautiful landscapes and world renowned fall foliage. The forest has recently been adopted by the National Forest Foundation as one of its “Treasured Landscapes,” for its on-the-ground restoration needs due to damage from flooding, woody debris, sediment and erosion caused by Tropical Storm Irene in . In , the Foundation launched its Treasured Landscapes, Unforgettable Experiences campaign to focus on building public-private partnerships in support of large-scale forest and watershed restoration across America’s National Forest System and community engagement. This campaign is concentrated in 14 iconic sites from Alaska to Florida, with the White Mountain National Forest becoming one of the campaign’s newest sites this year. “This new partnership with the Foundation, allows us to continue ongoing watershed restoration, repair trails and bridge damage, and address any spread of invasive plan species caused by the storm” said White Mountain National Forest Supervisor Tom Wagner. Perhaps your next stop during the fall or winter season will be the White Mountain National Forest. Whether you’re a returning or first-time visitor, you must explore this “Treasured Landscape” in New England. NOTE: Recent weather events have impacted some national forests on the East Coast. Campgrounds, roads and trails may be closed because of the storm. Visitors are advised to call ahead to the local ranger district office to find out about forest openings and closures before setting out on a trip.  The National Forest Service has waived fees during the Veterans Day Holiday weekend. To learn more click here.

"Shawnee National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jan 31,  The Shawnee National Forest will offer a new school program this year called Naturalist in the Classroom. Youngsters will have an opportunity to enjoy the Shawnee National Forest, like the kids here at the Young Trekkers afterschool program. Photo used with permission. With declining budgets in the public school system, there has been a steady decrease in school fieldtrips in recent years. This plight further widens the disconnect between children and nature. To help bridge the gap between the schoolroom and the natural world, the Shawnee National Forest will offer a new school program this year called Naturalist in the Classroom.  The program will be piloted to third- through fifth-grade students in Union and Alexander counties located in southern Illinois, and will focus on two themes – forest ecology and wetland ecology. Forest Service employees will visit the classroom several times during the semester to cover topics, such as the role of water, the function of wetlands, forest functions, and tree identification, or subjects identified by the teacher.  Naturalist in the Classroom will culminate in a one-day field trip at a Forest Service site with Forest Service natural resource and conservation education professionals to show students how what they learned applies in the field and in national forest management. There will be hands-on activities and games from various national curriculums, such as Project Learning Tree, Project Aquatic Wild and WOW! Wonders of Wetlands will be used. Naturalist in the Classroom aims to strengthen and expand the Shawnee’s environmental education program, get kids outdoors, and assist local educators in meeting Illinois’ learning standards.  Schools benefitting from the program are located in areas with high unemployment and have some of the highest underserved populations in southern Illinois. “We are really excited about implementing this new program in local schools,” said Allen Nicholas, forest supervisor at Shawnee National Forest.  “There are so many barriers to getting children in the outdoors these days.  We hope the Naturalist in the Classroom project will be the bridge in getting kids into the outdoors, as well as connecting them to the expertise of our natural resource professionals.” The spring application deadline is Feb. 5; the fall application deadline is Sept. 5.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Agricultural Research Service Information Staff. in  Research and Science  Jul 06,  (Left to right) Pennsylvania State University agricultural engineer Michael Hile, ARS agricultural engineer Al Rotz and ARS research associate Felipe Montes use a dynamic flux chamber to measure the emission rates of gaseous compounds from manure on a dairy barn floor. ARS photo  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. News by USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) indicates that moving dairy cows out of climate-controlled barns and onto the land may help to lessen the ecological impact of dairy farming without any corresponding loss of production. A team of ARS scientists in University Park, Pa., conducted a modeling study that evaluated how different management systems on a typical 250-acre Pennsylvania dairy farm would affect the environment.  The scientists collected a range of field and input it into their model to evaluate the environmental dynamics of four different dairy farms in all types of weather over 25 years. All four systems were set to produce the same amount of milk, adjusting for fat and protein, on the same land.  The model generated estimates for ammonia emissions from manure, impact on the soil including erosion and leaching of nitrates, and phosphorus losses from field runoff. Total emissions for the greenhouse gases methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide were 8 percent lower in year-round outdoor production than with cows tucked away in the barn.  Keeping dairy cows outdoors all year reduced the dairy operation’s ammonia emissions by about 30 percent. While barn-bound cows were estimated to each produce 22,000 pounds of milk per year, compared to only 13,000 pounds per foraging cow, the total amount of milk protein and fat produced was essentially the same.  That’s because the foraging cows produced milk that contained more fat and protein.

"Feed the Future: Together We Can  This week, USDA was honored to join forces with USAID and Islamic Relief USA to host the department’s 4th annual Iftar celebration. The event welcomed over 170 guests, including representatives from humanitarian organizations, faith-based groups and federal employees.  This year’s Iftar called attention to the importance of reducing food insecurity abroad with the theme “Feed the Future: Together We Can.” Iftar is an evening gathering held each year during Ramadan.  A time of spiritual cleansing in the Islamic faith, Ramadan is when Muslims fast, abstaining from food and water from sunrise until sunset. Iftar is the meal at which Muslims break their fast each night. For many Muslims, fasting is an act of empathy towards those around the world who go hungry not by choice, but instead by circumstance.

"Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics in  Research and Science  Nov 04,  Dr. Woteki works with 4-H members. The past eight years have been an extraordinary time for agricultural science, and for the application of new insights from other fields to enhance agricultural productivity and the overall agricultural economy. As the final days of this administration are approaching, it gives me a great deal of pride to look back at what USDA has accomplished in the areas of research and innovation. Scientific research is a fundamental part of our mission at USDA. But, ultimately, what's behind all the science is people – people who do the research and people who are affected by it. As USDA's Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics, I've met and worked with both as I've traveled across the country and around the world. I've seen the dedication and innovation of researchers at a USDA laboratory in California as they developed uses for drones and laser-guided sprayers as part of a ""precision agriculture"" movement. Their work allows the wise, efficient application of water and chemicals – as well as increased crop yields – in drought-ridden areas. I've seen the confident, solitary efforts of a Cornell University professor in the field of urban aquaponics who, with USDA funding, proved that he can not only raise 10,000 tilapia in fish tanks housed in the unlikely location of a high school basement in midtown Manhattan, but could then recirculate the fish tank water to nourish a thriving edible garden a few floors up in the school building. And I've seen the eagerness reflected in the faces of two young girls taking part in 4-H National Science Day activities in the nation's capital, applying science and technology skills and equipping themselves to possibly become part of the next generation of leaders in agricultural science. These people, and so many before them, embody the commitment to scientific innovation that is a major reason why Americans have not had to worry about food security since the Dust Bowl days of the s. To learn more about USDA's important scientific work, I invite you to take a few minutes to take a look at our results over the past eight years in our USDA Medium Chapter 11: Food and Ag Science Will Shape Our Future. The 21st Century has been referred to as the “Century for Biology,” and we are witnessing the applications of our heightened understanding of genes and gene traits to enhance crops and livestock. These applications, in turn, have been integral to USDA efforts like the transfer of germplasm and new plant varieties to the private sector here in the U.S. We are helping, through USDA’s partnership with the Agency for International Development and the “Feed the Future” initiative, in delivering UG99-resistant wheat varieties and improving the nutritional content of legumes—two examples of how our research and innovation are being applied to help improve food security around the world. Our work has been informed by projections that our global population will reach over 9.5 billion people by the year . To adequately feed that number of people would require an almost doubling of the world’s current level of agricultural production and a reduction in food loss and waste, at the same time the amount of farmable land is decreasing. As we continue to learn about the effects of a changing climate, our focus is on sustainably intensifying agricultural production to deliver the array of foods to provide for good health and foods that are free of disease-causing pathogens and toxins. We have developed a vision of a bioeconomy that by the year will produce a billion tons of biomass – agricultural residues, grasses, energy crops, forestry trimmings, algae and other sources – that will provide alternative sources of fuel, energy and other bioproducts. We have also focused research on developing agricultural systems that will be able to provide all of these services and be resilient in the face of climate change. Over the last eight years. We have faced numerous challenges and the results have been remarkable. There is still much to do, but we have left a solid foundation for continuing USDA’s work to support the American agricultural economy, to strengthen rural communities, to protect and conserve our natural resources, and to provide a safe, sufficient, and nutritious food supply for the American people.

On November 22, the United States and Israel came one step closer to renewing agricultural research and development activities that could produce new knowledge and innovations beneficial to both countries and increase the economic bottom line for farmers and ranchers. Dr. Sonny Ramaswamy, director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and Edo Chalutz, executive director of the U.S.–Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD), signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to promote collaboration via NIFA among U.S. and Israeli scientists and engineers. BARD and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), USDA’s intramural research agency, have cooperated on research together since BARD’s inception. While the MOU does not obligate either agency to specific funding, it offers the framework for facilitating collaborations through the partnership that BARD and the U.S. government have shared since . “The United States and Israel have a shared stake in dryland agriculture, high-value horticultural crops, and pest management. There should be ample opportunity for American and Israeli scientists to jointly continue to advance these and other important areas of science,” Ramaswamy said. One example of cooperation between the nations is water and soil management. Efficiency in water use is of particular interest since the Israelis have worked for years in to develop drip irrigation and have grappled with issues of soil salinity. Many U.S. scientists are conducting similar research, so this may be an area where the MOU could strengthen or begin new collaborative efforts. “This agreement will facilitate many mutual benefits, and we look forward to getting started,” Ramaswamy said. “In fact, we plan to use this MOU as a model for building other important global partnerships.” Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and Cooperative Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Aug 22,  USDA’s Agricultural Research Service and Purdue University researchers are working together to develop biological controls that protect against white grubs, which eat turf grass roots. During the U.S. Open held this summer in Erin Hills, Wisconsin, some of the world’s top golfers competed for a shot at becoming the champion (won by Brooks Koepka). The course’s meticulously groomed putting greens and fairways—like those of so many other golf facilities—are an inspiration to lawn-care enthusiasts near and far. But professional golf course superintendents and lawn-loving homeowners alike face a common foe: chubby, C-shaped pests called “white grubs,” which eat the turf grass roots. Unchecked, they cause brown spots or barren patches that mar the turf’s aesthetic value and even playability. Robert Behle isn’t an avid golfer, and you won’t find him competing with his neighbors for the best-looking lawn. But he does know a thing or two about insects—and even more about controlling them using their natural enemies. An Agricultural Research Service (ARS) entomologist, Behle specializes in ways to formulate naturally occurring fungi and other microorganisms into bio-based pesticides. In fact, he and Purdue University colleague Doug Richmond recently finished a three-year project funded by the U.S Golf Association (USGA) to evaluate the potential of the fungus Metarhizium brunneum to kill white grubs, the larval stages of Japanese, June, and other scarab beetles. The practice, known as “biological control,” is one that’s already found its way onto some golf courses. Indeed, a survey by the Environmental Institute for Golf found that 42 percent of 27-plus-hole golf facilities sometimes or frequently use biocontrol in their pest management practices. The researchers used an ARS patent-pending process called “liquid culture fermentation” to mass-produce the fungus and turn it into clay granules, which they applied at different rates to grub-infested turf grass plots at Purdue University. When they rolled back patches of the turf, a grizzly sight awaited them. Depending on the rates applied, 50 to 70 percent of the grubs lay dead beneath the soil, covered in a fuzzy growth that confirmed the fungus had infected and killed them—typically 7 to 10 days after exposure. An insecticide applied to different plots worked even faster, killing 95 percent of the grubs. However, when used in the fall, the chemical had lost some of its “punch” against larger-sized grubs compared to the fungus, which worked better with the cooler temperatures.  The findings, which the researchers published in a USGA annual report, could help golf course superintendents identify ways to use the fungus as part of an integrated pest management (IPM) approach, which combines judicious insecticide use with cultural, biological and other controls. Golfers needn’t be distracted by the prospects of this biocontrol fungus quietly working underfoot, though. Its absolute preference for infecting white grubs and other insect turf eaters means people, pets and wildlife won’t suffer the same fuzzy fate as these pests.

"International Programs Office, USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Trade  Oct 20,  In Nigeria, NASS representatives Matt Deaton, Terry Holland and John Campbell worked with Kaduna State Agricultural Development Programme, National Bureau of Statistics Federal Department of Agriculture to develop a stronger national agricultural statistics program. Today the United Nations is celebrating the first World Statistics Day, to raise awareness of official statistics, which are premised on the core value of service, professionalism and integrity. As one of the principal statistical agencies in the U.S., the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) has been heavily involved in establishing and improving agricultural statistics systems in countries around the world since the end of World War II. Food insecurity, shortfalls in regional food production and lack of reliable information on the agricultural sector are major concerns in many countries. Improved agricultural systems can provide more and better information to address these issues. This is why, over the past 10 years, NASS international projects have been instrumental in helping more than 30 developing and emerging market countries in Africa, Central and South America, Asia, and Central and Eastern Europe to develop and improve their agricultural statistics programs. Using our experience in conducting the census of agriculture, NASS is currently working with the Armenian National Statistics Service and the Ministry of Agriculture to conduct a full count of agriculture in Armenia. It has been 90 years since Armenia conducted its last census of agriculture. The upcoming census will also be Armenia’s first since the country gained its independence in . In addition to the Armenian census of agriculture, NASS is also currently working with the governments in Georgia, Brazil, Mongolia, Nigeria and Serbia. Our agency is also gearing up to start a new project in Moldova. We work to provide all of these countries with technical assistance and training on a reimbursable basis in all aspects of statistical surveys and systems. The benefits of such assistance extend beyond serving the interests of the various countries. By helping other countries improve their agricultural statistics systems, USDA’s ability to assess world food and fiber production is also improved. Establishing strong working relationships with other agricultural statisticians around the world allows NASS staff to gather and develop new ideas for improving the U.S. agricultural statistics system, while exposure to other cultures and work situations enhances our employees’ abilities to solve problems. For more information on NASS’s international programs for improving agricultural statistics, please contact our International Programs Office at 202-720- or nass-ipo@nass.usda.gov.

"USDA Office of Communications in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 09,  A new poll shows that parents of school-age children overwhelmingly support national nutrition standards for all foods and beverages sold to students during the school day. For more information, visit: www.pewtrusts.org/SchoolFoodParentPoll. Click to enlarge. Over the past four years, USDA has worked closely with schools, parents, community leaders, and nutrition experts to ensure that when children go off to school, they are greeted by a healthier school environment.  According to the CDC, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years, leading to an increase in obesity-related health outcomes in children, including cardiovascular disease, pre-diabetes, and bone and joint problems.  Improving school nutrition is vital to reducing childhood obesity, because many children consume half of their daily calories during the school day. Making the healthy choice the easy choice sets our nation’s children up for a lifetime of healthy choices, and supports a healthier next generation.  Recently, we’ve seen evidence that student acceptance of healthier meals is increasing across all grade levels.  Today, we are pleased to see the results of the latest poll by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the American Heart Association, showing that most parents support the healthier meal and snack standards implemented through the Healthy, Hunger-free Kids Act of .  Read more about the results of that study in this guest blog, from the American Heart Association. A majority of parents favor strong national nutrition standards for food and drink sold at schools, according to a poll released Monday by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the American Heart Association. In addition, the poll found that parents would also like to see salt limited in school foods and more fruits and vegetables served. The poll, which was conducted in June among 1,112 parents, said that 80 percent of the parents said they were concerned about their children’s health. Seventy-four percent said they were concerned about childhood obesity, a major risk factor for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar and cardiovascular disease later in life. Currently, more than one third of children and adolescents are clinically overweight or obese. Among children ages six to 11, obesity rates rose from 7 percent in to 18 percent in . The rates increased from 5 percent to 21 percent during that same period for youth ages 12 to 19. Childhood obesity has been a major national focus, with federal agencies and advocacy organizations, including the American Heart Association, working on ways to curb the trend. The poll was conducted just weeks before the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued “Smart Snacks” standards on July 1, which mandated that school snacks must be a fruit, a vegetable, protein, dairy, or whole grain; have fewer than 200 calories; and be low in fat, salt, and sugar. The poll revealed that support for stricter school nutrition standards cut across racial and political lines. Sixty-eight percent of whites, 85 percent of Hispanics and 91 percent of African-Americans said they support the standards. Fifty-six percent of Republicans, 71 percent of independents and 84 percent of Democrats favored stronger standards. Only 22 percent of parents expressed that they strongly opposed higher school nutrition standards. Among the poll’s other findings: 72 percent favor national standards for school meals; 72 percent support standards for school snacks; 91 percent support requiring schools to include a serving of fruits or vegetables with every meal; 75 percent think salt should be limited in meals; 23 percent believed food sold a la carte at schools was nutritious, whereas only 8 percent believed the same of food sold in vending machines. Penny Kris Etherton, PhD, a professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pennsylvania, said the findings are encouraging, but parents voicing support is just the beginning. “Schools and parents need to be on the same page about what the kids eat,” she said. “You can’t have one set of standards at school and another set of standards at home. It’s encouraging to see that parents are supportive of higher nutritional standards, but we need to educate across the board so that parents understand what this really means for how their kids should eat.” Reducing sweetened beverages can lower a child’s intake of “empty” calories, Kris-Etherton explained. However, some parents might believe fruit juice is healthy “when it’s really just sugar water. The child would be better off either drinking plain water or eating a piece of fruit to get the fiber and nutrients from the fruit. The challenge will be making healthy eating fun and interesting for kids.” The poll was conducted by Hart Research Associates and Ferguson Research.  Pew, RWJF, and AHA are jointly supporting efforts to ensure all foods and beverages in schools are healthy. The Kids’ Safe and Healthful Foods Project is a collaboration between Pew and RWJF. Voices for Healthy Kids is an initiative of RWJF and AHA, with Pew providing additional expertise.

"USDA Economic : Building Blocks for Policy  About midway through USDA’s 150-year history, federal officials decided that economic research and analysis could be a valuable, objective tool in helping farmers – and policymakers - grapple with farm price and income issues. In , the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE) – predecessor agency of USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) – came into existence. The Bureau began regularly producing agricultural market outlook (still an ERS staple), and - not surprisingly - its early work included analysis of agricultural policy impacts during the Great Depression. Although the BAE’s functions were dispersed throughout the Department in the s, they were assembled again into a single agency, the Economic Research Service, in .  I’ll touch on just a few highlights of ERS activities that illustrate the value of our agency’s work over the past century.  Mary Bohman, Administrator, Economic Research Service  Posted in  USDA Results  Apr 12,   Respond to this story",Here is a concise question related to the content: What role has the USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) played in helping farmers and policymakers navigate agricultural policy issues over the past century?,"The USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) has played a key role in providing objective economic research and analysis to help farmers and policymakers understand farm price and income issues, as well as analyze the impacts of agricultural policies."
"Public Affairs Specialist, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Apr 07,  Clemence, a teacher from Ogondougou School, displays the peanuts grown in the school garden to be used as a condiment in the meal provided by USDA (CRS/Carmen Matty-Cervantes). A group of schoolchildren wait patiently in line to get their lunch. This ritual takes place in schools all over the world. But for the children in Mali, a country ranked 160 out of 169 of the poorest countries in the world, this may be their one nutritious meal for the day. With the number of chronically hungry people surpassing one billion, a sustainable approach is necessary to answer the call of those in need. USDA’s McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program answers that call and works to not only feed the world’s hungry, but also improve the nutrition and education of children around the world. At noon each day, the students line up and eagerly wait for their turn to get their plate full of rice and split peas thanks to USDA (CRS/Carmen Matty-Cervantes). The McGovern-Dole Program supports education, child development and food security in low-income, food-deficit countries that are committed to universal education. It provides for donations of U.S. agricultural products, as well as financial and technical assistance for school feeding and maternal and child nutrition projects. Currently, USDA funds 36 active agreements with 17 cooperating sponsors in 28 countries, assisting more than five million beneficiaries. To date, the Program has provided meals to more than 22 million children. Since , Catholic Relief Services, with the help of the McGovern-Dole program, has played a large role in improving the lives of children and their families in Mali, a country with a population of more than 12.5 million. The United Nations recently reported that 10 percent of the total population was undernourished and that 38 percent of pre-school aged children are physically stunted. In light of Mali’s situation, this McGovern-Dole project has enhanced the welfare of targeted communities through improving access to food and education for children. By the end of the fiscal year, the CRS/Mali program had directly impacted the lives of over 45,000 individuals in Mali. In promoting the health of students, teachers, and school cooks, more than 5 million meals, as well as vitamins and medications, were distributed among 120 schools. Nearly 2,000 members of school management committees supported by the program participated in literacy sessions and radio broadcasts about the importance of education. Through these efforts, overall school enrollment in targeted communities has increased from 26 percent to 32 percent for boys and from 39 percent to 55 percent for girls since the program began in . In May , the Obama administration unveiled the Feed the Future (FTF) Initiative. The Initiative supports the international effort to increase the availability and accessibility of food and to improve nutrition and food safety. It serves as a springboard for broader economic development and food security. It also serves as a foundation for peace and opportunity in developing countries, which ensures our own national security. USDA is working with the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of State, and international organizations to help implement the Initiative. The McGovern-Dole program is one way USDA leverages its resources to support Feed the Future. The Program has played a critical role in enhancing the livelihood of Malians and will remain a bright spot in food assistance and education in communities around the world.

"USDA Pennsylvania Public Information Officer in  Rural  Feb 14,   Snow didn't stop the ideas from flying as members of the Northern Tier Regional Planning and Development Commission (Northern Tier) and their partners from Bradford, Sullivan, Susquehanna, Tioga, and Wyoming Counties met in Pennsylvania last month. Northern Tier is leading the regional group that was awarded the opportunity to participate in the Stronger Economies Together (SET) training and technical assistance program, sponsored by USDA Rural Development in conjunction with the Northeast Regional Rural Development Center and Penn State Extension. The SET program is a nationwide effort focused on working with regional groups to encourage and strengthen regional thinking and developing information and strategies to address issues affecting the region. The training will cover nine course modules on “Strategies for Building New Economic Opportunities” which will be completed by next year. Marcellus Shale was the topic, but the conversation wasn't about the money and jobs the industry has brought to the area. The conversation was about how to measure the economic impact of Marcellus Shale, keep the dollars in the region, and create a sustainable economy. The Northern Tier realizes the way to achieve sustainable results and best utilize area resources is regional collaboration. The foundation created on that snowy morning will be the building blocks of the region's future success. This effort is a great example of how Rural Development has brought leaders and stakeholders in several communities together to collaborate on how to improve the quality of their community.

"AMS Livestock, Poultry, and Seed Program Deputy Administrator in  Conservation  Jan 27,  Livestock correlations, like the one held at Penn State, are one way that USDA Market News ensures the accuracy and consistency in its . The correlation allowed reporters to compare live animal assessments and grades with the post-slaughter assessment and grades of the same animals. During its 100 years of serving the livestock industry, USDA Market News – part of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) – has prided itself in creating transparency and clarity in the marketplace by allowing all industry stakeholders to have the same information about the market at the same time.  The entire agricultural supply chain relies on USDA Market News for timely, unbiased .  Without this free service, information would not be available to everyone equally, making USDA Market News a vital lifeline for America’s agricultural economy. Over the years, countless changes have occurred in the livestock industry – like the way that livestock standards are applied and the way market reporting is conducted.  To keep up with these changes, livestock correlations are held to assure the industry that all USDA market reporters are applying the USDA’s livestock grades and standards consistently and accurately. AMS develops, maintains and interprets USDA’s livestock grades and standards – like the Prime, Choice or Select grades used for beef.  USDA grades and standards ensure uniformity in products and quality, as well as in USDA’s market published across the nation.  Grades and standards provide a common trade language that ranchers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers are familiar with and rely on to buy and sell effectively. Recently, a group of market reporters from the Livestock, Poultry, and Grain Market News division attended a livestock correlation at Penn State University facilitated by its on-campus meats laboratory.  At Penn State, market reporters evaluated a pen of cattle and a pen of lambs and assigned the appropriate livestock quality and yield grade, while veteran market reporters spoke about the animals’ distinguishing qualities.  The Penn State campus offered a unique venue for the correlation, having a full meat processing and cutting facility right on campus. The next day, the market reporters returned to Penn State to correlate their live animal grade designations from the previous day to the same animal’s post-slaughter grade designations, comparing and correlating their findings to check consistency and accuracy in their findings. Livestock correlations are just one way that USDA Market News upholds its commitment to accuracy and consistency in its .  Market reporters understand that in order for their to be as meaningful as possible, a Choice grade steer in Georgia needs to be comparable to a Choice grade steer in Iowa, just as a Prime lamb in Pennsylvania has to be equal to a Prime lamb in Colorado. This uniformity, strengthened by the continuous work of market reporters, makes USDA Market some of the most trusted and respected in the world.

"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way from the Summit: How REE is Using New Strategies to Reach Even Newer Poultry Handlers  During a walk along tree-shading sidewalks in the “burbs”; you’re accustomed to seeing games of hopscotch, bike rides, and maybe even the occasional Golden Retriever. However, one residential backyard, nearly 6 miles from downtown Atlanta, calls into question whether this is suburbia at all. There were swings, a tree house, and even patio furniture. Yet one feature certified this was not your mother’s suburban home: over a dozen chickens living comfortably in a custom made “Coop de Ville.”    The rise of “backyard poultry” is one of many agricultural phenomena tied to a growing food consciousness and increased urbanization. And while USDA’s fundamental job doesn’t change, the Department does because the challenges do.  The recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at increasingly popular backyard chicken coops underscore this. While this concern was not clearly expressed in the Act of Congress that created the Department, the mandate was. USDA still works to “acquire and to diffuse…information” towards facilitating the protected growth of American agriculture. That service is what brought Research, Education, and Economics Undersecretary Dr. Catherine Woteki to this residence in Decatur, GA. Accompanied by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service officials and a man known best as the “Chicken Whisperer,” Dr. Woteki toured the site and helped to shed light on current HPAI research and important biosafety measures.

"Administrator, USDA Rural Housing Service in  Rural  May 12,  New home loan processing is saving customer and staff time, taxpayer money and lots of paper. (Click to enlarge) This has been the year of innovation at USDA Rural Housing Service. We are working smarter, faster, more efficient and environmentally conscious than ever before.  After years of brainstorming, planning, reengineering, testing, and training, RHS has realized its vision: the Section 502 Guaranteed Single Family Home Loan Program now operates paperless, and we’re saving more than we ever imagined possible. USDA’s Rural Development State field offices now transact business with private lenders via Web-based uploads and electronic signatures.  This means RHS and our private partners are no longer printing and sending hundreds of pages of paper back-and-forth every time a loan guarantee is used to help a rural American family buy their home. As a result, loan guarantees are processed faster and families move into homes more quickly. Postage fees will be eliminated and huge print jobs avoided for every one of the 140,000+ home loans USDA guarantees we will make in the coming year. Initial estimates show USDA Rural Housing Service will save 37,500 reams of paper every year now that we do more business in a paperless environment. More than 135,333 staff hours per year nationwide were being spent managing these paper processes. Staff will have more time to assist our customers, connect with potential partners and, of course, help more rural Americans buy their own homes through our 502 homeownership programs. All of the savings in time, paper and postage adds up to some serious savings of American tax dollars. In fact, we estimate RHS will save more than $4.2 million in just one year of using the new process nationwide.  This means we can allocate more time and money into oversight initiatives that will work to ensure lender compliance, and more adequately staff other Single Family Housing Programs to better serve Rural America. The people who work in the Rural Housing Service are proud of this milestone! But, as they like to remind everyone, RHS is just getting started.  Innovation projects of this sort have begun to touch every one of the Agency’s programs. RHS is advocating for the American dream of homeownership by working smarter, faster, more efficiently, and more conscious of the environment than ever before.

"Special Projects Coordinator, Arizona USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Jan 23,   “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.” Those words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. seem particularly prophetic for staff at USDA Rural Development in Arizona. As staff was planning for the federal Martin Luther King Day of Service, we received news that our friend on the USDA Phoenix building cleaning crew, Elia Zepeda, was ill and in the hospital. Within days she slipped into a coma and died. Elia’s cheerful personality greeted many USDA Rural Development employees at the Arizona State Office as they entered or exited the building each day. Although we never saw her in anything but her blue Goodwill uniform, it was clear that, although she loved her job, she was much more than a “cleaning lady.” Co-workers at Goodwill and so many of the workers for the federal agencies at the building where she worked were stunned and saddened by her passing. USDA’s Vanessa Garcia (Right) gets sorting instruction from a Goodwill employee USDA Rural Development Community Facilities Specialist Vanessa Garcia had a great idea that would both serve the community and honor Elia: Donate our MLK Day of Service time to the Goodwill Center where Elia had been trained and employed. Earlier this month, staff donated their hours of service to sort and cart donations at the Goodwill Center in Elia’s name.

"USDA Mississippi Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  Jan 25,   Earlier this month, all Mississippi agencies and staff were invited to participate in USDA’s Martin Luther King Jr. National Day of Service by volunteering two hours of their time to a non-profit organization of their choice. Three USDA Rural Development Mississippi State Office employees, Jennifer Jimerson, Ericka Butler, and Michelle Wilkerson volunteered at Stewpot Community Services in Jackson, serving meals for lunch. The very heart of Stewpot is the noon meal its staff and volunteers serve each day of the year. This meal serves as the center of each day as well as the heart of the Stewpot philosophy. Rich and poor, black and white … all God's children come together over a nourishing meal. More than 120 people a day are physically and spiritually fed in the community kitchen and 50 meals are delivered to shut-ins in the area. Volunteers are always needed to lend a hand in the Stewpot Community Kitchen. USDA Rural Development employees began volunteering at Stewpot Community Services during USDA’s Martin Luther King, Jr. National Day of Service. “After volunteering in , staff has continued to support the organization by volunteering throughout the year. USDA Rural Development works each day to help rural communities, so we want to support organizations that offer assistance in their communities and who strive to help those in need,” said State Director for USDA Rural Development Mississippi, Trina George. Anyone is welcome to eat the Stewpot noon meal. Over 60,000 meals are served each year, and more than 7,000 volunteers serve in the community kitchen each year. Volunteers work as a team to make the plates for the Meals on Wheels program as well as the plates for everyone in the dining room. Volunteers serve the plates and drinks to everyone who has come to Stewpot for the noon meal. Approximately 10 volunteers are needed each day of the week to keep this rewarding ministry going.

"USDA Rural Development Utilities Service Administrator in  Initiatives  Rural  Technology  May 27,  Anita J. (Janie) Dunning, Missouri State Director, and Jonathan Adelstein, RUS Administrator (center), painting the Ralls County PWSD No. 1 water tower A three day visit to Missouri, the “Show Me State” allowed me to join Janie Dunning, Rural Development State Director, to see how rural areas benefiting from infrastructure investments made possible through USDA Rural Development programs and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) financing. My trip started on Wednesday, May 18, , with a visit to Socket Telecom, LLC in Columbia, MO.   We learned of their progress on a $23.7 million Rural Utilities Recovery Act investment for high speed fiber-to-the-home broadband access to 2,700 homes, 36 critical community institutions and 270 businesses in Callaway County.  That afternoon, as a member of President Obama’s White House Business Council on “Winning the Future,” I facilitated a roundtable discussion with 20 community and business leaders of Mexico, MO, hosted by Frank Cordie of Mid America Brick. When you think of “bricks and mortar” for cementing economic development, there is no better place than in America’s heartland at a brick plant.  I gathered feedback on ways we can help businesses expand, create jobs, and improve the economic base in their area.  The roundtable was followed by a very interesting tour of the brick plant to see how the $10 million from the agency’s Business and Industry guaranteed funds was being used to bring this regional business icon back to life. Jonathan Adelstein, RUS Administrator; Barry Hart, CEO of the Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives; Jay Nixon, Governor of Missouri; Dan Strode, President/CEO of Ralls County Electric Cooperative. The next day, I joined Missouri Governor Jay Nixon for a “light up” ceremony at Ralls County Electric Cooperative (RCEC). They were celebrating the construction and hooking up the first customers of $19.1 million project, funded by USDA under the Recovery Act, to serve 4,600 households, 300 business and 58 anchor institutions in northeast Missouri.  I found most interesting is that the RCEC is reinvesting 10 percent of their earnings from the broadband investment for economic development opportunities for individuals and businesses in their service area.  This ceremony was followed by a working lunch to discuss other broadband opportunities with Damon Porter, Governor Nixon’s point-man on broadband. My next stop was to Ralls County Ralls County Public Water Supply District No. 1 to visit the site of water improvements including a new 250,000 gallon water tower.  Janie and I grabbed paint brushes and assisted with painting the water tower support.  Yes, that was a first for me. That evening the Missouri state office staff hosted me in a discussion with Barry Hart, CEO of the Association of Electric Cooperatives and other electric cooperative leaders to talk about partnering strategies to assist rural Missourians. My third day, included a tour of USDA funded Water and Wastewater projects in Howard County.  First stop was to a state of the art, environmentally friendly lagoon at the City of Fayette.  I was very impressed with this new technology and treatment of waste water.  One of the stages in the water treatment includes a process in a lagoon covered with a heavy duty rubberized material. I made a closer inspection of the rubberized material and verified that it was strong enough for opportunity for me to “walk on (waste) water”!  This may be a first for an Administrator. Jonathan Adelstein, USDA Utilities Administrator, walking on (waste) water at the City of Fayette lagoon. The next stop was to see another investment to the City of Fayette for improvements to their water system including the construction of a new water tower.  The last stop was for a celebration of strategies supported by President Obama and Secretary Vilsack for regionalization.  The Howard County Regional Water Commission was established as a regional water waste supply and treatment system to serve three public water systems in the southern part of Howard County including: the City of Fayette, the City of New Franklin and Howard County PWSD No. 1. It was definitely a packed three days but gave me a great appreciation for the hard work that the Missouri Rural Development staff perform in administering programs and “yes” they did “Show Me” some wonderful examples of our programs benefiting rural Missourians!

"AMS Fruit and Vegetable Program Deputy Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Jul 03,  In addition to purchasing blueberries for federal food distribution programs, AMS supports the blueberry industry through grant programs like the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. This program offers funds to states to support research and marketing projects that do things such as increasing crop yields. Photo courtesy of the U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council. Blueberries are often highly sought after because of their long list of health benefits and their sweet taste. Whether purchased fresh, frozen, or pureed, the blueberry has long been a staple in the diets of many people. Every July, the entire nation celebrates Blueberry Month by coming up with creative recipes and other unique ways to get their fill. Here at USDA, every month is Blueberry Month. One of the ways that we show our appreciation for our nation’s blueberry producers and processors is by creating more opportunities for people to enjoy this delicious fruit. Indigenous to North America, the history of blueberries can be traced all the way back to Native Americans, who added them to soups, stews, and even meats. Highbush or cultivated blueberries are grown on large bushes that are planted in rows. These blueberries are often sent to the fresh market. Lowbush or wild blueberries produce smaller sized berries and are pruned every couple of years. The majority of lowbush blueberries are processed into items like jams, jellies and baked goods. My agency, the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), does its part to help more people eat these little blue dynamos.® Through our Commodity Procurement Program, we purchase frozen cultivated and wild blueberries. The purchases send this highly nutritious food to school children, families, and communities through federal food distribution programs like the National School Lunch Program. In , we bought nearly $17.9 million or 11.3 million pounds of frozen wild blueberries. This provided a reliable outlet for producers in places like Maine where 98% of the nation’s wild blueberries are harvested. As a result of this purchase, states like Maine can continue to strengthen their rural economies. Our purchases are also making a big difference in states like New Jersey -- the birthplace of the cultivated blueberry. The state’s blueberry industry produced more than 51 million pounds that  yielded nearly $81 million in revenue in . This was by far the largest revenue generator in the Garden State’s fruit and vegetable sector that year. In , AMS helped continue this trend by buying $18.4 million or 15.4 million pounds of frozen cultivated blueberries from growers across the country. In addition to our purchases, AMS supports the blueberry industry by offering grants to help it remain competitive in the marketplace. Classified as specialty crops, blueberries are eligible for grants through our Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. This program offers funds to states to support research and marketing projects that do things such as increasing crop yields. So, thanks to Specialty Crop Block Grant funds, several state agriculture departments can conduct research to mitigate the damage to its blueberry crops created by the Brown Marmorated Stinkbug and other invasive pests. Whether it’s July or any other part of the year, AMS is committed to supporting our nation’s blueberry producers and processors. We recommend that you add some color to your plate with some blueberries. The U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council’s website has some great recipes to get you started.

"Recreation, Heritage and Volunteer Services, U.S. Forest Service in  Conservation  Forestry  Mar 18,  An owl seems to plead for help after getting stuck in a vault toilet. A movement to save birds from serious injury and death garnered a Wings Across the Americas Award for the Teton Raptor Center of Jackson Hole, Wyo., and employees from several national forests. (Photo courtesy Teton Raptor Center) Small owls, such as western screech and northern saw whet owls, weigh between 3 and 7 ounces, or about the same weight as a small cell phone or a deck of cards. They prefer dark, narrow spaces for nesting and roosting, which is why they are called cavity birds. Their habitat preferences make them prone to using man-made features, such as open pipes, that mimic their natural nesting and roosting cavities. But on some public lands, that natural act of finding habitat in ventilation pipes has led to their death. The resolution that could save thousands of birds resulted in an award from Wings Across the Americas, a program of the U.S. Forest Service and its partners to conserve birds, bats, butterflies and dragonflies across all landscapes and boundaries. The project received the Habitat Management and Partnership Award, shared with Forest Service employees and the Teton Raptor Center in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Many public agencies use vault toilets to manage sanitary waste on their lands, and the ventilation pipes seem to attract the birds. The small owls enter the hole at the top of the vent, fall down the vertical pipe and land in the waste holding reservoir. The small size and weight of the birds make it impossible for them to gain any lift to escape. In , the Teton Raptor Center heard about the problem and decided to do something. Roger Smith, founder of Teton Raptor Center, said a photo of an owl peering up from the reservoir made him realize the need for “…a real, tangible conservation project that people could understand and commit to – preventing bird mortality from a man-made problem by covering the hole with a screen.” As a non-profit organization with a mission focused on conservation, education and rehabilitation, the Teton Raptor Center resolved to launch a public awareness campaign:  the Port-O-Potty Owl Project. Of course, it quickly gained the nickname “Poo-Poo Project.” Unbeknownst to Smith was the collaboration between Gerardo Chavarria, a Forest Service regional engineer based in Denver, and Greg Hayward, an agency wildlife ecologist working in Alaska. Hayward sought out Chavarria because he wanted an engineering fix to prevent the bird deaths. “His concern was contagious and provided a challenge for me to investigate if there was a cost effective way to screen the toilet vent stacks without too much negative effect on air flow out of the stacks.” he said. Chavarria used his engineering skills to design a screen that would not adversely affect the functional design of a vault toilet. In fact, his work helped to advance the quick fixes the raptor center sought on vault toilets on three national forests in Wyoming. Chavarria’s advance research determined the types of screen that would work, which allowed the raptor center and the Forest Service to immediately cap the toilet vents. Because the need and resolution were already pre-determined, Forest Service employees Joe Harper of the Shoshone National Forest, Tammy Fletcher of the Caribou-Targhee National Forest and Bernadette Barthelenghi of the Bridger-Teton National Forest could more quickly answer the raptor center’s call. Harper brought the awareness of what happened to the birds to the forest, and all vault toilets are now screened and any new toilets and pipes also will be screened. Fletcher helped to secure grant funding to purchase screens for the Caribou-Targhee and all participating land agencies within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. And Barthelenghi made the work possible on her forest and worked to ensure the project and solution were shared with all agency offices. Joe Alexander, forest supervisor on the Shoshone, said they partnered with community organizations to help install the necessary screens.  Local chapters of the Audubon Society and Boy Scouts engaged on this real world problem and helped to make a difference. “The Shoshone National Forest prides itself on being the leader in conservation,” Alexander said. “After implementation of these new toilets it became apparent that some small efforts could go a long ways in protecting our avian resources.

The Monitoring and Conservation of Black-Backed Woodpecker in Burned Forests project received the Research Management & Partnership award. Since , several organizations, including the Pacific Southwest Regional Office of the U.S. Forest Service and the Institute for Bird Populations, worked to better integrate the habitat needs of the bird into forest management plans. The Bat Cave Gating Project on the Mark Twain National Forest also received the Bat Conservation Award. The forest is home to a large gray bat maternity colony, and the project’s goal is to protect the bats by closing nearby trails and installing chute gauges and flyover gates at entrances of bat maternity caves. The Migratory Shorebird Project: Connecting Communities of the Americas through Research for Conservation received the International Cooperation Award. The project looks at two species, the Western Sandpiper and the Pacific population of the Dunlin, measures their response to management actions, studies what influence population changes and educates people on the importance of wetland resources all along the Pacific Coast of the Americas. The University of Minnesota Monarch Lab received the Communities in Conservation award.  For more than 20 years, the lab has linked academic research with community outreach programs associated with monarch conservation.

"Forest Health Protection, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 05,  Removing mud and seeds from your shoes can help prevent the spread of invasive plants and animals. (Photo by Kim Lanahan-Lahti, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Division of Forestry) For years now, the U.S. Forest Service has been encouraging visitors to our nation’s forests and grasslands, to not only enjoy all there is out there, but to play safe and play clean. One example of this outreach effort is the PlayCleanGo: Stop Invasive Species In Your Tracks campaign. PlayCleanGo has 130 partners, all fostering active participation in actions designed to interrupt recreational pathways of spread for invasive species. By becoming a partner, you can spread the message to stop invasive species in your tracks. “PlayCleanGo is designed to give outdoor recreationists a clear call to action to be informed and attentive in helping stop the spread of invasive plants and insects and improving overall forest health,” said Monica Lear, U.S. Forest Service Forest Health Protection Director. “These pests can expand like a different kind of wildfire, from forest to forest by unsuspecting visitors just looking for some fun and adventure.” From camping to fishing to hiking, getting outside and into nature is one of the many activities that our forests support. Outdoor recreation provides physical challenges, contributes greatly to the physical and mental health of individuals, provides economic benefits to communities, and has become an essential part of American culture. PlayCleanGo is helping these recreationists preserve the land they already love and enjoy. Through positive messaging, the program provides simple steps people can take to avoid accidently spreading invasive species.  This advice includes letting visitors know to stay on designated trails, remove mud and seeds from shoes and gear, and burn only local or certified firewood. For example, garlic mustard, an aggressive plant invader of wooded areas throughout the Northeastern and Midwestern US, can form dense stands and displace native species by competing for available light, nutrients and water resources. Garlic mustard seeds stick together when damp and adhere readily to small soil clusters, making it easy for them to stick to muddy boots, pant cuffs, and animal fur. Through easy actions like inspecting hiking equipment, clothing, and pets before going out on a hiking trail and conducting the same inspection upon leaving the trail, the PlayCleanGo campaign is helping slow the spread of invasive species. PlayCleanGo was launched by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, in partnership with the University of Minnesota Extension, Minnesota departments of Agriculture and Transportation, and Explore Minnesota. Creating a new and successful awareness campaign, like Smokey Bear and his fire prevention message, depends on broad, frequent exposure to the public. For this reason, PlayCleanGo invites public and private organizations to join the effort by becoming a partner.

"The Buried Forest of Alaska's Kruzof Island: a Window into the Past  Seldom does one find a way to directly date a prehistoric volcanic eruption, but 11-year-old Blake LaPerriere opened such a door for excited scientists in Southeast Alaska. Last September, Blake, his parents, and his younger brothers were exploring a beach on southwestern Kruzof Island, part of the Tongass National Forest landscape and just west of Sitka, Alaska, where they live. Blake investigated a deeply incised creek behind a pile of beach drift where he found a standing burnt tree embedded in a tall bank of pumice.

"AMS Deputy Administrator, Livestock and Seed Program in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 28,  USDA is as American as baseball and apple pie. Almost anything and everything about U.S. food – and in some respects, baseball – is somehow connected to USDA. Curious? Read on to see how USDA ties in to the World Series. “The Ryan Express” Delivers the Goods Major League Baseball Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan pitched 27 years in the big leagues, tossing a league record seven no-hitters. In that span Ryan was comfortably pumping 100 mile-per-hour fastballs past hitters until he was 40 years old, registering 95 mph on the radar gun until retirement. Nicknamed “The Ryan Express” for his baseball exploits, he went on to become a successful business owner. Ryan knows a good deal when he sees one. In he became a principal owner, president and CEO of the Texas Rangers baseball club. The team has made it to the World Series the last two seasons: losing to the San Francisco Giants in and participating in the thrilling, nail-biting autumn classic of against the St. Louis Cardinals. Ryan also knows the value of the USDA shield. He’s the head of the Nolan Ryan Guaranteed Tender Beef Program, a marketing program verified by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). AMS relies on university-researched and industry-recognized standards to determine which marketing claims it chooses to verify. Companies like Ryan’s can approach AMS and request the agency verify marketing claims such as “guaranteed tender” to assure customers that the products listed on packaging are exactly what they claim.  This is an important service to consumers who desire a certain quality of beef and want third-party assurance that their beef purchases meet exacting requirements. _________________________________________________________________________________________ USDA Certified – St. Louis (Cardinals) Style If you bellied-up at a local sports bar and ordered a plate of St. Louis Style ribs while watching the World Series, thank a former USDA employee for naming the cut of pork. In the late s Steve Olson, an agricultural marketing specialist in the USDA Livestock and Seed Program’s Standardization Division, wrote meat standards for the Agricultural Marketing Service’s Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications (IMPS). Last June Olson shared his story about naming the cut of meat with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He explained how some butchers fancied carving off the breast bone and brisket bones from pork spareribs. “We did a survey to find out if there was a consensus for what this was called,” Olson told the Post-Dispatch. A majority of the respondents called it a St. Louis cut. “The only reason I went ahead and put the term into the IMPS is because I happen to be an avid St. Louis Cardinals baseball team fan, and they had just defeated the San Francisco Giants in a playoff,” Olson said. For more specifications, you can view the latest IMPS report. On pages 11 and 32, Item No. 416A is listed as “Pork Spareribs, St. Louis Style.” St. Louis ribs, ready to eat.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Oct 24,  Bat Week graphic. By the time October comes around, store shelves are stocked with Halloween candy, costumes, and decorations. Bats are often situated among this imagery, whether as silhouettes in the background or as blood-sucking monsters. But bats are none of these things. They are primarily nocturnal, they make their homes in dark places, but there’s nothing scary about them. That is why Bat Week, October 24-31, is a time to celebrate bats, what they contribute to our society, and to dispel the myths that cause so much misunderstanding of these gentle, intelligent creatures. There are more than 1,300 species of bats worldwide, and they are diverse. Some, like Kitti’s hog-nosed bat, also known as the bumble bee bat, can be as small as your thumbnail and survives on insects. Others like the flying fox eat fruit and have earned their name due to their impressive size. Bats like this Mexican free-tailed bat feed on insects and play an important role in pest control on agricultural crops. Photo by MerlinTuttle.org. There are three species of vampire bat among those 1,300. However, they live in Mexico, Central and South America; feed primarily on large livestock; and take about an ounce of blood in a feeding. Forty-seven species of bat call the United States home. Bats provide valuable services to us. Most feed on insects and play an important role in pest control on agricultural crops. The various species of beetles, moths, and other insects that often plague crops represent a tasty meal to a hungry bat. In fact, it is estimated that if bats were lost in North America, savings of up to $3.7 billion dollars annually would be lost due to increased pesticide requirements in agriculture. In one case, a Georgia pecan farmer was able to abandon pesticide use altogether after he built bat houses housing several thousand Mexican free-tailed bats. The Forest Service is looking into the role that bats play in pest insect control on the forest as well. Many insects, like bark beetles and gypsy moths, can be devastating to forests, and as voracious insect eaters, bats have the potential to help cull their numbers. Recognizing the role they play, the Forest Service has long been a champion of bat conservation. Over the last decade, the fungal disease white-nose syndrome has killed more than six million bats. While Forest Service researchers seek a solution to white-nose syndrome, the agency’s land managers explore improved ways to manage bat habitat. Within the 193 million acres of forests and grasslands that the agency manages, there are more than 25,000 abandoned mines that present both opportunity and hazard. Recognizing the potential of abandoned mines as ideal roosting, hibernation, or maternity sites, the Forest Service has constructed “bat gates” that provide a grating to keep visitors from stumbling into a potential hazard while allowing bats to fly freely. You too can make a big difference by planting bat-friendly gardens, building bat houses, and helping dispel myths about bats. Little Brown bats found in Maine with white-nose syndrome.

"Rural  Jul 19,   Story and Photos by Phil Eggman, USDA Rural Development, Washington State Office Donating a little bit of time can go a long way to making a big difference for people. Just ask the employees of USDA Rural Development in Washington State who, on July 13, donated two hours of their time at the end of a hectic day to make food packages for the elderly, young mothers, infants and children at the Thurston County Food Bank located in downtown Olympia. According to Thurston County Food Bank Executive Director Robert Coit, it was opportune that the Rural Development team were packaging food for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), which is a USDA program that provides nutritious food ""packages"" designed specifically for the nutritional  needs of low-income pregnant and breastfeeding women, infants, children up to age six and elderly people 60 and older. ""It's a great program and helps us with our mission to eliminate hunger in Thurston County,"" Coit said, adding that the food bank serves 10,000 families annually, including 37,000 individuals, half of which are children, around the communities of Lacy, Olympia  and Tumwater. ""This was a great opportunity for us to help out in our local community,"" said Mario Villanueva, Washington State Director, USDA Rural Development. ""Too many Americans live in food deserts and lack access to healthy food.  USDA is a key partner in providing access to healthy food by administering the nation's nutrition programs, funding projects that provide underserved areas with greater access to fresh produce"" ""It was great!,"" said Becki Southworth, Multi-Family Housing Loan Specialist. ""I really feel like we were able to help our local community by not only what we do every day through housing, business and community programs, but by taking it up a level and getting out in the community, we were able to help meet another need, provide food to those that need it most.  I am so glad I was able to go and I would love to do it again."" ""I had fun and it felt great to know that we helped 210 families in just an hour and a half of work of great teamwork,"" said Housing Specialist Leslie Schmidt. ""It just shows how much you can help the community with just a little bit of our time."" In addition to helping out at the local food bank (an exercise the agency plans to repeat on a regular basis), Rural Development is participating in a summer food drive as part of the 2nd Annual ""Feds, Farmers, and Friends Feed Families"" (F5) initiative.  The Washington State food drive kicked off July 6 in Olympia and other area offices and will run through July 31. The food drive makes a big difference. Last summer, federal employees around the country donated more than 1 million pounds of nonperishable goods and daily essentials for those in need. The new goal for across the Federal government is 1.2 million pounds of non-perishable items. ""We know the need is great in our area and this was a chance for our agency and federal partners to contribute to a worthwhile cause,"" said Gayle Hoskison, Olympia Area Director.

"Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Oct 31,  A wasp works its way out of an aphid mummy after developing inside as larvae. (Photo courtesy of the ARS Electron and Confocal Microscopy Unit) At Halloween, people revel in ghosts, goblins, and things that go bump in the night. Not all are in books or movies, though. There are plenty of creepy critters doing downright scary things every day in your own backyard. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, since many of these “monsters” are actually good guys getting the bad guys out of town; it’s just not always pleasant to watch. Fire ants are common in subtropical Southeastern states and have shown up as far west as California. These stinging ants are not just painful pests; they’re also a bane to agriculture, feeding on young plants and seeds, causing an estimated crop loss of $750 million per year. There are many ways to control or eliminate fire ants, but nature provides one that is tailor made for the silver screen! Enter the phorid fly, a natural predator of the fire ant. The fly swoops in on its target and deposits an egg into the ant. After hatching inside the ant, the maggot works its way into the ant’s head, where it lives for a couple of weeks, feeding on bodily fluids. The maggot then releases chemicals that eat away at the ant’s body until its head falls off. The maggot then stays in the severed head and feeds on brains until it reaches maturity and breaks out through the ant’s mouth. Like zombies? You will, if you don’t like cockroaches. The jewel wasp injects a serum into its victim, which “zombifies” the roach into submitting to its will. The passive zombie roach allows the wasp to lead it by an antenna into a nest, which quickly becomes a nursery after the wasp lays its egg. As with the phorid fly larvae, it feeds off its host until it reaches maturity. Mummies also abound in gardens and fields, courtesy of a pair of wasps. These wasps (Aphidiinae braconid wasps – pictured – and Pteromalid chaclid wasps) also deposit an egg inside the body of their prey, this time an aphid. The wasp larvae grow inside the aphid, which soon becomes mummified in that it turns inflated, rigid, and off-color. After the larva becomes an adult wasp, it chews its way out, leaving the mummy husk behind. “Husks are fun to collect and are routinely encountered in gardens,” said Matt Buffington, a research scientist with the Agricultural Research Service’s Systematic Entomology Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. “In fact, if you have them, it’s a good sign your aphid problems are being somewhat controlled.” Aphids are a scourge to crops and horticulture, where they suck on sap, which causes yellowing, stunting, distortion of plant parts, leaf mold, and, in cotton, poor fiber quality. Aphids can also transmit plant viruses. Not to be outdone, some bees (Trigona hypogea) make an appearance as scavenger vampires. “Instead of providing their young with protein from pollen, vampire bees gather protein from carcasses on the forest floor,” Buffington said. “Further, they have unique jaws for tearing into dead animal flesh and cutting it into pieces for transport and digestion.” There are plenty of other examples of insects that exemplify Halloween, but one of the spookiest is actually a mammal – the humble bat. If you can get past the vampire nature of some bats, you’ll find that many species of bats are great friends of plants; they pollinate, spread seeds, and feed on pesky bugs. So, on All Hallows’ Eve, as you’re greeting young ghosts and goblins doing their rounds of trick-or-treating, don’t forget about those beneficial creepy critters in your own backyard.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. When people think about keeping our homeland safe, they don’t usually think about animal diseases that threaten our nation’s economy and food supply, but USDA scientists do. Years of dedicated research on foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is paying off. A team of USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists and their U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) collaborators received the DHS Secretary's Exceptional Service Gold Medal Award at a recent ceremony in Washington, D.C. The award recognizes outstanding leadership or service distinguished by achievements of national or international significance that improves our homeland security. The team successfully developed and licensed the world’s first molecular FMD vaccine for cattle—the most significant scientific accomplishment in FMD vaccine development in the past ates. Research leading to this award was initiated by retired scientist Marvin Grubman while working at ARS’ Foreign Animal Disease Research Unit (FADRU) at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in Orient Point, New York. Grubman created a novel FMD vaccine, which was used as the foundation for this work. ARS scientists receiving the award were Luis Rodriguez and Teresa de los Santos at FADRU, and Laszlo Zsak at ARS’ Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory in Athens, Georgia. Other FMD team recipients were Lawrence Barrett, Jeffrey Babcock, Michelle Colby, John Neilan, Michael Santillo and Christopher Schutta, with DHS’ Science and Technology Directorate at Plum Island; and Lavanya Ratnam and Robert Webb, with the Office of General Counsel in Washington, D.C. FMD is a highly contagious disease that affects cattle, swine and other cloven-hoofed animals.

"DVM, Ph.D., USDA/APHIS Deputy Administrator, Veterinary Services, U.S. Chief Veterinary Officer in  Animals  Oct 16,  Waterfowl fly at 40 to 60 miles per hour. Migrating mallards can cover 800 miles in 8 hours if helped by 50 mile per hour tail winds. We know you’ve heard it before: seasonal migratory patterns bring an increased risk of disease-carrying birds interacting with commercial or backyard poultry. But the health and safety of our U.S. poultry flock is important enough to make it worth repeating. Birds, particularly waterfowl like ducks and geese, can carry avian influenza without showing any symptoms or signs of disease. Because the risk of introduction never goes away, having strong biosecurity practices on poultry operations can help prevent the spread of infectious disease before it starts. The - U.S. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreak is never far from my mind. It forced us to reevaluate our preparedness and response capabilities, from a federal, state, and industry standpoint. Today, we are all better prepared to handle and quickly respond to avian influenza detections. Our Wild Bird Surveillance Program, which has been in place for more than a decade, is on-going. Since July , USDA and our partners have collected more than 90,ates. This improves our ability to detect these viruses and helps poultry producers and others make informed management decisions. The program also gives us a chance to learn more about the virus, including the make-up and transmission of various virus strains. We’ve taken these experiences and lessons learned from the -15 outbreak and developed Defend the Flock, an outreach program that offers commercial poultry growers important information to help put the best biosecurity practices into place. Defend the Flock provides multiple resources for poultry growers, including guidance on biosecurity basics, an assessment tool to help strengthen their biosecurity programs, and sharable materials to help everyone at their operations better understand biosecurity’s importance. Stay up-to-date on the latest biosecurity information by following on Twitter. Everyone who has poultry in their care can help defend the U.S. poultry industry by reviewing the following biosecurity basics. Together, we have made great strides in our preparedness and response capabilities. Protecting American poultry remains a top USDA priority. Biosecurity can stop the disease before it stops.

"Public Information Coordinator, Mississippi Rural Development in  Rural  May 03,   U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack joined Obama Administration Cabinet members Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan, as well as Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate, Small Business Administration Administrator Karen Mills, and other state and local officials to tour areas in Alabama and Mississippi affected by last week’s tornadoes. After visiting devastated sites in Birmingham and nearby areas, the group crossed over to Mississippi, where they surveyed the damage done to Smithville, a town of approximately that was almost literally wiped off the map. In Smithville, Miss. the senior administration officials were joined by Mississippi’s USDA Rural Development State Director Trina George, who had made the trek from her home in central Mississippi in the pre-dawn hours on Thursday, the day after the tornado hit. State Director George viewed damaged areas in Maben, Amory, and parts of Chickasaw County on Thursday. She had monitored the tornado, keeping in contact with local officials as the tornado went through Mississippi on Wednesday. She linked up on Thursday morning with local USDA personnel in Oktibbeha County, arriving only hours after the tornado had passed through. She also toured damaged areas in Neshoba and Kemper Counties that afternoon. Secretary Tom Vilsack toured the area of Smithville, Mississippi and saw firsthand the heavy damage caused by the tornado. He is seen in this photo talking to one of the victims of the disastrous weather. Behind him is USDA Rural Development State Director Trina George of Mississippi. Secretary Vilsack and State Director George were two of a number of Obama Administration Cabinet officials, federal administrators, and local leaders to see the damage caused by tornadoes in Mississippi and Alabama. “It is heartbreaking to see this damage and to talk to the people who are victims of the tornado,” said George. “I was able to not only see the physical damages, but I was able to listen to some of the actual victims, many of whom had lost everything. However, I can report that USDA Rural Development has programs that can offer some relief to these unfortunate victims.” George cited USDA Rural Development programs such as funding to replace and repair single-family homes, shared community facilities and the water and wastewater systems in the damaged areas. “I want to make sure that people know about the availability of our programs, especially our single-family home loan and home repair loan programs, so that they can rebuild their homes and businesses and continue to have clean water.” George has a history of fast action on disaster relief. Most recently, she was on the scene the day after tornadoes ran thru Holmes and Yazoo Counties in and made sure that USDA Rural Development programs were a part of both the immediate and long-term relief efforts in those counties. Local officials in both counties credited George and USDA Rural Development for their fast work in making resources available, especially to the homeowners who lost their homes in that disaster. “These people have lost everything but their spirit. For them to see the highest officials in our nation’s government, including Cabinet secretaries and head of relief agencies coming to what is left of their town to see the damage personally,” Said George, “I can’t convey to ya’ll how uplifting that is to those people.

"Posted by Almanza, Administrator of the Food Safety Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Oct 22,  USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service Administrator Al Almanza (fourth from left) was among the senior executives from 10 federal agencies who took part in the Interagency Import Safety Conference at Dulles, Va., on October 21, .  Yesterday I visited with FSIS personnel and 9 other federal agencies in Dulles, Virginia to focus on a critical element of food safety: protecting the public from unsafe imports. The Interagency Import Safety Conference was organized by the Department of Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to bring agencies together, improve cooperation, and build collaboration.  Our mutual goal with these efforts is ensuring the continued health and safety of the American consumer. I want to express a thanks and gratitude to those working to reach this goal to prevent foodborne contamination and protect consumers. Today marks us as one step closer to achieving our goal by focusing on food import safety cooperation. I would also like to thank our import inspection personnel who are working hard every day on the frontlines at keeping harmful imports from reaching the American public. In December of last year, the Commercial Targeting and Analysis Center opened here in Washington, D.C. to provide agencies with shared resources, analysis and expertise necessary to improving the safety of imports. This, among other initiatives proposed by the Food Safety Working Group, will provide an appropriate forum to address the concerns expressed by consumers about the safety of the food they’re serving their families. I was able to see today the commitment of our public health officials and import inspectors through innovative ideas and combined resources. I look forward to continue working across agency borders to fulfill our commitment to protecting public health.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  May 25,  Map of the dollar value of USDA Foods purchased in ; represent the states that are the largest sources of a particular type of USDA Foods. (Click to view a larger version) Do you know where your food comes from?  If you can pinpoint where your food was grown and produced, you can make more informed decisions to maximize quality, freshness, and nutritional value.  You can also help support local economies through your purchases.  The USDA Foods program takes this mantra to heart and publishes state of origin with procurement information on all USDA Foods every year.  As we like to say at FNS, “All USDA Foods are local to someone.” USDA Foods are 100 percent American grown and produced.  Each year, USDA procures more than 200 types of food, including meat, poultry, fish, fruits, vegetables, flour, cereals, and dairy products, totaling approximately $2 billion.  Organizations such as food banks, disaster and emergency feeding organizations, Indian Tribal Organizations, schools, and other feeding groups receive these USDA Foods for use in meal service or distribution to households through programs like the National School Lunch Program, The Emergency Food Assistance Program, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations. A recent report on the state of origin of USDA Foods found that USDA Foods procures food from more than three-quarters of all states.  California, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Illinois are the five states with the highest dollar amounts of USDA Foods purchases.  A number of items available through USDA Foods are sourced solely from one state.  For example, 100 percent of the strawberries purchased by USDA Foods in FY came from the state of California.  During this time, California schools received approximately 3.3 million pounds of this locally produced product through the USDA Foods program.  All of the wild blueberries came from Maine and all the catfish were purchased from Mississippi. States and schools can use this sourcing information and other purchasing trends available on our website to tailor their USDA Foods purchases accordingly, or they can simply purchase with confidence, knowing that all USDA Foods purchases help strengthen the American economy by supporting a local community somewhere across the country.

"National Forests of Florida, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 08,   Well into the wee hours of night, for five successive evenings, teams of scientists from across the southeastern United States waited and watched as bats in the Apalachicola National Forest swooped down to feed on their insect prey only to be captured in sheer mist nets. The scientific teams and U.S. Forest Service wildlife biologists were conducting bat surveys to test for white-nose syndrome and general bat healthiness throughout the region. This Seminole Bat is a medium-sized bat caught by Gary Libby, an ecologist on the Bat Blitz Team that examined bats to determine levels of health and/or disease conditions, May 22, . The Seminole Bat grows up to four and one-half inches long with a wingspan of up to 12 inches and can weigh up to one-half ounce. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service photo by Porter Libby. Dubbed “Bat Blitz,” the 5-day event was hosted by the Florida Bat Working Group, which partnered with the U.S. Forest Service, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the University of Florida “We’re mapping locations where each species was captured to learn more about the types of forest and water bodies that each species is associated with here in the Panhandle,” said Assistant Professor Holly Ober of the University of Florida Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation. “We'll also study the bat guano to determine which insects each bat species is feeding on.” Bat testing to date has confirmed a very low probability of local bats being affected by white-nose syndrome, a condition linked to the deaths of more than a million hibernating bats from New Hampshire to Tennessee. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the cause of the bat deaths remains unknown despite the continuing search to find the source of this condition by numerous laboratories and state and federal biologists. Each night, 12 teams of five biologists spread out across the forest and surveyed bats in places where they were expected to be feeding. “Because bats are active at night, few people see them, and even fewer understand or appreciate their importance in our daily lives,” said Micah Thorning, wildlife biologist for the U.S. Forest Service. “For example, as the primary consumers of flying insects, bats play a crucial role in insect control.” The survey netted 246 bats of eight different species with the number of bats caught at one site totaling 57. The most widespread species caught were the Seminole Bat, Evening Bat, Red Bat and Southeastern Bat, but rarer species such as the Tricolored Bat, Big Brown Bat, Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat, and Brazilian Free-tailed Bat were also captured and tested. The event started in with the Southeastern Bat Diversity Network (SBDN) selecting Tennessee to host the first Bat Blitz. SBDN promotes, facilitates and organizes the event every year. The Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat is one of two of its kind caught on found on the Apalachicola National Forest during Bat Blitz, May 22, . The Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat is listed as a sensitive species and is a rare find on the National Forests of Florida. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service photo by Porter Libby. “Planning a Bat Blitz takes a lot of time and effort -- most states begin planning one and a half to two years in advance,” said Ober. “We began a bit late, so we have been working feverishly for the past eight months.” Ober credited their success to the dedication of a core group of individuals from the Florida Bat Working Group, an organization of local, state and federal agencies and private partners.

"Director, SNAP Benefit Redemption Division in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Mar 29,   Last summer, the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), in collaboration with the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), released  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at Farmers Markets: A How-To-Handbook.  The handbook assists farmers’ market operators and direct marketing farmers in determining the steps necessary to become authorized to participate in SNAP and, subsequently, the steps related to managing participation. It includes tips and on how to make the program work successfully for vendors and customers.  The handbook also features a list of resources, a glossary of important terms, and several case studies from farmers markets that have successfully implemented EBT technology.  AMS’s USDA Farmers’ Market Directory is available online to locate farmers’ markets that accept nutrition assistance program benefits. Collaboration through the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative led the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS),to co-release, with the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), ""Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at Farmers Markets: A How-To-Handbook."" There are many benefits to making farmers’ markets more accessible to all communities, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet in these hard times.  The concentration of fresh and nutritious foods found at farmers’ markets and sold by direct marketing farmers helps introduce low-income households to a variety of healthy options.  As SNAP clients increase their demand for local produce, small farmers have potential to increase in their customer base.  Our goal here at FNS is to authorize an additional 200 direct marketing farmers and/or farmers’ markets to accept SNAP benefits and increase redemptions nationally by at least $750,000 each year.  We are on our way to reaching these goals.  At the end of Federal Fiscal Year () , according to AMS, a total of 6,132 farmers’ markets were operating around the United States.  This represents a 16 percent rise from .  Of this total, 1,611 farmers’ markets and direct marketing farmers were authorized by FNS and redeemed $7,547,028 in SNAP benefits.  This is a 263 percent increase in the number of authorized farmers and farmers’ markets and a 49 percent increase in SNAP redemptions over the previous five fiscal years. Under regular SNAP rules, EBT equipment is provided free of charge and the expense is shared by the SNAP state agency and FNS.  For farmers’ markets and direct marketing farmers that do not have access to a land line and electricity necessary for the standard equipment to work,  the markets may elect to use manual paper vouchers or purchase wireless equipment through a third party processor.  FNS reimburses states that wish to provide wireless equipment to farmers and markets at the rate of 50 percent of the cost of equipment as part of the administrative cost associated with benefit issuance.  Under a demonstration waiver, FNS allows markets to implement scrip projects that allow a farmers’ market to obtain one FNS authorization to accept SNAP benefits for all eligible vendors at the market by using a single point-of-sale (POS) terminal.  The scrip (paper, tokens or receipts) is purchased at a centrally-located POS terminal that accepts SNAP benefits and is exchanged for eligible food products by participating vendors.  Many markets also use this process for accepting credit and debit cards. FNS has conducted a congressionally-mandated cost benefit analysis to assess the feasibility of equipping all farmers’ markets nationwide with wireless EBT point-of-sale (POS) equipment.  This analysis focuses on requiring centralized operation of a single EBT terminal to issue scrip, as it is the most cost effective way to equip farmers markets and often the most practical way for markets to manage participation.  It is likely that most farmers’ markets will implement SNAP if funding is made available.   President Obama has included a request for $4 million in the budget to support this effort.

"Posted by Written by Katie Yocum, USDA Rural Development in  Initiatives  USDA Results  Technology  Jun 11,  While the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma is rich in cultural pride, identity and history, its remote location in the rugged terrain of Southeast Oklahoma has severely limited the tribe’s economic development efforts.  But a Broadband Initiative Program grant, made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, will enable Pine Telephone Company (PTC) to use innovative wireless technology to deliver affordable broadband service to portions of this rural, remote and economically disadvantaged region in Southeast Oklahoma. During World War II, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma provided an invaluable service to the United States by pioneering the use of Code Talking, using the native Choctaw language, to prevent enemy forces from intercepting the transmission of army secrets. And in , the Choctaw Nation was awarded the Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award, the highest recognition of support of employees who serve in the National Guard and Reserve.  So while the Choctaw Nation has shown outstanding compassion for the nation and its tribal members, the local economies of Choctaw communities have suffered tremendously.  Of the five counties on tribal lands that will be served by PTC, all of them are plagued with unemployment rates that soar above the state average and a substantial proportion of residents living below the poverty line. PTC spent years testing broadband technologies that would offer reliable internet service to residents of this remote region, and they determined that advanced 3G technology presents the most viable solution. The system is designed to be scalable and to cost-effectively accommodate technology upgrades, so that it will remain viable for years to come. PTC’s system will offer service to nearly 5,000 households, 10 school districts, and 12 volunteer fire departments and ambulance services. With reliable, high speed wireless access, the region will be able to overcome their geographic isolation to stimulate the sustainable economic growth that it needs.  And offering quality internet access to key community institutions, like schools and public safety bodies, will mean better educational opportunities and enhanced health care and public safety for residents of this region. And in addition to the many benefits to be reaped by members of the Choctaw Nation, this Recovery Act project will also create more than 150 jobs over the multi-year construction period.

On Tuesday we tried to make your trip to the grocery store a little easier, by explaining the labels you’ll find on turkeys for sale. Now that you have your bird, you’re probably thinking about putting your game face on and getting that meal ready. In between trying to convince your 21-year-old nephew to sit at the kid’s table (because there’s no room at the adult table) and figuring out how you’ll answer your relatives’ questions about where your current relationship is going, we want to help you prepare your meal. With such thoughts possibly running through your head, proper food safety practices are sometimes treated like pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving: always but too often ignored and overshadowed.  Chris Bernstein, Food Safety Education Staff, Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA  Posted in  Health and Safety  Nov 20,   2 Responses",What are some proper food safety practices that should be considered when preparing a Thanksgiving meal?,Proper food safety practices to consider when preparing a Thanksgiving meal include adhering to safe handling and cooking procedures to prevent contamination and ensure the turkey is cooked thoroughly.

"APHIS Pleased With Animal Evacuations At Two Flood-Ravaged North Dakota Zoos  In late May, two zoos in central North Dakota were hit hard by flooding.  The disaster prompted the need for a swift evacuation of the animals.  In Bismarck, the Missouri River threatened to submerge the Dakota Zoo and its 500+ animals under as much as seven feet of water, and in Minot the Roosevelt Park Zoo was a potential target of the rising Souris River, which runs directly through the city. During the height of the flooding, APHIS’ Animal Care Program monitored coming from the zoos and kept abreast of river levels.  Inspector Amy Jirsa-Smith contacted zoo officials regularly. She was on-site at both facilities, and helped corral some animals at the Dakota Zoo so they could be transported to other facilities.  However, she is quick to point out that the zoo staff at both facilities, with the assistance of several cooperating state and local agencies, state veterinarians, four neighboring zoos and the National Guard, had everything under control.

Photo courtesy Ron Ploof Sometimes it can take a while to turn a good idea into a successful venture.  At USDA, we understand the value of research, and by providing resources to get things started at the local level, we often see amazing results that have positive impact for farmers, agribusinesses and consumers across the country. The Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program (FSMIP), administered by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service, is one of the many ways that USDA makes an investment in the future of agriculture.  Funding practical research projects that focus on innovation and collaboration, FSMIP’s diverse projects reflect the unique marketing challenges and opportunities faced by different agribusiness sectors, local communities and regions.  Sometimes, by solving a specific problem within their state or local area, grant recipients end up addressing issues that have national or industry-wide impact. With the support of FSMIP funds in and , the California Association of Food Banks (CAFB), in partnership with the California Department of Food and Agriculture, was able to dramatically expand its Farm to Family program.  Among several positive outcomes was a pilot project to help food banks access nutrient-dense row crops. Crops like broccoli, cauliflower, and celery are often sorted and separated right in the harvest field.  Products that do not meet supermarket grade are usually left in the field and tilled under.  CAFB worked with two major growers to harvest cull products, providing a steady source of high nutrient vegetables to food banks.  Since the project’s inception, people in need have enjoyed over 8 million pounds of these crops, and food banks now have a regular, permanent supply of nutrient-dense row crops.  This project provides a model for other states seeking to provide a new market for produce growers while meeting a vital food need.

Photo courtesy Alameda County Community Food Bank With FSMIP funding, the Ohio Direct Marketing Team led by Ohio State University used surveys and case studies to evaluate the current marketing strategies and practices of Ohio food producers.  The goal was to determine if and how a web-based marketing system called MarketMaker improved the effectiveness of their marketing efforts.  MarketMaker is currently one of the most extensive collections of searchable food industry related in the country and contains over 400,000 profiles of farmers and other food related enterprises in 19 states and the District of Columbia. This investment continues to benefit Ohio food producers in numerous ways.  The FSMIP study was the first step in developing standardized protocols to evaluate the contribution of marketing tools on reducing transaction costs and leveling the playing field for local food enterprises on a national level. As a result, the Ohio Direct Marketing Team attracted additional funding to develop training modules such as MarketReady to prepare producers to enter new markets.  They also held “Meet the Buyers” forums to bring buyers and sellers together for targeted sales meetings, and developed maps, apps & mobile media marketing tools to help consumers find producers. In , the number of registered producers and users of Ohio MarketMaker increased significantly.  There were more than 5,000 visitors and 679 registered producers by the end of the year.  In , Ohio was one of two states recognized with the first National Food MarketMaker Innovation Awards, sponsored by Farm Credit.  Building on strong food industry partnerships, the “Get Connected” campaign engaged new organizations through customized promotional and educational materials. As a result, the number of registered MarketMaker users nearly doubled from to . The creation of “Get Connected” artwork and marketing resources will benefit the entire national MarketMaker network of states.

"Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiative Coordinator, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Nov 03,  Lesser prairie-chickens benefit from lands where a rancher is using prescribed grazing, according to a new report. Photo courtesy of Nick Richter. Habitat conservation practices make a difference for lesser prairie-chickens. That's the finding of a recent scientific study – the first part of a multi-year study – described in a new report from the Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiative (LPCI). LPCI, led by USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), works with partner organizations and ranchers to improve habitat and address threats to the bird. Since , more than 1 million acres of habitat have been restored on working lands. NRCS works with partners to monitor the outcomes, which helps determine if conservation practices are making a difference, but accurately estimating wildlife populations can be challenging with uncommon, widely dispersed species like the lesser prairie-chicken. A recent study identified a new model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, and it shows encouraging evidence that NRCS-recommended conservation practices through LPCI are working and that large blocks of intact prairie are important to prairie-chicken conservation. The study assessed one year of from the annual aerial survey of lesser prairie-chicken lek sites conducted by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and it looked at four factors that might impact site occupancy — patch size of native vegetation, percent of land cover managed with prescribed grazing; percent of land cover enrolled in USDA’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); and density of primary roads. The research team intends to continue with a multi-year study that assesses additional variables. As the amount of land enrolled in CRP or using prescribed grazing increases, the likelihood that lesser prairie-chickens will occupy that land also increases. Lesser prairie-chickens face many threats, including habitat loss and fragmentation from row-crop agriculture, fire suppression, unmanaged grazing, development, and drought. The species currently occupies just 16 percent of its historic range. But in western Kansas, lesser prairie-chickens have reoccupied portions of their historical range and have even moved into areas outside that historical range. The range expansion coincides with former croplands enrolled and maintained as grasslands through CRP as well as native grasslands managed using LPCI prescribed grazing practices. A team of researchers tested whether there was a quantifiable link between land where ranchers are implementing LPCI prescribed grazing plans or have enrolled their land in CRP and the likelihood of prairie-chickens occupying a landscape. Their results indicate that these habitat conservation efforts are working. After developing an expanded model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, the team found that occupancy increases as prairie patch-size increases, as well as in landscapes with ongoing conservation practices. Specifically, the results indicate that when ranchers are using prescribed grazing or enrolling land in CRP, the likelihood of lesser prairie-chickens occupying that habitat increases significantly. The report’s management recommendations include: Enrolling acreage within the lesser prairie-chicken active range in prescribed grazing or CRP. Maintaining large blocks of native prairie across the range through sustainable ranching. Identifying potential landscapes with willing landowners to develop conservation easements, particularly if combined with prescribed grazing and other proven habitat conservation practices. Implementing prescribed grazing on dispersed patches throughout large blocks of rangeland. Cultivating diverse stands of CRP-enrolled grasslands that serve as connective tissue to larger patches of native prairie. Retaining CRP acreage as grasslands after contract expiration. NRCS outlined its three-year conservation strategy for lesser prairie-chicken conservation, which encourages adoption of many of the above recommendations on 500,000 additional acres, such as prescribed grazing, using easements to protect key habitat corridors, and providing assistance to convert expiring CRP lands to grazing.

"New Study Offers Sage Advice  For many, one of the New Year’s first big chores is to remove a tree from inside their home. Trees, beautiful and useful as they are, do not belong everywhere. Such is the case with trees and other woody species that are expanding into the Western grasslands. Over the years, woody species like juniper, pinyon pine, redcedar and mesquite have encroached on grassland and sagebrush ecosystems, altering these landscapes and making them unsuitable for native wildlife like the lesser prairie-chicken and greater sage-grouse. Encroaching conifers also degrade rangelands for agricultural producers whose livestock rely on nutritious forage.

"Chief, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Sep 22,  Utah rancher Bill Kennedy worked with NRCS through SGI to improve his working rangelands for sage grouse and livestock. Photo by Jesse Bussard. This past April, we woke up at 3 a.m. and made our way to a blind amid an expanse of sagebrush on a ranch in central Montana. When the sun rose that morning, I saw my first sage grouse--actually, I got to see more than 100 of them!--when the birds arrived at the lek site for their famous tail-shaking springtime courtship dance. Seeing sage grouse in action reminded me how important it is to do what we do here at USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). I saw firsthand how agriculture and wildlife can co-exist and thrive. In the West, we work with over 1,300 ranchers through the NRCS-led Sage Grouse Initiative (SGI) to improve their ranching operations while also helping this iconic bird. It’s been a big year for sage grouse. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) determined last year that the species didn’t merit protections under the Endangered Species Act because of the collaborative conservation efforts underway to help the species. Central to that effort were ranchers, who have stepped forward for many years to make a difference. But last year’s decision did not mean we slowed down our conservation work through SGI. We’re here for the long haul, building on previous successes by implementing our Sage Grouse Initiative 2.rategy, which will conserve an estimated 8 million acres of sagebrush—along with 350+ species that depend on it--by . Sage grouse are an “umbrella species” and an icon of the Western range. When ranchers implement conservation practices that benefit sage grouse, those practices also benefit 350-plus sagebrush-dependent species. Photo by Tatiana Gettelman. With the help of conservation partners, NRCS has conserved 5 million acres of sagebrush rangeland and reduced threats to sage grouse. In the past six years, SGI and ranchers have: Reduced the threat of invasive grasses and wildfire by managing for healthier rangelands on 1.8 million acres. Removed 457,000 acres of expanding conifer to reclaim core sage grouse habitat. Protected 451,000 acres of agricultural land and prime wildlife habitat for 350-plus sagebrush-dependent species. Improved grazing strategies to enhance range habitat on more than 2.7 million acres for sage grouse and other wildlife species. Conserved 12,000 acres and improved 179 acres of wet meadow and riparian areas for brooding hens. Marked or moved 628 miles of high-risk fences to reduce sage grouse collisions by 83 percent. We continue to fine-tune our conservation efforts through science and research. In the past year, we’ve documented how removing encroaching juniper to restore sagebrush benefits songbirds as well as sage grouse. We’ve also studied how and where to reduce the risk of converting sagebrush into cultivated cropland, which we made available on the new SGI Interactive Web Application. This new online mapping tool provides free on rangewide conditions, helping NRCS conservationists and partners plan and prioritize conservation projects. Plus, we now use our successful efforts in sagebrush country as a model for the rest of the country. We are applying what we’ve learned to other priority species and landscapes to replicate success through Working Lands for Wildlife (WLFW). The future of wildlife, agriculture and rural ways of life depend on this shining model of collaborative conservation. SGI uses science, research and tools to improve and fine-tune conservation efforts. Photo by Tatiana Gettelman.  If there’s one thing we’ve learned, it's that, together, we can make a difference. We’re proud of our collective past achievements and look forward to continuing our work with America’s producers to conserve landscapes for future generations.

"Branch Chief, Farmers Market and Direct Market Research Branch, AMS in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Dec 17,  Shed Two at Detroit’s Eastern Market Look up Wayne County, Michigan, home to Detroit, in USDA’s Food Environment Atlas and it is obvious that local residents have some significant challenges in accessing healthful food.  An alarmingly high number of households that lack a car in Wayne County are located further than one mile from the closest grocery store, meaning that many families struggle to get access to fresh and healthy food.   Indeed, the closure of two supermarkets in left Detroit as the largest city in the country without a single full-service supermarket within its boundaries. A recent study indicates that over half a million of Detroit’s residents live in neighborhoods where they must travel twice as far to reach a grocery store than they do to reach a convenience store. As a result, many families are forced to buy their meals at these convenience stores, where microwavable pre-prepared meals and fast food are well-stocked, and fresh and healthy foods are often hard to find. Detroit, in other words, is a food desert. But, there is good news! Eastern Market Corporation, one of the nation’s longest operating public markets has taken on the challenge of addressing Detroit’s significant food access issues. Eastern Market has developed a comprehensive “food hub,”  coordinating aggregation and distribution for many of Michigan’s small and mid-size farmers who are producing the healthy food that Motor City residents need and want.  With nearly 500,000 of Wayne County’s 1.9 million residents relying on SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) for their food purchases, the market director knew that it was important to ensure that his organization could process SNAP benefits. Today, Eastern Market processes up to $30,000 of SNAP transactions per month.  What’s more, SNAP benefits redeemed at Eastern Market are doubled for each participating household with the support of the Fair Food Network, an organization that provides a financial match to SNAP redemptions through its Double Up Food Bucks program. As part of the USDA’s interest in examining  how actively coordinated food hubs can play an important role in eradicating food deserts, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service has partnered with Eastern Market through a cooperative research agreement to expand the availability of fresh, healthful  and locally-produced food throughout Detroit.  Our to-do list includes: Developing more direct-to-consumer marketing activities in neighborhoods challenged by poor public transportation systems; Training farm vendors  about emerging opportunities for direct-to-consumer sales in food desert neighborhoods; Facilitating deliveries between the region’s local growers and organizations who are dedicated to distributing fresh, healthful food directly to Detroit’s neighborhoods in need; and, Educating local residents about available nutrition assistance programs and emerging market outlets. As a food hub, Eastern Market is uniquely positioned to serve all people in Detroit while economic benefits to local farmers, ranchers, and dairies.  Eastern Market and its member tenants provide a bevy of wholesale services that open new markets for the region’s small and midsize producers—including aggregation, distribution, processing and commercial market opportunities.  Eastern Market also houses prepared food businesses (like ravioli and fresh salsa).  They’re even planning to redevelop a full square mile in a dedicated economic development district to bring in additional business incubators, restaurants, retailers, wholesale services and a distribution center – all designed to help rebuild southeast Michigan’s regional food system and eliminate Detroit’s food access problems. By integrating all of these diverse business functions into one centralized, coordinated regional “food hub,” Eastern Market’s business development model can be expected to bring good things to Detroit.

"Celebrating American Agriculture: All USDA Foods are Local to Someone  March is National Nutrition Month. Throughout the month, USDA will be highlighting results of our efforts to improve access to safe, healthy food for all Americans and supporting the health of our next generation.  Fish and fowl, sowing and reaping, nutrition and agriculture… certain words and concepts naturally go hand in hand, and March is a month to celebrate both the foundation and purpose of the American food system. With March designated as National Nutrition Month and March 15 as National Agriculture Day, the time is ripe to reflect on healthy eating goals and to express gratitude for the farmers, fishers, and ranchers who provide the foods to fuel our nation. USDA’s Food Distribution Programs work at the intersection of nutrition and agriculture. Each year, USDA purchases more than 2 billion pounds of food worth nearly $2 billion from American farmers and distributes the food to schools, food banks, Indian Tribal Organizations, disaster feeding organizations, and other charitable institutions and feeding organizations. The programs benefit both ends of the food chain by supporting local agriculture and the economy while also providing a nutrition safety net for vulnerable Americans.

"Got Weeds? Need to hold water in the soil? Mulch can help with these things and more. Mulching is one of the simplest and most beneficial practices you can use in the garden. Mulch is simply a protective layer of a material that is spread on top of the soil. Mulches can either be organic -- such as grass clippings, straw, bark chips, and similar materials -- or inorganic -- such as stones, brick chips, and plastic. Both organic and inorganic mulches have numerous benefits. Mulch helps conserve and extend available water, protects the soil from erosion, reduces competition by suppressing weeds, moderates temperature extremes, and acts as a barrier or visible marker of gardening beds to limit damage by landscape maintenance equipment. Understanding when, what type and how much mulch to spread is important because spreading too much mulch can be damaging to trees and plants.

"What is a native plant? A native plant is a plant that is a part of the balance of nature that has developed over hundreds or thousands of years in a particular region or ecosystem. Note: The word native should always be used with a geographic qualifier (that is, native to New England [for example]). Only plants found in this country before European settlement are considered to be native to the United States. There are many benefits of landscaping and gardening with native plants including conserving water, protecting soil from erosion, and creating habitat and providing food for many different animals including birds, pollinators, and small mammals. Simply by growing native plants gardeners can bring enormous beauty to a community and joy to its residents. In addition, native plants are easy-to-grow and require minimal maintenance. Fall is widely considered the best time of year to plant native trees, shrubs, grasses, vines and perennials.

"In the United States, between 30-40 percent of food is wasted. This means that food that could have helped feed families in need is sent to landfills. Urban gardens can play a role in creating rich compost and improved soil quality from food waste. The best thing, however, is to reduce the food you waste in the first place. Learn how USDA is fighting food waste and how you can too. Food Donation All food grown in a People’s Garden at a USDA-owned, or leased, facility is donated to local food pantries, food banks, food rescue programs, kitchens, and shelters. Those growing food at other locations are encouraged to donate a portion of what’s grown to help those in need and reduce food waste. If you grow more than you need, donate it, don’t waste it! Helpful Tip Donations of food and grocery items to non-profits to feed needy individuals are covered by the Good Samaritan Food Donation Act (Public Law 104-210). Unless there is gross negligence or misconduct on behalf of the donor, individuals and groups are not liable.

"What is composting? Composting is the process of recycling organic materials into an amendment that can be used to enrich soil and plants. Types of Compost Bins Typical Compost Bin Tumbler Compost Bin Worm Compost Bin Why Compost? Food scraps and yard waste currently make up 20 to 30 percent of what we throw away. USDA is fighting food waste and you can too. Composting is nature’s way of recycling! Here are a few reasons to get started today:  Feed the soil without using chemical fertilizers.  Keep food waste out of the landfills and prevent greenhouse gas emissions.  Conserve water by building healthy soils. Get Started There are different ways to get started composting today. You can start a backyard composting bin or use worms to do the work. Backyard composting in three easy steps:  Choose a location. A good site is dry in either the sun or partial shade.  Set-up your compost bin. Purchase a compost bin or create an inexpensive bin with wire mesh and 3-4 poles for support.  Get composting. Include 2-3 parts “brown material” (fall leaves, twigs, shredded newspaper, straw, wood chips, and shredded wood) and 1 part “green material” (vegetable and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, crushed eggshells, garden and grass clippings, tea bags without staples) by volume then add water to keep moist. Don’t forget to turn your pile! A monthly rotation is a good rule of thumb. Worm Composting Setup:  Select Container. Purchase a worm bin or make your own from a plastic or wood storage container. Worm bins require holes drilled for aeration and drainage. There are several online sources with instructions to create a worm bin.  Locate bin. The ideal temperature for worm composting is 59-77 degrees F. The bin can be kept indoors or outdoors in the shade. During colder months, insulate the worm bin with blankets, straw, or other material to keep it warm.  Worm Bin Setup:  Worms need bedding such as a mixture of non-glossy paper, cardboard, or leaves. Soak the material for 10 minutes, wring out the water so it is moist but not saturated, and place it in the bin with a handful of soil.  Now you are ready to add your worms. There are over 9,000 species of earthworms, but only 7 are suitable for vermicomposting. The most widely used species is the “red wiggler” which you can buy from a worm grower. Do not use worms from a bait shop or your garden since they will not be able to thrive in your worm bin.  Feed your worms veggie and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, eggshells, and moistened bread. Avoid meat, fish, dairy products, citrus fruits, twigs and branches.

Considering these differences, both methods are suitable for reducing food waste. However, vermicomposting is more ideal for homeowners who: * Have limited outdoor space * Want to reduce odors and pests associated with traditional composting * Can maintain a consistent temperature in their worm bin * Are willing to invest time and effort in managing the worms and their diet For homeowners looking to reduce food waste, either method can be effective. However, if you're short on outdoor space or prefer a more hands-off approach, vermicomposting might be the better choice."
"Southwest Regional Assistant WIC Director in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Sep 21,  Claudia Crow, a farmer from Shawnee, OK, assists a customer during the Pottowatomie County Famers Market Five-Year Anniversary.  In the hustle and bustle of working for the WIC program in the Southwest Region, I travel quite often, attending meetings and ensuring logistics much like many of my fellow federal and state co-workers. Recently I had the privilege to attend the Pottawatomie County Farmers Market five-year anniversary in Shawnee, OK. Having grown up in a very rural town, representing FNS was a learning experience that reminded me of home. The event was a total success, as the market was full of people including farmers, seniors, families and children. Celebrating five years of service, the event included live music, family and children’s activities, and most important of all: fresh fruit and vegetables. I learned that famers drive hours to sell their crops at the market, and it accounts for as much as over two-thirds of their income. Most farmers market customers swear by the produce bought there, as it is much fresher and lasts longer than normal store-bought produce. In some cases, supermarket produce makes a week-long journey of over 1,500 miles before getting into the kitchen. But the most important part was seeing FNS programs like WIC and SNAP EBT represented. All of the farmers were knowledgeable about Farm to School and Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food, and have even started farm tours for children and have working relationships with local schools. Getting fresh vegetables in school cafeterias straight from the farm is great on so many levels! Observing our partnerships at the grassroots stage from farmer to a customer, or farmer to a school sets a tone for the whole region. The relationships I see built are ones that last for years, and I wish the Farmers Market all the best in their future endeavors. Here’s to another five years of successful farming and selling!

"Cover Crops Cover crops are traditionally planted on farms but can be used in gardens. A cover crop is any crop grown to cover the soil and may be incorporated into the soil later for enrichment. Planting cover crops in your garden provides multiple benefits such as controlling erosion, suppressing weeds, reducing soil compaction, increasing moisture and nutrient content of soil, improving yield potential, attracting pollinators, and providing habitat for beneficial insects and wildlife as well as food to animals. Cover crops (grasses, legumes and forbs) recommended for seasonal cover and other conservation purposes include annual ryegrass, oilseed radish, winter cereal rye, and oats used for scavenging unused fertilizer and releasing nutrients back into the soil for the next crop to use. Good cover crops to break up compacted soils are forage radish (also known as oilseed radish) and forage turnip. Similar to commercial nitrogen (N) fertilizers, legume cover crops like crimson clover, hairy vetch and Austrian winter pea can help “grow” some of your N needs. Crop Rotation It has long been a common practice for farmers to vary the crops grown in each field from year to year. This same practice of rotating crops can be applied to small-scale food gardens. Make a plan to grow certain plant families in one area of the garden this season and in a different area next season. For crop rotation to be most effective, don’t plant an area with vegetables from the same plant family more than once every three to four years. Rotating crops can have important production benefits such as increasing yields, improving nutrients and organic matter in the soil, and it can help disrupt the lifecycle of crop pests, reducing chemical use. Don’t forget to add a cover crop to your rotation –especially when the garden is fallow –to reduce soil erosion and improve wildlife habitat.

"Posted by the Food Safety Research Information Office, National Agricultural Library in  Health and Safety  USDA Results  Jul 29,  USDA’s National Agricultural Library launches its latest Web exhibit “How Did We Can?” on home canning in the United States. July is the height of summer grilling season, and throughout the month USDA is highlighting changes made to the U.S. food safety system over the course of this Administration. For an interactive look at USDA’s work to ensure your food is safe, visit the USDA Results project on Medium.com and read Chapter Seven: Safer Food and Greater Consumer Confidence. The USDA’s National Agricultural Library (NAL) recently launched its newest online exhibit, “How Did We Can? —The Evolution of Home Canning Practices.” The exhibit follows the evolution of home canning in the United States and the progression of associated food safety . Canning aids in food preservation by removing microorganisms responsible for decay through heating and creating a seal to prevent recontamination. Home canning held an important role in 20th century food preservation, particularly through the two World Wars, and continues to be practiced today. “How Did We Can?” highlights changes in home canning based on a growing understanding of bacteriology. Around the turn of the 20th century, the four most prominent canning techniques were oven, open-kettle, water bath, and pressure canning. By the end of World War II, the USDA recommended only two techniques: water bath for high-acid foods and pressure canning for low-acid foods. Those recommendations remain the same under the current USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning. During World War I and World War II, canning was touted as being imperative to the war effort on the home front and was referred to as “a real war job” in a Office of War Information poster. Home canning peaked during World War II when over four billion cans were processed in . While home canning has never since reached such a height, it continues to thrive today among home food preservation enthusiasts.

"High-Tech Agriculture Continues to Reap Rewards for Farmers and Society  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Just like a smart phone helps users learn, communicate and make important decisions, smart technology—known as precision agriculture—helps farmers know and apply critical information about the right investments in fertilizer, seed, pesticide and water needed to produce their crops. Through new technologies, farmers produce more efficiently and see an increase in profits while improving stewardship of ecosystems and local communities. To talk about precision agriculture is to talk about mapping the amount of a crop grown per acre (yield) or the types of soils in a given area. It also includes the technology that automatically guides farm machines and controls variables like the rates of seeds, fertilizers or chemicals.

"Posted by the Food Safety Research Information Office, National Agricultural Library in  Initiatives  Health and Safety  Nov 21,  USDA Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) microbiologist Monifa Peterson demonstrates the addition of reagents for an E. coli non-O157:H7 analysis. Food is necessary and can be quite enjoyable, but it must also be safe to eat. Unfortunately, about one out of six Americans gets sick from eating contaminated food at some point during the year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scientists from USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) work for one of the federal agencies that conducts research to help make the foods we eat safer. To help the public more easily access USDA food safety research information, the department’s National Agricultural Library’s Food Safety Research Information Office (FSRIO) has launched a new “Meet the Experts” online video collection available on the NAL website. FSRIO has collected videos from a variety of sources and organized them in one repository. Current videos highlight ARS food safety research. FSRIO will add other videos to the collection that highlights research and food safety efforts from across USDA agencies. Many foods must travel through different points between the farm and your plate.  Lettuce, for example, is harvested from the field, cooled, processed and packaged, then transported to your grocery store where it is displayed in a cooler waiting for someone to buy it, transport it home or to a restaurant where it finally gets prepared and eaten.  ARS scientists in the produce-safety videos discuss how their research is improving the safety of that lettuce all through its journey to the grocery display cooler.  Stay tuned as additional videos are added to the “Meet the Experts” website.

"AMS Administrator in  Research and Science  May 16,  Pictured here with his pet rooster, March, Lue Gim Gong’s work with citrus trees helped develop a frost-tolerant orange after a disastrous winter in Florida. No one should live in this world for himself alone, but to do good for those who come after him. These are the words that Lue Gim Gong lived by.  When he was only 12 years old, Lue left his home and farmer parents in Canton, China and crossed the Pacific Ocean to America.  He lived and worked in San Francisco until he was 16, and then moved to Massachusetts to take a job at the C.T. Sampson shoe factory. At church, Lue met Fannie Burlingame, the daughter of a wealthy farmer and merchant.  She immediately recognized his desire to learn and his natural talent with plants.   He eventually came to live with her family and they helped him become an American citizen in . Along with his green thumb, Lue had a knack for storytelling and a way with animals.  While his personality and desire to learn were larger than life, his body was frail and at some point in his youth he became very ill, possibly with tuberculosis.  His condition was made worse by the cold New England climate, so Fannie suggested he move to DeLand, Florida, where she and her sister owned a house and orchard. Working with William Dumville, Fannie’s brother-in-law, Lue planted orange trees and other fruits, immersing himself in the world of horticulture. In the winter of -95, Florida saw some of the worst freezes in recorded history.  Almost all of the citrus groves were lost—including the ones worked by Lue and Dumville.  Lue’s experiments in cross-pollination became focused on producing fruits that were more tolerant of cold weather. Fannie passed away in , leaving Lue the house and property in DeLand.  Devastated by the loss of “Mother Fannie,” Lue became a bit of an eccentric fixture in the small Florida community.  His pet rooster, March, and two horses named Baby and Fannie were his main companions, but his work with plant varieties continued. In , he was recognized for successfully cross-pollinated a “Hart’s Late” Valencia orange with a “Mediterranean Sweet” to produce a new orange named the “Lue Gim Gong.”  This sweet new variation, later found to be a nucellar seedling of the Valencia, ripened in the early fall and was much more resistant to the cold.  It is sold under the Valencia name today. His achievement won the Silver Wilder Medal, awarded by the American Pomological Society—the first such award for a citrus fruit. Lue also developed an apple that ripened a month earlier than other varieties, tomatoes that grew in clusters, and a peach that would ripen in late November.  His continued efforts with citrus plants also produced varieties of grapefruits that grew singularly (instead of in clumps), a cold-tolerant grapefruit that was slower to drop and a “perfumed” variety that had a heavy fragrance. Lue’s conviction to do lasting good changed the Florida citrus industry and broadened the seasonal range for many orchard-grown trees.  While his life was lived simply and mostly outside of the limelight, he certainly did his best to create something good for the generations of farmers that came after him. USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), celebrates the life of Lue Gim Gong and spirit of the words he lived by.  From our programs that support farmers and ranchers of all sizes to our role in bringing food to U.S. troops, we strive to do good for those around us and those who will come after us.

"Be Fire Wise: Preparing Your Home for Wildfire Season  Very often, the difference between saving your home in a wild fire and losing it to the flames is pretty much determined by what you do to prepare your property. The U.S. Forest Service calls it being Fire Wise. I’ve had personal experience in the importance of clearing a wide perimeter around your property to deny fuel—dried wood, grass and trees—to a fire. Back about ten years ago my grandparents’ ranch house near the Cleveland National Forest in San Diego County was spared because of a 150-foot clear space between the flames and the house.

"Public Affairs Specialist, APHIS in  Animals  Plants  Apr 16,  Delicious citrus: Scott Bauer, USDA Agricultural Research Service It’s time to grab those gloves and get outside for some gardening!  April is not only a great time to plant citrus trees, but it’s also Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month. Before wielding that shovel, take a few minutes to learn how to keep your trees healthy and prevent the spread of citrus disease. Citrus greening disease, also known as Huanglongbing (HLB), is one of the most severe plant diseases in the world. The disease has devastated millions of citrus trees in the United States and now has the potential to eliminate the citrus industry.  Once a tree is infected with the disease, there is no known cure. Citrus greening is spread by a bug the size of the head of a pin—the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP). When the bug feeds on an infected tree, it becomes a carrier, spreading the disease from one tree to another.  Although the disease is not harmful to humans, fruit from infected trees are not suitable for consumption because of their green color, misshapen appearance and bitter taste. Here are four tips to help get you started with citrus while preventing the spread of citrus greening disease: 1. Be Aware of Quarantines. If you are thinking about buying a citrus plant, be sure not to move it from quarantined states or territories. Not only are you risking spreading citrus diseases by transporting citrus outside of these areas, but it's also against the law. Review the quarantine map at SaveOurCitrus.org. 2. Check the Citrus Plant Supplier. Be a savvy buyer. Citrus plants sold in a regulated state must be sold from a certified vendor and be properly labeled.  3. Keep Homegrown Citrus at Home. Help reduce the spread of citrus diseases by not moving your homegrown citrus fruit or plants from quarantine areas. 4. Inspect Citrus Plants Regularly for Diseases and Insects. Visit our symptom checklist and corresponding photos to identify a plant impacted by ACP, citrus greening, citrus canker, citrus black spot and sweet orange scab. If you detect an infected plant, report it immediately. If you suspect your citrus may be diseased, report it immediately to the USDA.  The USDA’s Save Our Citrus iPhone App offers a convenient way for people to identify and report suspected citrus disease. This free app is available for download from the iTunes store.   To learn more about the Save Our Citrus program, visit www.saveourcitrus.org or follow the program on Facebook and Twitter. USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has declared April as Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month. Throughout the month, APHIS is posting a series of blog entries here and also share invasive plant pest and disease information through our twitter feed. APHIS and its federal and state partners are fighting to protect our communities, our public lands, and our agricultural resources from invasive species. But we can’t do it alone.

"Shoshone National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Nov 19,  Prince Albert II of Monaco poses in between Wapiti District Ranger Sue Stresser and Shoshone Forest Supervisor Joe Alexander. (U.S. Forest Service/ Kristie Salzmann) On a beautiful fall day on America’s first national forest, Prince Albert II of Monaco retraced the steps his great-grandfather took 100 years ago through the wilderness of the Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming. Prince Albert II helped celebrate on Sept. 20 the centennial anniversary of the hunting trip his great-grandfather, Prince Albert I, took with now-historic figures William “Buffalo Bill” Cody and Abraham Archibald Anderson, the first Special Superintendent of Forest Reserves. The successful hunting trip cemented lasting relationships between the men and established an area in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, which is still known today as Camp Monaco. The centennial celebration began with a morning horseback trail ride following a route very similar to one Prince Albert I took a century ago. A local outfitter and fly-fishing guide, Lee Livingston Outfitting Inc., guided Prince Albert II and his party through the changing leaves of the forest where they were greeted with splendid mountain views and a few grizzly bear sightings. The trail ride was followed by a luncheon at the Pahaska Tepee, Buffalo Bill Cody’s original hunting lodge on the Shoshone National Forest. While enjoying the splendor of the historic lodge, guests were treated to the history of the original hunting trip, as well as stories about Prince Albert I and Buffalo Bill Cody.

"Pacific Southwest Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jul 25,  Bob Goodwin, a former California Highway Patrol officer, now works for the U.S. Forest Service as a Tribal relations advisor. (U.S. Forest Service photo) During his 21 years as a California Highway Patrol officer, Bob Goodwin eased tensions during traffic accidents, issued verbal warnings and made arrests—all in a calm and cool way. Now, as Tribal relations advisor for the U.S. Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest Region, Goodwin is again relying on those valuable people and negotiating skills to build relations between Tribal entities and the federal government. Goodwin’s easy-going demeanor, “can do” attitude, and ability to resolve challenging issues make him perfect for the job. As tribal relations advisor, Goodwin, 50, who grew up in Northern California, provides advice and guidance to the regional forester on issues that concern Native Americans. He also works with the region’s national forests and ranger districts on projects that may have an effect on traditional, cultural sites. Goodwin is often called upon to ensure smooth relations when the interests of tribal entities and the Forest Service conflict. He is currently working with the tribes as the Forest Service implements the Forest Plan Revision on the region’s Inyo, Sequoia and Sierra national forests. The Forest Plan instructs the Forest Service on how to manage the resources of a national forest. While the issues have been challenging, Goodwin views the exercise as an opportunity for the Forest Service to strengthen relationships with its tribal partners. “My experiences with the (California Highway Patrol) got me into situations that were very stressful or difficult, where I had to look at all the possibilities on how these things could be resolved,” said Goodwin. Along with his experience with the highway patrol, Goodwin, who is an enrolled member of the Karuk Tribe part Karuk, was elected to the Karuk Tribal Council and served two four-year terms. Despite his tribal connection and experience, he was uncertain about applying for the position with the Forest Service because he wondered whether he could serve the needs of both the agency and the Tribes. But after careful consideration, he determined that his unique experience brings an understanding that would be valuable for both parties. Goodwin says he is particularly interested in protecting natural resources and developing stewardship opportunities for all tribes across the state. “Bob has first-hand experience from the tribal side which gives him a leg up in the job,” said Leaf Hillman, director of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy for the Karuk Tribe.  “He handles tough situations calmly and doesn’t get rattled.”  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Tags:  California  Forestry  FS  Inyo National Forest  Native Americans  OTR  Sequoia National Forest  Sierra National Forest  Tribal","What unique experience and perspective does Bob Goodwin, as a former Highway Patrol officer and Karuk tribal member, bring to his role as Tribal relations advisor for the U.S. Forest Service?","Bob Goodwin brings a unique combination of experiences to his role as Tribal relations advisor, including: * His background as a calm and effective mediator in stressful situations during his time with the Highway Patrol * His personal connection to the Karuk Tribe through his tribal membership and past service on the Karuk Tribal Council * A firsthand understanding of both the federal agency's perspective and the needs of Native American communities This blend of experiences allows him to navigate complex relationships between the Forest Service and tribal entities, making him well-suited for his role."

"USDA Forest Service Chief in  USDA Results  Forestry  Nov 22,  Untreated ponderosa pine woodland compared to an area restored by the Greater Flagstaff Forest Partnership working with the Forest Service in on the Coconino National Forest in Arizona. While people have squabbled over the direction of federal forest management, many landscapes have declined. Take southwestern ponderosa pine, for example. Where thick grasses once waved under big orange-barked pines, thickets of spindly trees now threaten natural and human communities alike through outbreaks of insects and disease, followed by devastating fires. Now people are joining together around common conservation goals to restore landscapes like these. The U.S. Forest Service is working with partners to restore healthy watersheds capable of delivering all the values and benefits that Americans want and need. The goal is to restore landscapes that future generations will describe with the same awe inspired in the first European visitors. In Arizona, environmentalists, local officials, and others have coalesced behind a Forest Service initiative to furnish small-diameter materials from four overgrown national forests to local mills and bioenergy facilities. “I’m hoping to look back on this day as the official end of the forest wars,” said Todd Schulke of the Center for Biological Diversity. The time is right for a restoration economy. The Forest Service is tailoring its programs and projects to a new management environment associated with climate change, demographic growth, and other large-scale drivers of landscape changes that are undermining the health of America’s forests and grasslands. Restoration treatments are based on collaboration with stakeholders to achieve mutual goals across entire landscapes, leading to more jobs and a better future for forest-based communities hard hit by recession. A restoration economy will take time to develop. It will take years to establish confidence and mutual goodwill, overcoming lingering doubts and festering fears and suspicions. In time, however, Americans can unite to achieve their mutual restoration goals through landscape-scale conservation. Joining together, we can link ecological restoration to jobs and economic opportunities for communities across the nation, for the sake of generations to come.

"National Program Leader with the Division of Youth and 4-H, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  Oct 19,  Since its creation more than 100 years ago, 4-H has expanded its focus from the field to the lab to keep pace with developments in agricultural techniques and technologies. Photo courtesy of 4-H. National 4-H Week happens each October, a time when nearly six million youth celebrate their participation in 4-H.  Every year, clubs around the country showcase the great things that 4-H offers young people and highlight the incredible things they do to make a positive impact in their communities. The 4-H clover is one of the most recognized in the country, but it wasn’t always that way.  Like most things, it grew – this case from three leaves. The seeds of 4-H were planted at the start of the 20th century by several adults in different states who were concerned about young people. Clark County, Ohio, claims credit as being the birthplace of 4-H, although the initial groups were called “The Tomato Club” or the “Corn Club.” The times were ripe for a new youth innovation like 4-H. During the late s, public universities’ researchers saw that adults in the farming communities did not readily accept the new agricultural discoveries being developed on campuses, such as hybrid seed corn, milk sanitation and home canning procedures. However, they found that young people were open to new thinking. Rural youth programs became an innovative way to introduce new agricultural technology to their communities. In , Iowa school superintendents Jessie Field Shambaugh and O.H. Benson developed a 3-leaf clover pin with an “H” on each leaf to signify “head,” “heart,” and “hands.” In a meeting, club leaders approved the design of a 4-leaf clover with an H on each leaf, adding “health.” By , the groups were becoming known as 4-H clubs. Congress passed the Smith-Lever Act in , creating the Cooperative Extension System at USDA, which included work of various boys' and girls' clubs involved with agriculture, home economics and related subjects. This action effectively nationalized the 4-H program. Between and , clubs were formed at some historically black land-grant colleges in Southern states opening up 4-H to more African-American youth. As 4-H grew, its focus moved beyond the translation of science to include personal growth so that youth could gain skills to help them transition to adulthood in a contributing, productive and self-directed manner. With its national headquarters located within USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), today 4-H serves nearly 6 million youth in rural, urban and suburban communities in every state and many U.S. military installations around the world. Today’s 4-H’ers tackle the nation's top issues, from global food security, climate change and sustainable energy to childhood obesity and food safety. To improve the nation's ability to compete in key scientific fields and take on the leading challenges of the 21st century, 4-H programs offer a wide variety of science, engineering, technology and applied math educational opportunities, including agricultural sciences, rocketry, robotics, environmental protection and computer science. Find out more at www.4-h.org. NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

"Deputy Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations, USDA in  Conservation  Initiatives  Nov 02,  Today, I accompanied Secretary Vilsack on a trip to the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois to announce USDA’s year-long celebration of the 150th anniversary of our founding in .  It is quite fitting that we are marking this celebration in the hometown of our founder, President Abraham Lincoln, which just so happens to be my hometown as well. During today’s festivities, Secretary Vilsack unveiled the official 150th anniversary graphic to help mark the occasion which you can view at the USDA 150th anniversary website. This graphic will be used throughout the year as the USDA community celebrates this landmark anniversary by commemorating important events, such as the signing of the legislation to establish the Department on May 15, by President Lincoln, and the July signing of the Morrill Act to establish our public land grant universities. Additionally, People’s Gardens will hold a series of anniversary events that celebrate the innovative, collaborative work of USDA employees across the country. These events will showcase the Department’s dedication to providing healthy, nutritious food for those in need with a special emphasis on the conservation and restoration of our nation’s natural resources. USDA continues to fulfill the vision Lincoln set forth when he called us the “People’s Department” – touching the lives of every American, every day. As the chair of USDA’s 150th Anniversary Committee, I am excited about for USDA to reflect on 150 years of accomplishments, while also using it as an opportunity to consider the challenges that lie ahead.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Sep 08,  Victoria LeBeaux, national program leader with the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. Photo by Carlos Harris There is no one-size-fits-all approach to career development and, according to one of the nation’s new leaders in agriculture, the course one steers toward a profession in agriculture can be as varied and diverse as the population itself. “I’m not a big fan of the term ‘pipeline’ because it implies that there is only one way in and only one direction you can go,” said Dr. Victoria LeBeaux, a national program leader (NPL) with USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).  “If that were true I certainly wouldn’t be here, since I had no intention of studying agriculture.” As an undergraduate, she studied economics with the goal of working in international development. Prior to starting her doctorate in sustainable agriculture, LeBeaux lived in rural areas in France and Austria and volunteered in Mexico.  Iowa State University ultimately recruited her to complete doctoral training in a three-year NIFA-funded National Needs Fellowship (NNF) program. NNF trains students for masters and doctoral degrees. In some cases it also provides additional post-doctoral training for the Fellows.  For LeBeaux, that additional training meant a six-month stint in Guatemala where she examined how technical assistance providers helped enhance regional food security by advancing sustainable agriculture practices. LeBeaux returned to NIFA in after completing her Ph.D. and subsequent postdoctoral studies, and became an NPL in NIFA’s Division of Community and Education.  In that role she manages about $10 million in federal funding that supports secondary and postsecondary research, education and extension in the food, agricultural, and human sciences. These programs include the Educational Literacy Initiative’s Research and Extension for Undergraduates (REEU) fellowships program.  REEU provides experiential learning opportunities for underrepresented and first-generation college students. In addition, she uses her scientific training to represent NIFA in federal initiatives like USDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food, which helps coordinate USDA programs to strengthen local and regional food networks nationwide. “I sincerely appreciate the opportunities provided though the NNF program,” she said.  “As with many other young people, pursuing doctoral education was not on my radar and would not have been possible had I not had the financial support provided by the grant.  I think we need to create a diverse array of pathways to link young people to careers in agriculture and to show them that whatever they are interested in, there are opportunities in agriculture.” NIFA programs offer grants for K-12 schools and community colleges, such as The Secondary Education, Two-Year Postsecondary Education, and Agriculture in the K-12 Classroom Challenge Grants (SPECA) program; funding for undergraduate and masters level education such as the Higher Education Challenge Grants program and the Multicultural Scholars Program (MSP); and support for doctoral studies is provided by the NNF Fellowship and the Education and Literacy Initiative. NNF supports 45 new masters and doctoral students each year, while MSP supports 35 undergrads. Beyond grants, there are many other ways people can benefit from NIFA. For example, educators can access free curriculum from AITC through its Curriculum Matrix. NIFA is also the home of 4-H National Headquarters that supports the positive youth leadership development. NIFA is also a key partner with the Cooperative Extension Service, which operates offices across the country to provide community education in agriculture, health, nutrition, personal finances, and more. NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

(Photo courtesy of 4-H) Military-connected youth have an exciting opportunity to join other members of the military family this summer. These residential and day camps will develop skills and teach the campers new techniques that will help prepare them to be productive citizens. The 16 camps, held in 15 states, are 4-H camps sponsored by Air Force Child and Youth Programs, with programs tailored to meet the needs of both the host unit and regional 4-H programs. Camp themes range from leadership development to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); from sustainable energy to college prep; from drones and geospatial technology to outdoor forestry and farm conservation; and more. In addition to camps sponsored by the Air Force, Purdue University’s Cooperative Extension Service hosts Military Teen Adventure Camps that are open to families in all service branches. Purdue’s program is funded by a grant from Department of Defense and USDA. USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is the home of 4-H National Headquarters and provides funding and national program leadership to 4-H. “Besides having a great time at summer camp, making new friends, and creating memories that will last a lifetime, youth who attend Air Force 4-H Camps develop a variety of life skills, experience independence, foster teamwork, enhance communication, and increase social skills while having fun with other military youth,” said David Brittain, North Carolina State University 4-H extension associate with the Air Force 4-H Partnership. The 4-H Military Partnerships Program provides support to military-connected youth whether they live on or near an installation, in the United States or overseas. Despite the frequent moves of military families, 4-H clubs provide consistency in belonging and the chance to develop life skills through a positive youth development framework. 4-H programs integrate the research-based programs and resources of the nation’s land-grant universities to help youth excel.

"New SNAP E&T Initiatives Aim to Help SNAP Participants Find Jobs  Getting a good job these days takes more than good intentions because today’s jobs require a higher level of skills than ever before.  This is why the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program’s Employment and Training Program (SNAP E&T), administered by states across the country, has such an important role to play in helping SNAP recipients gain the skills they need to find and keep good jobs.  This is also why the U.S. Department of Agriculture is committed to supporting this effort. USDA demonstrated that commitment in two new initiatives launched just this week, the SNAP E&T Learning Academy and a new website for the innovative SNAP to Skills Project, led by the Food and Nutrition Service. The Academy breaks new ground, as a first-ever opportunity that will help address an identified need. You see, though SNAP E&T programs operate across America, we’ve found that there is an opportunity for further sharing of best practices and lessons learned by developing resources that spread the knowledge base throughout the country. The two new projects launched this week will use a “train-the-trainer” model to create new leadership capacity to build the next generation of SNAP E&T programs.

"NRCS Recovery Act Project Helps Provide New Starts for Residents   For more than 45 years, people who lived in West Virginia’s Dunloup Creek Watershed have dealt with floods. That’s because there’s a scarcity of flat land in the area and residents have had to settle mostly along the creek—the very area that floods during storms. Two major floods in and devastated five low-income communities spread out across two counties in the watershed. The floods destroyed houses, ate away at the stream bank, polluted drinking water and washed away utilities. Damages totaled millions of dollars. Because of the mountainous terrain and far-flung population, traditional flood control measures like dams, channels, floodwalls, dredging and flood proofing were not feasible. Yet many residents were trapped into living in their damaged homes, unable to move out because of perilous financial circumstances.

To raccoons, snakes and opossums, crayfish look pretty tasty, and large crayfish will even cannibalize their smaller kin. Crayfish, which live in rivers and streams, need instream cover to hide from all their predators. They also use cover to find food, to shelter while incubating eggs, and to keep themselves from being washed away in floods.

U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists are launching a campaign to ask volunteers to count the number of stink bugs in their homes. USDA-ARS photo by Stephen Ausmus. Calling all insect enthusiasts and frustrated gardeners!  USDA scientists need your help in documenting Brown Marmorated Stink Bugs (BMSB) in your home. Beginning September 15th through October 15th, we’re asking citizens across the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States to record daily counts of this pest on the exterior of their homes, along with their location and the time of each count. While USDA scientists are focusing on the Mid-Atlantic region, any they can get from other U.S. regions would also be helpful to their research. The quest to find out just how many stink bugs there are, and how they behave, is the brainchild of a consortium of researchers from USDA, the University of Maryland, Pennsylvania State University, Rutgers University, Virginia Tech, the Northeastern IPM Center, Oregon State University, North Carolina State University, Cornell University, the University of Delaware and Washington State University. This project is represented on the website, “Stop BMSB (www.stopbmsb.org),” which was launched in . The project involves more than 50 scientists who are investigating the impact BMSB have on grapes, orchard crops, small fruits, ornamental crops and vegetables, as well as ways to prevent or minimize the pest’s impact. BMSB have been found in 40 states and have caused the most damage in the Mid-Atlantic region. The value of at-risk crops where BMSB have been established or identified exceeds $21 billon. Because landscape features such as woodlands, structures, roads and different land use types affect the spread of the insects, it is important to collect related to BMSB locations. BMSB survive cold winter temperatures near farmland in homes, office buildings and warehouses. Scientists are just beginning to understand how landscape features will be a key component in combating stink bugs. Volunteers willing to count their stink bugs can contact USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) entomologists Tracy Leskey (tracy.leskey@ars.usda.gov), Doo-Hyung Lee or Torri Hancock at 725-, at the ARS Appalachian Fruit Research Laboratory in Kearneysville, West Virginia.

There are so many things most of us don’t know about trees and Arbor Day is a great time to learn a thing or two. For instance, did you know the mighty oak tree is America’s national tree? In fact, each state celebrates their own Arbor Day and has designated a tree to represent them. Our nation’s capital honors the scarlet oak.  Alaska’s Sitka spruce,  Maine’s eastern white pine, Florida’s cabbage palmetto, Washington state’s  western hemlock and California’s mighty sequoias all paint the landscapes of our lives. Our urban forests, the trees that line our streets and shade our parks and yards, not only add beauty but their shade can help reduce our utility bills. Trees soften the harsh angles of a city’s brick and mortar skyline and add a touch of color; for a moment we can envision what it must have looked like before there was a city. But, you may still be asking yourself:  What else do trees do for me? They also absorb as much as 13 percent of carbon emissions thus cleaning the air that we breathe and reducing the effects of climate change. In short, they make our planet a safer place to live. Forests also help filter nearly half of all the drinking water we need to sustain our lives and they provide the lumber we need to build our homes, make furniture and, in some cases, provide sources of bio-energy to whole communities. So, since trees and our forests do so much for us, why not use Arbor Day as the perfect opportunity to give back by planting trees—lots of them—so that future generations will look back with gratitude for all that we did to help protect and restore our forested lands.

"South Carolina Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 27,  Swales, like this one, were created throughout the wetland to hold water after a rain event, which in turn helps aid in flood storage, enhances plant diversity and provides habitat for wildlife. NRCS photo. A 53-acre conservation easement is an ideal environmental learning lab for students at Francis Hugh Wardlaw Academy in Johnston, South Carolina.  The land was once pastures for cattle, but now it’s a vibrant wetland just across the street from the high school. The contractor hired to install the restoration work, Charles Kemp, was instrumental in involving the school’s students in creating and managing the wetland. “These students are exploring what a career in agriculture or environmental science would be like, and they love being outside and escaping the confines of the classroom,” Kemp said. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service provided technical and financial assistance to develop the restoration plan, and install the structures and earthwork to convert the wet pasture into a functioning wetland. Kemp coordinated with the school’s football coach and director of the agricultural education program, Mark Rodgers, who incorporated the wetland restoration activities into a hands-on learning experience for his students. Several of the students, like senior Jacob Baynham, hope to make farming a career. He will graduate from Wardlaw Academy in a few weeks and will attend an agricultural college in Georgia. “When you plant something and watch it grow, you feel a sense of accomplishment, and conservation is so important when it comes to farming,” Baynham said. Rodgers started the agricultural program two years ago and has been thrilled with the interest and enthusiasm from the students. The students spend 3 to 4 days a week working at the wetland easement.  “I want to inspire these students to care about the environment,” he said. The area was once pastures for livestock. The landowner worked with NRCS through the former Wetlands Reserve Program to create the wetland. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals. It’s estimated that 87 percent of the wetland losses from the mid-s to the mid-s were because of conversion to farms and ranches. This program aims to restore wetlands in places where they’re best suited. “We traditionally restore altered or degraded floodplains and forested depressions back to wetlands, so converting this pastureland back to its original hydrologic state was unique,” said Sudie Daves-Thomas, a wildlife biologist with NRCS. When wetlands are drained or altered, this can create very uniform topography through land leveling or other agricultural activities. This wetland restoration plan called for macrotopographic features, which are wetland “ridge and swale” areas. These are areas that will hold water after a rain event, and they create a diversity of water features, which aid in flood storage, enhance plant diversity and provide important wildlife habitat. The students helped create this wetland by planting almost all of the plants there. The area is now teeming with amphibians, birds, beneficial insects and native vegetation. Many migratory birds stop at wetland areas on the way to their winter or summer homes, and more than one-third of the United States’ threatened and endangered species live only in wetlands. This South Carolina wetland is now home to shorebirds, songbirds, waterfowl, egrets and herons. Thanks to the dedication and vision of Kemp and Rodgers, these students are getting a unique educational experience by witnessing what happens when a wetland comes back to life. This May, NRCS is celebrating American Wetlands Month by sharing the stories of wetland restoration, like this one in South Carolina.

"Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Oct 21,  Almond growers are innovative in their water savings. This orchard uses micro-irrigation, which efficiently directs water. Photo courtesy of the Almond Board. It takes a lot of hard work to make a living out of farming, to build a thriving agricultural business and it takes ingenuity. This is especially true in rural America, where dedicated farmers and ranchers rely on each other and the communities around them to fuel innovation and create opportunity. From nutritional research to competitions that promote sustainability and continued environmental care, ag promotion programs—with oversight from USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)—help American farmers make long-term investments that ensure a better future for everyone. For more than 30 years, California almond growers have pooled their resources under the Almond Board, focusing on research and techniques to make the most of precious water resources.  Efficient water use and irrigation management are vital to the success of California’s Central Valley almond growers, ensuring that consumer demand for almonds can be met sustainably.  State-of-the-art farming and production developments over the past two decades have helped farmers reduce the amount of water they use per pound of almonds grown by 33 percent. Key strategies have included the wide adoption of micro-irrigation as well as advances in soil assessment and monitoring. Innovative use of wood products is beginning to change the face of construction, and USDA is doing its part to support these advancements. A new prize competition was launched earlier this month, challenging developers, institutions, organizations and design teams to demonstrate the architectural, structural and commercial viability of using sustainable wood products in tall-wood construction. USDA is investing up to $1 million in the competition and nonprofit partners—the Softwood Lumber Board and the Binational Softwood Lumber Council—have committed an additional $1 million.

Each year, the National Pork Board, along with its co-sponsor, National Hog Farmer magazine, highlights farms that represent environmental stewardship. Most of these stewards employ state-of-the-art technology and new approaches to pig farming, which have benefits for their surrounding communities as well.  The stewards are evaluated on manure management systems, water and soil conservation practices, odor-control strategies, farm aesthetics and neighbor relations, as well as wildlife habitat promotion. “Our environmental stewards clearly understand the role technology plays in a comprehensive approach to raising pigs,” said Lynn Harrison, chair of the selection committee. “It illustrates how bright ideas can become innovative solutions. From relying more on solar power to giving back to their communities, our stewards put their own stamp on raising high-quality pork for customers.” David and Sharon Stephens from Malta Bend, Missouri, Pork Industry Environmental Stewards.

The Hass Avocado Board also enlists the help of nutrition researchers to study the benefits of consuming avocados. Emerging research suggests that fresh Hass avocados may play a positive role in many areas including heart, eye, cognitive, digestive and cellular health. In particular, the research showed that having avocados with tomato sauce or raw carrots can help the body better use and absorb vitamin A. USDA is committed to working with ag promotion programs to keep America .  By pooling their resources and investing in research through these programs, farmers and ranchers are able to overcome challenges, find new markets for their products and develop innovative, sustainable solutions that bring positive change.

"Illinois Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 22,  The wetland in bloom with a more than 100-year-old oak tree standing prominently in the prairie. Natural Land Institute photo. Now, when you look at the Nygren Wetland Preserve in Illinois, a menagerie of wildlife can be seen –  ducks and geese paddling about, white pelicans lounging, otters swimming and a pair of sandhill cranes huddling in a nest. There was talk of the endangered blanding turtles living in the wetland, too. It’s a wonderful scene, but it was much different 14 years ago. The land, located along Raccoon Creek at the confluence of the Rock and Pecatonica rivers, was once forests and crops. The Natural Land Institute purchased the land in , and that’s when transformation began. The institute works to create an enduring legacy of natural land in northern Illinois for people, plants and animals. The wetland was made possible by the institute’s partnership with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, along with a trust given to the institute by the Nygren family. NRCS provided $1 million toward the purchase of the 655-acre easement from the land’s original owner. Flooded cropland that eventually became Nygren Wetland Preserve. Natural Land Institute photo. The land was enrolled in the former Wetlands Reserve Program, which provides financial assistance for restoring wetlands. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals. “NRCS assistance and countless other partners have helped with developing this property into what it is today and for the general public to enjoy on a daily basis,” said Josh Franks, NRCS district conservationist in Winnebago County, Ill. “I think we all should feel good about that.” The Nygren Wetland Preserve includes six types of plant communities, including wetlands, prairie and woodlands. Each requires specific management and maintenance that include re-seeding and prescribed burns. The burns reduce the unwanted plants and stimulate the native grasses. “It has been great working with the entire NLI staff at the Nygren WRP site,” Franks said. “They truly are great conservation stewards and protect the valuable natural resources in northern Illinois.” An extensive flood in caused reed canary grass to take over a portion of the wetland. Reed canary grass is an invasive species that will overtake native plants if not controlled. Kevin Rohling talks about the plants in the wetland with Josh Franks, NRCS district conservationist, and Ellen Starr, NRCS area biologist. NRCS photo. “We have an ongoing attempt to eradicate the invasive grass,” said Kevin Rohling, the institute’s stewardship director. The institute also has a reed canary grass experiment plot. “We are attempting to see if we can eradicate the grass without using herbicides,” Rohling said, saying they clip seed heads before seeds are naturally dispersed by the plant. The institute intends to restore the wetland with original grasses and forbs. “Seeds are collected on site, and if not available, we reach out to surrounding areas for those hard to find seeds,” Rohling said. Years ago, Raccoon Creek was straightened to improve farming activities. When deciding how to return the stream to its meandering state, it was discovered the old stream channel was still intact.  Dikes were placed to force the water back to the original channel. Three years later, a study on the meandering creek showed there was a 100 percent increase in fish species and 1,000 percent increase in fish abundance. Partnerships and volunteers have made this wetland what it is today and the volunteers are the heart of the preserve. The Nygren Wetland Preserve not only has tremendous volunteer support but is also located next to three forest preserves. The contiguous preserves provide a large nesting, breeding and flyway for birds, amphibians and mammals, not to mention the enjoyment and educational opportunities for local residents. As beautiful as it is today, the Nygren Wetland Preserve maintenance and support is ongoing. “We are currently assisting them with a restoration contract approved last year to manage 36 acres of reed canary grass and 156 acres of prescribed burning in and ,” Franks said. “They are always excited to try new things at the property and I anticipate us assisting when we are able to in the future.” White pelicans enjoy a rest before moving on to more northern nesting grounds.

"USDA Rural Development State Director for Maine in  Rural  Sep 12,  Partners gather with Andy and Valerie Cole to celebrate a grant the business received to install solar panels on the historic barn that has housed the family business for over a century. Andy and Valerie Cole are the husband and wife team who own Andy’s Agway in rural Dayton, Maine. It’s an impressive operation - in no small part because the Coles still run their agricultural business on the fundamental values their family began with over a century ago. Andy’s Agway started as a family farm purchased just after the Civil War. At first, the farm supplied only the Cole family but slowly it grew to provide for surrounding families, producing vegetables, hay, wood, and ice for nearby communities. In the s, the farm went into dairy production and provided milk deliveries to Biddeford and other towns in southern Maine. Andy Cole, Owner of Andy’s Agway, provides a tour of his business to Bette Brand, USDA Administrator for Rural Business and Cooperatives Service. During my visit to Andy’s Agway with USDA Administrator for Rural Business and Cooperatives Service Bette Brand, we got the opportunity to meet Andy and Valerie and watch them enthusiastically waiting on customers. Clearly these folks take both agriculture and customer service to heart, and it’s not surprising given that’s what they were raised on. Andy grew up on the family farm, studied Ag Mechanization in college, and began working as a management trainee for Agway as soon as he graduated. His wife Valerie owned horses and many other pets as a child, then studied Animal Science in college. The couple met while working at Agway and made agribusiness their life’s work when they opened the store in Dayton. The business recently received a Rural Energy for America Program Grant from USDA Rural Development to install a solar photovoltaic system nearby the barn that houses the store. This modern technology will help the business save money on energy. The solar panels will save $2,700 per year and generate nearly 29,000 kWh annually, replacing all of the energy needs for their business. Valerie said, “We feel very strongly about reducing our carbon footprint and using resources that are cleaner and greener.” Many things have changed at Andy’s Agway through the years - but not the values that make Andy’s Agway a staple to the local farming and agricultural community. Despite the present-day solar technology near the antique barn, the principles Andy’s Agway was established on generations ago have remained: Christian values, good work ethic, and a positive ‘help-your-neighbor’ attitude that is apparent in the day-to-day operations at the store. The Cole family has remained in agriculture throughout multiple generations because, according to Andy, “We want to help people realize the importance of agriculture, especially local agriculture. We enjoy helping people to be as self-sustaining as they want to be and we make it easy by delivering things right where people want them - whether it’s on the front porch, in the barn, or right on the edge of the garden.” It’s investment in rural small businesses and producers like the Cole family that helps our rural communities not only survive, but thrive – and when rural America thrives, all America thrives. Operations like Andy and Valerie’s Agway are the underpinnings of our nation’s economy, and I’m proud we could be a part of helping them grow.

"Illinois Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 28,  The South Branch Prairie shows vibrant native grasses two years after its restoration. DeKalb County Forest Preserve District photo. If the land floods more often than growing a crop, why not let it go back to what it wants to be – a wetland. That’s what happened on the Hoppe Heritage Farmstead in . The Hoppe sisters owned cropland along the southern branch of the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb County, Ill. About half of the land would flood on a regular basis. After several years of dealing with the floods, the sisters decided to do something about it. They sold the homestead to the DeKalb County Forest Preserve District, which preserves and restores landscapes and their plant and animal life. Terry Hannan, the forest preserve’s superintendent, contacted USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service about a conservation easement as a possible opportunity to improve the land. NRCS provides technical and financial assistance for wetland restoration projects like this one. The Hoppe sisters enrolled 55 acres land into the former Wetlands Reserve Program. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals. “This was a three way deal,” said Paul Searl, a district conservationist with NRCS. “We bought the easement from the sisters, and then they sold the land to the forest preserve. We started the process in early .” Before re-establishing the native plants, extensive research was done to ensure plant were accurate to pre-settlement conditions. Al Roloff, the forest preserve’s natural resources manager, used several reference books as well as records and observations of plant species that exist in local remnant plant communities. NRCS provided six-inch topographic measurements that made planting much easier. The map gives elevations of the land, enabling Roloff to select the proper plants for the soil type.  The lowest elevation, because of the standing water, was planted with root divisions, mud clumps and plugs. Later, when the area dried, he and volunteers scattered seeds by hand of bulrushes, other sedges and forbs. Roloff was excited by the rapid results of their restoration work. “The first year germination rates far surpassed my expectations,” he said. The main threat is the canary reed grass and some cattails, both invasive plants. “The main focus was the vegetation with a concern of invasive species,” Searl said. The tile that originally drained the field was brought to the surface with a riser. Now, instead of water leaving the fields through this drainage system, it holds water on the fields, helping in its transformation to a wetland. After just two growing seasons, the plantings have taken hold dramatically. “The diversity and density of plants has been amazing,” Roloff said. Including the prairie buffer, there are more than 100 different species located in this 55 acre plot. From to , a study was conducted on the mussel populations in the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb County, including the stretch of river that runs through South Branch Prairie and the connecting Russell Woods Preserve. Mussels are indicators of water quality because their survival rate is lowered when covered with sediment and pollutants. Wetlands improve water quality by filtering nutrients, pollutants and sediment and lead to other environmental benefits, including creating better habitat for mussels. “They found 14 species of mussels in large numbers, much large than anywhere else in the river,” Roloff said. “It is the most rich and diverse portion of the Kishwaukee River.” Roloff said these discoveries help highlight the important of wetlands on water quality. Through NRCS conservation easements, South Branch Prairie, added to the corridor of other existing forest preserves, wildlife has flourished with sightings of bald eagles, sandhill cranes and many different shorebirds. Diversity in plants benefits pollinators, protects the soil and improves water quality. “With the forest preserve and wetland collecting water runoff and filtering it before entering the river,” the water quality in this stretch of the river is the best in northern Illinois,” Searl said.

"Merrigan Meets Main Street in Momence, Illinois  This week, Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan toured the Main Street of Momence, Il, to view the positive growth made possible by USDA’s investments in rural revitalization. The community was decorated with corn stalks and fall mums to welcome Agriculture Deputy Secretary Merrigan to this town of 3,200 people, located 50 miles south of Chicago.  Merrigan and Momence residents enthusiastically toured several businesses that received financing thanks to a USDA Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG), administered by the USDA Rural Development agency.  Last year USDA provided a $99,000 grant to “Main Street Momence,” a preservation and volunteer based economic development program, to help them establish a revolving, low-interest loan fund.  The program is designed to help small businesses locate or remain in Momence’s historic downtown area. Thirteen months later, four businesses have taken advantage of the increased access to credit by taking out loans. As a result, these businesses have created 27 new full time jobs and saved another 21 in this past year alone.

"APHIS Public Affairs, Fort Collins, CO in  Animals  Plants  Mar 29,  Converting airport grasslands to biofuel, solar or wind production may not only provide more environmentally sound alternative energy sources, but also increase revenue for airports and reduce the local abundance of wildlife hazardous to aircraft. U. S. Department of Agriculture research is helping shed light on this promising concept. USDA photo by David Bergman. Most people are familiar with the weekly summer ritual of mowing the lawn.  At best, the smell of fresh cut grass is appealing, but often the task is considered time consuming, tiring and expensive.  What if your “lawn” was actually hundreds of acres in size, and how often you mowed it, what type of grass you had, and if you used pesticides greatly impacted the safety of nearby residents?  “Mowing the lawn” is just one of the tasks airport managers and biologists confront as they work to keep wildlife away from runways and aircraft. Currently, productive land use near airports is limited and keeping the land fallow is usually the norm.  What airport managers see as a cost of doing business, USDA researcher Dr. Travis DeVault sees as an opportunity. Since , DeVault and colleagues at the National Wildlife Research Center’s Sandusky, Ohio, field station, a part of the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, have partnered with Mississippi State University researchers to explore alternative uses for lands on and near airports with the goal of reducing wildlife hazards, while also providing a source of revenue for airports. In a recent study, DeVault and colleagues estimated that airport properties in the contiguous United States contain approximately 1,276 square miles of idle grasslands─an area larger than the state of Rhode Island.  In DeVault’s eyes, much of this land could potentially be converted to biofuel, solar or wind production. Researchers and airport biologists with the U. S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Wildlife Services program provides technical assistance to civil and military airports in an effort to reduce wildlife collisions with aircraft. Photo courtesy of USDA. “Though there’s a big push to increase renewable energy production in our country, land managers are cautious about the impacts that wind, solar and biofuel production may have on wildlife and conservation efforts,” notes DeVault.  “Why not locate alternative energy production on and near airports where wildlife presence is already discouraged?” Current research efforts are investigating wildlife use of solar arrays and biofuel crops, such as switchgrass and mixed warm-season grasses. “Our goal is to identify biofuel crops or other renewable energy sources that are undesirable habitats for wildlife hazardous to aviation.  Finding such land uses will not only help reduce wildlife collisions at airports but also promote renewable energy production in areas inappropriate for wildlife conservation.” For more information, please visit NWRC’s reducing wildlife hazards to aircraft project page.

The Wisconsin Chippewa Flowage Forest Legacy project was selected March 15 to receive a U.S. Forest Service Wings Across the Americas award for their efforts in wild-bird habitat management. Every year, the Forest Service recognizes outstanding work by partners and local Forest Service employees in conserving habitat for birds, bats and butterflies. This award highlights the outstanding partnership of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the Trust for Public Land, and the U.S. Forest Service for work in land stewardship and bird conservation in northwestern Wisconsin. The Chippewa Flowage Forest Legacy Program project links over 18,000 acres of resource-rich forest with nearly one million acres of protected forest lands on either side of the Chippewa Flowage Watershed. The program connects the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal land, protected county forest lands and state protected lands. This property is a critical piece of the forest puzzle in the Chippewa Flowage Watershed, the state’s third largest inland body of water, and a world-class fishery for muskellunge and walleye. A conservation easement on this site ensures continued unrestricted access to this Northwoods jewel. This project is located adjacent to the Upper Chippewa Conifer-Hardwood Forest Important Bird Area -- designated by the Audubon Society for providing essential habitat that contributes to the protection of bird populations and communities, including a heron rookery.  Endangered grey wolves are also known to frequent the property. By permanently protecting important forest habitat surrounding the Chippewa Flowage -- one of Wisconsin’s largest wilderness bodies of water -- important ecological, recreational, social, cultural and economic benefits have been preserved for future generations.

"South Carolina Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 27,  Swales, like this one, were created throughout the wetland to hold water after a rain event, which in turn helps aid in flood storage, enhances plant diversity and provides habitat for wildlife. NRCS photo. A 53-acre conservation easement is an ideal environmental learning lab for students at Francis Hugh Wardlaw Academy in Johnston, South Carolina.  The land was once pastures for cattle, but now it’s a vibrant wetland just across the street from the high school. The contractor hired to install the restoration work, Charles Kemp, was instrumental in involving the school’s students in creating and managing the wetland. “These students are exploring what a career in agriculture or environmental science would be like, and they love being outside and escaping the confines of the classroom,” Kemp said. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service provided technical and financial assistance to develop the restoration plan, and install the structures and earthwork to convert the wet pasture into a functioning wetland. Kemp coordinated with the school’s football coach and director of the agricultural education program, Mark Rodgers, who incorporated the wetland restoration activities into a hands-on learning experience for his students. Several of the students, like senior Jacob Baynham, hope to make farming a career. He will graduate from Wardlaw Academy in a few weeks and will attend an agricultural college in Georgia. “When you plant something and watch it grow, you feel a sense of accomplishment, and conservation is so important when it comes to farming,” Baynham said. Rodgers started the agricultural program two years ago and has been thrilled with the interest and enthusiasm from the students. The students spend 3 to 4 days a week working at the wetland easement.  “I want to inspire these students to care about the environment,” he said. The area was once pastures for livestock. The landowner worked with NRCS through the former Wetlands Reserve Program to create the wetland. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals. It’s estimated that 87 percent of the wetland losses from the mid-s to the mid-s were because of conversion to farms and ranches. This program aims to restore wetlands in places where they’re best suited. “We traditionally restore altered or degraded floodplains and forested depressions back to wetlands, so converting this pastureland back to its original hydrologic state was unique,” said Sudie Daves-Thomas, a wildlife biologist with NRCS. When wetlands are drained or altered, this can create very uniform topography through land leveling or other agricultural activities. This wetland restoration plan called for macrotopographic features, which are wetland “ridge and swale” areas. These are areas that will hold water after a rain event, and they create a diversity of water features, which aid in flood storage, enhance plant diversity and provide important wildlife habitat. The students helped create this wetland by planting almost all of the plants there. The area is now teeming with amphibians, birds, beneficial insects and native vegetation. Many migratory birds stop at wetland areas on the way to their winter or summer homes, and more than one-third of the United States’ threatened and endangered species live only in wetlands. This South Carolina wetland is now home to shorebirds, songbirds, waterfowl, egrets and herons. Thanks to the dedication and vision of Kemp and Rodgers, these students are getting a unique educational experience by witnessing what happens when a wetland comes back to life. This May, NRCS is celebrating American Wetlands Month by sharing the stories of wetland restoration, like this one in South Carolina.

"Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Oct 21,  Almond growers are innovative in their water savings. This orchard uses micro-irrigation, which efficiently directs water. Photo courtesy of the Almond Board. It takes a lot of hard work to make a living out of farming, to build a thriving agricultural business and it takes ingenuity. This is especially true in rural America, where dedicated farmers and ranchers rely on each other and the communities around them to fuel innovation and create opportunity. From nutritional research to competitions that promote sustainability and continued environmental care, ag promotion programs—with oversight from USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)—help American farmers make long-term investments that ensure a better future for everyone. For more than 30 years, California almond growers have pooled their resources under the Almond Board, focusing on research and techniques to make the most of precious water resources.  Efficient water use and irrigation management are vital to the success of California’s Central Valley almond growers, ensuring that consumer demand for almonds can be met sustainably.  State-of-the-art farming and production developments over the past two decades have helped farmers reduce the amount of water they use per pound of almonds grown by 33 percent. Key strategies have included the wide adoption of micro-irrigation as well as advances in soil assessment and monitoring. Innovative use of wood products is beginning to change the face of construction, and USDA is doing its part to support these advancements. A new prize competition was launched earlier this month, challenging developers, institutions, organizations and design teams to demonstrate the architectural, structural and commercial viability of using sustainable wood products in tall-wood construction. USDA is investing up to $1 million in the competition and nonprofit partners—the Softwood Lumber Board and the Binational Softwood Lumber Council—have committed an additional $1 million.

Natural Land Institute photo. Now, when you look at the Nygren Wetland Preserve in Illinois, a menagerie of wildlife can be seen –  ducks and geese paddling about, white pelicans lounging, otters swimming and a pair of sandhill cranes huddling in a nest. There was talk of the endangered blanding turtles living in the wetland, too. It’s a wonderful scene, but it was much different 14 years ago. The land, located along Raccoon Creek at the confluence of the Rock and Pecatonica rivers, was once forests and crops. The Natural Land Institute purchased the land in , and that’s when transformation began. The institute works to create an enduring legacy of natural land in northern Illinois for people, plants and animals. The wetland was made possible by the institute’s partnership with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, along with a trust given to the institute by the Nygren family. NRCS provided $1 million toward the purchase of the 655-acre easement from the land’s original owner. Flooded cropland that eventually became Nygren Wetland Preserve. Natural Land Institute photo. The land was enrolled in the former Wetlands Reserve Program, which provides financial assistance for restoring wetlands. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals. “NRCS assistance and countless other partners have helped with developing this property into what it is today and for the general public to enjoy on a daily basis,” said Josh Franks, NRCS district conservationist in Winnebago County, Ill. “I think we all should feel good about that.” The Nygren Wetland Preserve includes six types of plant communities, including wetlands, prairie and woodlands. Each requires specific management and maintenance that include re-seeding and prescribed burns. The burns reduce the unwanted plants and stimulate the native grasses. “It has been great working with the entire NLI staff at the Nygren WRP site,” Franks said. “They truly are great conservation stewards and protect the valuable natural resources in northern Illinois.” An extensive flood in caused reed canary grass to take over a portion of the wetland. Reed canary grass is an invasive species that will overtake native plants if not controlled. Kevin Rohling talks about the plants in the wetland with Josh Franks, NRCS district conservationist, and Ellen Starr, NRCS area biologist. NRCS photo. “We have an ongoing attempt to eradicate the invasive grass,” said Kevin Rohling, the institute’s stewardship director. The institute also has a reed canary grass experiment plot. “We are attempting to see if we can eradicate the grass without using herbicides,” Rohling said, saying they clip seed heads before seeds are naturally dispersed by the plant. The institute intends to restore the wetland with original grasses and forbs. “Seeds are collected on site, and if not available, we reach out to surrounding areas for those hard to find seeds,” Rohling said. Years ago, Raccoon Creek was straightened to improve farming activities. When deciding how to return the stream to its meandering state, it was discovered the old stream channel was still intact.  Dikes were placed to force the water back to the original channel. Three years later, a study on the meandering creek showed there was a 100 percent increase in fish species and 1,000 percent increase in fish abundance. Partnerships and volunteers have made this wetland what it is today and the volunteers are the heart of the preserve. The Nygren Wetland Preserve not only has tremendous volunteer support but is also located next to three forest preserves. The contiguous preserves provide a large nesting, breeding and flyway for birds, amphibians and mammals, not to mention the enjoyment and educational opportunities for local residents. As beautiful as it is today, the Nygren Wetland Preserve maintenance and support is ongoing. “We are currently assisting them with a restoration contract approved last year to manage 36 acres of reed canary grass and 156 acres of prescribed burning in and ,” Franks said. “They are always excited to try new things at the property and I anticipate us assisting when we are able to in the future.” White pelicans enjoy a rest before moving on to more northern nesting grounds.

"USDA Rural Development State Director for Maine in  Rural  Sep 12,  Partners gather with Andy and Valerie Cole to celebrate a grant the business received to install solar panels on the historic barn that has housed the family business for over a century. Andy and Valerie Cole are the husband and wife team who own Andy’s Agway in rural Dayton, Maine. It’s an impressive operation - in no small part because the Coles still run their agricultural business on the fundamental values their family began with over a century ago. Andy’s Agway started as a family farm purchased just after the Civil War. At first, the farm supplied only the Cole family but slowly it grew to provide for surrounding families, producing vegetables, hay, wood, and ice for nearby communities. In the s, the farm went into dairy production and provided milk deliveries to Biddeford and other towns in southern Maine. Andy Cole, Owner of Andy’s Agway, provides a tour of his business to Bette Brand, USDA Administrator for Rural Business and Cooperatives Service. During my visit to Andy’s Agway with USDA Administrator for Rural Business and Cooperatives Service Bette Brand, we got the opportunity to meet Andy and Valerie and watch them enthusiastically waiting on customers. Clearly these folks take both agriculture and customer service to heart, and it’s not surprising given that’s what they were raised on. Andy grew up on the family farm, studied Ag Mechanization in college, and began working as a management trainee for Agway as soon as he graduated. His wife Valerie owned horses and many other pets as a child, then studied Animal Science in college. The couple met while working at Agway and made agribusiness their life’s work when they opened the store in Dayton. The business recently received a Rural Energy for America Program Grant from USDA Rural Development to install a solar photovoltaic system nearby the barn that houses the store. This modern technology will help the business save money on energy. The solar panels will save $2,700 per year and generate nearly 29,000 kWh annually, replacing all of the energy needs for their business. Valerie said, “We feel very strongly about reducing our carbon footprint and using resources that are cleaner and greener.” Many things have changed at Andy’s Agway through the years - but not the values that make Andy’s Agway a staple to the local farming and agricultural community. Despite the present-day solar technology near the antique barn, the principles Andy’s Agway was established on generations ago have remained: Christian values, good work ethic, and a positive ‘help-your-neighbor’ attitude that is apparent in the day-to-day operations at the store. The Cole family has remained in agriculture throughout multiple generations because, according to Andy, “We want to help people realize the importance of agriculture, especially local agriculture. We enjoy helping people to be as self-sustaining as they want to be and we make it easy by delivering things right where people want them - whether it’s on the front porch, in the barn, or right on the edge of the garden.” It’s investment in rural small businesses and producers like the Cole family that helps our rural communities not only survive, but thrive – and when rural America thrives, all America thrives. Operations like Andy and Valerie’s Agway are the underpinnings of our nation’s economy, and I’m proud we could be a part of helping them grow.

"Illinois Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 28,  The South Branch Prairie shows vibrant native grasses two years after its restoration. DeKalb County Forest Preserve District photo. If the land floods more often than growing a crop, why not let it go back to what it wants to be – a wetland. That’s what happened on the Hoppe Heritage Farmstead in . The Hoppe sisters owned cropland along the southern branch of the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb County, Ill. About half of the land would flood on a regular basis. After several years of dealing with the floods, the sisters decided to do something about it. They sold the homestead to the DeKalb County Forest Preserve District, which preserves and restores landscapes and their plant and animal life. Terry Hannan, the forest preserve’s superintendent, contacted USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service about a conservation easement as a possible opportunity to improve the land. NRCS provides technical and financial assistance for wetland restoration projects like this one. The Hoppe sisters enrolled 55 acres land into the former Wetlands Reserve Program. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals. “This was a three way deal,” said Paul Searl, a district conservationist with NRCS. “We bought the easement from the sisters, and then they sold the land to the forest preserve. We started the process in early .” Before re-establishing the native plants, extensive research was done to ensure plant were accurate to pre-settlement conditions. Al Roloff, the forest preserve’s natural resources manager, used several reference books as well as records and observations of plant species that exist in local remnant plant communities. NRCS provided six-inch topographic measurements that made planting much easier. The map gives elevations of the land, enabling Roloff to select the proper plants for the soil type.  The lowest elevation, because of the standing water, was planted with root divisions, mud clumps and plugs. Later, when the area dried, he and volunteers scattered seeds by hand of bulrushes, other sedges and forbs. Roloff was excited by the rapid results of their restoration work. “The first year germination rates far surpassed my expectations,” he said. The main threat is the canary reed grass and some cattails, both invasive plants. “The main focus was the vegetation with a concern of invasive species,” Searl said. The tile that originally drained the field was brought to the surface with a riser. Now, instead of water leaving the fields through this drainage system, it holds water on the fields, helping in its transformation to a wetland. After just two growing seasons, the plantings have taken hold dramatically. “The diversity and density of plants has been amazing,” Roloff said. Including the prairie buffer, there are more than 100 different species located in this 55 acre plot. From to , a study was conducted on the mussel populations in the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb County, including the stretch of river that runs through South Branch Prairie and the connecting Russell Woods Preserve. Mussels are indicators of water quality because their survival rate is lowered when covered with sediment and pollutants. Wetlands improve water quality by filtering nutrients, pollutants and sediment and lead to other environmental benefits, including creating better habitat for mussels. “They found 14 species of mussels in large numbers, much large than anywhere else in the river,” Roloff said. “It is the most rich and diverse portion of the Kishwaukee River.” Roloff said these discoveries help highlight the important of wetlands on water quality. Through NRCS conservation easements, South Branch Prairie, added to the corridor of other existing forest preserves, wildlife has flourished with sightings of bald eagles, sandhill cranes and many different shorebirds. Diversity in plants benefits pollinators, protects the soil and improves water quality. “With the forest preserve and wetland collecting water runoff and filtering it before entering the river,” the water quality in this stretch of the river is the best in northern Illinois,” Searl said.

"Merrigan Meets Main Street in Momence, Illinois  This week, Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan toured the Main Street of Momence, Il, to view the positive growth made possible by USDA’s investments in rural revitalization. The community was decorated with corn stalks and fall mums to welcome Agriculture Deputy Secretary Merrigan to this town of 3,200 people, located 50 miles south of Chicago.  Merrigan and Momence residents enthusiastically toured several businesses that received financing thanks to a USDA Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG), administered by the USDA Rural Development agency.  Last year USDA provided a $99,000 grant to “Main Street Momence,” a preservation and volunteer based economic development program, to help them establish a revolving, low-interest loan fund.  The program is designed to help small businesses locate or remain in Momence’s historic downtown area. Thirteen months later, four businesses have taken advantage of the increased access to credit by taking out loans. As a result, these businesses have created 27 new full time jobs and saved another 21 in this past year alone.

"APHIS Public Affairs, Fort Collins, CO in  Animals  Plants  Mar 29,  Converting airport grasslands to biofuel, solar or wind production may not only provide more environmentally sound alternative energy sources, but also increase revenue for airports and reduce the local abundance of wildlife hazardous to aircraft. U. S. Department of Agriculture research is helping shed light on this promising concept. USDA photo by David Bergman. Most people are familiar with the weekly summer ritual of mowing the lawn.  At best, the smell of fresh cut grass is appealing, but often the task is considered time consuming, tiring and expensive.  What if your “lawn” was actually hundreds of acres in size, and how often you mowed it, what type of grass you had, and if you used pesticides greatly impacted the safety of nearby residents?  “Mowing the lawn” is just one of the tasks airport managers and biologists confront as they work to keep wildlife away from runways and aircraft. Currently, productive land use near airports is limited and keeping the land fallow is usually the norm.  What airport managers see as a cost of doing business, USDA researcher Dr. Travis DeVault sees as an opportunity. Since , DeVault and colleagues at the National Wildlife Research Center’s Sandusky, Ohio, field station, a part of the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, have partnered with Mississippi State University researchers to explore alternative uses for lands on and near airports with the goal of reducing wildlife hazards, while also providing a source of revenue for airports. In a recent study, DeVault and colleagues estimated that airport properties in the contiguous United States contain approximately 1,276 square miles of idle grasslands─an area larger than the state of Rhode Island.  In DeVault’s eyes, much of this land could potentially be converted to biofuel, solar or wind production. Researchers and airport biologists with the U. S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Wildlife Services program provides technical assistance to civil and military airports in an effort to reduce wildlife collisions with aircraft. Photo courtesy of USDA. “Though there’s a big push to increase renewable energy production in our country, land managers are cautious about the impacts that wind, solar and biofuel production may have on wildlife and conservation efforts,” notes DeVault.  “Why not locate alternative energy production on and near airports where wildlife presence is already discouraged?” Current research efforts are investigating wildlife use of solar arrays and biofuel crops, such as switchgrass and mixed warm-season grasses. “Our goal is to identify biofuel crops or other renewable energy sources that are undesirable habitats for wildlife hazardous to aviation.  Finding such land uses will not only help reduce wildlife collisions at airports but also promote renewable energy production in areas inappropriate for wildlife conservation.” For more information, please visit NWRC’s reducing wildlife hazards to aircraft project page.

The Wisconsin Chippewa Flowage Forest Legacy project was selected March 15 to receive a U.S. Forest Service Wings Across the Americas award for their efforts in wild-bird habitat management. Every year, the Forest Service recognizes outstanding work by partners and local Forest Service employees in conserving habitat for birds, bats and butterflies. This award highlights the outstanding partnership of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the Trust for Public Land, and the U.S. Forest Service for work in land stewardship and bird conservation in northwestern Wisconsin. The Chippewa Flowage Forest Legacy Program project links over 18,000 acres of resource-rich forest with nearly one million acres of protected forest lands on either side of the Chippewa Flowage Watershed. The program connects the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal land, protected county forest lands and state protected lands. This property is a critical piece of the forest puzzle in the Chippewa Flowage Watershed, the state’s third largest inland body of water, and a world-class fishery for muskellunge and walleye. A conservation easement on this site ensures continued unrestricted access to this Northwoods jewel. This project is located adjacent to the Upper Chippewa Conifer-Hardwood Forest Important Bird Area -- designated by the Audubon Society for providing essential habitat that contributes to the protection of bird populations and communities, including a heron rookery.  Endangered grey wolves are also known to frequent the property. By permanently protecting important forest habitat surrounding the Chippewa Flowage -- one of Wisconsin’s largest wilderness bodies of water -- important ecological, recreational, social, cultural and economic benefits have been preserved for future generations.

"Helping Ag Businesses Reflect on their Accomplishments and Look to the Future  Reflection, celebration, and ambition are hallmarks of entering a new year. We reflect on the challenges we faced, celebrate our accomplishments, and set goals for the future. For businesses, a common goal is finding new ways to satisfy ever-changing consumer demands. Our nation’s farmers and ranchers rely on research and promotion programs to help meet these demands, connecting consumers to their quality products. With a focus on highlighting quality products and building consumer trust, many research and promotion groups embarked on new initiatives and continued to expand on others in . Success for agricultural businesses often depends on their ability to provide consumers more information.

"Senior Technical Advisor, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  May 01,  Most Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants who can work already do. SNAP’s food assistance benefits are critical to helping these workers put food on the table as the jobs they hold often pay low wages, offer unreliable hours, and don’t provide benefits like paid sick leave. Reliable, high-quality work is a powerful way out of poverty, and USDA’s SNAP Employment and Training (SNAP E&T) helps gain professional skills and connections to better employment opportunities. While SNAP state agencies are responsible for operating SNAP E&T programs, they work closely with other partners who have expertise in building strong employment programs like the Department of Labor, local job centers, and SNAP E&T professionals. In , USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service awarded a SNAP E&T National Partnership Grant to the National Association of Workforce Boards (NAWB) to provide technical assistance to state and local workforce development boards, so they can become SNAP E&T providers. Since then, NAWB has continued its work to expand SNAP E&T’s footprint. We all have a shared goal of matching job seekers with sustainable employment opportunities, and it only makes sense to bring everyone’s strengths to the table.

"Public Affairs Branch Chief, USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Apr 27,  WIC is one of the most powerful, evidence-based public health programs, setting moms, babies, and young kids up to be healthy and thrive. The program is associated with incredible outcomes like improved diet quality, birth weights, and cognitive development, and reduced infant deaths, premature births, and health care costs. It’s no wonder more than six million women, infants, and children across America participate in the program. But still, that’s only about half of those who are eligible, which means millions are missing out on WIC’s proven benefits. (Check out our National and State Level Estimates of WIC Eligibility and Program Reach in webpage for really cool, interactive charts showing program eligibility and reach by age, race, gender, military status, and more.) WIC has the potential to help so many more. USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service is working hard to get more eligible families connected to WIC. One of the ways we’re doing that is by making it easier to enroll. We’re encouraging state agencies to continue allowing participants to enroll in and receive WIC benefits virtually as well as in-person. We’re also leveraging sharing across government programs to streamline WIC enrollment. In line with the Executive Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery and the Biden-Harris Administration National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, FNS is encouraging states to easily connect eligible moms and kids who already participate in programs like SNAP, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Medicaid with WIC benefits. As part of that effort, we’re investing in a cooperative agreement that will provide subgrants and support to WIC state agencies to expand the use of sharing to identify, refer, and enroll eligible participants. We encourage colleges, universities, and nonprofits to apply. USDA believes a healthier future starts with our children, and these steps will help give our nation’s youngest the best possible start through WIC.

"PhD, RDN, Director of Nutrition Security and Health Equity, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Jul 20,  Almost a year and a half ago, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack outlined USDA’s focus on nutrition security, which builds on food security by emphasizing the co-existence of food insecurity and diet-related diseases and disparities. Put simply, nutrition security means having consistent and equitable access to healthy, safe, affordable foods essential to optimal health and well-being. It’s my honor and privilege to join this effort as the second director of nutrition security and health equity at the Food and Nutrition Service within USDA and lead the department’s approach to advancing food and nutrition security. In this role, I will work to elevate the administration of USDA’s 16 nutrition assistance programs. These programs reach one in four Americans over the course of a year, and they are some of the most far-reaching, powerful tools in the federal government to help ensure that everyone — of all demographic groups and life stages—experiences nutrition security. Every day, USDA works hard (, 792 ) to connect nutritious foods to those most in need. Part of this work includes leveraging the momentum (, 10.0 ) of the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health and the corresponding National Strategy, which set ambitious goals to end hunger, improve nutrition and physical activity, and reduce diet-related diseases and disparities. We are also working to better integrate nutrition and health. Since hosting a National Summit this past fall, USDA has participated in three regional summits hosted by ProMedica and The Root Cause Coalition. We look forward to participating in their four remaining summits. We have learned so much about the power of integrating nutrition and health and the power of our partners in healthcare. I am excited to work across our department and with our partners in government, non-government organizations, and people working in communities across America to continue building awareness of our efforts and identify opportunities for collaboration. This work includes building new and enhancing collaborative activities with our National MyPlate Strategic Partners, SNAP-Ed implementing agencies, and everyone committed to advancing food and nutrition security. I know these programs are key ingredients to our work ahead. I know this firsthand through my experience as a community engaged researcher, like when a parent told me their child requested broccoli and kiwi after participating in our SNAP-Ed supported programming.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 12,  NRCS Chief Jason Weller (far right) completes his tour of acequias in New Mexico at the oldest continuously functioning acequia in the United States – the Acequia de Chamita, near Espanola, New Mexico – in operation since . With Chief Weller are (left to right) Gilbert Borrego, NRCS New Mexico Acequia Civil Engineering Technician; Kenny Salazar, President of the New Mexico Association of Conservation Districts; and Bren van Dyke, First Vice President of the National Association of Conservation Districts. Photo by Rey T. Adame. Last week, I visited with local communities in northern New Mexico. Many of these communities rely on irrigation ditches, called acequias, as their primary water source in an otherwise arid region. These are ditches that were used by their parents, and their grandparents, and their great-grand parents. Some acequias in the area date back more than 400 years. Through the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), NRCS is working with acequia communities and partners across the state of New Mexico to improve water quality, water quantity, and boost the overall health of these local irrigation ditches that so many rural American communities depend on. The Acequia San Rafael del Guique, for example, provides water for roughly 150 people in the Ohkay Owengeh and El Guique communities – it’s being revitalized as part of our RCPP project in the state. This is one of 115 conservation projects currently being funded by RCPP in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. Together, USDA investments and partner contributions have brought our total conservation investment through RCPP to almost $800 million – and we’re just getting started. Last week, Secretary Vilsack announced that the second round of RCPP funding is now available. A new bucket of $235 million will be put to work funding innovative new projects to benefit our soils, water, and wildlife. RCPP is an example of government working at its best. We’re empowering local communities and private landowners to take control and identify what the needs are in their backyards. We’re harnessing the power of public-private partnership – bringing in new partners, new resources and new ideas to the table, resulting in conservation outcomes that we never could have realized on our own. Just like the first round of RCPP, 25 percent of the funding will be awarded to state-level projects; 40 percent for multi-state and national projects; and 35 percent for projects in eight Critical Conservation Areas, including: the California Bay Delta; Chesapeake Bay Watershed; Colorado River Basin; Columbia River Basin; Great Lakes Region; Longleaf Pine Range; Mississippi River Basin; and the Prairie Grasslands. We’re looking for projects that deliver the most conservation for the tax payer dollar – and leverage additional financial and technical resources to get the job done. We’re looking for innovation. We’re looking for ideas that help producers boost their operations and mitigate threats, while meeting regulations and protecting the natural resources we all depend on. Seeing how our investments are changing lives for families in acequia communities in New Mexico and communities across the country pushes me to be a better public servant.  I’m grateful for these opportunities. I’m eager to see our current RCPP projects come to fruition and the new ideas coming to the table in the months ahead.

"Communications Director, USDA Office of Research, Education, and Economics in  Initiatives  May 06,  The USDA and the Council of Universities today renewed their memorandum of understanding that reaffirms and sustains the partnership between USDA and the historically black colleges created under the Second Morrill Act of for an additional five years. Dr. Juliette Bell, President of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore and Chair of the Council of Universities of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, signed the agreement with Secretary Vilsack. This year celebrates 125 years of the signing of the second Morrill Act, which led to the creation of 19 historically black land-grant colleges and universities. (USDA Photo by Bob Nichols)  Congress enacted the Second Morrill Act, creating a group of African-American land-grant universities, in the year .  Today – 125 years later – USDA maintains a close, supportive and cooperative relation with these 19 schools located in 18 states that are commonly known as “ Universities.”   This morning in a ceremony in his office, Secretary Vilsack signed an agreement extending USDA’s commitment to the Universities for another five years. Also signing the agreement was Dr. Juliette Bell, President of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES), acting on behalf of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities’ (APLU) Council of Universities.  Secretary Vilsack spoke of the importance of extending the partnership between these universities and USDA, saying it was “more important than ever to train the next generation of policy makers, researchers and educators in the food and agricultural sciences.” The legislation gave states funds to establish state universities for persons of color if race was an admissions factor at the existing state university. Over the years, these institutions have a track record of “serving the underserved” and “reaching the unreached.” Today, Universities are proud to remain the custodians of access to and opportunity for higher education in underserved communities. With today’s signing ceremony, USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) will continue to support internships, training, technical assistance, faculty exchange opportunities, increased mentoring and other collaborative environmental and public health activities. One example of this frequent collaboration can be seen this graduation season.  Secretary Vilsack gave the commencement address at Florida A&M University earlier this month.  Dr. Catherine Woteki, USDA’s Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics, also underscored the importance of Universities in a speech to UMES students celebrating National Day. “The institutions are places of cutting-edge research and technology, empowering many students to become the leaders we need to feed the growing world population,” Woteki said. “With the agricultural challenges looming over us all, it is crucial that we continue to revolutionize agriculture with groundbreaking ideas and build sustainable agricultural systems. “…The best investment we can make, then, is in the most valuable commodity we can cultivate – each of you – by supporting the next generation of food, ag and natural resource scientists and those dedicated to training them.” The complete text of Dr. Woteki’s speech can be found on the REE website.

"Forest Service Stream Technology Can Prevent Road and Bridge Washouts  Remember the devastating floods in Vermont – the worst in a century – that made national headlines late last August?  Hurricane Irene pounded Vermont and the Green Mountain National Forest and New Hampshire and the White Mountain National Forest with up to 12 inches of rain in less than a day.  Many communities were left reeling from the massive flood damage for weeks and months in post-storm recovery efforts. More than 500 road miles and 200 bridges and culverts were destroyed or damaged.  Communities were left stranded by the flood’s devastation of the transportation infrastructure.  Millions of dollars of property damage occurred.  Residents also suffered increased costs related to emergency service access, commuting time and lost tourism revenue.  Aquatic life was also harmed when heavy machinery cleared “debris” and reshaped rivers.

The opening marked completion of the 500th water and environmental project completed by USDA through the Recovery Act. USDA photo. USDA Rural Utilities Service Administrator John Padalino recently visited the 500th water and wastewater project completed under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of . ""The Recovery Act has brought improved water and wastewater services to nearly 1.7 million rural residents,” said the Administrator. Administrator Padalino made his remarks at the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority Treatment Plant in Arkansas. Most people in the U.S. take for granted the fact that safe drinking water is readily available for use by simply turning on a tap, or pushing a button on a fountain.  However, many rural communities within the U.S. must deal with negative impacts associated with contaminated water sources at their homes and schools. In fact, since the ’s there have been efforts to bring safe drinking water to Boone, Newton, and Searcy counties in Arkansas.  Groundwater in this region is often contaminated with naturally occurring random, radium, and fluoride, which water systems must address.   Contaminated ground water is unsafe and unfit for humans to use. USDA funding for the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority system is used to provide clean, safe water for over 20,000 residents and businesses. In addition to the USDA funding, the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission provided nearly $10 million for the project. Programs like the one which funded the Treatment Plant would not be available without a Food, Farm and Jobs Bill. Rural areas need safe and reliable water for the health of their communities and sustainable economic growth. Since the start of the Obama Administration, USDA has invested more than $218 million, in over 100 water and wastewater programs in rural Arkansas alone.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Sep 09,  A surreal blend of harkens at winter yet provides peaceful warmth to fall on the Nez Perce National Forest in Idaho. While some may feel fall signals the end of summer, others see it as the beginning of the rebirth of spring. (U.S. Forest Service) What to see, when to see it, and where to see it is what the U.S. Forest Service Fall web pages are all about — making the of fall that much easier to find, appreciate and understand. The glorious that come with autumn across our nation should not be missed. From New Hampshire to Arkansas and from Alaska to Virginia, and nearly every state in between, the changing shades of leaves from green to brilliant reds, vibrant oranges and golden yellows is a must see. Fall leaves contrast with the marble stairs on the World War I Memorial in Washington, D.C. Urban forests also offer a plethora of as the season changes. (Courtesy Robert Westover) Every year the Forest Service updates and improves upon its Fall web pages and this year is no different. Aside from the popular standbys like our toll-free Fall Hotline that lets you listen to which forests and grasslands are peaking, and an interactive map that lets you click on the forest nearest you, we’ve added a map that will show you when the leaves are peaking in your state. The new leaf peaking map is pretty simple to figure out. It’s color coded so green is for no change, red means leaves are peaking and brown lets you know the color is basically gone and winter is on its way. Cities are also festooned with in fall as well. The Forest Service works with many municipalities across the country to help keep what we call urban forests healthy. These oases of nature in the middle of the hustle and bustle of city living are particularly stunning as the leaves of thousands of trees begin to change, set against the backdrop of mirrored skyscrapers, manicured parks and street lamp-lined roads. The Forest Service also manages millions of acres of grasslands throughout the mid-section of the country from Texas to North Dakota. Seeing the tall grasses and wildflowers of fall is yet another natural beauty to behold. So let the Forest Service help you plan your Fall adventure! Amongst the falling leaves, you might discover the frost flowers of dittany (Cunila origanoides). Its former light blue flowers have come and gone, its seed cast to the wind, but from the base of their stems you may be lucky enough to see what looks like curling ribbons of ice-- one last gem of their blooming glory-- a frost flower.

"Under Secretary of Agriculture for Natural Resources and the Environment and Anne Castle, Assistant Secretary for Water & Science at the Department of the Interior in  Forestry  Sep 12,   Cross posted from the White House Council on Environmental Quality blog: Americans know the importance of forests to our communities and our economy.  They provide jobs and recreational opportunities, filter our air and water, and make up essential habitat for wildlife and natural resources.  But increasingly, we’re also recognizing that forests play an important role in mitigating climate change. Recently, President Obama announced a Climate Action Plan to reduce carbon pollution, prepare for the impacts of climate change on our communities and economy, and lead international efforts to combat global climate change. This plan recognizes that America’s forests play a critical role in addressing carbon pollution, absorbing as much as 14 percent of our country’s greenhouse gas emissions each year.  Over the last several decades, forest regrowth on former farm lands, reforestation, and maturing forests have kept our forest growth rates high, helping us absorb even more carbon. At the same time, development of forest lands is reducing the amount of carbon we can absorb now and in the future.  Carbon pollution is also taking a toll on our forests – heat waves, wildfires, pests and drought are all worsened by climate change, reducing our forests’ ability to sequester carbon. It is difficult to predict precisely how much these impacts will reduce the potential of our forests to combat climate change – but we do know that we must start now to find new ways to enhance forests’ ability to absorb carbon and become more resilient. As part of the President’s Climate Action Plan, the Administration is bringing Federal agencies together to tackle this challenge.  An interagency Task Force is working to provide more accurate and consistent annual updates of carbon fluxes from forests and other lands.  This will help us ensure that we have up-to-date information on how major disturbances like wildfires, as well as land development trends, impact the capacity of the nation’s forests to absorb carbon. It will also provide the tools we need to make more effective policy decisions, ensuring land managers are able to take into account the carbon sequestration value of our forests.   The Task Force is also developing new approaches to retain and restore our forests and other important landscapes like grasslands and wetlands. This initiative will build on the significant work the Administration already has underway to ensure healthy, thriving forests. For example, the Department of Agriculture announced this year the creation of seven new regional hubs to provide research and timely information to farmers and forest landowners as we work together to combat climate change. This work will complement research by DOI Climate Science Centers, in areas such as evaluating management options, projecting forest conditions and carbon storage under climate change, evaluating the effects of changing rainfall and snow conditions, and studying the effects of changing forests on particular species and ecosystem services. This information is helping to inform restoration efforts undertaken by the Forest Service and its partners to make our forests more resilient. And DOI and USDA are working together with other Federal agencies, states, tribes, and private landowners to engage in historic, landscape scale conservation projects that will put critical ecosystems on a stronger footing for the future. Climate change poses a tough new challenge for the forest ecosystems that provide so much for all Americans. Following President Obama’s lead, we’re getting ahead of the game – focusing on new partnerships, strengthening interagency collaboration, and ensuring that the best science is available as we take on climate change in the years to come.

"An Explanation of Green Jobs Policies, Theory, Measurement Approaches, and Job Growth Expectations  A new white paper titled An Explanation of Green Jobs Policies, Theory, Measurement Approaches, and Job Growth Expectations was written by Iowa State University through a cooperative agreement with USDA’s Office of Energy Policy and New Uses.  The authors explore policy, theoretical foundations, and the approaches to measuring green jobs in the United States.  The paper contains brief descriptions of national and state initiatives to quantify green jobs, as well as their potential for growth.  The study finds there is little academic research that conceptualizes the green economy.  Regional research to assist state and local policy development is needed, along with evaluations investigating offsetting job losses. There are currently twin public policy focuses regarding green jobs.  The first concerns imply value of the activity; namely, the ability to conserve energy and other natural resources as well as reduce pollution.  The second focus is the job producing value.  While most people agree that the environmentally beneficial goals of policy developments are essential, the job creation goals are foremost in most policymakers’ minds.

"US Forest Service Office of Communication in  Forestry  Mar 02,  The legacy of the Weeks Act is shown by looking at photos of the White Mountain National Forest a century apart. Nearly a 100 years later after being decimated by logging, this photo depicts a healthy restored forest at the same location.  The Weeks Act, which went into effect on March 1, , has been identified as one of the most important pieces of environmental legislation in American history. In the early s the public began to embrace a more proactive attitude toward conserving public lands. Just the year before, in , Gifford Pinchot started the Forest Service. Before the Weeks Act, lands set aside for conservation were all located in the West and were created from large blocks of land in the public domain. Millions of acres of bare, eroded lands dotted the Eastern states from cut-over and farmed-out lands. In the West, the epic wildfires of fueled support for the Act. The most poignant element of the Act was that it gave the federal government authority to buy private lands in the East to establish publicly-owned forests. This provided both immediate and long-term benefits: the immediate protection of eastern watersheds from further development; the creation of a long-term effort to restore forests on public lands; and the beginning of new federal-state cooperative partnership responsibilities to protect these lands from intense and damaging wildfires. The Act’s natural resource conservation success has been profound: it designated 52 national forests in 26 Eastern states and mandated conservation ethics on some 20 million acres of national forests and grasslands across 41 states and Puerto Rico. Today, 80% of the 155 national forests are comprised of lands acquired through the Weeks Act, sustainably managed for a wide variety of conservation purposes. The impact of the Weeks Act is still strong today. America relies on the treasures their forests provide, including clean water, wildlife habitat, recreation, forest products, and a wide range of goods and services. The conservation successes of historic partnerships that created many of our beautiful national forests are an integral part of how the Forest Service continues to do business. The Act has a rich legacy, and the Forest Service remains committed to the tenets of its conservation core and values. The results of the Act support local economies and communities and broad tourism and recreation business sectors, and will extend our natural resource heritage far into the next 100 years.

Another app maps out all the fire hydrants in Boston, so volunteers can dig them out after a snowstorm. But, more can be done. According to Ann Mills, USDA Deputy Under Secretary of Natural Resources and Environment, “Open and the innovation it supports is essential to supporting 21st century disaster preparedness and planning in a climate changing world.” The USDA Open submission for this quarter concentrated on Disaster Relief . Seventy-four datasets were collected that related to disasters of all kinds.  It is USDA’s goal that the will be used to spur development of the tools necessary which would assist those needing help or those responding to help. We encourage you to use the USDA open sets to create solutions for communities. These datasets could give populations the ability to access the necessary resources in order to be better prepared for a disaster as well as promote economic recovery after one occurs.  Importantly, these resources also could help communities better prepare for future drought and other extreme weather events, and reduce their impact on livelihoods and their economy. We don’t know when the next disaster will strike, but we believe the open- movement is beginning to make government work better, save money and increase transparency. Both the private and public sectors need to step up and make comprehensive disaster preparedness technology a priority.

"Archaeological Heritage of Colorado's Ute Tribe Part of National Forests' History in Rocky Mountain Region  There are small piles of fallen wooden timbers on national forests in the Rocky Mountain Region that tell a story of the area’s past. They are part of aboriginal wooden structures known as wickiups, a conical-shaped dwelling used by native people. These relics are known to be part of the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe of southwestern Colorado and are still in use for ceremonial purposes. The relics are part of the tribe’s legacy of living on these lands and are a part of the cultural history on the Grand Mesa - Uncompahgre – Gunnison, San Juan, White River and Rio Grande national forests.

"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication in  Conservation  Forestry  Nov 15,  Visitor Map screenshot shows a sampling of Yonder images from national forests and grasslands throughout the country. (U.S. Forest Service.) There are few better ways to plan your get away on a national forests or grasslands than to use the Forest Service’s online Visitor Map. With thousands of recreation areas, roads and an increasing number of trail systems, you can digitally explore and plan your next adventure from home before you even hit the road.  With recently updated features, finding the perfect forest or grassland location is easier than ever.  And it’s as easy to use. For instance, when the online visitor’s map first displays, an area called Explore is shown where you can select one of six items from its menu, with camping or hiking being the most popular. But selecting any of these items brings up clusters where these activities exist and by clicking each cluster, you can further zoom into the map as far as you’d like. The site has additional features that the Forest Service thinks you’ll really enjoy. First, you can share your outdoor experiences with us or anyone else for that matter on a social media app called Yonder.   The creators of Yonder describe the app as a “…purpose-built for sharing your camping vista, red point, single-track descent, pow shot, or dawn patrol adventure with a community that’s just as psyched about the outdoors as you are.“   We agree. So, when you’re out exploring on your public lands, we really encourage you to share your photos and videos! Just remember, reservations are at many campgrounds, so a link is provided in the info window where the reservation can be made at recreation.gov. Another cool feature allows Forest Service twitter content to be geo-located on the Visitor Map. Geo-location helps us get important messages out to you. So, don’t forget to look for our Tweets on the map near the areas that interested you. Visitor Map screenshot shows the number of camping opportunities throughout the Northwest.

"USDA Supports Rural Small Business in Missouri  In Fulton, Missouri lies a hidden gem, a meat-lover’s dream to say the least. Starting out as a small processing center, the Brinker family expanded their business, Central Missouri Meat and Sausage, into a retail store and food court. Filled with the aroma of smoked pork, tender beef and a large assortment of specialty sausages, this small business is making a big impact on the central Missouri meat market. Co-owner Kenny Brinker says what makes them stand out from their competitors is their local approach and the fact that all the meat is processed and packaged on-site in their processing center.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Nov 20,  Digital maps available for your smart phone will help visitors find their way around U.S. Forest Service forests and grasslands. Scaling a mountain or hiking across a meadow is a peaceful, exhilarating exploration – unless you don’t know which fork in the trail to take. It used to mean taking out a folded map, holding onto it tightly so the wind won’t blow it away or trying to shelter it from raindrops. Now dealing with a map may be faster, easier and more convenient by opening your smart device and using a U.S. Forest Service digital map you downloaded for free or for a nominal fee. “In many areas of our national forests or grasslands, internet connections are just not available,” said Joan Steber, a cartographer who worked on the digital map project. “The free app and static maps will help because the user downloads the maps to their Apple or Android device before heading to a national forest or grassland.” The Forest Service maps are available through the Maps Mobile App developed by Avenza Systems Inc. The geospatial maps allow you to use the information without the need to be connected to a live network. Users can measure distance and area, find coordinates, zoom, plot marks, save place marks and add labels and other convenient ways to customize for your own experience. The app is available for free through iTunes and the Android Play Store. The app provides access to Forest Service maps, such as motor vehicle use maps, which are free while national forest atlases are 99 cents and forest visitor maps are $4.99. Prices are pending for other agency maps. The maps are geo-referenced with the user’s location appearing as a blue dot. The app works on iPhones and iPads with WiFi+3G. It also works with Android 4 or newer operating systems on devices with at least 1 gigabyte of memory. “Through our web surveys, we know visitors want this type of information, and they want it mobile,” Steber said. “We have worked to offer them a product they can use easily.” Digital maps showing U.S. Forest Service lands are available for your smart device and will augment age-old tools like your compass.

White was named an Honorary Forest Ranger in a ceremony at the Kennedy Center for the performing Arts in Washington DC November 9. (US Forest Service photo by Karl Perry)  It isn’t part of the agency’s mission statement to make childhood dreams come true – but it became our privilege today at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC. U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell had the honor of making a childhood dream come true for actress Betty White. As a child, White explained in a recent interview, she had always wanted to be a forest ranger. ‘Back then they didn’t let girls do that sort of thing’ she commented. Today White received a special plaque, a Forest Service badge and special Ranger’s Stetson from Chief Tidwell. “I am sorry you couldn’t join us before,” Tidwell remarked. “Judging from your illustrious career, you would have made marvelous contributions to our agency and to the cause of conservation across the United States,” he said. “Betty, you are a role model for little girls – for all of us – never to give up on our dreams.” With an engaging smile and a tear in her eye White expressed her appreciation for the honor, and her personal conviction and enthusiasm toward conservation. “I cannot thank you enough.” She began. “Whether I’ve been a legitimate forest ranger, or not, I’ve been working for the (conservation) cause for the last 89 years,” she laughed. “And I will continue to work for it as much as I can.” White added, “In my heart I've been a forest ranger all my life, but now I'm official."" The actress shared that some of her first memories as a child are riding into the High Sierras in front of her father on horseback. They would stay for three weeks and never see ""another two-legged soul,"" she joked. White concluded her remarks by saying, “As excited as I am today, as grateful as I am – I know two people who would be over the moon – my mom and dad.” For the record, the first women employed by the Forest Service as a lookout was Hallie M. Daggett, who started work at Eddy's Gulch Lookout Station atop Klamath Peak on the Klamath National Forest, in the summer of . But it would be more than 40 years before the agency hired its first woman forester, Joanne G. McElfresh, in . She worked on the Deerlodge National Forest (now the Beaverhead-Deerlodge) in Montana. More than 20 years later the first woman took the reins of a District Office when Wendy Milner Herrett was selected to lead the Blanco Ranger District on the White River National Forest. In the agency named its first woman Chief Forester when Gail Kimbell was selected to head the organization. The Forest Service has become more effective, efficient, open and proactive in its role of managing the nation’s forests and grasslands for current and future generations. Women have made great contributions to and fulfill vital roles in the agency’s success. Making dreams come true may not be a written part of the Forest Service’s mission. But the results of the agency’s conservation and management efforts – and the contributions of the men and women of the Forest Service – provide the background and potential for many dreams to come true.

On the grounds of Valley Hi-North Laguna Library in Sacramento, California, upwards of 150 children participated in the California Summer Meals kickoff event hosted by the California Summer Meal Coalition, Sacramento Public Library, and the Elk Grove Unified School District.  USDA’s Summer Food Service Program offers free meals during summer break so kids are better fueled with healthy food to learn and grow all year long. Though the weather approached 100 degrees, the children were not deterred from learning about the importance of healthy meals during the summer months at this event. Across the spacious summer food program kick-off site, children clutched their fresh fruit smoothies created by a blender which was powered by a stationary bicycle.  They also enjoyed a face painting station, a hula-hoop station, bean bag contests, and an FNS trivia game. Holly Prestegaard, Program Specialist of the Western Regional Office of USDA Food and Nutrition Service, with children at the Valley Hi-North Laguna Library in Sacramento, CA. For the parents in attendance, this kick off was just the start.  They are now equipped with information to ensure that their children will have an opportunity to eat nutritious meals this summer. Access to nutritious meals during the months when children are not in school and do not receive a school breakfast or lunch helps them stay both healthy and educationally sharp. That’s why it’s so important that we continue to feed kids during the summer. Food and nutrition partners in California understand that closing the summer meals gap is a team effort.  The collaboration between the California Library Association and California Summer Meal Coalition, in partnership with the Food and Nutrition Service and the California Department of Education raised awareness among families in Sacramento – and across the state – about free, healthy lunches available through the USDA summer meals program.

"FNS Southwest Regional Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 07,   The No Kid Hungry New Mexico Campaign, an initiative of the New Mexico Collaboration to End Hunger, is gaining partners and momentum.  The campaign is less than a year old, but already progress has been made on the goals: Increasing participation in the summer meals program, school breakfast, and SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.  It’s so important to connect eligible people with the federal nutrition safety net.  And that is exactly what Share Our Strength and its partners are doing in New Mexico and across the nation to end childhood hunger. Part of the No Kid Hungry New Mexico campaign centers on school breakfast, an area of special interest to me. I can see the potential to reach more children just by changing the way breakfast is offered to students. A healthy breakfast makes a big impact on a child’s well being – physically and mentally.  That translates to better attentiveness, performance and behavior in school, too.   This method also eliminates the stigma for low-income children of coming to school early for a free breakfast in the cafeteria. And many children simply can’t get to school before the first bell. Southwest Regional Administrator Bill Ludwig speaks to school superintendents and food service directors about expanding school breakfast at the New Mexico School Breakfast Summit in Albuquerque on Nov. 15.  Part of the No Kid Hungry New Mexico plan includes implementation of alternate service models for school breakfast in high poverty counties.  As part of training and outreach to schools, the New Mexico Collaboration to End Hunger hosted the New Mexico School Breakfast Summit on Nov.  15.

I was happy to be a part of the summit and to tell the story of how breakfast in the classroom is already increasing participation in large and small school districts in Texas and Arkansas. Summit sessions included the role of school breakfast in reducing child hunger, alternative breakfast models, tools to facilitate breakfast expansion and lessons learned from successful programs in New Mexico.

"Public Affairs Staff Officer, Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forests in  Forestry  Feb 22,  Trail users of all types take part in a Trails 101 course offered through CoTrails in January on the Anna Ruby Falls trail. One of the goals of CoTrails is to educate and engage a robust volunteer force to assist with trail maintenance and planning efforts. Photo credit: USDA Forest Service/Judy Toppins The Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forests in Georgia receive 2.2 million visitors each year, and their primary activity is use of 850 miles of designated system trails. But it’s not only hikers that take advantage of the recreation opportunities which these trails provide. Cyclists, hunters, anglers, off-highway vehicle enthusiasts and horseback riders all recreate on national forest trails-- and they don’t always see eye-to-eye. One year ago, the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest embarked on a unique collaborative effort to bring these trail users together to help identify and maintain a diverse, quality trail system on Georgia’s national forests.  By working together with all trail users, the Forest Service created an opportunity to seek new ways to deal with the ever-increasing use of trails, public demand for more trails, limited agency resources to properly maintain existing trails, and potential competition among different trail users. The forests first began the Collaborative Trails Initiative, or “CoTrails,” by hosting a series of meetings in forest communities. How could all trail users work together and with the Forest Service to address shared concerns and find solutions?  More than 350 people attended those meetings. A core group of more than 40 volunteers coalesced to see the effort through the planning stage. The result is a five-part strategic plan launched in January that the Forest Service and an ever-growing number of CoTrails volunteers are beginning to implement. Trail users of all types take part in a Trails 101 course offered through CoTrails in January on the Anna Ruby Falls trail. One of the goals of CoTrails is to educate and engage a robust volunteer force to assist with trail maintenance and planning efforts. Photo credit: USDA Forest Service/Judy Toppins The CoTrails Strategic Plan outlines five objectives. They include engaging volunteers, inventorying and assessing existing trails, creating a forest-wide interactive online map of the trail system and identifying unauthorized trails and opportunities to incorporate new system trails on the national forests. A professional assessment of 200 miles of trails is already underway, and thousands of volunteer hours have already been invested. The far-reaching influence of this effort will benefit more than just trail users by offering a more satisfying recreation experience.

"Intermountain Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Dec 06,  The tranquility of winter camping is ideal at the Grizzly Ridge yurt on the Ashley National Forest in Utah. Numerous hiking, biking and off-road trails crisscross the area. (U.S. Forest Service) While some may close up tents and winterize recreational vehicles this time of year, there are others who look forward to a winter filled with adventures on forests and grasslands. The draw is yurts and historic cabins available to rent that offer a bit of solitude for camping, a dose of adventure on skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles, and a lifetime of memories. A yurt is a circular tent with canvas walls. There are many different styles and sizes of yurts, but generally each yurt is different in what it offers. Typically, you can expect to provide your own bedding, food, and cooking supplies. Some include beds, tables and chairs. Others have camp stoves and wood burning stoves. Check information on Recreation.gov before making your reservation and committing to a stay. Last year, Johanne Tuttle and her friends chose the Grizzly Ridge yurt on the Ashley National Forest in Utah. After skiing three miles to reach the yurt, they found it had a wood-burning stove to keep warm when they finished cross-country skiing or sledding down a small hill. Inside, they could relax, play cards and cook their meals. “We were actually really surprised to get up here and see how spacious the yurt is. It’s really spacious, big huge bunk beds, double sized, so you can easily fit two people on one bed,” Tuttle said. “It’s bigger than any yurt I've ever been in and plenty of room to move around and stretch out.” Tuttle’s group stayed for several days, packing in everything they needed and adhering to outdoor ethics and packing out their trash and leaving the yurt ready for the next campers. Jamie Tyson, Johanne Tuttle, Charity Parks and Chris Berry dine on a meal they cooked in the Grizzly Ridge yurt on the Ashley National Forest in Utah. The yurt comes with bare-bones cooking utensils. (U.S. Forest Service) Staying in a yurt or cabin is easy to do depending on the location of the cabin and whether use is seasonal or year-round. All reservations are made through Recreation.gov. However, most facilities are locked and can be accessed only after contacting the forest or grassland office. And as with any outdoor recreation adventure, preparation is key no matter which season you choose. Be sure you have the appropriate clothing, supplies and a local area map before you head out. The Forest Service offers paper maps for sale and digital maps for iOS and Android smart devices. Still not sure you want to stay in a yurt? To learn more about unique camping experiences on the Ashley National Forest, watch videos on the Grizzly Ridge yurt; Trout Creek Guard Station; and the Carter Military Yurt. Johanne Tuttle, Jamie Tyson, Charity Parks and Chris Berry head out for cross-country skiing after checking into the Grizzly Ridge Yurt on the Ashley National Forest in Utah. The primitive camping site is open year-round but many people are drawn to it for its feeling of isolation and for the cross-country and snowshoeing trails.

It goes without saying a successful statistician must have strong math, analytical and technical skills. You might be surprised to learn, then, just how much of my time is dedicated to listening to and talking with people. To be sure, I still use math and science daily. Two decades into my career, however, it’s those intentional, important interactions with farmers who answer my agency’s requests for information, as well with those who use my agency’s , researchers, analysts and farmers themselves that keep me busiest. Why? Because NASS is the “go to” source for official government statistics on U.S. agricultural production, economics, land, water, energy, environmental management and farmer demographics. Part of my job includes making sure farmers want to respond to our surveys and censuses and that researchers choose to use our because it is the most accurate and unbiased. I’m the grandson of a cattle rancher so intrepid that even after my then seventy-something year-old grandfather was kicked by a horse, he continued to ranch. I like to think I’ve inherited that tenacious nature and apply it to everything I do, even building awareness of the relevance of agricultural statistics. I do this by engaging with people at expos, trade shows, and one-on-one meetings. Somewhere between admiring the butter sculpture, checking out the latest equipment, vehicles, livestock, research, technology and trends, people stop in the NASS booth and we chat. I have found that farmers respond to my agency’s requests for information when they understand how official government statistics help them manage risks, conserve natural resources and promote a healthy agricultural production and marketing system in which they benefit. I spend a good bit of time meeting with farmers at farm shows, agricultural conferences and even at their operations. I also serve as presenter, moderator and panelist at agricultural symposiums and meet with stakeholders at multidisciplinary meetings. I do this to better understand what is happening in American agriculture, what matters to people who rely on agriculture and how my agency can provide the needed to help make sure American agriculture remains healthy and prosperous. Each time I meet with a new producer; a new user, I feel the satisfaction that comes from working at a job I sincerely enjoy.

"Associate Administrator, NASS in  Research and Science  Trade  May 17,  Trucks deliver soybeans for inspection and purchase, then the soybeans are loaded onto barges for shipment to New Orleans and overseas customers. The USDA NASS June Grain Stocks report will indicate how much grain is in storage as of June ates while the June Acreage report reflects farmer-reported principal crop acreage planted as of June 1, valuable supply insights for domestic and world markets. USDA photo by Lance Cheung. With May being World Trade Month, it is worth noting that the source of to determine the U.S. supply of crops and livestock is America’s farmers and ranchers who fill out surveys from USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). These statistics feed directly into the monthly World Supply and Demand Estimates report (WASDE), which shows how much food, feed, fuel, and fiber are available or expected to be available around the world throughout the year. These are available free of charge to anyone who wants them and are widely regarded as the gold standard. Did you know that during the / growing season, farmers and ranchers across the United States produced an estimated 47.4 million metric tons of the world’s estimated 758.4 million metric tons of wheat, according to the May 10, WASDE report? The same report forecasts world wheat production for the / growing season to be 747.8 million metric tons – 10.6 million metric tons less than last year, of which 49.6 million metric tons is forecast to be U.S. production. NASS collects and these U.S. , and those for dozens of other agricultural products, every month with information gathered directly from farmers and ranchers. Additional information is collected and reported every quarter. A series of each year – March Prospective Plantings, June Acreage, September Small Grains Summary, and the January Annual Crop Production , along with Grain Stocks – give important insights into U.S. crop supply at telling points during the year. Currently, NASS is conducting the June Agricultural and Grain Stocks surveys and asking more than 100,000 farmers, ranchers, and grain storage operators to report actual planted acreage and stocks for use in determining domestic consumption and trade. Survey , combined with information from geospatial, field level yield surveys, weather, and other sources, form the final NASS estimates. In addition to producing high quality statistics about U.S. agriculture, NASS has been helping to establish and improve agricultural statistics systems in countries around the world since the end of World War II. Food insecurity, shortfalls in regional food production, and lack of reliable information on the agricultural sector are major concerns in many countries. Improved agricultural systems can provide more and better information to address these issues. NASS specialists provide technical assistance and training on a reimbursable basis in all aspects of statistical surveys and systems. The benefits of such assistance and resulting stronger, consistent statistical organizations extend beyond serving the interests of the various countries. By helping other countries improve their agricultural statistics systems, USDA’s ability to assess world food and fiber production is also improved.

"Census and Survey Division Director, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Farming  Mar 22,  Keep celebrating National Ag Day by getting ready for the Census of Agriculture and make your voice heard! In just a few months, America’s farmers and ranchers will have the opportunity to strongly represent agriculture in their communities and industry by taking part in the Census of Ag. This National Ag Day, we are sharing the three things you can do now to help us in this tremendous endeavor. Only conducted every five years by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), the census captures a complete count of all U.S. farms, ranches, and those who operate them.  Even small plots of land – whether rural or urban – growing fruit, vegetables or some food animals count if $1,000 or more of such products were raised and sold, or normally would have been sold, during the census year. The census helps tell the whole story of U.S. agriculture. The last Census of Agriculture counted more than 2 million farms and ranches in the U.S. spanning over 914 million acres. Without the Census of Agriculture, we would not know that 3.ates – only one percent of our total population – provide food, fuel, and fiber to the nation and others around the world. The Census of Agriculture remains the only source of uniform, comprehensive, and impartial agriculture for every county in the nation. Census results are valuable to those who serve farmers and rural communities, including federal, state and local governments, agribusinesses, trade associations, extension educators, researchers, and farmers and ranchers themselves. Answers to the census can help grow a farm’s future, shape farm programs, and boost services for communities and the industry. Today, National Ag Day, and in the months to follow, we ask you to do three things: 1. Find out more about the Census of Agriculture by visiting www.agcensus.usda.gov; 2. Sign up to be counted in the Census of Agriculture, if you are involved with agriculture and have never participated in the Census before, and 3. Help spread the word so we can get a complete picture of U.S. agriculture. Become a Census of Agriculture Partner! Producers will receive their Census of Agriculture questionnaires this December. They will have the option to complete their form and return it by mail or use the Online Response to Census of Agriculture. Improved this year, the online census form is convenient, dynamic and user-friendly. It is accessible on any electronic device, calculates totals automatically, and skips questions that do not pertain to the operation. Remember, the Census of Agriculture is Your Voice, Your Future, Your Opportunity.

(Stock photo) With summer right around the corner, it’s time to break out the grill and cornhole – May is National Barbecue Month! It’s also national beef, egg, strawberry, and salad month. Apropos of a backyard shindig, lemonade and apple pie days are also in May. As a matter of fact, the summer months coincide with the peak of several fruits and vegetables, nearly all perfect for a barbecue. Often the star of a barbecue, beef provides options like hamburgers, all beef hotdogs, steak, ribs, kebabs, and brisket. Did you know that the United States produced more than 26 billion pounds of beef last year? For more information about red meat production in , check out the complete Annual Summary (, 1.6 ) released by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) last month. According to the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), the United States is the largest producer of beef in the world! The Census of Agriculture tells us that there are more than 913,000 U.S. farms with cattle and calves. Texas has the largest number of cattle and cattle operations in the country. What will the Census of Agriculture tell us? If beef is on the menu, consider marinating the meat and/or grilling with charcoal or wood chips for added flavor. If you’re making kebabs, don’t forget to soak your wooden skewers in cold water for several minutes before using them to avoid burning. Looking for a couple of great side dishes that are waist wise? Try deviled eggs and a refreshing fruit salad. According to the Chickens and Eggs Summary (, 1.3 ) released in February, U.S. farmers produced 106 billion eggs, 92 billion of which were table eggs, with Iowa being the largest producer. According to the Census of Agriculture, the United States has 198,272 farms with laying hens. Texas has the most operations with layers . Strawberries are great in almost everything! From desserts and drinks to salads and sauces, the strawberry is a nutritious and versatile fruit. In , the U.S. produced more than 3 billion pounds of strawberries. California’s operations, with 38,200 total strawberry acres harvested, produced nearly all the U.S. total with 2.9 billion pounds. For more on strawberries, keep an eye out for the upcoming Noncitrus Fruit and Nuts Annual Report on June 26. Not a big fan of all the work or cleanup of a barbecue? Keep it simple! Organize a potluck and use recyclable or compostable plates and utensils. As for the grill, remove debris while it’s still hot for easier and quicker cleaning. Want to do something creative? Transform your backyard barbecue into a tropical luau or host an outdoor movie night. Beyond reminding us about these wonderful foods and occasions, May reminds us that we have only a few more weeks for census collection. If you received a census questionnaire but have not yet completed and returned it, please do so as soon as possible. Even if you don’t farm, please return the questionnaire so that everyone is counted. The results of the Census of Agriculture will represent America’s diverse agriculture and rural communities in very important local, state, and national decisions in the years to come.

"NRCS Alaska in  Conservation  Forestry  May 11,  Newly hatched salmon. What do wild Alaskan salmon and Sitka black-tailed deer have in common? Other than playing starring roles on many Alaskans’ favorite dinner menus, they also both thrive in forests with large open canopies of hardwood and conifers with thick plant undergrowth. Such characteristics exist in mature forests but not in clear-cut areas. Historically rich in fish and wildlife species, the Starrigavan Creek watershed in Sitka, Alaska, was clear-cut about 40 years ago by the state of Alaska for timber production, impacting fish and wildlife habitat in this popular local recreation area. In , USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) partnered with the U.S. Forest Service, the State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources, Trout Unlimited and the Sitka Conservation Society to rehabilitate the Starrigavan Creek watershed. The goal was to improve habitat for salmon and deer, two keystone species for many watersheds in southeast Alaska that are also important for subsistence and recreation. Secondary goals were to increase berry production and provide firewood for the local community. The forest after thinning. While the Forest Service spearheaded in-stream work on their property, NRCS worked with Trout Unlimited on the adjacent land. We cut excess conifer trees, leaving hardwoods in place to mimic an old growth forest. The hardwoods provide canopy and leaf litter, an important nutrient input to streams and forest soils. To facilitate decomposition of the cut trees, make travel easier for wildlife and allow additional light to reach the understory, we lopped the cut trees into small pieces. Along the roadsides, community members collected the cut trees for firewood. Monitoring the success of the project continues, as there are both short and long-term benefits of forest conservation. The trees left uncut during the project work will grow faster now that they have better access to light, water and nutrients. So far, the newly opened forest floor is thriving with favored deer browse such as bunchberry dogwood and five-leaf bramble; salmon habitat has improved; and the berry picking looks promising.

"Research and Science  Apr 02,   The Forest Service is collaboratively developing a new planning rule for the National Forest System that will be rooted in science. The collaborative dialog really opened up March 29-30 in Washington DC at the National Science Forum. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack visited the Forum in demonstration of his support of a new planning rule that embraces participation and is science-based.  The Science Forum was just the first of many opportunities for the public to participate in the development of a new planning rule. In fact, on April 1st and 2nd a National Roundtable discussion is taking place. To view the schedule and watch live selections of National Roundtables.  We are also inviting people to join the Virtual Roundtable at our planning rule blog.  The Forum was designed to provide scientific information to serve as the foundation for future collaborative meetings and aid in integrating science into the development of the next planning rule.  During the Forum, scientists shared in discussion on the latest science on topics such as restoration, climate change, watershed health, diversity, and the national forest’s contribution to vibrant local economies. The entire forum was made available on a streaming live web cast and online participants were able to participate and ask questions of the scientists via the planning ruleblog. We heard diverse viewpoints and we’re excited to keep the conversation going.  An interim summary of some of the major themes discussed at the Forum is available now on online. This product shares some highlights of the science and viewpoints offered by Science Forum presenters, attendees and online participants. A more complete summary of the Science Forum will be available in coming weeks. Panelist’s presentations are also available on the planning rule Web site, and it is our intent to post video segments from the Science Forum on the planning rule web site in the coming weeks.  Our collaborative process to develop the planning rule is in the early stages. We are continually adding new and broader opportunities to get involved. If you’ve got ideas, let us know what they are by commenting on our blog.

"Posted by Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack in  Forestry  Dec 17,   I want to thank Avoided Deforestation Partners for holding this event and inviting me to join all of the distinguished speakers here today in urging the adoption of REDD plus as part of a global climate framework. We are encouraged by the progress being made here in moving REDD forward.  The United States believes an agreed outcome in Copenhagen should include REDD.  Our negotiating team is working hard to make this happen. Protecting the world’s forests is not a luxury.  It is a necessity. Tropical rainforests, in particular, are of special importance. These forests are vital to the protection and storage of water.  The forests of the Amazon alone provide 15%-20% of the water that flows from the world’s rivers into our oceans. Tropical rainforests are also reservoirs of biodiversity, covering 2% of the world’s surface but containing half of the world’s plants and animals. And, tropical rainforests are vitally important to the livelihood of many living in the world’s rural areas. By creating well-designed policies that value those forests, local people and communities can share in the economic benefits of forest conservation and environmental stewardship. As evidenced by the gathering here in Copenhagen, protecting the world’s climate is one of the greatest challenges of our lifetime.  Forests have a vital role to play in overcoming this challenge.  Rainforests store vast amounts of carbon.  That’s true across the planet, and in America, too.  Our Tongass National Forest, a temperate Alaskan rainforest comprises only 2% of America’s forest land base, but may hold as much as 8% of all the carbon contained in the forests of the United States. Beyond the negative consequences of deforestation, it will be very difficult to protect the world’s climate, without protecting and restoring our forests. We lose more than 13 million hectares of tropical forests annually, and as we’ve heard today, the consequences are enormous, approximately 17% of global warming emissions coming from deforestation. Protecting the world’s forests will require significant capital.  We believe that valuing carbon in forests through a well-designed carbon market can provide one of the best opportunities we have to dramatically slow down forest loss and degradation in developing countries.  Of course, capital alone isn’t enough.  We must develop accurate forest inventories.  We must learn to balance local development with forest conservation.  And we must build local capacity so that countries are ready to participate in REDD markets and activities. The Obama Administration and United States is committed to working with our international partners to protect these forests across the globe.  Today the State Department¸ USAID, and USDA’s Forest Service are already working with the governments of Ghana, Nepal, Mexico and others to learn how REDD plus can be implemented on the ground and we expect to ramp up these programs in the near future.  This includes improvements in carbon inventories, systems for paying for ecosystem services, and assistance in helping forests adapt to a changing climate. While REDD can make it possible for developing countries to protect their forests, developed countries must also recognize their own responsibility towards their own lands.  In the United States, the Obama Administration is taking steps to protect and restore our forests in order to sustain our climate and our water resources.  This week, the US Forest Service will formally announce a process for development of a new forest planning rule to govern the way we manage our publicly-owned National Forests, all 193 million acres.  Moving forward, forest restoration, climate mitigation and adaption will be central components of how we manage our National Forests. The Obama Administration has also taken steps to protect roadless areas on our National Forests – these areas not only store carbon, but are critical in conserving water and wildlife.  And, we recognize the importance of protecting our privately-owned forests many of which are threatened by suburbanization and fragmentation. Our domestic efforts are important, but internationally we must move quickly to make it possible for developing countries to address deforestation.  We recognize the significant role that international public finance must play in supporting developing countries efforts to slow, halt and reverse deforestation.  That’s why I’m pleased to announce that the United States is committing one billion dollars over the next three years for fast start of REDD.  We regard this as an initial investment to build the capacity in these countries and undertake efforts to slow deforestation.  These funds will be available for countries that develop ambitious REDD-plus plans addressing deforestation and forest degradation, according to their respective capabilities.  We encourage other donors to join us in supporting forest countries to ensure early action on REDD-plus becomes a reality. The United States is committed to protecting and restoring its forests as well as helping our international partners do the same.  It is imperative that we sustain our forests everywhere so that they, in turn, can sustain us.

"USDA Grant to Enhance Sustainability of Beginning farmers and Ranchers  One of our biggest opportunities to increase employment and income in rural America is to enhance the sustainability of beginning farmers.  Many farmers are retiring, and coupled with a renewed interest in local foods is causing an increased demand on small and medium-sized farmers. Nearly 25 percent of U.S. farmers are 65 years and older.  The average age of the farm operator is 57 years.  I have noticed a shift is occurring with an increase in the number of new farm operations with many Americans interested in becoming beginning farmers and ranchers.  However, these farmers face unique challenges, including rising cost of farm land, lack of knowledge about accessing farm land and the capital to buy the land, lack of training in sustainable farming practices, a lack of operating capital in their initial years, and many need experiential learning to be successful.

"NRCS National Agricultural Engineer and USDA People’s Garden Apiary Co-Beekeeper in  Conservation  Initiatives  Sep 03,   This story has three parts. Read Part 1 here. Read Part 2 here. For an hour or so, that’s how it went: on one side of the roof, I smoked the bees and removed capped frames, volunteers ran the capped frames over to the extractor on the other side of the roof, and the extractor team spun the honey out of the trays with the hand-cranked extractor. The centrifuged honey slid down the sides of the extractor into a sweet puddle at the bottom of the metal barrel. Everyone had a turn spinning the extractor (and maybe sneaking a taste of the fresh honey; but I can’t say for sure—I was on the other side of the roof).  Then the extractor broke! A couple of the teeth in the gear snapped off, making it impossible to turn the hand crank. Andy and Nathan decided to carry the extractor and the remaining full frames back to their office in Beltsville, Maryland, where they had another extractor and could finish the job. But first, we wanted to pour the first two jars of honey. At the bottom of the exterior of the extractor barrel was a small tap. Leslie handed me two jars and I tapped the beautiful, clear honey into the jars. It was a proud moment for all of us.  This is me with the first two bottles from the extractor. From now on we’ll be able to monitor the hive for when the frames are full—and thus determine a good time to harvest the honey—without disturbing the bees. That’s because, while we were in the middle of the honey harvest, we lifted the hive and placed a scale under it. The scale has a logger that will take readings of the hive every 10 minutes to evaluate weight gain and loss. So we’ll now know how much honey is in the hive without even cracking the lid.  This is the bottom of the hive resting on the scale, which has been set on top of cinderblocks.  In case you’re curious, we didn’t take all of the hive’s honey that day. We left the bees several partially full frames to build on. They feed the young that honey, and we didn’t want to make more work for them than we had to. After all, it’s hot out, and gathering nectar to make honey is hard work. And after Nathan and Andy finished putting all the honey in jars, they put the extractor, with its streaks of honey, back on the roof for the bees to harvest. Now that’s what I call recycling!  For the latest updates, follow the People's Garden, NRCS and ARS on Twitter.

"Public Affairs Specialist, NRCS in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Sep 23,  Glynis Coleman and her son sell peppers and berries at a KYF2 Conference at the Kerr Center in Oklahoma. Larry Wright leaned to his right and said, “I just realized that when I was up there introducing the conference, I forgot to tell everyone who I was.”Larry is the Oklahoma area coordinator for the Great Plains Resource Conservation and Development’s (RC&D) and worked tirelessly for five months planning a conference that would help build the rural communities his council serves.  After his first Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Conference and Gala more than 250 attendees know exactly what Larry does, and will be telling their friends about him, too. The event was organized to help farmers and landowners learn about the opportunities offered by local and regional markets, and how USDA can help communities develop local and regional food systems.  It also brought together staff from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Cooperative Extension, and other agencies to meet and learn about producers and each other. The sessions for the conference moved from more topical content, like getting started with organic gardening, to more specific topics for those needing something more in-depth, like third-party verification.  You could tell by the questions asked that this conference met the aim of serving a range of people, including producers, aggregators, farmer’s market organizers, and school nutrition professionals. Some of the attendees were like Glynis Coleman.  She is a small scale producer originally from Denver, Colorado.  As a child, her only exposure to agriculture was through her grandmother’s small garden.  In the last few years, family obligations made it necessary for her to find some way to make money working from home.  A former nurse armed only with a small acreage and the ability to keep house plants alive, she set out in search of knowledge that would make agriculture a viable option for her.  Her first stop was a conference held by the Kerr Center. At the conference, Coleman and her son placed generously filled pint-sized baskets of black berries and peppers next to Melvett Chambers’ tomatoes in a miniature farmer’s market stand set up in the foyer.  After Chambers told her the price of small and large fruits, Coleman suggested the entire crop seemed to be abundantly sized when she asked with disbelief, “Which are the small?” It is one of many questions she has asked Chambers over her four years in the business.  Chris Kirby, with the Oklahoma Farm to School Program, matched them up in a sort of unofficial mentorship.  Coleman was not at the conference only to sell produce.  She also attended the plasticulture session, an agricultural system she already uses, and learned more about expanding her operation through the NRCS Environmental Quality Incentives Program Organic Initiative. Coleman says that there have been a few set-backs for her business, but she has been successful enough that her sister has left a career in the construction industry to add chickens and possibly goats to the operation.  For beginning farmers, Coleman says conferences like this are a good place to begin gathering information.  She offers this advice, “Make sure you want to do this, it is hard work.  Be willing to make mistakes. Diversify your crops.  You become reliant on the weather and God so you have to have some faith.” The conference exceeded everyone’s expectations.  Larry Wright was asked by many of the excited attendees if there will be another conference next year.  “There will be a conference for as long as it is needed.” (You can learn more about the Great Plains RC&D council and keep an eye out for next year’s conference and other events online at:   Category/Topic:  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Tags:  CEQ  Great Plains Resource Conservation and Development’s (RC&D)  KYF2  Natural Resources Conservation Service  Oklahoma Farm to School Program","Here is a concise question focused on the key concepts: What advice does Glynis Coleman, a small-scale producer, give to beginning farmers regarding building a successful farm business?","Glynis Coleman advises beginning farmers to ""Make sure you want to do this, it's hard work.

"Nebraska National Forests, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 27,  Richard Gilbert, Bessey Nursery Manager talks with students from Sandhills Public Schools about the seed collection process, growing process and replanting. (U.S. Forest Service/Tim Buskirk) Two million seedlings will grow up one day to become the forests of our future. The vision for all of those trees is part of the mission of the Charles E. Bessey Nursery, part of the Nebraska National Forests and Grasslands, and the oldest federal seedling nursery in the nation. Working with the Bessey Ranger District and the volunteer group Friends of the Nebraska National Forests, the nursery recently invited the public in for a rare opportunity to see the nursery in full production; growing, packing and shipping hundreds of thousands of seedlings to U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, conservation districts and other government agency locations. The seedlings are used for reforestation following fire and insect infestations, wildlife/habitat plantings, wind breaks, conservation plantings, and general planting. “We’ve just shipped 150,000 container seedlings of Douglas-Fir and Ponderosa Pine to the site of the Hayman fire on the Pike San Isabel National Forests in Colorado,"" says Richard Gilbert, the nursery manager. “These seedlings were grown from cones gathered by forest personnel near Colorado Springs and sent to us for extraction and storage until they are needed. The seedlings were started in February , packed once they were dormant in November , stored in a freezer at 26 degrees, and today we are ready to return them home. It’s gratifying to know we play a part in preserving the natural integrity of our nation’s forests.” According to Gilbert, in addition to the Hayman fire site, another 136,000 container seedlings were shipped to the Pike San Isabel National Forests. Almost 2.3 million seedlings were shipped for spring planting to forests in the Rocky Mountain Region and state agencies including the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest, the Nebraska National Forests,  Grand Mesa, Umcompahgre National Forest , Kansas Forest Service, White River National Forest, Black Hills National Forest and the San Juan National Forest Additional seedlings were sent to Conservation Districts in South Dakota and North Dakota and 1 million went to the Natural Resource Districts of Nebraska.  Large trees were shipped to the Memorial Grove near Monument, Colorado. “It was exciting to have so many students,” said Tim Buskirk, Bessey District ranger. “It was an honor to introduce them to the rich history of Bessey and the unique hand-planted forest. I hope many of them come back with their families soon.” The event also celebrated the kick-off of a new, accessible Discovery Loup Trail to loop through the Bessey Arboretum, conveniently located near the Bessey Visitor Center and Nursery. The three-quarter mile trail will be completed by Friends of the Nebraska National Forests, working together with the Bessey staff. According to volunteer Pam Reed, Nebraska master naturalist, the project involves renovation to a portion of the Bessey Arboretum, new tree identification markers for the 65 tree species located there, interpretive exhibits and a kiosk. Educational materials will showcase this unique Nebraska ecosystem, and the experimental, hand-planted forest and federal nursery.

"USDA Office of Tribal Relations in  Conservation  Energy  Food and Nutrition  Rural  Dec 15,   was another banner year for innovative Federal / Tribal partnerships, government-to-government relations with Federally Recognized Tribes and investments that continue to improve the quality of life for American Indians and Alaska Natives. Here are five examples from this past year of ways USDA and this Administration have built on their deep commitment to improving our working relationships with Tribes and helping them meet unique challenges facing tribal communities head-on. 1. Tribal partnerships fuel sustainable aviation The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe working through the Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance Tribal Partnership Program are making aviation biofuel from twigs and small branches that would otherwise have been burned in slash piles after timber harvests. Residual forest materials are collected from tribal forestland for use in aviation biofuel production. (Image courtesy of NARA) 2. Sowing Gardens, and Growing Kids Who Love Them If you ever bought into the idea that “kids don’t like vegetables,” elementary schoolers at Cherokee Central Schools’ in North Carolina could have changed your mind that day. Stationed in front of the school during after-school pick-up time, every car and person within reach received a glowing description of the wondrous greens the students helped grow, the most popular being a local native variety called Creasy Greens. Cherokee Central Schools students participate in a hands-on lesson in the school’s garden, which is planted with traditional varieties of vegetables grown for generations by the Cherokee people. 3. Investing in Opportunity in Indian Country Investments in strong, secure infrastructure in Indian Country—things like roads and bridges, but also internet access, housing and community facilities like hospitals and schools—help to improve connectivity and access to information, move products to market, and make communities competitive and attractive to businesses and investments.

USDA Foods Help Nourish a Culture Traditional foods are of significant value to Native American and Alaskan Natives today.  The same foods that have been used to feed our ancestors not only feed our bodies, but they feed our spirit. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recognizes this importance and works diligently to offer program and partnership opportunities that help enhance traditional food access in Indian Country.

"USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Forestry  Dec 15,   Day and night, pollinators are at work all around us—and it's not just honey bees. Did you know that pollinators are responsible for one out of three bites of food we eat? If you'd like to learn more, we've pulled together five blogs from highlighting some surprising facts about these busy helpers and the many ways different USDA agencies, farmers, ranchers and other partners are working to keep all pollinators healthy. 1. Cattle and Honey Bees Graze in Harmony on Wisconsin Farm When USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) launched a new coordinated effort to improve honey bee habitat in , Fitton was one of the first to participate. He works closely with NRCS to make improvements to the land that provide better forage for his cattle, improve existing hayfields and convert former corn fields into healthy pasture. Reed Fitton has enhanced honey bee habitat on the pastures he manages near Gays Mills, Wisconsin. 2. A Diet to Help Conserve Bees When Food Is Scarce In exchange for their labor, flowers provide bees with pollen and nectar as food. But few people wonder what’s available for bees to eat when there are few plants blooming in the late fall and early winter. MegaBee, an artificial diet developed by ARS and S.A.F.E. R&D, LLC, helps sustain honey bees in the face of pressures such as poor nutrition, pathogens, parasites and sublethal exposure to pesticides. 3. Using Agroforestry to Help Pollinators Help You One question many people are asking is: how can we incorporate more pollinator habitat into our communities, agricultural lands, and forests? Ongoing research by the U.S. Forest Service demonstrates that the number of pollinators in our landscapes can be increased through agroforestry and other land management practices. Blueberry bushes provide food for both bumblebees and people. (Photo credit: Nancy Adamson/ National Agroforestry Center.) 4. NRCS Partners with Farmers, Ranchers to Aid Monarch Butterflies Because monarch butterflies are often on the move, they need to have the right plants at the right time along their migration route, including milkweed, which is the sole food source for monarch caterpillars. We worked with butterfly experts across the United States to choose the best plant species for monarchs based on geographic location and value to monarchs. NRCS is working with farmers and ranchers to create and enhance habitat for monarchs. NRCS photo by Gene Barickman. 5. Celebrate the Mysterious World of Caves, a Home for Bats during International Bat Week Bats are vital to the health of our environment and economy.

"NIFA Public Affairs in  Research and Science  Dec 15,   This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. As we look back on , NIFA is also celebrating the partnership we have developed with the nation’s land-grant universities (LGUs), who play a critical role teaching students to meet the high quality, innovative research needs that are vital to the production of our country’s food, fuel, and fiber. USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture provides support to historically black colleges and universities that were designated at as LGUs in the Second Morrill Act in .  Grants to these universities support research, extension, and teaching in the food and agricultural sciences by building the institutional capacities of these schools.  Looking back on , here are 5 highlights. 1. s land-grant universities: Providing access and enhancing opportunities Historically black land-grant universities celebrated the 125th anniversary of the Second Morrill Act in August .  There are 19 land-grant universities in 18 states, including Central State University in Ohio, which as established under the Farm Bill.  USDA’s  National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) administers a number of LGU education grant programs that support projects that strengthen teaching, research, Extension, and facility programs in the food and agricultural sciences.

That changed quickly, however, at one of the foremost agricultural schools in the country, Tuskegee University, where she said, many people “helped me, guided me, and cared about my success.”  Today, Brooks has a Ph.D. in microbiology and is a leader in the Land-Grant University (LGU) System as the Executive Director of the Association of Research Directors. Dr. Carolyn Brooks had little exposure to agriculture while growing up in the city but, thanks to a love for biology nurtured at a ’s Land Grant University, she knows plenty now and even served as dean of the School of Agricultural and Natural Sciences at the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore, MD. (Photo courtesy of Carolyn Brooks) 3. An agricultural legacy: Agriculture strides through the generations Agriculture is in Dr. Antoine J. Alston’s DNA; he’s a third generation LGU agricultural scholar whose passion for giving back led to the creation of a program that provides students access to educational tools that weren’t accessible before.  While drafting his version of the perfect curriculum, he encountered students who lacked transferable credits from their two-year degree programs.  Alston wanted them to have the opportunity, so he developed the “2+2: Online Studies program.” Dr. Antoine Alston is professor and associate dean for academic studies in North Carolina A&T State University’s School of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences. He is a nationally recognized student mentor, agricultural educator, and expert in the areas of diversity and inclusion. (Photo courtesy of Antoine Alston) 4. Second Morrill Act redux: America’s land-grant universities academic par excellence Booker T. Washington.  George Washington Carver.  Educators par excellence.  Pioneers in food and agricultural scientific research. Dedicated their lives to helping “lift the veil of ignorance” by bringing knowledge to African-Americans and others with limited resources.  In the 125th year of their founding the family of LGUs, which includes 19 institutions in 18 states, continues its legacy of innovations; examples of recent innovations are cited. USDA joins everyone celebrating 125 years of the Second Morrill Act, which has provided educational opportunities for all. 5. There’s something fishy going on in Petersburg’s food desert In the midst of a food desert, Virginia State University (VSU) Cooperative Extension is teaching students how to create and operate sustainable urban farming, and helping feed the community while they’re doing it.  VSU purchased a large empty warehouse in downtown Petersburg and converted it into an aquaponics production center where they raise fish and grow plants in nutrient-rich water.  The indoor urban farm produces vegetables, herbs, and protein year-round and with a minimal environmental footprint. Virginia State University used a NIFA grant to purchase facilities where they teach aquaponics and urban farming. The operation allows them to both raise fish and grow vegetables in a symbiotic environment.

"Posted by Doug O’Brien, Deputy Undersecretary, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Apr 21,  The future of rural communities depends on safe, clean water supplies and healthy watersheds. That future is being challenged like never before and USDA RD is helping them meet the challenge. With Earth Day on the horizon for tomorrow, we at USDA Rural Development are looking forward to sharing some very big news about efforts kicking off across the nation to ensure clean drinking water and healthy watersheds in small, rural communities that face increasing challenges with aging infrastructure, drought and climate change. As you probably know, Rural Development works hard to help rural communities plan and build the critical infrastructure they need to grow and prosper sustainably. Over the past five years, in fact, Rural Development has invested nearly $10.3 billion through 7,867 loans, loan guarantees, and grants for rural drinking water and wastewater treatment upgrades across the nation. Collectively, this work generates powerful environmental benefits. Individually, each project demonstrates how even the smallest community -- and the everyday people living there -- can accomplish the substantial and vitally important work of preserving and protecting our natural resources and quality of life for future generations. With an infusion of funding provided by Congress in the Agricultural Act (Farm Bill) and to our local USDA Rural Development’s speedy delivery of those resources, small towns across the country will kick off a record number of water and wastewater system improvements beginning on Earth Day. Stay tuned this week to learn more about Rural Development’s largest-ever Earth Day commitment and the communities taking action for a sustainable future.

Deidra McGee of the U.S. Forest Service began the program by outlining the key provisions of the Act: Title I—Voting Rights Barred unequal application of voter registration requirements. Title II—Public Accommodations Outlawed discrimination in hotels, motels, restaurants, theaters, and all other public accommodations engaged in interstate commerce. Title III—Desegregation of Public Facilities Permitted Justice Department suits to secure desegregation of certain public facilities. Title IV—Desegregation of Public Education Encouraged the desegregation of public schools and authorized the U. S. Attorney General to file suits to force desegregation. Title V—Civil Rights Commission Addressed procedures for the Commission, broadened its duties. Title VI—Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs Authorized but did not require withdrawal of federal funds from programs which practiced discrimination. Title VII—Equal Employment Opportunity Outlawed discrimination in employment in any business exceeding twenty five people and creates an Equal Employment Opportunities Commission to review complaints. Title VIII—Registration and Voting Statistics Directed the Census Bureau to collect registration and voting statistics based on race, color and national origin. Title IX—Intervention and Removal of Cases Made reviewable in high federal courts the action of federal district courts in remanding a civil rights case to state court and authorized the Attorney General to intervene in certain private suits. Title X—Community Relations Service Created the Service to aid communities in resolving disputes relating to discriminatory practices based on race, color, or national origin. Title XI—Miscellaneous* Born in rural Alabama, General Williams spoke of the long road to passage of the Act, and how he lived “through quite a bit of the struggle”.  He discussed the segregated Alabama school system, reading ‘handed down’ school books, riding in the back of a public bus from his town to attend college, and how, after joining the military, he was pulled over by vigilantes while driving. “These are memories you can never forget, but it made me stronger; a better person and things changed with time.” He said life in America is like a cafeteria: you can pick what you want, but at the end you have to pay a price.  “We are still coming together.” In conclusion, Deputy Assistant Secretary Shorter said that the Act “Gave me a chance for an education and is the beginning of the now-modern America.  It set the stage and we must celebrate what happened, but it is also a call for us to keep pushing forward and treating others as we would want to be treated.  Now go out and BE better.” *SOURCE: Congress and the Nation, -64 (Congressional Service, ): -41.

"Communications Director, USDA Rural Development, Tennessee in  Energy  Rural  Feb 01,   USDA Business and Cooperative Programs Administrator Judith Canales convened a roundtable of renewable energy experts from the southeast in Nashville on January 26, to discuss development and marketing of bioenergy technologies and advanced biofuels. Despite an unexpected snow the night before, participants traveled in from Memphis and Knoxville as well as Middle Tennessee. FSA and Rural Development State Directors Gene Davidson and Bobby Goode hosted the Administrator and Ed Harlan of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Louis Buck of Tennessee Biomass Supply Cooperative, Pete Nelson of Memphis Bioworks, Atha Comiskey and Bart Comiskey of Clean Cities of Middle Tennessee, Paul Melgaard of Eco Energy, Terry Ruse of Clean Fuels Development Coalition, Warren Nevad of the Tennessee Renewable Energy Economic Council, Dan Stasser of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Stan Boyd and David Owenby of the Tennessee Department of Transportation and Rural Development Tennessee Energy Programs Coordinator Will Dodson. Canales opened the forum with the idea that, ""By making renewable energy sources commercially viable based on feed stock available in each region of the country, we create sustainable opportunities for job creation and economic development, and keep more energy dollars in the community."" The spirited discussion covered a range of challenges on the horizon for the emerging bioenergy industry from traditional fuel providers to misperceptions about the tradeoff between food and fuel crops. Canales emphasized that changes are coming to the USDA energy programs that will allow applications to be submitted year round and to encourage geographic and technological diversity. Canales and others brought up the regional nature of biofuel production. Regionally significant feed stocks mentioned included cellulosic switch grass, wood pulp and sucrose-rich crops. With the commercial availability of existing flex fuels growing rapidly, participants called for a fresh examination of regulations intended to encourage their use. ""Greater use helps drive down production costs and will encourage more stations to carry fuels like E20, E30 and E85 as they come online,"" said Goode. ""We can help drive the change to cleaner fuels by doing more to take advantage of flex fuels in fleet vehicles and by educating consumers on the benefits of using more renewable American-made energy resources."" Coop Manager Louis Buck said that with the advances being made in bioenergy production today he looks forward to a time when farmers send power down wires to the city and get a check delivered back in the mail. Electronic mail, presumably. During the roundtable, Canales also announced the award of a $25,000 Rural Energy for America (REAP) grant to the Tennessee Biomass Supply Cooperative. According to Buck, ""The investment will be used for research into commercializing a new, more efficient technology for generating hydrogen from what is typically regarded as low-potential biomass feed stock.""

""Broadband gives students more courses to choose from, more skills to use in high-paying jobs, and more opportunities to enroll in colleges and universities offering the best education available today. We must make needed investments to connect our rural residents to the 21st century technology that will help them compete in a global economy.""Today's announcement of nearly $16 million in USDA grants for distance learning and telemedicine services helps to support President Obama's ConnectED initiative. In June , President Obama announced an effort to connect 99 percent of America's students to high-speed Internet over the next five years. Since USDA has provided support for more than 3,300 educational institutions receiving distance learning services to help rural children get an education that is as good as that of their peers in cities.Today's investments are being provided through USDA's Distance Learning and Telemedicine Loan and Grant program. It provides funding to rural hospitals, clinics, schools and libraries for equipment and technical assistance for telemedicine and distance learning. Grant recipients must demonstrate that they serve rural America, prove there is an economic need and provide at least 15 percent in matching funds.For example, the South Central Ohio Computer Association in Piketon, Ohio, has been selected for a $184,000 grant to link 20 high schools. The Association will train students for high technology careers through a mentoring program using advanced communications technology. In Idaho, funds will be used by the Idaho Education Network to purchase distance learning equipment for K-8 schools in 62 of Idaho's most rural and economically challenged communities. The distance learning equipment will also be used to train emergency service personnel after school hours.Since , USDA has invested almost $150 million in the Distance Learning and Telemedicine program. These investments complement other USDA efforts to improve rural communications. In , USDA provided $305 million in loans for broadband infrastructure. These loans will result in new or upgraded broadband service for about 120,000 rural households, businesses and community institutions once the projects are completed.

"Farm Service Agency Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 29,  During a lunch-hour cooking demonstration with chef Jonathan Bardzik (left), Farm Service Agency (FSA) Administrator Val Dolcini (right) explains how FSA helps growers move produce from farm to market to the consumer’s table. During my travels to 46 states over the past two years, I’ve explored Illinois cornfields, watched an oyster harvest in Connecticut, and admired beet fields in North Dakota. I’ve toured a rooftop farm on a Brooklyn high-rise, and marveled at fresh vegetables grown in truck containers in the remote Alaskan Arctic. These are the places where it all begins, so that Americans have safe and affordable food, from the farm to the plate. So when local author and chef Jonathan Bardzik invited me to the USDA cafeteria for a lunch-hour cooking demonstration, I grabbed my apron and joined him as his “Sous Chef for the Day.” Bardzik has created more than 600 recipes using fresh produce from local farmers markets. With an audience of the USDA workforce and even tourists visiting from the National Mall, we prepared a delicious menu of minestrone pasta, eggplant and tomato soup, green beans with pistou sauce, and mesclun with honey crisp apples and cider vinaigrette. While cooking, we discussed how FSA provides a critical financial safety net for farmers and ranchers that ensures what they produce reaches the marketplace and ultimately to the table. I highlighted how the workhorse of the FSA portfolio, our microloan, of which 25,000 have been issued in just three years, has been a real game changer for farmers and ranchers, especially those who participate in farmers markets, urban agriculture, or as suppliers of locally sourced food. We also discussed the FSA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which, by helping farmers replace environmentally sensitive farmland with grasses, shrubs and trees, has done tremendous work to enhance air and water quality, prevent soil erosion, and create habitat for waterfowl, wetland and upland species. It wasn’t long before our guests attending our cooking demonstration were able to try all four of our freshly prepared recipes – with the Chef even offering cards so that guests could recreate the recipes in their own kitchens. And with my mini-apprenticeship drawing to a close, I thanked Chef Bardzik for the opportunity to join him in our own “farm-to-plate” adventure here at USDA.

"FSA Public Affairs Specialist in  Forestry  Conservation  Oct 03,  Fires blaze from the Blacktail Fire, located in the Blacktail Creek area, east of Loco Mountain in the Crazy Mountains, in Montana. The Blacktail Fire engulfed a little over 5,000 acres, with over 1 million acres impacted across Montana through various wildfires. Dry conditions plagued Montana this summer, with multiple wildfires torching over 1 million acres throughout the state. The largest fire, the Lodgepole Complex fire, impacted over 270,000 acres. Recent rain and snow, and the forecast for continued precipitation, help to suppress the fires and provide welcome relief for Montana residents. Fires aren’t too uncommon in Montana, but this year’s fire season has been different. Spring brought plenty of moisture from an abundant snow-pack and provided adequate moisture for grass growth. The moisture quickly depleting leaving most of the state in drought condition. “Ranchers saw this as great grass and feed. Firefighters saw it as fuel,” said Dennis Garcia, Farm Service Agency (FSA) county executive director for Glacier County, Montana. Garcia was activated to serve in the National Guard during the wildfire suppression efforts near Lolo, Montana. FSA provides assistance to farmers and ranchers who have been impacted by natural disasters, including wildfires, by administering a suite of safety-net programs to help producers recover from eligible losses, such as the Livestock Indemnity Program, the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program, and the Tree Assistance Program. The programs can assist farmers and ranchers who lost livestock, grazing land, fences or eligible trees, bushes and vines as a result of the qualifying natural disaster. In addition, the FSA Emergency Conservation Program provides funding and technical assistance for farmers and ranchers to rehabilitate farmland damaged by natural disasters. Low-interest emergency loans are available to help producers recover from production and physical losses. Compensation is also available to producers who purchased coverage through the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, which protects non-insurable crops (including native grass for grazing) against natural disasters that result in lower yields, crop losses or prevented planting. As a result of the ongoing drought conditions, all Montana counties were approved for emergency haying and grazing of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres. Due to drought and fire conditions, 53 of the state’s 56 counties have been declared either primary or contiguous disaster areas. “The short term impact is FSA can do a lot of good for producers. Producers can get some relief, fix fences and get feed purchased,” Garcia said. Garcia said hay donations came into the state from other areas to help out ranchers in need. Additionally, FSA employees from other states, including Missouri and Oklahoma, have spent time helping Montana producers enroll in FSA disaster programs. “It is proof that the agriculture community is one big small town where you have a lot of folks that have camaraderie,” he said. Detailed information on all of these disaster assistance programs can be found online at: www.fsa.usda.gov/disaster. Or at the USDA Disaster Resource Center. The Lolo Peak Fire, southwest of Lolo, Montana, has impacted over 53,000 acres. The National Guard was activated to help with evacuation efforts near the wildfire.

"Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiative Coordinator, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Nov 03,  Lesser prairie-chickens benefit from lands where a rancher is using prescribed grazing, according to a new report. Photo courtesy of Nick Richter. Habitat conservation practices make a difference for lesser prairie-chickens. That's the finding of a recent scientific study – the first part of a multi-year study – described in a new report from the Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiative (LPCI). LPCI, led by USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), works with partner organizations and ranchers to improve habitat and address threats to the bird. Since , more than 1 million acres of habitat have been restored on working lands. NRCS works with partners to monitor the outcomes, which helps determine if conservation practices are making a difference, but accurately estimating wildlife populations can be challenging with uncommon, widely dispersed species like the lesser prairie-chicken. A recent study identified a new model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, and it shows encouraging evidence that NRCS-recommended conservation practices through LPCI are working and that large blocks of intact prairie are important to prairie-chicken conservation. The study assessed one year of from the annual aerial survey of lesser prairie-chicken lek sites conducted by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and it looked at four factors that might impact site occupancy — patch size of native vegetation, percent of land cover managed with prescribed grazing; percent of land cover enrolled in USDA’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); and density of primary roads. The research team intends to continue with a multi-year study that assesses additional variables. As the amount of land enrolled in CRP or using prescribed grazing increases, the likelihood that lesser prairie-chickens will occupy that land also increases. Lesser prairie-chickens face many threats, including habitat loss and fragmentation from row-crop agriculture, fire suppression, unmanaged grazing, development, and drought. The species currently occupies just 16 percent of its historic range. But in western Kansas, lesser prairie-chickens have reoccupied portions of their historical range and have even moved into areas outside that historical range. The range expansion coincides with former croplands enrolled and maintained as grasslands through CRP as well as native grasslands managed using LPCI prescribed grazing practices. A team of researchers tested whether there was a quantifiable link between land where ranchers are implementing LPCI prescribed grazing plans or have enrolled their land in CRP and the likelihood of prairie-chickens occupying a landscape. Their results indicate that these habitat conservation efforts are working. After developing an expanded model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, the team found that occupancy increases as prairie patch-size increases, as well as in landscapes with ongoing conservation practices. Specifically, the results indicate that when ranchers are using prescribed grazing or enrolling land in CRP, the likelihood of lesser prairie-chickens occupying that habitat increases significantly. The report’s management recommendations include: Enrolling acreage within the lesser prairie-chicken active range in prescribed grazing or CRP. Maintaining large blocks of native prairie across the range through sustainable ranching. Identifying potential landscapes with willing landowners to develop conservation easements, particularly if combined with prescribed grazing and other proven habitat conservation practices. Implementing prescribed grazing on dispersed patches throughout large blocks of rangeland. Cultivating diverse stands of CRP-enrolled grasslands that serve as connective tissue to larger patches of native prairie. Retaining CRP acreage as grasslands after contract expiration. NRCS outlined its three-year conservation strategy for lesser prairie-chicken conservation, which encourages adoption of many of the above recommendations on 500,000 additional acres, such as prescribed grazing, using easements to protect key habitat corridors, and providing assistance to convert expiring CRP lands to grazing.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Farm Service Agency - Office of External Affairs in  Conservation  Feb 29,  Gail Dunlap used the USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to implement many conservation practices on her land, including restoring nearly seven acres of wetlands on one of her Ohio farms. Since she was a teenager some 60 years ago, Gail Dunlap has played an active role in her family’s seventh generation Ohio farming operation by focusing on ways to continually improve conservation practices and establish a natural and sustainable way of life. “Back then, we were not that many years past the Dust Bowl times and farmers in the area were doing a wonderful job of resting the soil with long rotations,” said Dunlap. “I remember even the weeds seemed to be as beautiful as wildflowers.” However, as the years passed, Dunlap quickly became more concerned about soil erosion issues in the area. Each time she returned home from college she noticed that more land was being tilled and islands of oak trees within the fields were disappearing. In , Dunlap learned about a new Farm Bill program called the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and was excited about how the program could benefit their farms. Her parents agreed. After talking with their local USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) staff, they discovered that an entire farm could be eligible for the program. CRP is one of the largest private lands programs for conservation used extensively throughout the country to reduce soil erosion, improve water and air quality and provide wildlife habitat. Today, the original Dunlap farm fosters multiple CRP practices, including wetland restoration, timber, prairies, buffer strips, riparian buffers, grass waterways, shallow water areas, tall grass prairies and various wildlife habitat and food plots. Dunlap has dedicated more than 220 acres of her land in Pickaway and Ross counties to conservation. CRP is a voluntary program that allows eligible landowners to receive annual rental payments and cost-share assistance to establish long-term, resource-conserving covers on eligible farmland throughout the duration of their 10-to-15-year contracts. “CRP is a blessing and it has helped me save our family farm by preserving the land and establishing wildlife habitat,” said Dunlap. “This program gave me hope that I would be able to restore my land through conservation practices so I could bring back diverse wildlife and have the opportunity to plant trees again.” Over the years, Dunlap’s CRP practices did indeed expand. Besides improving the soil health, Dunlap noticed an increase in wildlife numbers. It restored diversity to the farm. “The program provided me income and the opportunity to apply restorative methods to save my land and allow wildlife species to return, reproduce and thrive,” said Dunlap. “It has brought back beauty to the landscape, improved soil fertility and created new ecosystems that will continue to improve over the years. The impact of CRP will benefit many future generations.” Since , CRP has helped prevent more than 9 billion tons of soil from eroding and protected more than 170,000 stream miles with riparian and grass buffers, more than 100,000 acres of bottomland hardwood trees, nearly 300,000 acres of flood-plain wetlands, and 250,000 acres each for duck nesting habitat and upland bird habitat.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Jan 06,  A lesser prairie-chicken outfitted with a satellite telemetry harness on its back in CRP grass cover. Photo by Ashley Tanner The lesser prairie-chicken and its habitat are making a comeback thanks to a USDA conservation program. The ground-dwelling bird was once abundant in the southern Great Plains, living in parts of Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. But over the past 150 years due to human migration and settlement, the lesser prairie-chicken population has declined by more than 90 percent, and its range has shrunk by over 80 percent. The main threat facing the lesser prairie-chicken is the loss of habitat needed for survival caused by converting prairie to cropland, livestock overgrazing, oil and gas development, and building roads and power lines. An Oklahoma State University study recently found that land enrolled in the Farm Service Agency’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) improves and increases lesser prairie-chicken habitat by providing large areas of grasslands and grassland connectivity. The birds were found to rarely move more than 0.3 miles to or from roost sites, and at the county scale, the presence of CRP appears to increase habitat suitability and roost-site accessibility. The study was summarized in a recent Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Conservation Insight (, 1.2 ). Funded by the NRCS Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) Wildlife Component, the study investigated how CRP acreage influences lesser prairie-chicken habitat suitability and the birds’ use of the land. The researchers placed satellite telemetry harnesses on the backs of 104 lesser prairie-chickens from to throughout Beaver County, Oklahoma, to track how the birds used space and moved about in areas with varying amounts of CRP land. Bird movements were evaluated at the individual pasture, county, and distribution-wide scales. Bird locations were gathered from GPS and citizen science (such as the eBird database) and used to determine habitat suitability at both the distribution-wide and county levels, while GPS locations and bird movement patterns (i.e., movements between consecutive locations) were used to assess space-use in relation to CRP land at the county and pasture levels. The study showed that given the bird’s limited movements, habitat benefits vary according to the spatial arrangement of CRP across the landscape, so a patchwork of CRP, native range, and cropland areas may best provide for the needs of the lesser-prairie chicken. Another encouraging finding is that at the pasture scale, managed grazing of CRP land does not negatively influence the birds’ movements or habitat selection and appears compatible with the conservation objective of providing lesser prairie-chicken habitat. In many ways, ground-dwelling birds are no different than their counterparts that nest in trees, safely above many predators. Like their high-flying relatives, birds that live on the ground need food, water, and shelter for survival. The Oklahoma State University study shows that CRP can help preserve and restore what the lesser prairie-chicken needs to survive and thrive. CRP is one of several USDA programs that USDA offers that can help producers manage for prairie chicken habitat. Producers can learn more by contacting their local Service Center. Signed into law in , CRP is one of the largest private-lands conservation programs in the United States. It was originally intended primarily to control soil erosion and potentially stabilize commodity prices by taking marginal lands out of production. The program has evolved over the years, providing many conservation and economic benefits. The program marks its 35-year anniversary this month.

"Writer-Editor, USDA Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Jun 19,  A bee gathering pollen and nectar from a helianthus flower. Everyone wants healthy, thriving honey bee colonies. One-third of the food we eat requires pollinators, and commercial beekeepers transport honey bees hundreds of miles each year to pollinate almond trees and other crops. A scientist with USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and his colleagues have found that honey bee colonies foraging on land with a strong cover of clover species and alfalfa do more than three times better than colonies put next to crop fields of sunflowers or canola. The study was recently published in Scientific . The scientists placed managed honey bee colonies next to land in the USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in North Dakota and let the bees forage from May to October. CRP lands are reserved for long-term conservation efforts and are often home to a wide variety of flowering plants that bees find appealing. The CRP colonies had better health, more bees and greater ability to turn nectar and pollen into vitellogenin—a compound that serves as the base for producing royal jelly, which bees use to nurture larvae and turn larvae into queens. Vitellogenin is also a critical food storage reservoir for honey bees. After spending six months foraging on CRP land and then overwintering, more than 78 percent of the colonies in the study were graded A, the level commanding the highest price for pollination services in January. Of the colonies kept near intensely cultivated fields and then overwintered under the same circumstances as the CRP colonies, only 20 percent could be rated Grade A. “With California almond growers having paid an average of $190 per Grade A colony in the almond pollination season, the need for beekeepers to have access to land that has diverse and substantial nectar and pollen sources is obvious,” explained ARS research microbiologist Kirk E. Anderson. Anderson is with the ARS Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in Tucson, Arizona. Anderson and his team, including ARS molecular biologist Vincent Ricigliano, found that greater stores of vitellogenin were the best predictor of colony size after winter. The protein-rich compound prolongs the lifespans of queens and forager bees and strongly influences key behaviors that increase colony survival. This study highlights the value of high-quality forage, such as that provided by CRP land, to honey bee production in the Northern Great Plains region, which hosts close to half the U.S. managed bee population (about 1 million colonies) from May through October.

"Deputy Administrator of the National Organic Program in  Food and Nutrition  Jul 22,  Understanding the USDA Organic Label  Amidst nutrition facts, ingredient lists, and dietary claims on food packages, “organic” might appear as one more piece of information to decipher when shopping for products.  Understanding what the organic label means can help shoppers make informed purchasing choices. Organic is a labeling term found on products that have been produced using cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that support the cycling of on-farm resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity. The National Organic Program – part of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service – enforces the organic regulations, ensuring the integrity of the USDA Organic Seal. In order to make an organic claim or use the USDA Organic Seal, the final product must follow strict production, handling and labeling standards and go through the organic certification process.  The standards address a variety of factors such as soil quality, animal raising practices, and pest and weed control.  Synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, irradiation, and genetic engineering may not be used.   Organic producers rely on natural substances and physical, mechanical, or biologically based farming methods to the fullest extent possible.  Organic produce must be grown on soil that had no prohibited substances (most synthetic fertilizers and pesticides) applied for three years prior to harvest.  As for organic meat, the standards require that animals are raised in living conditions accommodating their natural behaviors, fed organic feed, and not administered antibiotics or hormones.  There are four distinct labeling categories for organic products – 100 percent organic, organic, “made with” organic ingredients, and specific organic ingredients.   In the “100 Percent Organic” category, products must be made up of 100 percent certified organic ingredients.  The label must include the name of the certifying agent and may include the USDA Organic Seal and/or the 100 percent organic claim.   In the “Organic” category, the product and ingredients must be certified organic, except where specified on National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances.  Non-organic ingredients allowed per the National List may be used, but no more than five percent of the combined total ingredients may contain non-organic content.  Additionally, the label must include the name of the certifying agent, and may include the USDA Organic Seal and/or the organic claim. For multi-ingredient products in the “made with” organic category, at least 70 percent of the product must be certified organic ingredients.  The organic seal cannot be used on the product, and the final product cannot be represented as organic – only up to three ingredients or ingredient categories can be represented as organic.  Any remaining ingredients are not to be organically produced but must be produced without excluded methods (genetic engineering). All non-agricultural products must be allowed on the National List.  For example, processed organic foods may contain some approved non-agricultural ingredients, like enzymes in yogurt, pectin in fruit jams, or baking soda in baked goods. Multi-ingredient products with less than 70 percent certified organic content would fall under the “specific organic ingredients,” and don’t need to be certified. These products cannot display the USDA Organic Seal or use the word organic on the principal display panel.  They can list certified organic ingredients in the ingredient list and the percentage of organic ingredients.  Becoming familiar with organic labeling allows consumers to make informed decisions about the products they purchase.  Consumers can be assured that the integrity of USDA organic products are verified from farm to market.
