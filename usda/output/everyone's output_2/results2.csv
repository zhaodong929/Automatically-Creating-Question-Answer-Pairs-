"in  Rural  Jun 30,  USDA Rural Development’s Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program has options for lenders to help homebuyers finance homes across rural America. This includes manufactured homes, which can help boost the housing supply in rural America and bring homeownership within reach for millions of people. Through the Combination Construction-to-Permanent Loan Program (, 158 ), USDA and its lending partners are making sure the dreams for millions to achieve homeownership come true by requiring no money down. Under this program, USDA guarantees 100% of the appraised value of the home and land. The program also helps lenders finance land costs, closing costs, site development, installation and setup costs for the home. It also allows lenders to obtain the loan note guarantee up front, creating more flexibility for both the lender and borrower. For example, USDA’s lending partner Metroplex Mortgage Services Inc. is working with the agency to ensure people in rural Florida, Texas, Tennessee and Alabama have a place to call home. Metroplex Mortgage Services Inc. President Sean Stephens said the company recently helped a single mother buy a new manufactured home with the Combination Construction-to-Permanent Loan Program. She was able to qualify due to the no-money-down requirement and the flexibility of the program. Guild Mortgage, based in San Diego, California, is financing four manufactured homes through the Single-Family Housing Guarantee Loan Program to help people in the Paradise community hit by wildfires access affordable housing as soon as possible. The homes are a construction type known as CrossMod. These types of homes blend the features of site-built homes with the innovative and efficient methods of factory construction and result in a product that appears as a conventional stick-built home. Checklist for Lenders If you’re a lender who is interested in financing new manufactured home construction through USDA’s Combination Construction-to-Permanent Loan Program, here are some tips to keep in mind. In order to receive USDA Rural Development financing, the unit must be new and:  Transported directly from the manufacturer to the site where it will be financed.  Have a floor area of no less than 400 square feet.  Installed on a permanent foundation built according to FHA .  Meet the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standard.  Certified by its builder that thermal requirements have been met. For more information, visit Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program | Rural Development (usda.gov).

"From West Virginia to Ohio, Food Fuels the Local Economy  West Virginia and Appalachian Ohio have a lot in common beyond their shared state border.  With a strong agricultural heritage, these vast rural areas are known for their forest and timber industries, and they are integrating food systems into local economic development. Earlier this month, I joined Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) Co-Chair Earl Gohl and Ohio’s State Rural Development Director Tony Logan to take a look at local food in the Buckeye state. My colleague, Deputy Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs Joani Walsh, recently made a similar trip to West Virginia. Organized by ARC, the visits were an opportunity to discuss how local food is diversifying the economy, developing a more competitive workforce and generating opportunities within regions like Appalachia. “Through our work on the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative, we know that there are lots of ways  that local foods are providing economic opportunities in rural communities,” said Walsh. “These  visits with ARC gave us a clearer picture of how that is happening in Appalachia.”  Doug O’Brien, Acting Under Secretary for Rural Development  Posted in  USDA Results  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Technology  Jun 17,   Respond to this story","How are local food systems being integrated into economic development in West Virginia and Appalachian Ohio, and what opportunities are they creating for rural communities?","Local food systems are being integrated into economic development in West Virginia and Appalachian Ohio by diversifying the economy, developing a more competitive workforce, and generating new opportunities within these regions.

"Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  May 11,    Blog by Dr. Lynn Harvey, Ed.D., RD, LDN, FADA Section Chief, Child Nutrition Services, Division of School Support, NC Department of Public Instruction  It was a proud day in North Carolina as Thomasville Primary School earned the HealthierUS School Challenge Gold Award.  Officials from the Food and Nutrition Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture were in Thomasville, N.C., to present the award.  Child Nutrition Personnel were joined by the Mayor, members of the City Council, County Commission, and Board of Education, the Superintendent, Principal, Teachers, Parents...and of course, the VIPs of the day...the STUDENTS!  Thomasville Primary School was the ""jewel"" in the state education crown having earned top recognition for their efforts to educate the ""whole child."" As part of the celebration, students demonstrated what they do all year, to not only achieve the Healthier US School Challenge nutrition standards, but also the physical side... they planted seeds in the school garden as they got instruction from a local farmer; they honed their match skills by spending money (school-issued currency) to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables at their produce stand; they played Food Pyramid Scramble (yes, running and squatting was involved....just ask USDA Food and Nutrition Branch Chief, Jane Mandel, and Southeast Regional Administrator Donald Arnette who ran the race in business clothes!)  When guests arrived for the awards celebration, they were greeted by the school’s Child Nutrition Personnel wearing bright yellow T-shirts that said ""Let's Move"". “The reason we picked this slogan,” said Brenda Watford, Thomasville County Schools Nutrition Director, “was to let First Lady Michelle Obama know that we are behind her ‘Let’s Move’ program. We want to help stop the obesity epidemic. We send newsletters home about the nutrition that children need and fact sheets about our fresh fruits and fresh vegetables that we serve as part of our USDA Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Program.”  What I observed on this day was nothing short of a complete transformation in the school cafeteria.

"Are Frogs on the Edge of Survival?  A lethal fungus is killing frogs and other water-dwelling amphibians all over the world, but a team of international scientists led by U.S. Forest Service scientist Deanna Olson is working to understand why. Olson, who works at the agency’s Pacific Northwest Research Station, and her colleagues have the daunting task of tracking the disease, known as the amphibian chytrid fungus. Unlike the clearly visible white-nose syndrome killing bats in the U.S., the frog fungus cannot be seen except with a microscope. That makes scientists’ jobs that much more difficult. Since the discovery of the malady is so recent, scientists still don’t understand a great deal about the fungus except that it affects the skin and ultimately leads to cardiac arrest in amphibians.

"Harvest Time: Celebrating Native American Heritage and Traditional Foods in FDPIR  Autumn is a time to reflect on all that we have to be thankful for, as we enjoy the harvest of nature’s bounty during gatherings with family and friends. In Indian Country, culture and tradition are sustained through shared meals with family and the community. Traditional foods are a powerful way for each new generation to connect with and honor its history and its ancestors, and participants in USDA’s Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) have access to more traditional foods than ever this year. November, Native American Heritage Month, is an especially fitting time to celebrate the addition to FDPIR of bison, blue cornmeal, wild rice, and wild salmon – foods that not only nourish a body but sustain a culture. In collaboration with the FDPIR community, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service and Food and Nutrition Service have been working to identify culturally relevant foods to procure and offer through FDPIR, a program that provides healthy food and nutrition education to an average of 92,500 income-eligible individuals living on or near reservations across the United States each month. The food package offers more than 100 domestically sourced, nutritious foods, including a variety of meat, poultry, fish, dairy, grains, and fruits and vegetables. In both fiscal year and , USDA received an additional allocation of $5 million dedicated to traditional and locally-grown foods. This fund, authorized under the Farm Bill and subject to the availability of appropriations, has allowed the exploration of new culinary opportunities for FDPIR.

"Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19?  Last year, as COVID-19 rattled the world economy and disrupted trade flows, agricultural trade remained mostly stable, falling only two percent during the initial wave of infections and lockdowns, before bouncing back and ending the year up 3.5 percent. But the growth in agricultural trade doesn’t mean that trade flows were insulated from the effects of the pandemic. Much of was in fact shaped by other factors. For instance, 95% of global agricultural trade growth came from China and was driven in part by non-pandemic related factors of increased feed demand, efforts to restock grain reserves, and policy factors. A recent paper by USDA’s Office of the Chief Economist, Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19? Findings from an Econometric Assessment (, 1.4 ) (Arita et al.), suggests that while agricultural trade remained stable at the aggregate level, a deeper empirical analysis reveals there were still significant disruptions due to the pandemic.

"NRCS Alabama and Ann Simonelli, The Conservation Fund in  Conservation  Oct 14,  (Pictured left to right) Jimmy Bullock with the Resource Management Service, Andrew Schock with The Conservation Fund and NRCS Alabama State Conservationist Ben Malone stand in one project area for the Coastal Headwaters Forest. It takes time, patience and a committed partnership, but seeing thriving forests of longleaf pine trees return to Alabama’s Gulf Coast is well-worth the wait. Longleaf pine forests once dominated the American Southeast, stretching across 90 million acres. A stronghold of the region’s environment and economy, longleaf was an essential building material used during the American Industrial Revolution. Today, only four percent of the original forests remain standing. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Alabama is working with groups to revive this strong and resilient wood, while also providing environmental benefits for the Gulf Coastal Plain’s wildlife and water. Through the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), NRCS is collaborating with The Conservation Fund (TCF), Resource Management Service (RMS), and many others on the Coastal Headwaters Forest, on a working forest project in Alabama and Florida.  The first RCPP phase is underway in Florida. The second phase in Alabama will use $5.1 million from RCPP, leveraged by $5.1 million in private and public partner funding, to protect and restore the longleaf pine ecosystem on 4,500 acres. The Coastal Headwaters Forest Partnership offers a needed solution, bringing partners and resources together to conserve and restore longleaf pine habitat on private lands, where the majority of southeastern forest land is located. NRCS will place a conservation easement on property in Alabama, providing protection and preventing land fragmentation. By preventing the forests from becoming fragmented into smaller parcels, the lands retain their ability to provide space for wildlife to live and migrate, as well as filter our water and remove CO2 from the air is compromised. The private landowner, RMS, will retain ownership, restore longleaf pine, keep the land on the tax rolls, and continue its forestry work that benefits the regional economy. Several partners attended a tour of the RCPP project area in the Coastal Headwaters Forest in Baldwin County, Alabama this summer. During a site tour held in late June, several partners, including the Longleaf Alliance, Alabama Wildlife Federation and the E. O. Wilson Foundation joined NRCS, The Conservation Fund and RMS in visiting key areas that will see direct benefits of restoring the longleaf pine ecosystem. “Restoring longleaf pine in Alabama’s Gulf Coastal Plain will preserve two major coastal river systems, Perdido and Escambia Rivers, in the Gulf Coastal Plain and protect habitat for the threatened gopher tortoise and approximately 250 other species related to longleaf pine habitat,” said NRCS Alabama State Conservationist, Ben Malone. The private landowner’s commitment to longleaf pine conservation and restoration is critical to regional wildlife and water protection.  The keystone species include the gopher tortoise, cotton-tailed rabbit and indigo snake. The project will also help protect and filter the many miles of streams flowing to the Perdido River and into the Gulf of Mexico. “With the RCPP grant, dozens of public and private partners are ready to meet, educate, make a change and be a model for restoring longleaf pine in Alabama’s Gulf Coastal Plain. The Coastal Headwaters Forests Partnership will make a difference in reversing the decline in longleaf pine and show large commercial timberland owners that longleaf pine can be a viable economic resource,” The Conservation Fund’s Andrew Schock said. The Coastal Headwaters Forest Partnership will advance the goals of America’s Longleaf Restoration Initiative—a collaborative, public-private effort to restore the threatened longleaf ecosystems across eight million acres by . The Longleaf Pine Ecosystem is one of several “critical conservation areas”—or focal areas—for the RCPP, and this project will build on other RCPP longleaf efforts in the Southeast, along with other federal, state and private investments being made throughout a 9-state region to restore longleaf pine. Created by the Farm Bill, RCPP investments of nearly $600 million have already driven 199 partner-led projects, including four projects in Alabama. The program leverages local leadership to establish partnerships that can include private companies, local and tribal governments, universities, non-profits and other non-government partners to work with farmers, ranchers and forest landowners on landscape-and watershed-scale conservation solutions that work best for their region.

"-Brown, Public Affairs Specialist Mid-Atlantic Region in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Sep 20,  Addison, a Kindergarten student at Matoaka Elementary School, makes friends with a new vegetable on Asparagus Day.  Matoaka Elementary School isn’t the biggest school, or the oldest. But it does have a Parent Teacher Association that takes student health very seriously.  So seriously, in fact, that one committee is completely devoted to helping kids and families develop Healthy Lifestyles! “There were a few PTA parents who started talking about how our school could be healthier,” said Tryna Fitzpatrick, “and we decided to survey families and find out what other parents were thinking.” The results were surprising- 92% of those who completed the survey wanted a healthier school environment- and felt so strongly that they were willing to contribute in one way or another to make it happen! And the Healthy Lifestyle Committee was born. Chaired by Tryna and Michelle Alexander, the campaign began leading the way with small changes and positive examples. The Golden Apple Award, for example, is presented to teachers and parents who are “caught being healthy.” “Last year one of our Kindergarten teachers decided to change up the menu for the Valentine’s Day Party- but she did it in such a positive way that no one felt deprived,” said Fitzpatrick. “It was a beautiful party full of healthy red, white, and pink foods- things the kids love, like strawberries and yogurt. The kids had a great time.  No one had a chance to miss cupcakes!” One thoughtful parent award-winner was looking for a way to thank hard working teachers. She developed an after-school exercise program conveniently located and timed so that staff could participate before leaving the school building. Yet another parent manages the school garden. In the fall and spring, kindergarten students plant vegetables, harvest them, and enjoy a salad party. School families care for the garden over the summer, one week at a time. Small efforts have continued to grow. “We’re really excited about our Local Food Initiative,” says Tryna. “It the cooperation of the county, school board, principal, and parents- it’s a big production.” A local farm, Kelrae, provides high-quality seasonal produce 2-3 times a month for use in school meals. So far, sweet potatoes, broccoli, and asparagus have all been popular offerings. Locally grown red potatoes are next up on the menu this year. Once there was bad weather and the vegetable the cafeteria staff had planned to use wasn’t available.  Kelrae was able to provide them with kale, instead. The cafeteria staff made crunchy kale chips, which the kids loved! “Without everyone’s efforts none of this would be possible,” says Tryna.  “But we know from our personal experience that working together can produce great things!” Find out how you can help introduce more fruits and veggies to schools in your area by visiting our Healthier School Day web site.  Continue to check back here on USDA’s blog as we continue to share stories that highlight how USDA and schools across the country are working to make school days healthier for students.

"Administrator, USDA Rural Housing Service in  Rural  Jun 12,  L to R: Vernon Brown, USDA Community Program Director in Kentucky; RHS Administrator Hernandez; and Thomas Fern, USDA Rural Development State Director for Kentucky. Recently, I visited southeastern Kentucky, where I joined Rural Development State Director Tom Fern on a whirlwind tour to parts of an eight-county region designated by President Obama as a rural Promise Zone and by Secretary Vilsack as part of USDA’s StrikeForce initiative covering 73 Kentucky counties. During my first stop, I joined Congressman Hal Rogers as he announced a $23 million loan (funded by USDA’s Community Facilities program) to purchase the property and facilities of the Knox County Hospital in Barbourville.  That loan was the first one to come across my desk last December shortly after I joined USDA. Meeting with some of the 200-plus dedicated employees of that hospital affirmed my belief that granting that loan was the right decision, as the funding will enable those healthcare workers to continue to serve the families of the region. My next visit was to Corbin, also in Knox County, where I toured a USDA-financed apartment complex that also serves as a site for USDA’s Summer Food Service Program. Inspired by Brenda Moses of the KCEOC Community Action Agency and her team – which serves between 40,000 and 60,000 meals each summer – I encouraged borrowers and managers at other USDA-financed housing complexes to also designate their facilities as summer feeding sites. Brenda Moses of KCEOC Community Action Agency briefs RHS Administrator Hernandez on KCEOC’s summer feeding efforts in southeast Kentucky. My last stop was Whitley County, which also benefits from Promise Zone and StrikeForce designations, where I met several families who are not only proud homeowners thanks to USDA’s Single-Family Housing Loan program, but whose homes are certified Passive House Institute US homes. This certification process involves meeting rigorous energy-efficiency standards, from design to completion.  Their rural community has the most Passive House Institute certified homes in the continental United States! I joined community leaders to break ground to build 13 more energy-efficient homes. Interestingly, they are built at a houseboat factory that diversified into homebuilding in order to weather the recent economic downturn. Left to right: Homeowner Linda Sawyers and son Jacob, RHS Administrator Hernandez and homeowner Ashley Warren. Over the years, southeastern Kentucky has endured great economic challenges. But the work happening there now – through visionary leadership, partnerships, collaboration, and strategic planning – convinces me that the region will meet those challenges as it moves confidently into a brighter future.

"Chief, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Nov 12,  NRCS is working with farmers and ranchers to create and enhance habitat for monarchs. NRCS photo by Gene Barickman. No matter where you grew up, you are likely familiar with monarch butterflies. You may have childhood memories from science class when you watched those peculiar green caterpillars transform into beautiful butterflies. Depending on where you live, you may have seen masses of their orange-and-black wings fluttering in the sky while the butterflies were on their annual cross-country migratory journey. Today, the iconic monarch butterfly is under pressure. Habitat loss has led to a steady decrease in their numbers. We’re working to reverse that trend. This year, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is launching a targeted effort in ten key states to create and enhance habitat for the iconic monarch on private lands. Through this effort, we’re partnering with farmers and ranchers to voluntarily establish habitat for the monarch on working lands while ensuring America’s farms and ranches stay productive. Because monarch butterflies are often on the move, they need to have the right plants at the right time along their migration route, including milkweed, which is the sole food source for monarch caterpillars. We worked with butterfly experts across the United States to choose the best plant species for monarchs based on geographic location and value to monarchs. We’re focusing efforts in the southern Great Plains and Midwest – two regions at the heart of the monarch’s migration. In the southern Great Plains, our work will focus on rangelands and ways to improve the health of pastures so they provide good forage for livestock and food for monarchs. In the Midwest we’re focusing on integrating plantings into croplands and making improvements to wetland areas. We’re looking for private landowners in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas and Wisconsin who are interested in making monarch-friendly improvements to their land. These efforts not only benefit butterflies, they also strengthen agricultural operations, support other beneficial insects and wildlife and improve our natural resources. When we designed this effort, we pulled together a variety of tools from the Farm Bill toolbox. In fiscal year , we’re making available $2 million through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and $2 million through the former Wetlands Reserve Program for existing wetland easements. Additionally, we created new enhancements through the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) to establish monarch habitat. The CSP enhancement assistance is available nationwide. We’re also working with the broader federal family on this effort. NRCS’ effort contributes to a multi-agency, international strategy to reverse the monarch’s population decline in North America. The Obama administration, through the National Strategy to Protect Pollinators and Their Habitat, has a goal of increasing the eastern population of monarchs to 225 million by .

"Deck the Halls with Holiday   From the smell of fresh pine, to the vibrant of poinsettias, the holiday season is the perfect time of year to spotlight America’s horticulture growers through the just released Census of Horticultural Specialties report. I’ve experienced firsthand how unique and amazing this industry is by working nationwide with producers and stakeholders as USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics (NASS) nursery and floriculture commodity specialist. For example, did you know farmers can invest more than 8 years growing a Christmas tree for harvest? While there are not many producers dedicated to this work, according to our latest report industry sales grew. In , there were 3,ates. That year there were a total of 20 million cut Christmas trees sold, valued at $367 million in sales. This was a significant increase from the last report in , when only 13 million trees were cut and sold for a total of $250 million.

"It's Quite a Pickle To Be In  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Pickles are a popular food, but are even trendier today as more and more craft brands show up in stores and farmers’ markets all over the country. But did you know USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has helped commercial pickle-makers, from small brands to the nation’s largest, meet the highest standards of food safety? While pickling—storing in an acid liquid, usually vinegar—has been recognized as a food-preserver since long before the discovery of bacteria, the kind of that today’s precise food safety standards require was not established until recently.

"USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Jan 11,   Reducing rental housing operating expenses, preserving the environment and promoting local energy sources is a priority for USDA Rural Development, demonstrated by green-energy initiatives like the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) and the Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program. Rural Development is now offering the Multi-Family Housing Energy Efficiency Initiative as part of the existing application process for Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Program for New Construction, Section 514 Farm Labor Housing Loans and Section 516 Farm Labor Housing Grants for Off-Farm Housing, Section 522 Housing Preservation Grants, and Sections 514, 515 and 516 Multi-Family Housing Revitalization Demonstration Programs.  This new initiative aims to promote development projects that make an effort to reduce energy use, reduce energy from the energy grid supply, have little or no net emission of greenhouse gasses, and are economically viable. The Energy Efficiency Initiative focuses on three areas: energy conservation, energy generation, and green property management.  Points are given to applicants for energy efficiency certifications, use of energy efficient building materials and design strategies, generation of energy on site, and commitments to energy efficient post-construction operation and maintenance.  Through administration of this initiative combined with existing Rural Development programs, USDA hopes to reduce the need for outside energy sources, reduce energy costs, promote the economy, and ultimately secure a better environment for future generations. Several green energy projects funded by  Rural Development are already experiencing the many benefits of conserving energy.  In Kings County, NJ USDA-RD provided a Section 515 loan and Section 538 Guaranteed Rural Rental Housing Program (GRRHP) loan to aid in the construction of 57 rental units for low-income residents.  The construction development, called Montgomery Crossing, employs a 28.1 kWh photovoltaic system, saving over 25 percent of annual electricity costs.  The development also features insulated vinyl siding, water-efficient fixtures, and landscaping plants with low water needs.  Other successful green projects include the Rancho Lindo Apartments development in Kern County, CA and the Harvest Point Apartments in Salem, NJ.

"Initiatives  May 24,   Brad Fisher, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service On May 20, , the USDA State Office in Dover, Delaware broke ground on its People’s Garden, answering Secretary Vilsack’s call to plant such gardens at Department offices around the globe. The Secretary established the People's Garden project in February to commemorate Abraham Lincoln’s 200th birthday.  (See the groundbreaking on YouTube.)  Since then, more than 300 People's Garden have blossomed across the country. The office has 80 Natural Resources Conservation Service, Farm Service Agency, Rural Development and Information Technology Services employees. The employees will volunteer their time to help care for and harvest the garden. The garden's bounty will help needy families in the area and provide a hands-on learning experience for second graders at North Dover Elementary School. And not only does the Delaware garden grow food, it grows partnerships, as well. At the ceremony, NRCS Chief Dave White pointed to the cooperative efforts by federal and state agencies, schools, and private conservation groups to make the garden a reality. Rural Development Deputy Under Secretary Cheryl Cook told the crowd that this and other People’s Garden’s are important to making people aware of where their food comes from and encouraging smart eating. Michael Scuse, Deputy Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services, affirmed that People’s Gardens educate the public about the work that farmers do every day to provide food, fiber, and fuel.  NRCS Delaware State Conservationist Russell Morgan said that he sees People’s Gardens as ways to teach lessons in taking better care of natural resources. One phase of the People's Garden at the USDA office in Dover is the expansion of a rain garden. Storm water runoff and flooding are top concerns in the Delaware Estuary because of the damage that can occur when large volumes of rainwater occur. Learn more about the People's Garden movement at www.usda.gov/peoplesgarden. NRCS employees dig out paths and install borders and landscape fabric. The garden is in the final construction stages.

"Happier than a Pig in Mud - Feral Swine Damage to Water Quality  How does the old saying go? That’s right, “Happier than a pig in mud!” Feral swine are no exception to this old farmer’s anecdote. Because they lack sweat glands, wallowing in mud and water is an instinctual behavior necessary for them to maintain a healthy body temperature. Unfortunately this behavior has cascading impacts, not only to water quality in individual streams, ponds, and wetlands, but to entire watersheds and ecosystems. Excessive feral swine traffic around wallows and water sources causes erosion along stream banks and shorelines. Sounders, or family groups, of feral swine spend large amounts of their day around the wallow, especially in hot weather, which means they leave significant amounts of urine and feces in and around the water. The impacts to water quality go far beyond the immediate wallow site when silt, excrement, and potentially harmful pathogens, are washed down stream.

"Communications Coordinator, USDA Office of Communications in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Feb 07,   What do dairy farmers, NFL stars, and the Secretary of Agriculture have in common? They all braved the winter weather and traveled to the site of Super Bowl XLV to support the Fuel Up to Play 60 (FUTP60) program. FUTP60 conducted a kids’ football clinic at the NFL Experience, an interactive theme park at the Dallas Convention Center. The clinic, aimed at kids,  focused on the fundamentals to improve nutrition and physical activity in their schools and personal lives. Kids from the local school district and beyond arrived at the converted Astroturf playing field, anxious to get moving. The buzz in the air wasn’t from the Katy Perry song reverberating throughout the arena; it was the excitement of kids anxiously awaiting the chance to run on the field to learn from the pros – Cowboy’s linebacker DeMarcus Ware and Colts’ wide receiver Reggie Wayne. After encouraging the kids to eat healthy and stay active, Secretary Vilsack introduced them to the dairy farmers on hand, who are working hard to provide kids across the nation with the dairy products that are so critical to a nutritious diet. While two major dairy states were represented in the Super Bowl, I have to say that it looked like more of the farmers on hand were backing the Steelers, rather than the Green Bay Cheeseheads. As the players took to the field the kids were all high-fives and cheers. The impact and influence of high profile players and role models, committed to living a healthy and active life, cannot be overstated. You could see it clearly in the wide-eyed stares and smiles of every child as they clung to every word from the NFL pros. As the players and kids ran through ladder and reception drills the excitement was overwhelming – we were all ready to suit up for the big game.  Not wanting to get hit by an overthrown pass from DeMarcus, I headed to the sideline where parents stood with cameras in hand and was caught up in a conversation between Secretary Vilsack and a Steelers fan.  The Steelers fan pointed out his son and said that he couldn’t be happier to see him out there active, healthy, and having a great time. Two years ago the father promised his son they could go see the Steelers play in the Super Bowl, but when the big day came, his son was in the hospital receiving a bone marrow transplant.  Fast-forward two years and this father kept his promise to take his son to a Steelers Super Bowl. Not only did they get to go, he watched on as his son joined NFL greats running, laughing and playing in perfect health. While the Super Bowl is the ultimate goal for any aspiring football player, the Fuel Up to Play 60 events were a dream come true for the kids, as well. The energy in the convention center was contagious and everyone thought of how to bring this excitement to communities across the country. Suffice it to say that FUTP60 has some big goals and some big names on board to reach those goals.

"Working Together To Prepare Forests For A Changing Climate  All this month we will be taking a look at what a changing climate means to Agriculture. The ten regional USDA Climate Hubs were established to synthesize and translate climate science and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers that are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA's Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate."" It can be a daunting task to try to plan for something as big and complex as climate change. Uncertainty, whether we will be facing drought, extreme storms—or both—from one year to the next, may make planning for healthy and productive forests seem impossible for managers and landowners. Just like no two forests are alike, neither are the people who own or manage them.  The different values and goals are reflected in the variety of decisions people make when responding to risks or incentives.  The USDA Northern Forests Climate Hub and the Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science (NIACS) are focused on helping people think about climate change in a way that’s practical and relevant to their particular goals.  We use the Adaptation Workbook to help all kinds of organizations and people consider climate adaptation while meeting their land stewardship goals.

"New Web-Based Tool Helps Land Managers Plan for Forests' Future  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. From South Carolina’s coastal plain to the North Carolina mountains to the tropics of Puerto Rico to the southern Sierra Nevada region of California, climate change is on the minds of forest planners. That’s because U.S. Forest Service planning teams in these areas are among the first to revise their land and resource management plans under the Planning Rule. To help them in their planning, land managers from the Francis Marion, Nantahala, Pisgah, El Yunque, Inyo, Sequoia, and Sierra national forests will turn to a web-based tool known as the Template for Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Management Options. Forest Plans help guide the management of national forests and are typically revised every 10 to 15 years. The plans help ensure that national forests and grasslands continue to meet the requirements of the National Forest Management Act—for clean air and water, timber and other forest products, wildlife habitat, recreation and more.

"Food Assistance Branch, Economic Research Service in  Research and Science  Jan 05,  In mid-year of , 20 State SNAP agencies (including some of the counties in California) and 11 State WIC agencies were partners in the Next-Generation Platform. Who participates in federal food assistance programs, and how does participation affect their lives? Who doesn’t participate, and why not? Policymakers need high-quality on such questions to make informed decisions about these programs, which affect millions of lives each year. That is why two USDA agencies are collaborating with the U.S. Census Bureau to produce research that sheds new light on the programs. The strategic partnership among USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS), the USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), and the Census Bureau brings each agency’s expertise to the effort. ERS is USDA’s principal social science research agency, while FNS administers USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – which serves about 42 million people a year, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) – in which about 7.2 million people participate. The Census Bureau not only conducts the nation’s decennial census, but is the leading source of quality about the U.S. people and economy. The three-way collaboration, known as the Next-Generation Platform, combines USDA administrative with survey and administrative from other government programs to provide a more complete picture of the SNAP and WIC programs. It is yielding findings that would otherwise be impossible to obtain. For example, ERS researchers used the Next-Generation platform to link two sources to estimate the SNAP Access Rate - that is, the share of eligible people who participate in SNAP within small geographic areas (such as counties) and for certain demographic groups (such as race/ethnicity, household type, and veteran status). The SNAP administrative helps to identify the number of participants, while the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey on income, citizenship, and household composition helps to estimate how many people are eligible to participate in a particular area. You can view an interactive visualization of these rates for New York. Three , SNAP Access at the State and County Levels: Evidence from Texas SNAP Administrative Records and the American Community Survey, Annual and Monthly SNAP Participation Rates, and Improving the Assessment of SNAP Targeting Using Administrative Records, provide additional detail on some of the findings that have already come out of this project. The partnership between USDA and the Census Bureau is a long-term effort to acquire State-level for SNAP and WIC, which will continue to inform the research. The individual records in a State’s dataset can be linked in a secure environment, protecting confidentiality, to matching records in government surveys or in administrative from other government programs. As States have learned about the project and have seen the value of sharing, more States have provided their to the project. In mid-year of , 20 State SNAP agencies (including some of the counties in California) and 11 State WIC agencies were partners in the Next-Generation Platform. Research based on this collaborative -linking effort will continue to produce findings that inform policymakers and the American public. USDA’s Economic Research Service and Food and Nutrition Service are partnering with the U.S. Census Bureau to acquire and link USDA administrative and survey , enabling researchers to get a more complete picture of the 42 million people who participate in SNAP and the 7.3 million women, infants and children in the WIC program.

USDA Photo by Lance Cheung.  “The safest bet in America is American agriculture!” That’s the way Secretary Tom Vilsack led off his remarks to the 2,000 farmers, ranchers, agriculture officials and industry leaders in attendance at today’s Agricultural Outlook Forum in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. Referring to statistics detailed a short time earlier by USDA Chief Economist Joseph Glauber, the Secretary pledged to continue to aggressively promote the export of American agricultural products.  He said trade will help create American jobs – especially in the agriculture sector.  Especially important, said the Secretary, are growing economies like those in Indonesia and Vietnam, both of which the Secretary is scheduled to visit later in the year.  The Secretary also noted that American farmers have tremendous opportunities represented by the growth of biobased products and biofuels.  And he told the audience that American agricultural producers deserve our utmost respect and appreciation, for continuing to produce food that costs the average American consumer less than 10 percent of his or her paycheck. The Secretary was preceded by Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow, Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, who discussed the upcoming Farm Bill.  The Senator noted that agriculture is very important to Michigan’s economy, second only to California in crop diversity.  Agriculture in Michigan, she said, represents one in four jobs which is why she thinks of the next farm bill as “a jobs bill.” Following the Senator and the Secretary, Former President Bill Clinton began with stories about his childhood in rural, agriculture-centered Arkansas and then talked about the central role that agriculture plays in solving the issues facing the world’s population.  “We’re living in a highly complicated environment,” the former President said.  He went on to note that a billion people go to bed hungry every night, while in urban areas of developing countries there is an increasing problem of obesity and diabetes.  Noting that no country ever moved ahead without first developing a strong agricultural base, he spoke of efforts in Africa to pull people out of poverty through rural development and education. The former President also noted the importance of elevating the status of women in developing countries, educating them, and giving them job opportunities.  He said that agriculture will be at the “vortex” of major global issues. The forum continues through tomorrow. For more information click here.

"Assistant Director & Emily Weidner, Natural Resource Specialist, Cooperative Forestry, Ecosystem Services and Markets, U.S. Forest Service in  Conservation  Forestry  Mar 23,   More and more these days we recognize that clean water is one of the most important products of our forests.  Forest lands are the source of nearly two-thirds of water in the 48 contiguous states -- the clean water that fills our rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands, sustains our fisheries, or flows from the taps of our homes and businesses.  Forests serve as a living sponge to capture, store and slowly release precipitation as well as trapping and transforming the chemicals and nutrient deposits that come in the rain or from adjacent runoff.  All the benefits that forests provide—like erosion and sediment control, maintenance of water quality, regulation of flows, and provision of clean drinking water—are called ecosystem services, and in this case can be called watershed services. Market-based financing of watershed management through payment for watershed services (PWS) schemes –a type of payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme, is emerging as a promising instrument to connect the forests to the faucet in clear economic terms. In a PWS scheme, landowners are financially compensated for the watershed services they provide.  The payment for watershed services helps incentivize watershed protection and leads to net increases in forest protection and improved management. For example, in New York City, the local government pays landowners for provision of watershed services directly and provides a suite of enhanced services to landowners, in part funded by water users downstream.  Through conservation easements, riparian restoration, and land purchase, the city has protected more than 35% of the watershed. A watershed forestry program, run by the non-profit Watershed Agricultural Council in partnership with city, state and federal partners including the U. S. Forest Service, provides the enhanced services and incentives to landowners. Abundant, clean water is a precious resource and one of the most valuable products provided by public and private forest lands. Drinking water is also one of most direct links between people and the valuable services that forests provide. Private forest owners and the Forest Service clearly have an important responsibility as stewards of not just the land but the nation’s liquid assets as well.

"USDA NASS Public Affairs Specialist in  Research and Science  May 01,  Members of the United States Armed Forces sacrifice so much to keep us safe and protect our country. Every May Americans recognize their efforts and express gratitude during Military Appreciation Month. At USDA, we also celebrate the contributions that our Military members have made to agriculture and farming. In , for the first time the Census of Agriculture, conducted by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), collected information about agricultural producers who served or are currently serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. The resulting showed that 370,619 producers – 11% of the country’s 3.4 million producers – had military service. These producers accounted for 129,144,965 acres and $41 billion in agriculture sales. Farms operated by producers with military service accounted for 11% of total U.S. agriculture sales, with 53% ($22 billion) in crop sales and 47% ($19 billion) in sales of livestock and livestock products. The ag census also found that 17% of all farms had a producer who served or is serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. The Census of Agriculture, currently underway, will provide updated information on military producers, which they can use when making decisions about their operations. Collecting on producers with military service is critical to providing needed programs and services. For example, USDA offers programs that benefit veterans who want to transition to agriculture, or start or expand a rural business. USDA is committed to ensuring service members have the tools they need to grow and thrive in agriculture. It’s not too late for all producers to respond to the ag census. Options for response are online at agcounts.usda.gov or by mail. To learn more about the Census of Agriculture, visit nass.usda.gov/AgCensus.

"Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Apr 09,  John Curtis, contract instructor, demonstrates milling techniques at a workshop sponsored by USDA’s Caribbean Climate Hub. The workshop was held at the University of Puerto Rico Agricultural Experimental Station in Corozal, Puerto Rico. (Photo by William Gould) The United States and its territories have suffered five consecutive years of at least $10 billion weather and climate disasters. And, for five consecutive years, USDA’s Climate Hubs have been there to help American agriculture prepare for and respond to these and other major climate events. Climate Hubs were introduced in February to develop and deliver science-based information, technology, tools, and education to help stakeholders make climate-informed decisions in 10 specific regions. “The Climate Hubs connect USDA research to programs and serve as a model for how to put climate resilience into practice,” said Rachel Steele, national climate hub lead with USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS). Climate Hubs, led by ARS and U.S. Forest Service, include representatives from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, Farm Service Agency, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and Risk Management Agency. Scientists in the hubs assess climate risks and vulnerabilities based on regional needs, including drought, forest and crop resilience, and threats from pests and disease. One of the most highly-visible efforts to date has been the Caribbean Climate Hub’s response to devastation in Puerto Rico caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. After discovering that the storms damaged about 30 million of the island’s trees, staff provided training to develop knowledge and technical skills that improved the island’s capacity to generate high-value products from the downed trees, such as furniture, musical instruments, and artisanal products. In the North Central United States, staff at the Northern Plains Climate Hub in Fort Collins, CO, and their collaborators developed Grassland Productivity Forecast (Grass-Cast), an online tool that helps ranchers predict the amount of vegetation on rangelands. Grass-Cast provides ranchers and other land managers with information about the likely availability – or shortage – of grazing resources in their area. Over five years, the Climate Hubs have provided critical resources and services (, 613 ), including collectively providing technical expertise to more than 17,000 people through 237 webinars, podcasts, and other digital media; participating in more than 410 peer-reviewed publications and 690 other papers; sharing climate-related education resources to more than 15,000 youth at over 50 events; and developing 36 pieces of formal curricula geared toward USDA staff, producers, foresters, land managers, and K-12 students. In its five-year review, the Climate Hub Executive Committee learned that demand for programs and products exceeds current capacity. The Committee determined that the hubs could play a larger role co-producing regionally relevant science. “The Hubs are poised to support the regional implementation of the USDA’s Agriculture Innovation Agenda, recently announced by Secretary Perdue, and the climate adaptation components of the USDA’s Science Blueprint (, 2.6 ),” Steele said. “In a world with growing populations and at-risk natural resources, increasing production while reducing our ecological footprint will foster a resilient agricultural sector that can withstand the spectrum of environmental shocks and extreme events. “The hubs are a model for ensuring that working land managers, extension professionals, and agricultural advisors have the information, , and tools they need to build landscape-level climate resilience,” she said.

"New Study Offers Sage Advice  For many, one of the New Year’s first big chores is to remove a tree from inside their home. Trees, beautiful and useful as they are, do not belong everywhere. Such is the case with trees and other woody species that are expanding into the Western grasslands. Over the years, woody species like juniper, pinyon pine, redcedar and mesquite have encroached on grassland and sagebrush ecosystems, altering these landscapes and making them unsuitable for native wildlife like the lesser prairie-chicken and greater sage-grouse. Encroaching conifers also degrade rangelands for agricultural producers whose livestock rely on nutritious forage.

"Eastern Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jul 29,   You can actually feel the wonder while discovering a new side of the U.S. Forest Service at Shedd Aquarium’s new Great Lakes Exhibit At Home on the Great Lakes. The Shedd Aquarium, on famous Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, unveiled the exhibit as part of its renovation of the facility’s historic Local Waters Gallery. The exhibit features exciting new interactive components. Visitors experience a connection to the Great Lakes through hands-on learning and up-close encounters with native Great Lakes species. “There is a strong connection between the health of national forests and the health of the Great Lakes,” said Regional Forester Kathleen Atkinson. “The Forest Service is thrilled to collaborate with the Shedd Aquarium to raise awareness about the interconnectedness of these resources.” After strolling through Shedd’s impressive views of aquatic species from around the world, visitors come “home” to the Great Lakes. Upon entering At Home on the Great Lakes, visitors are greeted by a very special welcoming committee of three lake sturgeons in a “touch pool.” Visitors have the opportunity to touch the “freshwater giant” that is sometimes referred to as a “living fossil.” Found in all five Great Lakes, lake sturgeon are the longest and largest living fish in the Great Lakes, growing up to 9 feet long and weighing as much as 200 pounds. The Forest Service Eastern Region is a proud partner of this exhibit, providing funding to Shedd Aquarium through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. One of the emphasis areas of this initiative is education and outreach to the general public on aquatic and terrestrial invasive species. Making this partnership even more significant is the fact that six Eastern Region national forests are within the Great Lakes basin – Chequamegon-Nicolet, Ottawa, Hiawatha, Superior, Huron-Manistee, and Finger Lakes national forests. Shedd Aquarium focuses on four key Great Lakes issues: building awareness of ecological separation; contributing to solution oriented research to address invasive species; accelerating habitat restoration; and protecting and promoting native wildlife. Visitors to the aquarium will also see Asian carp, sea lampreys and the small but destructive round gobies, all invasive species threatening the health of U.S. waterways. The exhibit helps visitors understand what they can do to help prevent the spread of these invasive species. Digital technology enhances the visitor experience, allowing guests to learn more about the species they see, as well as get breaking news from monitors providing real-time updates on basin-wide conservation news and events. The Forest Service has long been a partner with Shedd, who provides an outlet for education and outreach at an extremely large scale – 2 million people visit the aquarium each year.

"Administrator, USDA Rural Development Rural Utilities Service in  USDA Results  May 24,   Cross posted from the White House blog:  Twenty business leaders from Mexico, Missouri, joined me at the Mid America Brick plant recently for the first White House Business Council Roundtable meeting in Missouri.  President Obama asked me, along with other senior Administration officials, to facilitate a discussion to seek their input on ways the federal government can improve economic conditions and help them create jobs. When you think of “bricks and mortar” for cementing economic development, there is no better place than the heartland of America at a brick plant for a setting.  Mexico, Missouri, was once known as the brick capital of the world, but its biggest factory shut down in .  An energetic entrepreneur, Frank Cordie, CEO of Mid America Brick, is bringing it back to life.  Mr. Cordie graciously hosted and assisted with inviting key business leaders from the region.  His company is using USDA funding, as well as other financing, to restore this icon of the local business community, which at one time was the main employer in this rural town.  A tour of the plant made me believe he is well on the way to success.  I have never found a more committed group of leaders to their community. This roundtable was one of many the Obama administration is holding to get feedback on ways we can help businesses expand, create jobs and improve the economic base in their area.  The goal was to hear what the Federal government should do more of -- and what we need to do less of – to help them jumpstart the economy.  We discussed what resources the government needs to provide, and how we sometimes need just to get out of the way. The business leaders provided some very candid comments.   It was a great opportunity to learn from them about what was working, and hear about some of the barriers they face in running their businesses.  We discussed challenges with access to capital and the importance of USDA financing, regulatory barriers, excessive red tape, the need to better prepare for our energy future, and how the tax structure affects small business. President Obama asked me not just to get feedback, but to make sure his staff at the White House are fully apprised of the concerns and ideas that were raised in these meetings.  I am sending a comprehensive report to the White House so we can use what we learned to continue to grow the economy, and put Americans back to work, and win the future. As President Obama said in the State of the Union address, we want to out-innovate, out-educate, and out build our competitors in order to sustain our leadership and secure prosperity for all Americans.  Drawing on the insights of these business leaders in rural Missouri, we will do just that.

USDA photo by Bob Nichols. Recently, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack opened the G-8 International Conference on Open for Agriculture here in Washington.  As head of the U.S. Delegation, the Secretary noted that “ is quickly becoming one of the most important commodities in agriculture,” and encouraged the sharing of to magnify its power. Hundreds of individuals attended from around the world and thousands more watched the event as it was streamed on the Internet. In this blog, Katherine Townsend, Special Assistant for Engagement at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) gives an example of how open can improve crop yield and help producers keep more of the income generated by their labor. Jimmy Wambua, a social justice worker and young entrepreneur in Nairobi, Kenya, saw a problem. In a country where smallholder farmers grow the food that feeds the Kenyan people, crop yields were not reaching their full potential and growers were not getting a fair price. Decisions about what crops to plant and when were made on speculation and instinct, and farmers sold their crops based on prices offered by middlemen and traders. A solution seemed evident: increase access and sharing of information that already exists and is public, but is not in-use by the farmers. Jimmy joined the M-Farm organization that set up a text-message based mobile phone application for farmers to gain a better price by accessing market price for their crops- rather than relying on the word of the buyer- and provide a platform for farmers to sell their goods online. USAID contributed to the work of M-Farm- not through a grant or loan or other financial capital- but with information capital. With the release of an open set from the Famine Early Warning System (FEWSNet) M-Farm now has access to ten years of historic about market prices of crops, which show trends in crop price fluctuation, and enables better decision making on which crops to plant to yield the highest income. M-Farm’s story was just one of dozens that took the stage April 29 & 30 at the G-8 International Open Agriculture Conference and showcased innovative organizations that use open to support global food security. Dr. Howard-Yana Shapiro of Mars Global shared progress on mapping the genomes of over 100 crops that are vital to food security, but are overlooked because they are not commercially viable. Palantir Technologies and Grameen Foundation displayed their open app that they developed at USAID’s Hack for Hunger,which uses community knowledge worker-collected and Palantir analytics to build a crop-specific food security early warning system for farmers in Uganda. The concept of open agriculture fuses transparency and technology to improve food security worldwide; farmers, entrepreneurs, and researchers recognize the impact and potential of increasing access to information and are increasingly receiving high-level support. USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack touted the U.S. Government’s leadership role in increasing open for development impact and for global growth. Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, highlighted the use of open genomic to leapfrog development of new agricultural products. Dr. Kathryn Sullivan, acting NOAA Administrator and the first American woman to walk in space, delivered an inspiring perspective of the role that can play in transcending and unifying an Earth without country borders or sector divisions. Four hundred food security specialists, scientists, and technology experts gathered with policy makers from G-8 and the six African New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition countries to work together to increase available information and launch G-8 country action plans to get more open from both the public and private sector. U.S. Chief Technology Officer and Special Assistant to the President Todd Park cheered the work of the conference stating that, “by liberating from the vaults of government and the private sector, we can accelerate the use of open agriculture and nutrition to advance global food security while also fueling the growth of new businesses and jobs.” USAID has been consistently demonstrating its role as a leader in increasing open . Multiple G-8 conference speakers joined because of products they had made as a result of the December Development DataJam that USAID’s Innovation & Development Alliances (IDEA) office co-hosted with the White House Office of Science & Technology Policy. At the DataJam, USAID leadership joined with other issue experts, innovators, scientists, and entrepreneurs to commit to developing prototypes that use open to improve international. Continuing the support of these and other innovators and social entrepreneurs, last week USAID launched www.usaid.gov/developer with new datasets and tools that had previously not been available to the public, including some we support through Feed the Future the U.S. Government’s global hunger and food security initiative. Each of these datasets are useful on their own, and when compared and applied with other datasets from USAID and other organizations, they have the growing potential to dramatically increase the impact and efficiency of international assistance. In an increasingly networked and tech-savvy world, open has the potential for more people to use information for social good, and USAID and global development goals directly benefit from increasing access to information.Like any technological tool, open is useless without the people applying and engaging with it. Only through active and consistent participation can we ensure that information is timely, useful, and used. We can expect that these changes will come. Let’s get that information online and useable.

"for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services Michael Scuse in  Trade  Apr 11,  Acting Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services Michael Scuse takes a handful of U.S. soybeans used at a ‘tempeh/tofu village’ production site in East Jakarta on April 6. Scuse visited the village – which uses 100 percent U.S. soybeans to produce tempeh and tofu, which are soy-based stables of the Indonesian diet – during an Agribusiness Trade and Investment Mission to Indonesia that he led last week. Photographer, Danumurthi Mahendra, U.S. Embassy, Jakarta  This is the third in a series of three blogs affiliated with USDA’s Agribusiness Trade and Investment Mission, which was led by Acting Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services Michael Scuse.  While leading this week’s Agribusiness Trade and Investment Mission to Indonesia, I’ve been gratified to see firsthand how U.S. food and agricultural products are benefitting the Indonesian people. My itinerary included a visit to a tempeh and tofu production compound, or village, in the Cipayung neighborhood of East Jakarta, where local workers are using U.S. soybeans to produce nutritious, affordable, high-quality food products. Tempeh, a cake made from fermented soybeans, and tofu or soybean curd, are staples of the Indonesian diet. Those with limited incomes rely on these relatively inexpensive, soy-based products for their high protein and nutrient content. Demand for the products continues to grow, especially in Greater Jakarta, which has one of the fastest-growing population rates of any urban area in the world. But historically, tempeh and tofu production has been small-scale, informal and often unhygienic. In January , the American Soybean Association-International Marketing (ASA-IM) – which receives export market development funding from USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service – established Forum Tempeh Indonesia (FTI) to provide support to small-scale tempeh producers at the village level, particularly in the area of proper hygiene.  Mercy Corps International, a U.S.-based humanitarian organization, has partnered with FTI to renovate tempeh and tofu production facilities in Jakarta under a pilot project. Supported by technical assistance through ASA, as well as private-sector funding, FTI and Mercy Corps have upgraded tempeh village facilities, hygiene practices and production equipment. As a result, production costs at these project sites have been reduced by as much as 30 percent. Despite Indonesia’s growing demand for soybeans, the country’s domestic production is relatively limited. In fact, more than ates. U.S. soybean sales to Indonesia have grown 40 percent in the last six years, reaching a record $805 million in calendar year and making it our fifth-largest market. All of the soybeans used at the Cipayung tempeh village come from the United States. On my visit, I watched each step in the production process, and couldn’t help but feel pride in that U.S. support has helped to improve production of a food source important to Indonesians, and that U.S. soybeans are playing such a crucial role in feeding the Indonesian people and the world.

"USDA Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Mar 18,  More than 4,200 markets and direct marketing farmers now redeem SNAP benefits across the country. Farmers’ market incentive programs, which couple access to healthy foods with incentives to purchase healthy products while at the market, help SNAP recipients consume a healthy diet. As spring marches closer, farmers markets across the country are ramping up or reopening for the season. In addition to year-round staples like local milk, meat, and grains, the stars of the season—asparagus, onions, new potatoes, lamb, and greens of all varieties—are beginning to make their debuts. In a few months’ time, the markets will be in full swing, bursting with berries and zucchini and other summer fruits and vegetables. Here at USDA, we’re working hard to ensure participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have access to this healthful, local bounty. Remarkable progress has been made in providing better access to the nation’s 8,200 farmers markets and farm stands; more than 4,200 markets and direct marketing farmers now redeem SNAP benefits.  Beyond providing heightened access to farmers markets, we know that coupling access with incentives to purchase healthy products while at the market helps SNAP recipients consume a healthy diet. A new report from USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service makes clear that private sector organizations share the goal of increasing access and incentives, and are willing to dedicate financial resources to ensuring the success of this approach. Researchers for the Farmers Market Incentive Provider Study interviewed representatives from more than 100 organizations that provide financial incentives to SNAP participants redeeming their benefits at farmers markets.  Wholesome Wave is a great example of a not-for-profit organization that partners with 305 farmers markets in 24 states with nutrition incentive programs for doubling SNAP, WIC, and Senior Farmers Market vouchers at farmers markets. The USDA report researched how these organizations design and run their incentive programs, how they choose markets to participate, and how they evaluate the success of their efforts. The study also identified challenges that they face; it’s no surprise that securing sustained funding topped the list. Farmer’s market incentive programs are discovering new partnerships and affinities with health care organizations, local public health efforts, philanthropies, donors, and others in support of their work.  But the need for institutional local support far exceeds current private reserves.  In that regard, I am happy to report that the new Agriculture Act of enacted and signed by President Obama provides additional support for incentive programs.  Although the details are still being finalized, the legislation includes $100 million in grant money to provide federal matching funds for incentive projects that increase the amount of fruits and vegetables bought by SNAP households.  State, local, and tribal agencies; nonprofits; SNAP-authorized retailers; and economic development agencies, among others, are eligible to apply for the grants. I’m encouraged by the efforts of the many incentive providers and partners highlighted in the study, and pleased that soon USDA will be able to contribute much needed financial resources to augment the impact of these important programs. It’s clear that in working together we can help SNAP participants fill their farmer’s market baskets with items sure to support a healthy diet and a healthy farm economy in communities across the country. And that is the kind of ‘yield’ that both farmers and consumers alike can applaud. Editor’s Note: To further enhance SNAP redemptions at farmers markets, USDA also recently funded the creation of MarketLink.org, a website that assists farmers markets in becoming SNAP-authorized and helps them determine whether they are eligible for no-cost Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) equipment.

"New York USDA Public Affairs Intern in  Initiatives  Rural  Sep 11,   “Back to School Week” is often the most thrilling and the hectic time for students (As a student I have experienced this first hand). The campus atmosphere is filled with excitement, expectation and the ringing of laughter. In between purchasing textbooks and memorizing course schedules students are busy reconnecting with old friends, making new ones, getting involved in campus activities and moving into their dorms.  For many students in rural areas, these activities fade at the end of the day as they return home.  However, there is a growing movement amongst rural community colleges to extend the college experience. Colleges like Fulton-Montgomery Community College (FMCC) are offering dormitory housing to students.  Students living on campus is common place at major colleges and universities however, is seldom seen in rural community colleges.  This is changing.  During a recent tour promoting “Back to School Week”  Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development Doug O’Brien discovered first hand just how so. At a recent stop in New York Mr. O’Brien attended the grand opening of the FMCC Student Housing facility dubbed “Raiders Hall”.  As the Guest Speaker Mr. O’Brien’s day started early and a little haphazard as my struggle with a GPS, organizing a an impromptu staff meeting, and an equally impromptu campus tour (see note on GPS difficulties) were highlights but not the main event. Mr. O’Brien was in town promoting “Back to School Week” against the back drop of FMCC’s newly complete dormitory.  The idea of dormitories at rural community colleges is taking hold in upstate New York.  Through a $11.3 million dollar Community Facilities loan, FMCC is able enhance the college experience for rural residence. Raiders Hall is (in my opinion.) such a wonderful example of how Rural Development funds can make a huge difference in rural educational facilities. As Mr. O’Brien noted it is essential that rural areas, like Johnstown, have access to the best educational technology, training and facilities in order to gain the skills necessary to meet local economic demands as well as to compete on a national and even an international level. I am proud to be part of endeavors like this.  Helping rural communities achieve their vision, in this case, educational goals, is what makes Rural Development such a special agency.

"Food and Nutrition  Trade  Jun 08,   Senior Advisor to the Administrator, USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service What comes to your mind when you think of Iraq? Like many, my perceptions were created by years of media reporting. On Saturday, I arrived in Baghdad in a Blackhawk helicopter, and am still processing my feelings of heartbreak and inspiration. Yesterday I was honored to open the first U.S. agribusiness trade mission to Iraq in more than 20 years. At the opening plenary session, nearly 20 U.S. companies and more than 150 Iraqi entrepreneurs and buyers were present, as well as U.S. and Iraqi government officials.  The U.S. companies on the mission are both large and small, representing commodity, consumer-ready food, and forest product industries, as well as agricultural input suppliers, including agricultural equipment and irrigation system manufacturers. The purpose of this trade mission is simple: to increase U.S. agricultural exports to Iraq, promote joint ventures, and boost investment in Iraq’s developing agricultural sector. Over two days, U.S. and Iraqi producers, processors, buyers, traders, and investors will meet face-to-face in dozens of one-on-one meetings. In these meetings business will be conducted, ideas will be exchanged, and friendships will be forged. The courage and optimism of all the participants cannot be overstated. We hope this mission will be looked back on as a turning point in our relationship. As Ambassador Christopher Hill said in the opening address, we hope we will move from America being represented by General Petraeus and General Odierno, to General Foods and General Mills. Agriculture is an important part of Iraq’s economy.  It is the country’s second largest economic sector, accounting for 9.6 percent of its gross domestic product and employing about 20 percent of its labor force. The country’s farmers produce wheat, barley, rice, vegetables, dates, cotton, livestock, and poultry.  But, with Iraq’s population expected to nearly double in the next 25 years, agricultural imports, including those produced by Iraqi farmers plus edible oils, pulses, and a variety of consumer-ready products, are needed to feed the country’s growing urban middle class and low-income consumers.  In addition, Iraq has vast natural resources and great potential to further boost agricultural productivity and output of a broad array of farm products. What it needs are agricultural inputs, such as seeds, feed, and machinery to put this potential to work. With greater access to inputs, Iraq’s agricultural sector can develop more quickly. The U.S. companies on this mission can meet these varied needs. USDA’s strategy also reflects the Strategic Framework Agreement that the United States and Iraq signed in December . That agreement outlines the U.S.-Iraq bilateral relationship and recognizes that building a prosperous and diversified economy in Iraq will be key to its stability and integration into the world economy. I am someone who has worked for over 30 years to promote America’s agricultural exports all over the world. Nothing prepared me for what I have seen here and the spirit and resilience and spirit of the USDA and entire U.S. Government and military team working here in Iraq to give the people here a better chance to live the way anyone would want to, in security and freedom. USDA Head of Delegation Dan Berman discussed the benefits of expanded agriculture trade with Iraqi TV at the June 8 kickoff for the U.S.-Iraq Agriculture Trade Mission in Baghdad. Ambassador Christopher R. Hill opened the U.S.-Iraq Agriculture Trade Mission for an audience of more than 175 U.S. and Iraqi farmers, business people and officials.  Minister of Trade Dr. Safaeddin Mohamed Safi, Senior Deputy Minister of Agriculture Dr. Subhi Al-Jumailly and USDA Head of Delegation Dan Berman also offered remarks at the opening ceremony.

"Deputy Administrator, AMS Livestock and Seed Program in  Research and Science  Dec 30,  The brand of soy-based turf blanketing the Kansas State Wildcats outdoor stadium qualifies for the USDA Biopreferred program, and is an environmentally-friendly alternative to petroleum-based products. Photo courtesy Kansas State Athletics. When a Kansas State University football player plants his opponent’s face into the turf, the result may be a better-tasting blend of artificial grass. Turf is not a part of the USDA’s MyPlate recommendations, but defensive ends playing in the Wildcats’ stadium can skip their pre-game soy latte and get their fill during the game instead. Kansas State claims to be the first NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision institution to install soy-based AstroTurf. The synthetic grass also being used at some Major League Baseball and National Football League stadiums is an environmentally-friendly and sustainable alternative to petroleum-based products. With the help of the United Soybean Board, Kansas State was able to join the ranks of other sports organizations using soy-based turf. Building global demand for U.S. soybeans is the mission of the United Soybean Board, which recently celebrated its 20th anniversary.  The board is administered by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service, and is a checkoff program supported by a collective investment from farmers. The funds are used to strengthen the position of soybeans in the marketplace and expand domestic and foreign markets. The Board’s promotion and outreach efforts spur global demand for U.S.-grown soybeans, which has risen by more than 140 percent over the past 20 years. Over the last 20 years, the cohesive research and development work of the soybean checkoff has identified many new uses for soy, and the Kansas State football field is just one example of the program’s success. Bob Haselwood, the board’s New Uses Chair, said industrial use of U.S. soy has increased 50 percent since . The animal agriculture sector is the primary user of soybeans for the production of feed, but Haselwood said soybean oil is also applied in the development of paint, cleaners and other products. The brand of soy-based turf blanketing the Kansas State Wildcats outdoor stadium qualifies for the USDA BioPreferred program. The program promotes the increased purchase and use of biobased products, and is expected to spur economic development, create new jobs, and provide new markets for farm communities. The USDA BioPreferred program compiles a catalog of biobased products. Biobased products are commercial or industrial products (other than food or feed) that are composed in whole, or in significant part, of biological products, renewable agricultural materials (including plant, animal, and marine materials), or forestry materials. The Farm Bill extended the definition of biobased products to include biobased intermediate ingredients or feedstocks. So the next time you watch a Wildcats home football game, remember that the players are literally running on soy.  And that the United Soybean Board, under the oversight of USDA, helped bring this sustainable product into the sports arena.

"U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 13,  The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) hosts a free workshop on gene banks for conservation of tree species in Chicago, IL, May 16-19, . Details are available at www.fs.fed.us/geneworkshop. The story of Super Girl being placed in a pod on Krypton and fired off to earth to help save her cousin and at least some of her species is science fiction. But for many species the danger of extinction from climate change, habitat destruction, or invasive exotic pests is the real deal. At an upcoming Gene Conservation Workshop experts will discuss different ways to safeguard species from climate change and other threats. For forest tree species that are experiencing rapid declines due to invasive exotic pests or climate change, long term seed storage is our best hope so that they can be returned to the wild once a control is found. Humans have learned how to preserve vulnerable plant species from extinction, and preserve a wide range of unique individual traits found in plant genes that may help them survive in the future. You can find some of these species including white pine and ash along with a wide variety of other non-endangered plant species at U.S. Forest Service, National Seed Laboratory and Agricultural Research Service seed banks. But the challenge is daunting. For example, blister rust on white pines in the Rocky Mountains and Emerald ash borer on ash species in the eastern US are killing the trees faster than a solution can be found. To save vulnerable species we need to follow their propagation patterns. Seeds of most plants in temperate zones must drift some distance from the mother plant once they mature. As this often occurs during dry weather the seeds must have the ability to dry out without dying. The seeds go into stasis and drift off in their own little escape pod with an embryo safely carried in each seed. During their journey, humid air surrounding the seed results in higher moisture content and dryer air results in lower moisture content for the seeds. Seeds will always adjust their moisture content to the relative humidity around them. Seed scientists have found that adequate drying of seeds for long-term storage occurs when the air around the seeds is at or close to 30 percent relative humidity. If the air is more humid the biological activity in the seed increases and the seeds begin to lose viability. If the air is much dryer than 30 percent relative humidity water is removed from the seed that is needed for the structural integrity of the cells and physical and chemical damage occurs. So, once the seeds have fully adjusted their moisture content in the ideal environment of 30 percent relative humidity, lab technicians seal them in moisture proof containers to prevent them from reabsorbing moisture should the relative humidity around them increase. Seeds that are dried adequately, sealed in moisture proof packets, and kept at 0o F, can be kept for decades without any decrease in germination and the ability to produce a new plant.

"Administrator of USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA) in  Equity  Initiatives  Mar 11,  It’s Women’s History Month and I am proud to work alongside so many great women leaders at USDA. When I was asked last year to lead the Risk Management Agency it came as a surprise. Living far from the Washington Beltway in South Dakota, in a rural area, I could not imagine why this administration would want me to head an agency of such importance. I am not a well-known political leader or influencer. However, this administration made a commitment to embrace diversity. They decided in the best interest of this Nation to seek out qualified women for important roles. And choosing me did come down to some important qualifications, including 40 years of operating a farm, serving as a county executive for the Farm Service Agency, working in the private sector, and my belief that Federal crop insurance is invaluable to the success of any ag operation. This administration’s decision to choose me is a testament not to me, but to this administration's commitment to ALL women. They recognize the value of women in agriculture and what women continue to do throughout time - their day-to-day work, supporting partners, and their desires to make things better for their families, which is why this month - Women's History Month - is so important to me. Sometime this month, please find a moment to reflect on the contributions and sacrifices of women to society and in our personal lives. Marcia Bunger is the Administrator of USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA). Prior to her appointment, she served as a County Executive Director for USDA’s Farm Service Agency. Bunger is also the owner and operator of a -acre farm and the first member of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community and first woman to serve as RMA Administrator.

However, translation services can verify any translation received from software. The United States is a multilingual Country. According to a U.S. Census Bureau survey, nearly 68 million people in the U.S. speak a language other than English at home. Each year the U.S. welcomes more than 800,000 new citizens from all over the world. President Biden’s Executive Order entitled, Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, dated February 16, , states, “Agencies shall consider opportunities to ….

Executive Order 6 and Title VI provide meaningful access to USDA programs for members of the public who have limited English proficiency. Departmental Regulation -005, dated June 4, , establishes policies and procedures and requires each USDA agency to prepare a language access plan covering Federally conducted programs and activities, that include needs and capacity assessment; oral language assistance services; written translations; policies and procedures; notification of the availability of free language services; staff training; assessing accessibility, and quality. USDA Limited English Proficiency Translation and Interpretation Services Guide Names and Pronouns Using an individual's correct pronouns is a powerful affirmation of self for transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals. It validates one's identity, encourages authenticity and builds inclusive and supportive cultures. USDA's correspondence and communication should aim to adopt the use of gender-inclusive pronouns; and normalize clarifying pronouns in communication to eliminate the possibility of misgendering individuals. As a default, the pronouns “they/them/their” should be used in USDA sponsored communications, outreach, and correspondence rather than ""he/she pronouns, unless Program guidance specifically directs otherwise. An individual communicates their pronouns. For example, “Hi my name is John Doe and my pronouns are he/him/his” instead of “Hi my name is John Doe.” A good practice is to inquire into an individual's preferred greeting. If they share, we must respect an individual's request. This also applies to non-written communication such as when interacting in person, via phone, and video calls. Gender Inclusive Communications Guidebook (, 550 ) Tools for Readability and Accessibility Section 508 Standards are established and maintained by the U.S. Access Board.

"APHIS Public Affairs Specialist in  Animals  Plants  May 22,  Photo credit: Mark Trail via @ComicsKingdom Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) Awareness week is May 17-23 and my tenure in a nationally syndicated comic strip is coming to an end, so it’s a good time to tell you how a new USDA employee wound up cartoon-ized. The Mark Trail strip—known for its environmental themes—just finished a six-week long storyline about the invasive EAB.  The EAB, a small metallic green wood-boring beetle, destroys ash trees and is now found in 25 U.S. States.  The Mark Trail strip features “Agent Abbey Powell from the USDA” and shares information about the EAB. To view the comic—beginning with my debut—visit Mark Trail. How did this happen? James Allen, the strip’s current author, called the APHIS Public Affairs Office with his interest in developing the storyline. I took Allen’s call and answered his questions—not suspecting at the time that I would end up in the comic!  He was curious about the EAB, which likely arrived in the US in the late ’s or early s, in solid wood packing material.  In response, APHIS now requires that imported wood packing material be treated to kill any invasive pests that may be hitchhiking inside.  I provided an outline of how the USDA would respond if Mark Trail contacted us about the EAB, and developed a scenario to fit into his planned storyline. I told Allen about the sticky purple traps APHIS uses to survey for EAB and the stingless wasps we release as a biological control. “Abbey got right on the task and sent over a treasure trove of info and pictures. Details of everything... step by step procedures of their approach to identifying the insect, quarantine of the area and biocontrol practices. Abbey was so helpful, I asked her permission to put her in the strip as an agent of the USDA,” said Allen. “She kindly obliged and sent a picture of herself. I referenced from her photo and made her a ""Mark Trail-ized"" character,” he added. While I provided key messages, it was Allen who crafted the story and art for each installment. He took some scientific and other liberties—ranging from my job title (“Agent Powell” instead of public affairs specialist) to technical points concerning the biology and behavior of EAB, and the story’s ending. Allen and I have both been flattered by the response. He said, “As I continued writing the story, her part began to grow. It seems the public's interest grew as well. Readers at the Comics Kingdom website were posting things like ‘I searched Abbey Powell... there is one that actually works at the USDA!’ ... and ‘I found her LinkedIn profile and she looks like the character in the strip!’” I’m humbled and honored to be part of this comic strip with national reach to help raise public awareness about EAB and other invasive pests and diseases and what APHIS does to combat these threats.

Ms. Stacie Lee, the Food Service Manager at Eagle Butte, has been running the Seamless Summer Option through the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) at the site for 11 years.  The site is the largest in the area and with the USDA meals reimbursement, she is able to cover most of her expenses, “It practically pays for itself”, says Ms. Lee, “except it doesn't cover all salaries but it does pay for food, freight, storage. It may pay for one or two salaries”.  Ms Lee adds, “The kids really inspire me to run this program”. Smiling while eating a healthy lunch at the Eagle Butte feeding site. During our visit, the kids enjoyed a healthy breakfast made up of an egg and cheese burrito, fruit, juice and milk.  The lunch menu featured home-made pizza made with whole grain dough, tossed salad, fruit and milk.  Overwhelming, the kids said their favorite part of the meal was the fruit option – plum. Many of the kids joining in summer meals also participant in the Diabetes Prevention Program where the kids enjoy pool activities from 10 AM – 12 Noon, then join summer meals directly afterwards with the pool onsite at the Eagle Butte school. As part of our visit, the Cheyenne Eagle Butte School Drum Circle honored us with traditional songs.  The drum circle’s leader, Mr. Emmanuel Red Bear, is Eagle Butte’s Lakota Language teacher and plays an active role in developing young youth following Lakota traditions.  “These songs have been handed down to generation after generation pretty much the same melody and the same beat. It’s good to know that these young guys can sing these kinds of songs. It makes me feel good to know that the culture isn't going to die out”.

"Rocky Mountain Region, USDA Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 28,  Fuel breaks on the White River National Forest in Colorado directly protect nearby homes during the Buffalo Fire in the community of Silverthorne, Colo. on June 12, . (Photo credit: USDA) When the Buffalo Fire sparked on the White River National Forest on June 12, the flames stopped short of nearly 1,400 residences near Silverthorne, Colorado. But, it wasn’t just the air support from firefighting helicopters and tankers and the more than 150 firefighters on scene that helped prevent a catastrophe in two small mountain subdivisions. Part of the success can also be attributed to proactive work over the last decade to build fuel breaks and reduce hazardous fuels where homes meet wild lands or what is called the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). “The fuel breaks reduced the number of trees available to burn next to homes; gave firefighters safe spots to aggressively fight the fire; and provided for effective fire-retardant drop zones,” said Bill Jackson, district ranger, White River National Forest, USDA Forest Service. “Without the proactive forest treatments, we likely would have lost homes.” Tanker pilots were able to effectively drop fire retardant (pink foreground) as ground crews simultaneously used the fuel breaks as a safer place to engage the Buffalo Fire near Silverthorne, Colo. On June 13, . (Photo credit: USDA) These fuel breaks are 300- to 500-foot wide open spaces developed between the forest and subdivisions where lodgepole pine trees that had been killed by the mountain pine beetle once stood ripe for ignition. The fuel breaks were built as part of larger proactive forest management programs in Summit County and throughout the watershed around the Dillon Reservoir.  “Wildfires don’t know boundaries, so when it comes to forest management in Denver Water’s priority watersheds, we take an all hands, all lands approach,” said Christina Burri, watershed scientist at Denver Water. “By partnering with all the land owners, from federal, state, local and private, we’re able to better protect all of our interests from catastrophic wildfires and extend our investment and reach throughout the entire area.”  One such partnership is the From Forests to Faucets program, which is a forest management partnership between Denver Water and the Rocky Mountain Region of the Forest Service. Since , Denver Water and the USDA Forest Service have invested approximately $33 million for treatments across 70,000 acres. “From Forests to Faucets helps us identify areas where we have common interests in limiting high intensity wildfires and improving forest and watershed health,” Jackson said. “The partnership helped us stretch our funds to treat more acres in Summit County.” In this case, the Forest Service was able to invest in 900 acres of hazardous fuels reduction projects next to the Wildernest and Mesa Cortina neighborhoods above Silverthorne- projects that saved an estimated $913 million worth of homes and infrastructure from the Buffalo Fire. The Colorado State Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service joined From Forests to Faucets in to allow forest managers to take even more of an “all hands, all lands” approach as funds will go to forest treatments on non-federal and private lands as well as national forests.

"Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  USDA Results  May 01,  Brewing tanks from a craft brewery. Massachusetts used a USDA Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program grant to help local farmers tap into the $14.3 billion craft brewing industry. Photo courtesy Greg Peverill-Conti. Over the years, the way we look at food in America has changed and evolved. As people explore new tastes, adjust their diets and become more familiar with new ingredients, it is up to farmers and ranchers to stay innovative and responsive to new demands. Through my role at USDA I often visit with farmers and ranchers about what it takes to grow their businesses, to remain competitive in a global market, and how USDA is an important partner to help meet these challenges. The Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program (FSMIP), administered by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), is designed to support research projects that improve the marketing, transportation and distribution of U.S. agricultural products. FSMIP is a collaboration between Federal and State governments that puts matching funds from each towards projects that bring new opportunities for farmers and ranchers.  In , craft brewing accounted for 14.3 percent of the U.S. beer market—that’s a value of about $14.3 billion. With the market growing 10.9 percent over the last decade, the interest in sourcing local ingredients for the brew has also grown. Looking to tap into the market potential, the Massachusetts Department of Agriculture Resources used a FSMIP grant to partner with the state Brewers Guild. They surveyed craft brewers to assess the variety, volume and value of local ingredients used in the brewing process. Exploring how farmers and brewers can work together to match production and processing requirements, the project is giving Massachusetts growers more opportunities to sell their products. From pumpkin beer to fruit-infused brew, the combination of locally crafted beer and locally sourced ingredients is resulting in some creative partnerships… and some one-of-a-kind beers.  On the opposite end of the grain spectrum, some Americans are looking for alternatives to wheat and barley in their diets. Whether for health reasons or because they want a broader variety of carbohydrates, consumers are interested in more gluten-free options. For Colorado millet growers looking to expand their customer base, it became increasingly important to show consumers how this unique cereal crop can fit into a gluten-free or regular diet. A millet medley with carrots, mushrooms and parsley. The Colorado Department of Agriculture used matching funds from a USDA FSMIP grant to help millet growers in the state market their gluten-free grain to consumers. Photo courtesy Jennifer with recipe at  Using a FSMIP grant, the Colorado Department of Agriculture worked with a graduate nutrition class at Colorado State University in Fort Collins to develop gluten-free recipes using Colorado millet. The students created appetizers, desserts, snacks and entrees such as Black Bean and Millet Medley, Millet Stuffed Peppers and Spiced Millet Pudding. The project also brought the millet industry together, where they worked collectively to better understand and pursue opportunities in the export market.  These are just a couple of examples of the innovative and collaborative spirit inherent to FSMIP projects. USDA will continue to work with states and communities across the country to establish and implement innovative marketing programs that have a positive, lasting effect for states, communities and rural America.

"Deputy Undersecretary, Rural Development in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Nov 05,   The people of Winston County, Mississippi faced many of the same problems as other rural communities across the nation: declining population, rising prices, and family farmers in need of capital, business tools, and new markets for their products.  But they were determined to overcome these challenges. When native son Frank Taylor returned to his hometown after college he established the Winston County Self-Help Cooperative, a consortium of local farmers that pool their resources to receive training in business development, conservation, health, and other topics of concern.  The Cooperative also has a youth program, which teaches vital skills to the next generation of Winston County farmers. Meet youth program leader and “mommy, auntie, granny” Jean Harper as she shows off the youth farm run by the Cooperative, which will grow collards, cabbage, string beans, and more.  Winston County Self-Help Cooperative, whose motto is “Saving Rural America,” received a Small and Socially Disadvantaged Producer Grant to expand their operations into the surrounding counties of central Mississippi.  They were assisted by Kenneth Randle of the Mississippi Rural Development office. This is just one great example of how USDA is making a difference every day, every way.  For more great stories check out our other videos here and here, and follow our channel on YouTube.

The 2-year-old gray wolf is the first and only documented wolf in California since , and is protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act. Journey, as the wolf is nicknamed, originally belongs to a wolf pack in Wallowa County, which is also home to Wallowa-Whitman National Forest in northeast Oregon. In February, Oregon state scientists attached a GPS collar to the wandering wolf. Since then, scientists have tracked Journey as he zigzagged throughout the state, becoming the first wild wolf in more than 60 years to appear west of the Cascades, and eventually reaching northern California Dec. 28 – all in search of a mate.

"Deputy Administrator for Commodity Operations, USDA Farm Service Agency in  Trade  Mar 31,  U.S. peanut farmers produce more than 4 million metric tons of peanuts each year that provide consumers a monounsaturated fats and protein rich food that also is a good source of vitamin E, niacin and folate, making it an ideal nutritional source for school age children worldwide. “Working for peanuts” is a phrase typically used when someone is toiling for little reward. But when describing the activities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), a far better phrase is “working with peanuts,” especially when referring to the agreement recently reached by USDA to provide this nutritional commodity to a neighboring nation in great need, the Republic of Haiti. USDA crafted a deal that will result in 500 metric tons of packaged, dry-roasted peanuts grown in the United States to be shipped later this year to school children in Haiti who have little access to food.  This effort stems from the “Stocks for Food” program that first started in late , a joint project between the Farm Service Agency (FSA), Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS) and Food and Nutrition Services (FNS) that transfers surplus farm commodities in government inventory to feeding programs and food banks both domestically and overseas. The school feeding project in Haiti, where the United Nations will distribute the peanuts, is funded by the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service through the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program, which sends domestic agricultural commodities to school feeding programs at primary schools around the world that are struggling against poverty, malnutrition, and disease. The surplus peanuts will help feed nearly 140,000 malnourished kids for a full school year. Having food available for the kids increases their attendance at school and improves their ability to learn. The Farm Service Agency joins the Foreign Agricultural Service in prideful use of the nation’s commodities to help nations in need. FSA’s Commodity Operations staff in Washington, D.C., and Kansas City, Missouri, worked diligently to procure the peanuts necessary to fulfill the international food-aid mission led by FAS and the domestic needs addressed by the Food and Nutrition Service. The multi-agency, USDA effort is especially rewarding when all of the puzzle pieces fit and a commodity is used wisely to meet nutrition requirements of people throughout the world.

"Secretary of Agriculture in  USDA Results  Rural  Sep 02,   Cross-posted from the White House Blog Yesterday I was pleased to receive the encouraging news from two USDA that illustrate the strength of the recovery in our agricultural economy. The Farm Income Forecast and Outlook for U.S. Agricultural Trade show a positive picture for , and predict sustained growth for the future.  This recovery is a testament to the Farm Bill, to a wide range of efforts of the Obama Administration – such as the Recovery Act – to move the economy forward and to support the agriculture economy, and the hard work and resilience of America’s farmers and ranchers.  Like the rest of the economy, the agriculture sector has struggled through tough economic times.  But after declining more than 20 percent in , the main measures of farm sector earnings experienced a rapid rebound and are forecast to rise in .  Net farm income has rebounded, up 24 percent from .  And net cash income will be the second highest on record.   Just as important – this recovery was sector-wide.  While an increase in the value of livestock production accounted for much of the upward movement, there is also an increase in the value of dairy production, meat animal production, and poultry and egg production.  And this progress is having an immediate effect on the lives of millions of Americans: average farm family household income is projected to reach more than $81,000 in – up 5.8 percent from . These forecasts highlight the importance of USDA’s work to increase agricultural exports as a part of President Obama’s National Export Initiative.  We are pursuing a new trade strategy which looks at nations based on the nature of their marketplace.  We have worked hard to negotiate the removal of barriers to exporting pork, poultry and other products.  And we have pursued an international trading system with rules based on the best available science to ensure that U.S. agricultural producers have fair access to foreign markets.   These efforts mean that agriculture is one of the only major sectors of the economy with a trade surplus, which we expect to be worth $30.5 billion this year.  Overall, we agricultural exports should be worth $107.5 billion in fiscal year – up from $96 billion in – and we expect them to rise again in .  More importantly, this progress should create good jobs for Americans: USDA studies show that every billion dollars in agricultural exports supports over 8,000 jobs and generates an additional $1.4 billion in economic activity.   And I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that the underlying values of rural America has played in this strong and rapid recovery. The dedication of our farmers and ranchers is second to none. They have worked hard keep their debt low and to capitalize on a broader economic recovery.  And their willingness to adapt, innovate and embrace new research has ensured their success for decades and was main reason they have been so resilient in the current economy.   As the American economy continues to climb out of the recession, with help from the Obama administration and USDA, American Agriculture is helping to lead the charge. American farmers and ranchers have stayed resilient, and will continue to support a foundation of economic prosperity for the rest of the nation.

"Montana Range Riding Aids Ranchers, Mitigates Conflicts  As silvery moonlight washed across the Montana meadow, it sent long shadows over the grass. Tonight, I didn’t need the gentle clang of the grazing bell to tell me where the horses were feeding. My leggy quarter horse was as brightly silver-white as the full moon. The distant lowing of cows across the meadow confirmed that all was well. Somewhere in the distance, a wolf pack was probably making evening rounds, but tonight they likely wouldn’t visit this meadow.

"Deputy Administrator, Livestock & Poultry Program in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Dec 12,  USDA Meat Grader Ray Colon works daily to ensure the quality of beef that has the USDA shield. December is filled with holiday observances and family gatherings, many highlighted by a seasonal feast. While the centerpiece for these feasts is as diverse as our nation, beef is a popular choice, particularly the standing rib roast, a traditional favorite. Last holiday season, the standing rib roast accounted for one fourth of all beef roasts marketed in retail outlets. The standing rib roast, cut from the rib portion and usually including six ribs, gets its name as it “stands” in the oven on its bones. It gets its nickname, prime rib roast, from its “prime” location on the beef rib, not to be confused with the USDA Prime quality grade. Developed in the s, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service’s (AMS) U.S. grades are based on nationally uniform standards of quality developed by AMS. These standards promote uniformity and assurance of product quality on a continuous basis regardless of supplier. The official USDA grade shield indicates the product's quality level and are regarded as symbols of high-quality American beef. USDA’s voluntary quality grades (Prime, Choice, Select) are widely used as a “language” within the beef industry and consumers, making business transactions easier and providing a vital link to support rural America. USDA grading services support the domestic and international marketing of a variety of American agricultural products in addition to beef—such as turkey, lamb, veal, chicken, and shell eggs. Today, AMS employs 150 highly-skilled beef graders who, sometimes with the help of electronic monitoring, evaluate several factors that determine the grade, including the amount and distribution of marbling, which is the fine threads of fat dispersed within the lean. Marbling is what gives beef its flavor, juiciness, and tenderness. USDA Prime beef has the highest marbling score or fat content, followed by USDA Choice. USDA Select has only a slight amount of marbling. USDA Choice is the most common grade, followed by USDA Select, and USDA Prime. During December , 69 percent of graded beef was eligible for the USDA Choice grade, 18 percent for USDA Select, and 7 percent for USDA Prime. The USDA quality grade is your assurance that the beef you serve your holiday guests will provide a memorable eating experience. As you sit down to enjoy your holiday beef roast this year, remember to think of the many ranchers, graders, and marketers whose hard work went into to making your holiday celebration a success!

"USDA Results  Food and Nutrition  Trade  May 13,   Associate Administrator for USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service I am writing this post from my hotel room in Korea, because I want to share with you some of my experiences on my first day here at the Seoul Food and Hotel Korea Trade Show. As the associate administrator for USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service, I am here in Ilsan, northwest of Seoul, for several reasons. Among the most important is to meet face-to-face with exhibitors and business representatives who are here to sell American agricultural and food products, as well as Korean importers, food processors, and industry leaders converging at this event, the biggest trade-only food show in South Korea. Up to 1,800 exhibitors are here in this huge, 49,000-square-foot exhibition space. More than 35,000 visitors are expected. May 12, was the first day of this year’s show and I was privileged to represent the United States in the opening ceremonies.  I joined Minister Chang, the Korean Minister for Food, Agriculture, Forestry & Fisheries (MIFAFF), as a dozen or so dignitaries cut the ribbons signifying the official opening of this year’s show. As Minister Chang prepared to depart the show, he and I had a moment to chat informally.  I was impressed by his warmth and sincerity as we both re-affirmed the interests of MIFAFF and USDA in working together cooperatively on areas of mutual interest and concern. I then turned my attention to the USA Pavilion, which featured 36 exhibitors, representing a truly diverse range of U.S. food and beverage products including American meat products, fruits, cheese and a variety of other products. Last year, 30 U.S. exhibitors left the show with expected sales of $8.9 million in sales over the ensuing 12 months. This year, they hope to sell even more U.S. food and beverage products.  Even if the contacts made here don’t lead immediately to sales contracts, several exhibitors told me that it is nevertheless important for them to be here, to be visible with the trade and showcase their products.  Building a market presence is sometimes a long process, and participation in these types of trade shows introduces foreign buyers and consumers more quickly and effectively to the attributes and advantages of American products.  The exhibits not only showcase the U.S. products, but also demonstrate ways to use and serve the products, whether American style or adapted to Korean style.  Even the non-edible give-aways, such as the carrying bags with egg-head caricatures on them given out by the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, are a visual reminder of the likeability of American agricultural products. Korea is already a very important trade partner for the United States. It is the third largest economy in Asia and the world’s 15th largest economy. This country is an economic powerhouse. My presence here emphasizes how strongly the United States values its long, strategic partnership with Korea, which began 60 years ago. As I meet with Korean officials, buyers, and traders, I have the opportunity to reinforce that partnership. Looking back on the response of visitors to the food and beverages displayed at the USA Pavilion, I am optimistic that the demand for U.S. agricultural products is strong and our reputation as a reliable supplier of safe, wholesome food and agricultural products is excellent. Our FAS staff here in Korea in partnership with U.S. cooperators, NASDA, the state and regional trade groups SUSTA and Food Export-Midwest, as well as innovative and forward-looking businesses, have done an outstanding job of showcasing American food agricultural products here.  FAS Associate Administrator Janet Nuzum shakes hands with Korea’s Minister for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Chang Tae-Pyong.

Nebraska residents were given the opportunity to share with members of the Administration what is being done at the local, regional and state levels to connect Nebraskans to the outdoors and to help conserve natural resources. Prior to the America’s Great Outdoors Initiative listening session, a bus tour visited restored wetlands in the Rainwater Basin complex, including Trumbull Basin and additional sites south of Grand Island. NRCS Chief White made a major announcement of the funding of five projects totaling $9.8 million that will restore, enhance and protect high-priority wetlands and improve wildlife habitat through the Wetlands Reserve Enhancement Program (WREP).  The financial assistance for the multiyear projects will protect and restore 2,440 acres of wetlands and associated habitats in four states, including Nebraska. Through WREP, the Rainwater Basin complex in south central Nebraska is receiving $750,000 for work on 240 acres this year.  This project, sponsored by Pheasants Forever, proposes restoring and protecting wetlands in an active agricultural landscape by allowing center pivots to cross wetlands, ensuring wetlands are compatible with the agriculture production in this region.  At the end of three years, 960 acres of wetlands and upland habitats adjacent to, and within, pivot circles will be restored. A panel of conservation leaders helped guide discussion about collaborative efforts that have protected Nebraska’s natural resources and encouraged Nebraskans to get outside and connect with nature.  Breakout sessions were held to gather ideas on what more can be accomplished by identifying what works, tools for success, challenges, and the federal government’s role.

"Forest Service Unveils Web Application Identifying At-Risk Forests  As our nation’s forests grow older and denser they are at greater risk of attack by pests, which can devastate some of more cherished national wildlands. Healthy forests not only provide a beautiful setting for our outdoor activities, they are at lower risk for catastrophic wild fires, and are more resilient to changes in climate and to insect and disease attack. To address myriad issues facing our nation’s aging landscapes, the U.S. Forest Service has developed the Forest Health Advisory System, a web-based application that highlights potential future activity of more than 40 major forest pests and pathogens across 1.2 billion acres of treed lands.

These changes in forest management practices can help promote healthy forests that are better equipped to withstand the impacts of climate change, pest, and disease attacks."
"Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  Animals  Plants  May 10,   The mission of USDA-APHIS Wildlife Services is to provide expertise to resolve wildlife conflicts and allow people and wildlife to coexist.  During my recent trip to South Florida I toured Homestead Airbase and learned firsthand about an extremely valuable service provided by APHIS-WS that most folks are not familiar with. The APHIS-WS team provides recommendations on habitat conditions and wildlife management techniques that help reduce wildlife hazards to aviation.  As a result, birdstrikes at Homestead have been reduced by over 90%.  This valuable service continues to protect the aviators and 26 F-16 Fighter jets housed there. These wildlife biologists face unique challenges not seen at many airports.  The week before my visit they captured four wild peafowl and chased away more.  These non-native birds are as big as wild turkeys, which rank among the top 10 damaging birds in airstrikes Their work also focuses on the removal and control of invasive species such as, non-native lizards like the Nile Monitor, non-native snakes like pythons and anacondas, and the South American Caiman.  I also learned about APHIS-WS control of Gambian pouch rats in the Florida Keys, which could threaten agriculture if they reached the mainland. These invasive species have become established in South Florida and have negatively impacted native species. In closing, I want to commend the commitment and success of our APHIS-WS team for the valuable work they do.

Service is a value woven into the very fabric of the USDA Forest Service. And many of the agency’s fire personnel sacrifice financial stability and time with their families because entry-level firefighter pay hasn’t historically matched their state and private sector counterparts. In June , President Biden increased firefighter pay to ensure no front-line firefighter was paid less than $15 an hour, delivering more than $24 million in additional pay to 11,300 Forest Service firefighters through incentives, awards and bonuses. The following year, thanks to pay provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, more than 12,000 Forest Service firefighters received a pay supplement equal to an extra $20,000 per year or 50% of their base pay, whichever was less. To date, nearly $230 million has reached firefighters’ pockets through these temporary measures. The U.S. Department of Agriculture continues to work on solutions for a permanent, competitive and equitable pay structure, along with a support system that will address the many challenges that have plagued its wildland firefighter workforce for decades. Service, Sacrifice and Hardship Four wildland fire responders share their stories of service, sacrifice and hardship and how the temporary pay supplements have positively impacted their lives. Their stories represent the thousands of outstanding men and women that serve in a variety of emergency responder capacities across the Forest Service. In recognition of Public Service Recognition Week, we invite you to read their stories to understand their struggles better and see how the pay supplement has helped them and their families continue to serve as the USDA works to find a permanent solution to the challenges they face.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Farm Service Agency in  Rural  Oct 12,   USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA)—the agency responsible for equitably serving all farmers, ranchers, and agricultural partners in the United States with effective agricultural programs—recently launched a Spanish-language Twitter account. We hope it helps to reach Hispanic farmers and ranchers in a new way. We’ll “tweet” the latest information on farm programs, loan announcements and emergency designations. We’ll also issue updates via Twitter on the Hispanic and women farmers claims process. “We are excited to offer a tool that reaches folks for whom English is not their first language,” said FSA Administrator Bruce Nelson. “As the population of Hispanic farmers and ranchers continues to grow, we need to grow with them and provide resources to help educate and inform all of our customers.” As part of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack’s cultural transformation initiative, the department has taken steps to ensure that all farmers and ranchers have equal access to programs available through the Farm Service Agency. Over the last fiscal year, more than 5,650 loans and $509 million in support were obligated to minority and women farmers under FSA's loan programs. The agency also saw its lowest number of civil rights complaints since the agency began. Out of 2 million producers the agency has served, 37 complaints were received. “We have come a long way and we will continue to serve all farmers and ranchers who have dedicated their lives to feeding the American people,” said Nelson.

"AMS Fruit and Vegetable Program Deputy Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Jul 03,  In addition to purchasing blueberries for federal food distribution programs, AMS supports the blueberry industry through grant programs like the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. This program offers funds to states to support research and marketing projects that do things such as increasing crop yields. Photo courtesy of the U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council. Blueberries are often highly sought after because of their long list of health benefits and their sweet taste. Whether purchased fresh, frozen, or pureed, the blueberry has long been a staple in the diets of many people. Every July, the entire nation celebrates Blueberry Month by coming up with creative recipes and other unique ways to get their fill. Here at USDA, every month is Blueberry Month. One of the ways that we show our appreciation for our nation’s blueberry producers and processors is by creating more opportunities for people to enjoy this delicious fruit. Indigenous to North America, the history of blueberries can be traced all the way back to Native Americans, who added them to soups, stews, and even meats. Highbush or cultivated blueberries are grown on large bushes that are planted in rows. These blueberries are often sent to the fresh market. Lowbush or wild blueberries produce smaller sized berries and are pruned every couple of years. The majority of lowbush blueberries are processed into items like jams, jellies and baked goods. My agency, the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), does its part to help more people eat these little blue dynamos.® Through our Commodity Procurement Program, we purchase frozen cultivated and wild blueberries. The purchases send this highly nutritious food to school children, families, and communities through federal food distribution programs like the National School Lunch Program. In , we bought nearly $17.9 million or 11.3 million pounds of frozen wild blueberries. This provided a reliable outlet for producers in places like Maine where 98% of the nation’s wild blueberries are harvested. As a result of this purchase, states like Maine can continue to strengthen their rural economies. Our purchases are also making a big difference in states like New Jersey -- the birthplace of the cultivated blueberry. The state’s blueberry industry produced more than 51 million pounds that  yielded nearly $81 million in revenue in . This was by far the largest revenue generator in the Garden State’s fruit and vegetable sector that year. In , AMS helped continue this trend by buying $18.4 million or 15.4 million pounds of frozen cultivated blueberries from growers across the country. In addition to our purchases, AMS supports the blueberry industry by offering grants to help it remain competitive in the marketplace. Classified as specialty crops, blueberries are eligible for grants through our Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. This program offers funds to states to support research and marketing projects that do things such as increasing crop yields. So, thanks to Specialty Crop Block Grant funds, several state agriculture departments can conduct research to mitigate the damage to its blueberry crops created by the Brown Marmorated Stinkbug and other invasive pests. Whether it’s July or any other part of the year, AMS is committed to supporting our nation’s blueberry producers and processors. We recommend that you add some color to your plate with some blueberries. The U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council’s website has some great recipes to get you started. In , AMS purchased nearly 11.3 million pounds of frozen wild blueberries and 15.4 million pounds of frozen cultivated blueberries from growers across the country.

"Eat It to Beat It - Garlic Mustard Challenge  Spring is often associated with ramps, rain, flowers and frogs, but on the Monongahela National Forest, the season of rebirth is focused on protecting our woods from garlic mustard. Garlic mustard is a non-native invasive plant first brought to America by European settlers in the s. They enjoyed eating it because of its zesty garlic-like flavor. They just had no idea that this plant would become one of the biggest threats to the diversity of plants and animals found in our eastern forests. In an effort to fight the spread of this invasive species, the Monongahela, along with several partners, hosts an annual Garlic Mustard Challenge to increase public awareness about the threat of non-native invasive species and to achieve boots-on-the-ground results.  Last year, elementary school students in Grant County, West Virginia, removed more than 13,000 pounds of garlic mustard from the Monongahela.

"NRCS in  Conservation  May 01,  Flooding in September along the Fox River just south of East Dundee. (Photo courtesy National Weather Service, Chicago, Ill., Weather Forecast Office) Over the past few decades, water quality in the Jelkes Creek–Fox River watershed in northern Illinois has diminished greatly. That’s why USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service collaborated with the Kane-DuPage Soil & Water Conservation District and Illinois Environmental Protection Agency in on a watershed planning process with residents, environmental groups and other stakeholders. One of the results of the thorough process was a watershed action plan, which was funded by NRCS partner, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. A watershed action plan is not a legally binding document, but rather a tool to help community leaders make informed decisions about water quality in a certain area. One change that can negatively affect water quality in a watershed is the conversion of land from wilderness or agricultural uses to urban areas. That’s because land covered with asphalt or concrete pavements can cause excessive surface water runoff from rain or snowmelt, which can contain contaminants like sediment, petroleum products from roads, and fertilizer and pesticides from yards. The water flows over the land, picking up any contaminants found there, and eventually drains into the lowest water body in the watershed—in this case Fox River and its largest tributary, Jelkes Creek. The impermeable pavement typically used to create sidewalks and roads also reduces the amount of water that can be absorbed into the soil. The Jelkes Creek–Fox River watershed action plan, which the conservation district developed with technical advice from NRCS, set goals for addressing water quality in the watershed—primarily reducing stormwater runoff, water pollution and soil erosion. When the conservation district obtains funds to implement the watershed action plan, NRCS will help install the conservation practices needed to protect water quality. First, though, NRCS experts will analyze where the worst of the erosion is coming from and estimate sediment delivery so that the most problematic areas in the watershed are tackled first. Then stormwater runoff will be reduced through the addition of rain gardens, engineered wetlands and biowales (landscaping that removes silt and pollutants). Soil erosion will be addressed with the building of stone structures that will slow the speed of water running down hills, helping to prevent soil from washing into the river. The plan will be put into action not just by the conservation district and NRCS, but also the people who live in the watershed, says David Powleit, Jelkes Creek–Fox River Watershed Coalition member. “The development of the watershed plan offers an opportunity for citizens to get involved with the water resources out their own backdoors,” he says. The Kane-DuPage Soil & Water Conservation District suggests voluntary methods for residents to enhance water quality. For example, they can sweep up yard debris, plant native plants and reduce the use of fertilizer and pesticides. Follow NRCS on Twitter. Check out other conservation-related stories on the USDA blog.

This post is part of a special series written by students celebrating 4-H’s commitment to science.  “Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety- nine, one hu— Whoa watch where you’re going. Can’t a guy do some pushups without being trampled? Let me guess, you’re looking for Carlye? Thought so. Well, she’s at a lamb show.

Swinger, though most people call me Swing for short. I’m Carlye’s perpetrator. My job is to swing and NOT to miss. Basically, I’m what happens when Carlye, science, and competition collide. Science has always been a big part of Carlye’s life. By the age of seven she had already written her first ‘report’ on bacteria (one of Carlye’s favorite topics). To this day, she still studies many different areas of science. She now hopes to join the F.B.I which is where I come in. I was the perpetrator used in one of her science fair experiments. She decided she was going to study and test how wind affects Blood Spatter Analysis for the first science fair at Round Up. So she designed me: a tall, strong, athletic, single perpetrator who enjoys working out and smashes sponges into the wall for a living. Despite my stunning good looks and dashing smile, she ended up placing second! She is currently working on a research project on mental illness and crime. Recently, Carlye learned about the 4-H National Youth Science Day and is thrilled that more kids are becoming involved in science at a young age, especially since she’s loved science from an early age. Fortunately for her, she has not only learned about different realms in science but also interview skills, and time-management techniques. Whoa!! Look at the time! I must hurry and take a quick jog then prepare for my interview for a job in the weed-whacking industry. Thankfully, Carlye gave me some tips.

For many followers of the Islamic faith, the month of Ramadan – known as a time of fasting and sacrifice – is also a time of reflection.  As we deal with hunger and thirst from sunrise to sunset, we are reminded of those who deal with hunger – and poverty – every day. As we reflect on our spiritual responsibilities, we must also recall our obligation to help others in times of need.  For Muslim employees of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), this holds especially true. USDA touches the lives of every American.  Our nutrition and food safety programs ensure that all America’s children have access to safe, nutritious, balanced meals, while our rural development programs promote prosperous, self-sustaining communities.  Our conservation programs protect our national forests and private working lands, while our agricultural support programs promote American agriculture and biotechnology while increasing food security around the world. This year, USDA expanded the StrikeForce Initiative for Rural Growth and Opportunity (www.usda.gov/strikeforce), to increase partnerships with local/state governments and communities to promote economic development and job creation in rural communities with persistent poverty.  Through StrikeForce, USDA is working to ensure that all communities can fully access USDA programs. That is why it was such a privilege to work with one of our partners, Islamic Relief USA (IRUSA), to host our fifth annual Iftar dinner (blogs.usda.gov/tag/iftar/). Almost 200 Muslim and non-Muslim employees from USDA and across the federal government came together with community members and representatives of faith-based organizations to break the day’s fast and discuss our shared goal – rebuilding and strengthening communities in need. Undersecretary Michael Scuse (then acting deputy secretary) kicked-off the event, talking about USDA’s support for rural communities, especially during times of disaster.  He was followed by Dr. Joe Leonard, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, who reminded us that while we’ve made great progress in providing equal access to USDA’s programs, there’s still more work to do.  Ali Zaidi, White House Policy Advisor spoke of the importance of USDA programs that support those in need – particularly those that provide America’s next generation with access to safe, healthy food. Dr. Abed Ayoub, president of IRUSA, showed a video about the work of his organization, and discussed efforts to provide communities around the world with access to food and water.  He also discussed IRUSA’s partnership with USDA to provide meals to low-income children here at home, during the summer months when school is out, and recognized SMILE, a New Jersey-based Islamic service organization, instrumental in helping people during the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Following tradition, the fast was broken with dates from American farmers in California.  A delicious Middle Eastern dinner was provided by IRUSA.  USDA’s Iftar is the largest among federal agencies.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Oct 13,  School lunch sometimes gets a bad rap. But I am here to tell you that school lunch is amazing and looks a lot different than what you may remember if you’re a kid of the 90s, like me. Last week, I volunteered at my son’s school. As lunchtime approached, the students were lined up in two lines: packed lunch and school lunch. The teacher announced, “Today, the cafeteria is serving popcorn chicken!” Immediately, several kids jumped from the packed lunch line to the school lunch line. That’s when I knew I was in for a treat! As we were walking towards the cafeteria, my son’s teacher told me to try the zesty meatloaf. I was already excited for popcorn chicken, but I decided to take her advice. This is not what school lunch looked like when I was kid. The meatloaf did not disappoint and neither did the mashed potatoes and broccolini. I can say with certainty that the school lunch my son receives is far more nutritious than anything I would pack for him. There was also a fantastic salad bar featuring locally grown produce. Kids were piling their plates with fruits and veggies…especially cucumbers. Did you know that FNS awards grants to support schools in purchasing equipment like salad bars, to allow them to serve nutritious meals to students? You can learn more about these equipment grants. I happened to be visiting during Virginia’s Farm to School Week. USDA’s Farm to School Program awards grants to help connect students to the sources of their food through education, taste tests, school gardens, field trips, and local food sourcing for school meals. Schools and other eligible organizations looking to improve access to local foods in their child nutrition programs can apply for a Farm to School Grant between now and January 6, . Since I communicate about school meals as a part of my job, I know that they are the healthiest meals kids receive each day. But now I know firsthand just how tasty they can be! Outside of the amazing food I ate, the other standout was the amazing food service staff. They serve the children with such pride, patience, and love.

"Director, Office of Community Food Systems in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 23,  School districts have until Friday, November 20, to update or submit new Farm to School Census ! What can $598 million buy you these days? A lot of local food!    This week, USDA announced early results from USDA’s second Farm to School Census indicating that school districts across the country invested more than half a billion dollars in local foods in the - school year. That represents an increase of $212 million (or 55 percent) over final results from the last census, conducted two years ago. Preliminary numbers also show that thanks to the hard work and dedication of school food service directors, teachers, farmers, fishermen and ranchers, more than 42,000 schools are involved in farm to school activities. Whether through buying local foods, building school gardens, or taking a field trip to a local farm, these programs improve child nutrition and provide dynamic educational experiences for students, all the while providing new market opportunities for local and regional farmers.  Indeed the benefits derived from adopting farm to school strategies are significant. The Farm to School Census found that school districts participating in farm to school activities enjoyed at least one of the following advantages:  Greater support from parents and the community Greater acceptance of the new meal pattern Lower school meal program costs Reduced food waste Increased participation in school meals  While these early results are impressive, we know that they do not represent all of the remarkable work happening across the nation. That is why, from now until November 20, , we encourage all food service directors to visit the Census site and follow the three easy steps outlined there to make sure your district is counted, and counted correctly!  A Colorado elementary school student shows off fresh lettuce grown by students in his school’s garden.  We look forward to sharing a more complete picture of farm to school with you in early , when we have tallied the final numbers. Until then, we encourage you to boisterously celebrate the last ten days of National Farm to School Month, savor autumn, and make sure your school district is counted!  Editor’s Note: To receive information and updates from USDA’s Office of Community Food Systems, please sign up for our e-letter.

Photo courtesy of the Napa County Agricultural Commissioner's Office. Last fall, the results of trapping for the European Grapevine Moth (Lobesia botrana or EGVM) in California were recounted during a conference call for the partners working to eradicate this invasive insect: zero, zero, zero, one moth. We’ve gone from more than 100,000 EGVM trapped in to just one in . This success makes the EGVM detection and eradication partnership one of the most effective programs for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), county departments of agriculture, University of California Cooperative Extension (UC Coop), and growers in the last decade. We’ve come a long way, but our work isn’t finished yet. One of APHIS’ top goals is the complete eradication of EGVM from California in the next two to three years. EGVM was first detected in Napa County, California in . Subsequent surveys detected EGVM in ate. The detection of this pest put fruit crops worth more than $5.7 billion at risk and threatened to close valuable export markets for U.S. grapes and stonefruit around the world. In , 90 percent of U.S. grape production came from California, so the finding of EGVM was especially concerning to grape growers, as well as the wine industry. County of Napa inspectors looking for EGVM early in , before we knew how big the infestation was. The damage in the Wicker vineyard and several others indicated the level of damage we could anticipate if we did not take action against this pest. Photo courtesy of the Napa County Agricultural Commissioner's Office. Napa Valley grape producer Ron Wicker recalled the impact the EGVM had on his crops. “In one week, our crop went from isolated clusters of rotting grapes to spreading through the entire vineyard. We lost 11 acres of chardonnay - all 60 tons of fruit.” Greg Clark, Napa County Agricultural Commissioner said “in Napa County, wine grape production accounts for 99% of annual crop production, or over $656 million in . This translates into approximately $14 billion in economic activity for the county. Napa is world renowned and we have to be good stewards of the crop, wine, and image.” Faced with this enormous threat, we and our partners in California moved quickly. We designed an eradication program that would produce results by closely involving growers and the community. The plan called for growers to carry out pest treatments, while state and county partners set traps and lures for detection purposes and reported findings. We also relied on the excellent support of the EGVM Technical Working Group, which met regularly to provide APHIS and its partners with the best science and to combat EGVM.

Photo courtesy of the Napa County Agricultural Commissioner's Office. “Another key reason for success was the grower liaison role that was created early in the program,” said Nick Condos, Chief of the EGVM Quarantine Program for CDFA’s Plant Health Programs. “The grower liaisons were critical to conveying information to growers and ensuring they understood the voluntary treatments planned.” “Growers worked closely with the liaisons and cooperated fully with both the quarantine and treatment plans,” Condos continued. “The reason WHY is because the pest was doing significant damage immediately. We were dealing with a potential game changer for how industry exports and operates.” The quick response, sound scientific strategy, hard work by growers and industry, and the support of the community has produced fantastic results. We have eliminated EGVM from nine of 11 counties, and more than 80 percent of the acres that were quarantined have been declared free of the moth. Now, with one moth detected in , success is even closer. Some day soon, we’ll get the news that we’ve accomplished our goal: no more EGVM in California.

(Photo credit: David Kosling, USDA) “Three…two…one!” And with this countdown the journey of three thousand miles for the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree from Montana’s Kootenai National Forest comes to end or just begins for those who have yet to see the massive 79-foot Engelmann spruce now on Capitol Hill. Starting tonight local residents and tourists will be able to view this gleaming tree adorned with thousands of hand-made ornaments crafted by children from all over the state of Montana. The tree, called Beauty of the Big Sky, began its cross-country sojourn in early November and has made over 30 stops at towns and cities along the way. Traveling alongside the spruce was one of the largest tree-topping stars ever made for a harvested tree. Despite concerns that the star might be too large and heavy for the tree, the sturdy Engelmann spruce held its own and the star has been successfully installed. The lighting was hosted by the Architect of the Capitol with members of the Montana Congressional Delegation speaking as well as USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue, with the U.S. House of Representatives Speaker, Paul Ryan, presiding over the ceremony held on the West Lawn of Capitol Hill. Carrying on a decades old tradition, a child from the tree’s home state flipped the switch to illuminate the tree.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Oct 24,  Bat Week graphic. By the time October comes around, store shelves are stocked with Halloween candy, costumes, and decorations. Bats are often situated among this imagery, whether as silhouettes in the background or as blood-sucking monsters. But bats are none of these things. They are primarily nocturnal, they make their homes in dark places, but there’s nothing scary about them. That is why Bat Week, October 24-31, is a time to celebrate bats, what they contribute to our society, and to dispel the myths that cause so much misunderstanding of these gentle, intelligent creatures. There are more than 1,300 species of bats worldwide, and they are diverse. Some, like Kitti’s hog-nosed bat, also known as the bumble bee bat, can be as small as your thumbnail and survives on insects. Others like the flying fox eat fruit and have earned their name due to their impressive size. Bats like this Mexican free-tailed bat feed on insects and play an important role in pest control on agricultural crops. Photo by MerlinTuttle.org. There are three species of vampire bat among those 1,300. However, they live in Mexico, Central and South America; feed primarily on large livestock; and take about an ounce of blood in a feeding. Forty-seven species of bat call the United States home. Bats provide valuable services to us. Most feed on insects and play an important role in pest control on agricultural crops. The various species of beetles, moths, and other insects that often plague crops represent a tasty meal to a hungry bat. In fact, it is estimated that if bats were lost in North America, savings of up to $3.7 billion dollars annually would be lost due to increased pesticide requirements in agriculture. In one case, a Georgia pecan farmer was able to abandon pesticide use altogether after he built bat houses housing several thousand Mexican free-tailed bats. The Forest Service is looking into the role that bats play in pest insect control on the forest as well. Many insects, like bark beetles and gypsy moths, can be devastating to forests, and as voracious insect eaters, bats have the potential to help cull their numbers. Recognizing the role they play, the Forest Service has long been a champion of bat conservation. Over the last decade, the fungal disease white-nose syndrome has killed more than six million bats. While Forest Service researchers seek a solution to white-nose syndrome, the agency’s land managers explore improved ways to manage bat habitat. Within the 193 million acres of forests and grasslands that the agency manages, there are more than 25,000 abandoned mines that present both opportunity and hazard. Recognizing the potential of abandoned mines as ideal roosting, hibernation, or maternity sites, the Forest Service has constructed “bat gates” that provide a grating to keep visitors from stumbling into a potential hazard while allowing bats to fly freely. You too can make a big difference by planting bat-friendly gardens, building bat houses, and helping dispel myths about bats. Little Brown bats found in Maine with white-nose syndrome.

"Producers get a New Revenue Source, Waterfowl Habitat is Preserved and Industry Benefits from Conservation Effort  Earlier this week, USDA highlighted the creation of a market for carbon credits generated on working grasslands. Landowners benefit because they receive compensation for the carbon credits generated on their lands. They get a new source of revenue, while thriving grasslands provide nesting habitat for wildlife, are more resilient to extreme weather, and help mitigate the impact of climate change. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, recently purchased almost 40,000 carbon dioxide reduction tons generated on working ranch grasslands in the Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. It was the first purchase of its type.  Robert Bonnie, USDA's under secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the purchase and USDA's involvement in the project at an event at USDA headquarters. He was joined by Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Greg Martin, executive director for global public policy, General Motors; Sean Penrith, executive director of The Climate Trust and Paul Schmidt, chief conservation officer of Ducks Unlimited. The under secretary thanked Senator Stabenow, Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, for her staunch support for the program, which she said is delivering “real world measurable results.” Bonnie said he hopes this purchase will set a pattern for future carbon credit sales.

"Southern Plains Regional Director, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Research and Science  Aug 03,  NASS interviewers conducting objective yield measurements in a field near Lubbock, Texas. Lone Star state growers are responsible for 56 percent of the U.S. acres planted to cotton and about 45 percent of the total cotton production. But how do we measure this crop accurately enough to make dependable forecasts for cotton yield and production? That’s where our measurement process, known as the objective yield kicks in. All of the objective yield measurements are done by a well-prepared team of National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) enumerators. For this growing season, we spent the week of July 12-14 training 43 enumerators with a combination of classroom and hands-on field practice. Since approximately 63 percent of the Texas crop, which represents 30 percent of the U.S. total cotton crop, comes from the High Plains of Texas, this group has the bulk of the samples in Texas. Once we begin collecting , these agency representatives lay out approximately 525 plots in cotton fields. Each objective yield sample will consist of two units per field, which, when combined, cover about 83 square feet of land. While this may seem like a small area, when combined across all of the plots in the state, this scientific process is quite accurate. We expect each one of these samples to represent nearly 10,500 acres of cotton grown in Texas. Of course it takes more than one measurement to get an accurate yield and production estimate. Our enumerators return to the plots each month to collect updated . During their visits, the enumerators count plants and fruit in a 10-foot area and pick cotton samples once bolls open. The cotton samples are weighed and sent to our National Operations Division in St. Louis, Missouri for further analysis. We also count squares, blooms, and large and small bolls from a separate 3-foot count area. The we collect from these plots, combined with the information growers provide in our monthly Agricultural Yield surveys, become the key source for Texas production forecasts throughout the growing season. The resulting cotton production inform decisions made by traders, agri-marketers, legislators, and of course the farmers themselves. Key decisions impacting the cotton sector are usually rooted in these numbers. This year, we will publish the first monthly Crop Production report for cotton production on August 12. After that we will continue publishing updated information each month through December. Final Texas and national cotton estimates will be available in early May .

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Agricultural Research Service Information Staff in  Research and Science  Dec 21,   This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Even in a tropical paradise like Hawaii, Christmas just isn’t Christmas to some folks without an evergreen tree decked out with twinkling lights and sparkling ornaments. But some USDA scientists worry about that Yule tree being decked out with something else: invasive western yellowjackets. These black-and-yellow-striped predators normally build their nests in the ground. But for close to a century, they’ve also been successful at sneaking into Hawaii aboard holiday trees harvested in the Pacific Northwest. First spotted in Hawaii in , the western yellowjacket (Vespula pensylvanica) remains a target for researchers and regulators who have observed the stinging invader competing with Hawaii’s birds for native insect prey. Applications of insecticide before the trees are harvested have proven 100 percent effective in killing the yellowjackets, and residues of insecticides applied 6 weeks earlier were still killing the pests at harvest. A process of literally shaking these trees, however, offers a pesticide-free alternative to ridding them of yellowjackets.  In the past, Hawaii’s agricultural regulators have that 10 percent of Christmas trees bound for the islands be shaken manually to detect hitchhiking pests if an inspector is present at harvest, or 100 percent of the trees be shaken mechanically if no inspector is present.  But there’s no precise rule about how long the tree should be shaken, and the duration could make a big difference in the number of pests dislodged. Scientists with USDA’s Agricultural Research Service teamed with colleagues from Washington State University, the University of Hawaii and the Hawaii Department of Agriculture to evaluate the efficacy of shaking the trees.  Although their research demonstrated that current shaking techniques won’t dislodge all the yellowjackets, Hawaiian authorities have since stepped up protection efforts by requiring that all incoming Yule trees undergo shaking.  These scientists are working to make pesticide-free shaking treatments more effective to help ensure Hawaii’s holiday celebrants don’t find more than they wanted under their Christmas trees.

"U.S. Forest Service, Office of Communication in  Forestry  Dec 13,  Strawberry guava plant.  This month a Brazilian beetle, tested for years by the U.S. Forest Service, is being released in Hawaii to hopefully devourer a non-native fruit known as strawberry guava. Though it sounds delicious, this colorful plant is invading and threatening Hawaii’s native forests and watersheds and has already overtaken hundreds of thousands of acres on the archipelago in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Introduced to Hawaii in , strawberry guava is a tree native to Brazil and has since advanced through Hawaii’s native forests. Removal is extremely difficult in remote forest areas. The species has also adversely affected Hawaii’s watersheds.  A University of Hawaii study shows that strawberry-guava-infested forests lose 27 percent more water than native forests. Added to all this degradation, Forest Service scientists report that the millions of pounds of dropped fruit are a primary source of oriental fruit flies which invade Hawaii agriculture crops and cost the state millions of dollars annually in quarantine treatment and control efforts. “We hope people understand that release of this biological control insect will not kill all strawberry guava,” said Tracy Johnson, lead researcher for the U.S. Forest Service in Hilo. “There will still be a lot of strawberry guava around. Slowing its reproduction and invasiveness will help restore the balance in favor of the native forest plants like”ohia.” Native Hawaiian forest For more than 15 years, U.S. Forest Service scientists have been testing for potential natural control insects for strawberry guava. Their results have determined that the Brazilian beetle known officially as T. ovatus, will slow the spread of strawberry guava providing natural control of the species and will not harm other native or beneficial plants or insects. T. ovatus lives most of its life inside the strawberry guava leaves, causing leaf galls or bumps, which reduces the vigor of the plant but does not kill it. The damage is similar to galls frequently found on `ohia which are caused by native insects. An initial release is scheduled at one site on Hawaii Island where progress will be monitored by the U.S. Forest Service. For more information go to visit the Forest Service's website.

"Executive Director of Food Services for New Haven Public Schools in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  May 06,   Cross posted from the Let's Move! blog:  Last week I had the wonderful opportunity to join 5 chefs from across the country, all of us being recognized as a Champion of Change. Working together as a team the six of us joined in a discussion with Under Secretary Kevin Concannon and Chef Sam Kass to discuss opportunities and challenges of the Chefs Move to Schools, a program of the Let's Move! initiative. The true spirit of Chefs Move to Schools (CMTS) is to engage children in their classroom through food. The program has morphed into a fun and educational program benefitting both school children and school nutrition professionals. One practice that is becoming popular is to have the program benefit both these groups; first by getting kids excited by a chef demo then having the chef step into the school kitchen, not to comment about the food, rather to work hands on with the kitchen staff to help re-educate them on basic kitchen skills. This quick educational lesson is often welcomed by the staff who see it as an opportunity to network with a local chef. Engaging organizations is important to seeing through with the success of CMTS. The American Culinary Federation, School Nutrition Association and Share Our Strength are the top three organizations involved to see through with the success of CMTS. Feeding children healthy school meals is important for several reasons but most importantly 32 million children participate in the National School Lunch Program and two thirds, yes two thirds of them qualify for free and reduced meals. At a time when one in four kids lacks access to nutritious foods every day, now is the time for everyone to step up to the plate, take baby steps and see to it that every meal that a child receives in school is a good one. Green and orange veggies, whole grains, minimally processed foods along with salad bars are a great start. The HealthierUS School Challenge and Let's Move! Salad Bars to Schools coupled with Let's Move! Salad Bars to Schools and CMTS are a good way to increase both excitement and healthy choices in schools, not to mention opening us funding opportunities.

"Veterans Find Unexpected Opportunities at AMS  When it comes time to transition from service in the military to a civilian job, many veterans do not immediately think to look for positions at the USDA.  There is an assumption that jobs with USDA are all farm-related – even those in the Agricultural Marketing Services (AMS).   In reality, there is a wide variety of opportunities within AMS and USDA as a whole. There are a number of jobs at AMS that overlap with different military specializations.  The agency has auditors who evaluate programs to make sure producers follow international standards and practices.  Positions in compliance and analysis, budget analysis, and information technology rely on skills like attention to detail and effective project management that are an essential part of armed services training.

Farmers market managers, state Departments of Agriculture, state farmers market associations, and other farmers market operators can continue to list their markets at the USDA Farmers Market Directory Website. “[The USDA National Farmers Market Directory]” is a snapshot of what is happening in farmers markets, and demonstrates how the industry is growing and expanding,” wrote Rayne Pegg, the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) (the USDA agency that maintains the Directory) in a recent open letter to market managers.  “[The Directory] illustrates where the markets are, how big they are, how often they operate and other valuable information for policy makers, researchers, advocates, government officials, media and consumers."" The official results of the USDA National Farmers Market Directory will be released later this summer and include about farmers markets that have registered with the Directory up until June 4.

"USDA Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 04,  Undersecretary Kevin Concannon meets with Sisters of the Holy Family, an order of nuns based in New Orleans. When a newspaper reporter asked me recently, “What can I tell our readers about the USDA programs,” I told her: “Most of what USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service does is through others.” As I travel throughout the country, I see how different organizations come together to carry out our mission of putting food on the table for those in need. In concert with FNS’ 15 nutrition assistance programs, hundreds of organizations are working hard every day to create the safety net against hunger that protects Americans. Without fanfare and with little public notice, coalitions of non-profits, religious organizations and groups of volunteers are often the first line of defense against hunger. One shining example of this excellent teamwork is in New Orleans where I recently met with Catholic Charities Archdiocese CEO Gordon Wadge and other representatives. They work hand in hand, using a combination of FNS programs, donations and community-building outreach techniques that aid people in many different ways across the city. For example, at Café Hope the food is prepared and served by disadvantaged, at-risk young people who might otherwise be on the street. I also talked with Tim Robertson the director of the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, Food for Families. Food for Families warehouses, pre-packs, and transports supplemental food boxes to more than 120 donation sites throughout Louisiana and where the program serves 60,000 people. I even visited a garden where former prison inmates, who are now members of AmeriCorps, work with the Sisters of the Holy Family. The Cornerstone Builders, as administered by Catholic Charities’ Office of Justice and Peace, eases formerly incarcerated individuals back into society by giving former inmates education, support and the opportunity to do community service. These examples don’t even scratch the surface of all that Catholic Charities does to enrich the lives of so many in New Orleans. Through their local service and the service of organizations like them across the United States, we strengthen the food safety net and our commitment to helping those in need.

"Director, International Programs Office, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 14,  USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) is the gold standard in providing timely, accurate and useful statistics in service to U.S. agriculture. But beyond the hundreds of surveys the agency conducts each year on behalf of U.S. ag, NASS has been helping to establish and improve agricultural statistics systems in countries around the world since the end of World War II. NASS’s international projects are especially relevant as we mark World Food Day this Sunday, Oct. 16. Our international programs provide technical assistance that aims to strengthen statistical organizations in foreign countries. Improved agricultural systems can provide more and better information that is critical to addressing major global concerns like food insecurity and shortfalls in regional food production. Over the past decade, NASS has had the privilege to help more than 30 developing countries in Africa, Central and South America, Asia and Central and Eastern Europe to develop and improve their agricultural statistics programs. Now NASS and USDA staff will have the opportunity to share their research and explore the latest methodological innovations by countries and development partners when the Ninth International Conference on Agricultural Statistics (ICAS XI) comes to Washington, DC, May 17-19, . ICAS IX, organized by USDA and the World Bank, in coordination with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, brings together statistical experts from around the world. The focus of next year’s conference will be, “Harnessing to inform an equitable and sustainable agri-food systems transformation.” Potential themes for conference sessions include natural resource use, rural development, collection and quality, capacity building in agricultural statistics and more. The conference provides a unique networking and learning opportunity at a time when access to high-quality agricultural statistics is as important as ever.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research portfolio. It is astounding to reflect at the end of the year and realize once again how many pieces came together each day, each week, and each month to make sure the United States has the best official agricultural statistics. It is something of a well-oiled machine made up of America’s farmers, statisticians, modern technology, deep agricultural knowledge, and the most basic elements of human interaction - trust and hard work - that brings forth these useful and objective on time year after year since . It takes hundreds of thousands of producers responding to a multitude of surveys each year, in addition to the every-five-year Census of Agriculture which USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) conducted this year, to provide the source information about U.S. farm production.  For this, we thank each individual producer who takes the time to complete the surveys.  Get a first look at the Census of Agriculture on February 20, at the Ag Outlook Forum. The small army of dedicated NASS staff and enumerators prepare the surveys, gather the information from producers, analyze and aggregate the information and then prepare and release the . Everyone takes their jobs seriously and is committed to producing the best agricultural statistics available. We are honoring many this week with an award ceremony and certificates of recognition for truly outstanding contributions. And why do we need these agricultural statistics? On a practical level, there are examples such as a Pennsylvania township using information about dairy farms to determine which roads to plow first in a snow storm so that milk could get to market instead of potentially being dumped. And the beginning farmer who used to determine where to locate her organic farm based on the proximity of farm services, other organic farms, and other criteria that would create a favorable business environment her operation. Or the trucking company that wanted to determine the best location to expand based on where large volumes of certain grains and byproducts are produced. In the big picture, we need them to understand local and global food supply, ensure smooth domestic and international trade, and to inform local and national food, land and farm policy. Many federal agencies and policy makers use the information for programs such as crop insurance, determining the use of and need for conservation programs, animal health and financial assistance. Since we collect the information personally, we often hear from producers just how important these are to them.

"APHIS Public Affairs Specialist in  Animals  Plants  Trade  USDA Results  Jun 27,  A U.S. delegation, led by Dr. Jack Shere, USDA Chief Veterinary Officer, and Dr. John Clifford, U.S. Delegate to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) participated in the 84th General Session in Paris, France. International trade is a key factor in the economic and financial stability of many countries.  Trade restrictions resulting from an animal disease outbreak can have devastating economic effects.  With this in mind, USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service signed three international agreements on this very topic last month at a meeting of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) in Paris, France.  These agreements will make it easier to maintain safe and fair trade of animals and animal products if an animal disease outbreak occurs. They emphasize the cooperation and understanding of the countries involved to promote shared knowledge, and resources, which can be crucial during an animal health event. The three arrangements, signed by the United States, relate to the International Animal Health Emergency Reserve (also signed by Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom), the Sharing of Vaccines for Foot and Mouth Disease (Australia, Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand), and Supporting the Recognition of Zoning for Foreign Animal Disease Outbreaks (Australia, Canada, and New Zealand). The International Animal Health Emergency Reserve agreement allows for countries to share emergency response teams and personnel as needed during animal disease outbreaks.  It also lets the countries involved to act rapidly and more effectively control and eradicate an outbreak. The Sharing of Vaccines for Foot and Mouth Disease agreement allows for countries to more readily request and consider requests for FMD vaccine from their respective FMD vaccine banks. This particular arrangement provides an opportunity to share vaccine resources can be beneficial during an outbreak and leaves the door open to include other countries’ FMD banks if there is future interest. Supporting the Recognition of Zoning for Foreign Animal Disease Outbreaks agreement allows countries to understand and accept each other’s processes for managing outbreaks and paves the way for recognizing “zones” for trading purposes.  This arrangement would allow for trade to be resumed early from disease-free zones and support continuing trade from affected zones where biosecurity risks can be effectively managed through specific import conditions, such as product treatments. Our animal health experts have a shared vision to safeguard our nation’s agricultural resources and to support international trade and cooperation while preventing the introduction of dangerous and costly disease in our country.  These agreements will complement our existing preparedness activities and benefit not only US producers and consumers, but the global community.

I fully agree.  That should be true no matter if someone lives in Manhattan New York; Manhattan, Kansas or Manhattan Beach, Oregon.  Using the power of the Internet, a student in rural America should have access to cutting edge information, the finest teachers and the resources they need to compete.  We have helped make this a reality in much of rural America, but there is much more to do.  Especially in these difficult economic times, government resources are not enough to accomplish our objectives.  And the Internet is just one piece of the puzzle.  Health care, public safety, clean water, great schools, and affordable, reliable power service is all if rural America is to thrive. That’s where philanthropy comes in.  In my address, I asked the philanthropists in attendance to forge new partnerships to increase rural investment.  I seek a full partnership across political and geographic boundaries to maximize the impact of the limited resources and help the 50 million residents of rural America thrive. In June, I was selected by the President to chair the White House Rural Council.  Later this summer, I will chair a series of meetings to advance the Council’s objectives.  Philanthropists not only have a place at the table, I want to work with them to set the table.  Together, we can improve the quality of rural life and in doing so, boost the economic health of all of America, rural and urban.

The race is sponsored by the Friends of the Sandia Mountains, with proceeds supporting the preservation and maintenance of the trails and picnic areas on the Cibola National Forest and Grasslands' Sandia Ranger District in Tijeras, N.M. The Sandia is a compact district of around 100,000 acres that includes the 37,200-acre Sandia Mountain Wilderness just east of Albuquerque. Because of its proximity to a metropolitan area, more than 1 million people visit the district each year. Visitors come for a variety of recreational activities – hiking, mountain biking, picnicking, rock climbing and horseback riding. In the winter, weather permitting, there’s cross-country skiing and snowshoeing.  Ruth Sutton, Cibola National Forest, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Feb 04,   Respond to this story","What recreational activity can be enjoyed at the Sandia Mountain Wilderness in winter, besides snowshoeing?",Cross-country skiing is another recreational activity that can be enjoyed at the Sandia Mountain Wilderness in winter.
"Catherine Greene, and Fred Kuchler, Economic Research Service in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 27,  A new report by USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS), Beyond Nutrition and Organic Labels—30 Years of Experience With Intervening in Food Labels, evaluates the impact of Federal organic and nutrition labels and several other food labels that emerged in recent decades. For more than a century, American families have used government-regulated food labels, such as “USDA prime beef,” to help them decide what food products to buy. Today, consumers also look to food labels for information about how their food was grown and how healthy it is.   Some food labels, such as grades of beef, eggs and apples, are based on longtime Federal requirements that apply to all companies. In , Congress also directed USDA and FDA to set standards for organic and nutrition food labels. But private-sector companies can put other information on food labels, such as whether a product is “raised without antibiotics,” or made without genetically modified ingredients (“non-GMO”), without government verification. A new report by USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS), Beyond Nutrition and Organic Labels—30 Years of Experience With Intervening in Food Labels, evaluates the impact of Federal organic and nutrition labels and several other food labels that emerged in recent decades. National standards for the Nutrition Facts label were intended to provide consumers with information to make healthy food choices. Since then, it has emerged that shoppers may be overwhelmed by the amount of information provided and in response, some companies have added simpler health claims on the front of food packages.  Before USDA developed standards for organic food, the word “organic” meant different things for different products, and in different U.S. States. National standards have helped level the playing field for producers and have widened consumer access to organic food. Since Federal organic standards were implemented in , U.S. retail sales of organic food have risen five-fold. While Federal label standards can be comprehensive, this doesn’t ensure that consumers understand them. The USDA Organic seal, for example, means that the farmer used practices that maintain or improve soil conditions, did not use GMOs, antibiotics, hormones, or synthetic pesticides -- and met many other requirements. However, many consumers confuse the USDA Organic seal with other less comprehensive food labels, especially labels that make a single claim such as “natural,” non-GMO,” and “raised without antibiotics.”  Without government involvement, the same label can be based on different standards — and private labels are often not verified. For example, early “raised without antibiotics” labels had different meanings, confusing consumers and creating conflict between companies. Though the labels now mean the same thing, firms don’t need their labels to be verified by USDA or other groups in order to use them.   Private-sector labels making single claims, such as “raised without antibiotics,” also provide opportunities for producers, and more choice for consumers. For example, producers can adopt a single practice at a lower cost than meeting all the requirements to use the USDA Organic seal, and in turn, offer a lower retail price for that product. Grocery store price premiums for USDA Organic chicken breasts, for example, were double the premiums for “raised without antibiotics” chicken breasts in . Smaller price premiums for single-trait products expand the market of potential customers while still giving companies an economic incentive to adjust their production processes.

"Funding is First Part of $75 Million Investment to Support a Fairer Food System and Expand Access to Nutritious Food  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .22  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@usda.gov  WASHINGTON, June 3, – The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announces significant investments to support urban agriculture, including $43.1 million for grants and cooperative agreements as well as six new urban county committees to help deliver key USDA programs to urban producers. These actions support USDA’s efforts to strengthen the food supply chain and transform the food system to be fairer, more competitive, and more resilient. Specifically, USDA is investing $10.2 million in new cooperative agreements to expand compost and food waste reduction efforts and $14.2 million in new grants to support the development of urban agriculture and innovative production projects. Additionally, $18.7 million will fund 75 worthy grant proposals from the application cycle, which was oversubscribed. “Investing in urban agriculture innovations helps us build a fairer, more transparent food system and promote equity by increasing nutrition security and economic opportunity in underserved communities,” said Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Chief Terry Cosby. “These projects will help for urban farmers create new, more affordable, and better local market options and help urban communities produce fresh and healthy food locally, reducing food waste while building nutrient rich compost.” “Supporting agriculture in our urban communities helps grow our economy and provides food to people,” said U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow. “I’m proud that Michigan has been a pioneer in this effort. Urban farmers provide fresh and healthy food to children and families while creating jobs and revitalizing our neighborhoods.” These investments build on USDA’s Food Systems Transformation Framework unveiled earlier this week. The goals of USDA’s Food System Transformation Framework include:  Building a more resilient food supply chain that provides more and better market options for consumers and producers while reducing carbon pollution.  Creating a fairer food system that combats market dominance and helps producers and consumers gain more power in the marketplace by creating new, more and better local market options.  Making nutritious food more accessible and affordable for consumers.  Emphasizing equity by creating wealth that stays in small towns and underserved communities. USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) is also standing up six more urban county committees, which help deliver farm loans, disaster assistance, safety net and conservation programs. “Urban county committees promote equity by giving urban producers a voice in creating and implementing policy and developing and designing programs specific to urban producers,” FSA Administrator Zach Ducheneaux said. “These new urban county committees will work to encourage and promote urban agriculture and address areas such as food and program access, community engagement and food security.” Composting and Food Waste Reduction Cooperative Agreements This is the third year of USDA’s Composting and Food Waste Reduction (CFWR) cooperative agreements, and so far, USDA has invested $3 million in community composting in urban areas across the country. The $10.2 million to be awarded in will fund pilot projects that develop and implement strategies for municipal compost plans and food waste reduction plans. Local governments may submit projects that do one or more of the following:  generate compost;  provide access to compost to farmers;  reduce fertilizer use;  improve soil quality;  encourage waste management and permaculture business development;  increase rainwater absorption; reduce municipal food waste; and/or  divert food waste from landfills. For example, Philadelphia is launching the first of a coordinated system of small-scale urban food waste composting sites on city properties. Meanwhile, Winterville, Georgia is building six composting stalls to collect and process food excess and refuse from producers and local community members. The compost is then provided to local producers and others. Priority will be given to projects that anticipate or demonstrate economic benefits, incorporate plans to make compost easily accessible to farmers, including community gardeners, integrate other food waste strategies, including food recovery efforts and collaborate with multiple partners. Projects should span two years. Office of Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production (OUAIP) Grants This is also the third year of OUAIP grants, which have already provided more than $7.5 million focused on food access, education, business and start-up costs for new farmers, and development of policies related to zoning and other needs. The $14.2 million to be awarded in will support the development of urban agriculture and innovative production projects through:  Planning Projects that initiate or expand efforts of urban and suburban farmers, gardeners, citizens, government officials, schools and other stakeholders to target areas of food access, education, business and start-up costs for new farmers, urban forestry, and policies related to zoning and other needs of urban production.  Implementation Projects that accelerate urban, indoor and other agricultural practices that serve multiple farmers and improve local food access. They may support infrastructure needs, emerging technologies, education and urban farming policy implementation. For example, Growing Gardens in Oregon received planning project funding to identify opportunities to meet community needs for healthy, affordable, culturally appropriate food through building greenhouses. Meanwhile, Grow Ohio Valley in West Virginia received implementation funding to set up a training and demonstration farm to support new and aspiring urban farmers. How to Apply for Grants and Cooperative Agreements Submit applications via grants.gov for Composting and Food Waste Reduction Cooperative Agreements and UAIP Grants. Pre-recorded webinars on the purpose, project types, eligibility and basic requirements for submitting applications will be posted at usda.gov/urban.

This grant program has been oversubscribed the last several years, ARPA funds made it possible to fund these worthy projects. A full listing of projects is posted on usda.gov/urban. Urban County Committees for Urban Agriculture The new urban county committee (UCOC) locations are Chicago, Detroit, Grand Rapids, Los Angeles, New York City, and Oakland, and they join 11 previously announced urban county committees. The six locations for county committees were selected based on a consideration of that included opportunity for economic growth, diversity, proximity to tribal nations, as well as the number of farm-to-table projects, urban farms, community and residential gardens, and green infrastructure projects within metropolitan and suburban areas. Like rural county committee members, urban committee members make important decisions about how FSA programs are administered locally. Each urban and suburban county committee will be composed of three elected members who will serve a term of up to three years. Urban farmers who participate in USDA programs in the areas selected are encouraged to participate by nominating and voting for themselves or others. USDA and Urban Agriculture Grants and cooperative agreements to support urban production are part of a broad USDA investment in urban agriculture. Other efforts include $260,000 for risk management education from USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA) and technical and financial assistance through conservation programs offered by USDA’s NRCS. OUAIP was established through the Farm Bill. It is led by NRCS and works in partnership with FSA and numerous USDA agencies that support urban agriculture. Its mission is to encourage and promote urban, indoor, and other emerging agricultural practices, including community composting and food waste reduction. Learn more by visiting farmers.gov/urban or downloading the new Urban Agriculture at a Glance brochure (, 1 ). Additional resources that may be of interest to urban agriculture entities include grants from USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture as well as FSA loans. These significant investments by USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and Office of Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production (OUAIP) build on the Biden-Harris administration’s Food System Transformation framework for USDA to transform the food system to benefit consumers, producers and communities by providing more options, increasing access, and creating new, more, and better markets for small and mid-size producers. USDA touches the lives of all Americans each day in so many positive ways. In the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA is transforming America’s food system with a greater focus on more resilient local and regional food production, fairer markets for all producers, ensuring access to safe, healthy and nutritious food in all communities, building new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate smart food and forestry practices, making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America, and committing to equity across the Department by removing systemic barriers and building a workforce more representative of America.

"Foreign Agricultural Service Public Affairs Specialist in  USDA Results  Trade  Oct 18,  Dutch Chef Eric Troost prepares an upscale dish using U.S. beef during a cooking demonstration for about 130 Belgian chefs Sept. 24. The demo was part of the first U.S. beef tasting event held in Belgium, which was hosted by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) office in The Hague, Netherlands, and the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF). The tasting was part of ongoing efforts to help expand U.S. beef exports to the European Union (EU). (Photo courtesy FAS The Hague)  The European Union (EU) is a relatively new market for U.S. beef exports. It wasn’t until August when the United States began exporting high-quality beef (marbled with a high fat content) to the EU under a negotiated tariff rate quota for non-hormone treated beef. Today, about 25 percent of U.S. beef exports to the EU are high-quality cuts such as tenderloin, strip loin and rib eye mostly used by upscale restaurants. The remaining beef exports include medium and lower quality cuts such as flank steak, chuck eye roll, briskets and shoulder clods. Finer restaurants in the EU traditionally do not integrate these cuts into their menus To help introduce these secondary cuts and expand U.S. beef exports to the EU, the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) office in The Hague, Netherlands, partnered with the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) and a Belgium-based meat importer and distributor to host the first U.S. beef tasting event in Belgium Sept. 24. USMEF’s international marketing efforts on behalf of U.S. beef, pork, lamb and veal are funded by the FAS Market Access Program (MAP) and Foreign Market Development programs to support activities such as this event. During the U.S. beef tasting event, approximately 130 Belgian chefs learned about the preparation of these less familiar beef cuts. Local Dutch Chef Eric Troost presented various cooking demonstrations including slowly cooked top sirloin with barbecue sauce, tartar of shoulder clod with artichoke and shallots and top blade with beets, coriander and sesame vinaigrette. The chefs were excited to learn cooking techniques for the secondary beef cuts, which are nearly 40 percent cheaper than primary beef cuts, said Mary Ellen Smith, agricultural attaché at the FAS office in The Hague. “Typically, secondary cuts from European beef cannot be used for finer dishes, so the Belgian chefs were intrigued by the various cooking methods that take advantage of the unique marbling in U.S. beef,” she said. “Events like these help introduce new U.S. products not only to the chefs that prepare them but to the thousands of European consumers that they serve.” The U.S. beef tasting event is just one example of how FAS’s market development programs have a long history of helping farmers, ranchers, and businesses of all sizes build and maintain commercial markets for U.S. food and agricultural products around the world. It also helps support President Obama’s National Export Initiative, which aims to double U.S. exports by the end of . Click here to view a video recap of the U.S. beef tasting event in Belgium.

"USDA Michigan Public Information Officer in  Rural  Oct 12,   USDA Rural Development Michigan State Director James Turner joined Senator Debbie Stabenow and local officials this summer in celebrating the opening of the largest commercial-scale anaerobic digester in the United States. The Fremont Community Digester is an ambitious new use of a proven technology.  Once used chiefly in farms, anaerobic digesters are now coming into their own. The facility will convert organic waste products – such as farm and food waste – and process it into biogas.  Approximately 1,500 local families will derive their power from this previously untapped energy source. Just as importantly, the digester will greatly reduce pollution.  As NOVI Energy President Anand Gangadharan noted during his remarks, the bacteria colonies within the tanks are voraciously hungry and can process more than 100,000 tons of waste. The byproducts of this process can be used for fertilizer, soil amendments and cow bedding. USDA provided a $12,825,000 Rural Development loan guarantee to finance the project, which has a total cost of $22 million. Anaerobic digesters are in concert with an agreement with U.S. dairy producers signed by the Secretary in Copenhagen, Denmark in to accelerate adoption of innovative manure to energy projects on American dairy farms. The agreement represents a dynamic public/private partnership and is another demonstration of the Obama Administration's commitment to curb the emissions of greenhouse gases.

"Foreign Agricultural Service Administrator in  Trade  Oct 22,  Trade visitors sample a variety of cheeses at the Rogue Creamery stand in the USA Pavilion. Rogue Creamery, an artisan cheese company, is dedicated to sustainability and the art and tradition of making the world's finest handmade cheese. Earlier this week I traveled to Paris to attend the 24th edition of the Salon International d’Alimentation (SIAL). This 5-day event is one of the largest international food and beverage trade exhibitions in the world, attracting 5,500 exhibitors and over 147,000 trade-only visitors representing 188 countries. I was very impressed by the wide variety of U.S. products on display and by the number of participating countries. For nearly 20 years, the United States has participated in SIAL Paris. This year’s USA Pavilion at SIAL was the largest to date, with some 140 exhibitors occupying over 2,700 square meters. SIAL offers U.S. food exporters the opportunity to test products and meet with European as well as other international traders and industry professionals. Clearly, this is a major factor for the large U.S. presence. One of my primary reasons for attending the show was to meet face to face with U.S. Cooperators, exhibitors, and importers from Europe and other regions, as well as industry leaders. I had the pleasure of talking with many small- and medium-sized companies and Cooperator groups who expressed their appreciation of our programs and services, including American Food Service, Head Country Food Products, Rogue Creamery, U.S. Meat Export Federation, USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, and representatives from the state regional trade groups (SRTG), just to name a few. Tuesday night’s SRTG-hosted trade reception, as well as an industry reception, was yet another wonderful opportunity to talk with Pavilion exhibitors and trade visitors. Reception guests included buyer groups from North Africa and the Middle East recruited by our FAS Field offices. The European Union (EU) is a major trading partner for the United States. The EU is America’s fifth largest market for agricultural and food products. France alone imports nearly $1 billion of U.S. farm goods annually. However, the scope of SIAL extended beyond the EU, reaching importers from all corners of the world. Building a market presence is sometimes a long process, and participation in these types of trade shows introduces foreign buyers and consumers more quickly and effectively to the attributes and advantages of American products. Looking back on the response of visitors to the wide variety of U.S. food and beverage products showcased in the Pavilion, I am optimistic that the demand for U.S. agricultural products is strong, and our reputation as a reliable supplier of safe, wholesome, and innovative products is excellent.

"Posted by Zoë Hoyle, Southern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Research and Science  Feb 07,   Almost three years ago, two biology professors at Delta State University in Mississippi brainstormed how to give science undergraduates research experience in microbiology and entomology. They hit upon the idea of searching for “science gold” in the bellies of bugs. Professors Tanya McKinney and Ellen Green received $40,000 through a grant for under-represented colleges from the U.S. Forest Service to help with the project. As part of their research experience, students in the program search the guts of beetle larvae to discover new cellulases, enzymes that break down cellulose, an organic compound that helps make plant cell walls rigid. “They (students) crack open logs and extract beetle larvae that they then dissect. They’re looking for the microbes in the larval digestive tract that make cellulases, enzymes that break down cellulose in tree cell walls,” Green said. “Though beetle larvae feed on wood, they don’t actually have the enzymes to digest it, so they rely on microbes.” Used in the paper and pulp industry to break down wood fiber, cellulases are showing promise in the fermentation of woody biomass into biofuels, although this process is still in the experimental stage. Woody biomass is described as byproducts of forest management, such as limbs, tops, needles, leaves, and other woody parts of trees and woody plants. “If we find new cellulases that are even a little more efficient that would be a big deal,” Green said. “These enzymes could be key to making the process of turning wood into fuel efficient and economical.” McKinney said the experience the students receive is invaluable. “Students get to experience what real scientists do on an everyday basis,” she said.

Photo credit: Ellen Green McKinney’s microbiology class and Green’s entomology class worked on the project together. As a result, McKinney’s microbiology students picked up some entomology and Green’s entomology students picked up some microbiology skills. “We were very fortunate to get funding from the Forest Service’s Southern Research Station Partnership Enhancement Initiative grant,” Green said. “It allowed us to design a research experience that we could incorporate into the classroom and reach as many students as possible.” Green and McKinney worked closely with Nathan Schiff, research entomologist with the agency’s Center for Bottomland Hardwoods Research. Schiff participated in classes and attended scientific meetings with project students. “They were quite enthusiastic and seemed to be getting an understanding of the scientific method,” said Schiff. “They seem more advanced than I was at this stage, and I expect that some of them will turn to a career in research.”  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Research and Science  Tags:  biofuels  Energy  Forestry  FS  Mississippi  Science  Southern Research Station",What is the potential application of new cellulases discovered by students researching the guts of beetle larvae in turning woody biomass into biofuels?,The potential application of new cellulases discovered by students is to make the process of turning wood into fuel efficient and economical.

"Philly Market Rises Up to Meet Hunger Challenge  Did you know that nearly one-third of the food available to U.S. retailers and consumers never makes it to the dining room table?  That’s 133 billion pounds of food going to waste--all of which has far-reaching impacts on food security, resource conservation, and climate change.  Experts have projected that reducing food waste by just 15 percent would provide the equivalent of enough food for more than 25 million Americans every year. That’s why my agency, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), decided to help tackle the problem by sponsoring the Terminal Market Food Waste Challenge.  Produce markets across the U.S. joined the friendly 90-day competition by making sure that usable fruits and vegetables were not thrown away.  While these fresh foods weren’t picture-perfect supermarket quality or simply didn’t sell, they were healthy, wholesome foods that could be made into juices, added to animal feeds, used for compost, or donated to charity.

"Deputy Undersecretary for the USDA Food Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 22,   Feeding students healthy, tasty and nutritious school meals can be a challenge.  Just ask any one of the thousands of school nutrition professionals who carry out the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program.  They have to balance menu planning following nutrition standards, financial management, and inventory management, all while making meals that will be enjoyed by students – not always an easy audience.  It is a testament to their dedication that over 90 percent of America’s schools have now implemented the improved standards found in the Healthy Hungry Free Kids Act of . USDA is working hard to find ways to continue to support their efforts. One way we are doing that is a new program that we recently piloted in Mississippi that provides free training through a partnership with the National Food Service Management Institute (NFSMI). The Team Up For School Nutrition Success Training (Team Up) is tailored to schools and covers topics like menu planning, financial management, procurement, meal presentation and appeal, as well as youth engagement tactics, and strategies to reduce plate waste.   Another partner in this initiative is First Lady Michelle Obama. Mrs. Obama is grateful for the hard work being done in our country’s school cafeterias, but also recognizes that some may need a little help. When she heard about our initiative, she took the time to make a video to not only thank and encourage the dedicated school food service professional around the country, but to encourage them to take advantage of Team Up. Hear with the First Lady had to say about Team Up:  The name Team Up really says it all. This unique learning experience provides not only professional training and resources, but peer-to-peer mentoring. Schools have the opportunity to learn from each other, in order to make positive strides toward providing healthy school environments with financial stability and strong student participation. It isn’t a one-off experience. The peer-to-peer mentoring will continue after trainees return to their districts, and NFSMI will conduct 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups to gauge the success of the plans the schools developed after the training.  If additional training is needed, NFSMI will recommend options based on the schools progress.  The state agencies and USDA Food and Nutrition Services will also provide support and feedback.  I couldn’t be more pleased with what I have heard about the how the first training class went, which was attended by 53 participants and 27 mentors. Participants told us that it was helpful to have a chance to discuss their individual challenges, as well as those that participants had in common. They said that hearing their colleagues and mentors talk about how they have handled some of these challenges in their schools was especially helpful.  Some participants even said that it was the best training they had ever attended!  The Kentucky Department of Education staff was so inspired that they created a video to say what a great experience they had. We look forward to continuing our relationship with the White House and all the trainees. Together we can ensure that America’s students are getting and eating the healthiest food possible during the school day.

"Kentucky Public Information Coordinator in  Initiatives  Rural  May 28,   For working parents in isolated rural communities, quality child care is a lifeline that allows them an opportunity to obtain employment so they can provide for their families. So when USDA Rural Development was approached by a child development center in Eastern Kentucky that was in need of expansion so it could serve parents on a waiting list, the agency provided a $75,000 Community Facilities grant. The center hosted an open house on May 21 to celebrate the new addition, inviting local, state and federal officials that had a hand in making it happen. Kentucky USDA Rural Development State Director Tom Fern participated in the program and expressed his congratulations and support for such an important and worthwhile project. Fern said this project highlights the Obama Administration’s focus on programs for improving education and child care, emphasizing the center’s role in the community as not only a daycare facility, but as a quality learning center. Appalachian Early Child Development Center opened in in Letcher County, which is one of Kentucky’s 43 persistent poverty counties.  The USDA funding allowed the child care center operators to build a new 600 square-foot classroom and install a handicapped accessible bathroom. The classroom addition has allowed the center to increase enrollment by 16 children. “With the new classroom, we went from an enrollment of 22 to 38 and took in three new children last week,” said Administrator Bonita Adams. “The grant from Rural Development gave us an opportunity to serve more children, and maintain a quality center.”  Category/Topic:  Initiatives  Rural  Tags:  Appalachia  Child Care  Community Facilities  Education  Grant  Poverty  President Obama  Rural Development",What funding initiative did USDA Rural Development provide to an Eastern Kentucky child development center to support its expansion and increased enrollment?,"USDA Rural Development provided a $75,000 Community Facilities grant."
"APHIS Associate Deputy Administrator, International Services in  Animals  Plants  Nov 13,  Peace Corps Volunteers receiving training on screwworm surveillance program from APHIS employees in Panama. Over the past few months, USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), as part of the U.S. Panama Commission for Eradication of Screwworm, has started to partner with Peace Corps Volunteers in Panama to enhance APHIS’ surveillance activities. Volunteers will be working in rural Panama and meeting with local communities to raise awareness about as well as report suspected cases of New World screwworm, one of the most costly and economically significant pests of livestock in South America. The New World screwworm is a parasite of warm-blooded animals, including humans. Female screwworms are attracted to and lay their eggs in exposed flesh wounds.  After eggs hatch, larvae burrow and feed on flesh, causing severe tissue damage and may even be lethal to the host. The screwworm was eradicated from the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Curacao and, finally, all of Central America in using the Sterile Insect Technique in which sterile male flies are released in massive numbers to mate with wild female populations. The mated female flies then lay non-viable eggs, leading to a decrease and subsequent eradication of screwworm populations. To prevent the screwworm from spreading north of South America, The Commission is maintaining a barrier at the Darien Gap between Panama and Colombia, by utilizing both preventive release of sterile flies and field surveillance. Effective surveillance is crucial to maintaining the screwworm barrier. Beyond Peace Corps Volunteers, U.S. Panama Commission for Eradication of Screwworm relies on field staff and an estimated 552 honorary volunteer inspectors, composed of farmers and private veterinarians to stay on the lookout for suspected cases of screwworm.  There is a constant threat of screwworm reintroduction beyond the Darien Gap from Columbia, where the pest is still present and the migration of people, domesticated animals, and cattle pose a risk. Because most of the Darien Gap and rural areas in Eastern Panama are not easily accessible, APHIS enlisted Peace Corps volunteers, who are already trained and skilled at working with rural communities, to assist with the screwworm surveillance program and reach out to local communities and their officials to explain the risk this pest poses to both people and livestock. “Not only are we creating opportunities for Peace Corps Volunteers who have an interest in agricultural work, it’s an opportunity for APHIS to enhance our screwworm surveillance,” said Deputy Administrator of International Services, Beverly Simmons, who oversees all international action programs, including screwworm.

"Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Jul 03,  A family dinner of marinated chicken and grilled vegetables. Photo by Christopher Leonard.  With Independence Day just around the corner, families across the nation are making preparations to honor the day as the grill chef, king of Castle Suburbia, lord of the living room, master of the flames, marches forth. With a meaty feast to honor the day, the Fourth of July has become almost as much a celebration of grilling greatness as it is a celebration of the nation’s independence. However, all that glitters isn’t gold and an infection of Salmonellosis can quickly knock the grill king off his throne and onto another. Fittingly, the Fourth of July sits in the middle of grilling season. The amber flames roaring up between the grill grates can easily give the false impression of bringing death to all bacteria. However, don’t be misled. Preparing burgers on the grill is a quest that must be tackled safely. Taking the four oaths of food safety (clean, separate, cook and chill) will ensure a feast free from visits to the porcelain throne, or worse, a trip to the emergency room. The battle against foodborne illness begins on the way home from the store. Separating raw meat products from ready-to-eat products on the journey home is an essential step in preventing cross-contamination. Cooking hamburgers to 160 degrees will safely kill Salmonella and dangerous E. coli bacteria, but it does no good if you contaminated a salad with raw meat juice. And the specter of Salmonella isn’t constrained to poultry. No, the risk from this bug reaches to beef, pork and other meats as well as poultry. Ever hear the phrase “clean as you cook?” It’s sage advice considering cross contamination can ruin nearly any dish. Cutting boards, cabinet handles, countertops, basically anything you may touch with your dirty, meaty hands can potentially transmit pathogens. A recent FSIS-sponsored study asked 80 consumers to prepare a meal including a fruit salad and meat dish. The meat provided was inoculated with L. casei, a bacterium found in yogurt, to test average food safety preparation. Half of the group heard food safety messages and half did not. Despite this, 90 percent of the fruit salads were contaminated with the target bacteria. Kitchen towels were a major source of contamination, but the sink, refrigerator, oven and trash cabinet handles were also contaminated, just waiting to infect something else. Check back soon for more information on this study’s findings. If the grill king’s subjects use proper techniques (see FoodSafety.gov for tips), there is still the matter of cooking the meat. Despite the common advice of cooking to color or checking juices, the ONLY way of ensuring doneness is with a food thermometer. Nothing else, short of dragon fire will do. Finally, keep cool by keeping food cool. Don’t leave food out in the hot summer air without a way to chill it. Again, fightback.org is a good source for tips on what foods can stay out and for how long. Stick to these four oaths of food safety and the grill king and his guests will enjoy the feast to honor the day. Make it a safe one.

Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service Meandering along a rustic trail surrounded by towering prairie grasses and blooming flowers, you feel a sense of simplicity as you come to a quiet overlook that slopes onto a bench where you can observe the activity of birds and small mammals surrounding a still pond. This beautiful prairie landscape leaves the viewer with an appreciation for nature’s wide open spaces. And, amazingly, you’re in the middle of one of America’s most populated regions because this could only be the Midewin (mi-Day-win) National Tallgrass Prairie, the largest piece of contiguous open space in the Chicago metropolitan area, located just an hour’s drive from the heart of the Windy City. Unique open space and wildlife viewing is not the only thing offered by the Midewin. There are bison roaming this land and on May 7, the U.S. Forest Service will host the Midewin Bison Expedition. The free event allows visitors to get a unique close up view of bison in the event pasture. Midewin exists today because of a major grassroots efforts by volunteers, partner agencies, businesses and organizations that all worked with the U.S. Forest Service to restore 19,000 acres of farm and industrial land to a mosaic of tallgrass prairie habitat. Restoration efforts included bridge replacement, streambank stabilization, creation of trails and picnic areas; and removal and disposal of old utility poles, railroad ties and other debris, planting native species, and much more. The first 5,000 acres were opened to the public in , and today a total of 7,200 acres and 22 miles of trails are open. The grassland habitat supports the state’s largest population of upland sandpiper and provides refuge for other grassland birds such as the Bobolink and Logger head shrike. A plethora of recreational opportunities await visitors including bicycling, hiking, horseback riding, hunting, outdoor learning, picnicking and now bison viewing. Since establishment of the Midewin, locals and staff have shared a vision of bringing bison back to the Prairie. Thanks to the dedication, work and support of the National Forest Foundation, partners and volunteers this vision was realized in November when four bulls and 23 cows were introduced to their new home. The hope is that the re-introduction will have a positive impact on prairie health. Prairie staff will explore how bison grazing patterns support the tallgrass ecosystem and benefit grassland bird habitat. Ultimately, the experiment will determine if bison can be used as a restoration tool across the more than 1,200 acres they call home. Inspired to make a trip to Illinois? If you can’t make the bison event on May 7, check out other fun and educational programs throughout the year. And, make sure the first stop on your visit is the Midewin’s Welcome Center, where you can find out the best areas for bison viewing and other information to make your prairie adventure a memorable one.

"Hoosier National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Sep 25,  The Ohio River Foundation crewmembers Lydia Cook, Rose Guardino, Rose Johnson, Catherine Kagemann, Callie Schulenburg, and Brynne Taylor build a pollinator habitat. USFS Photo. Streams will flow more freely and bees will have a new home on the Hoosier National Forest, thanks to the work of six young women from central Indiana. The women -- recent high school graduates from Bloomington High School North and South, a high school senior from Bedford, Ind., and an Indiana University student – spent three weeks in July working on ecological restoration projects in the forest. The crew was hired by the Ohio River Foundation and funded through grants from Duke Energy-Indiana, the Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The crew’s first project was to reduce sediment in streams and tributaries that flow into the Ohio River. The crew “hardened” stream crossings by placing about 100 tons of gravel that will hold soil in place and reduce the impact of horses on the trails. The women also learned about ecological conservation. Steve Harris, a wildlife biologist on the Hoosier, taught the importance of pollinators in the forest by building a pollinator “condo.”  The condo consists of a four-by-four-foot wooden frame with large tree limbs stacked inside.  Holes and crevices are cut into the limbs to provide places for pollinators to nest in. “The idea is to build a habitat where native pollinators and other beneficial insects will want to live,” said Harris. Harris and the Ohio River Foundation crew spent a day designing and building the habitat.  They added their own special flair on the project by carving “HNF” and a peace sign into the log.  It is the only pollinator condo on the Hoosier so far. The crew was disappointed the following weekend when they learned that a camper used the bee condo for firewood.  The crew spent a second day rebuilding the habitat and posted a sign to alert campers that this was an important part of the forest and not firewood.

"NRCS Illinois in  Initiatives  Conservation  Mar 10,  This adolescent chick, hatched and raised at the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, is one of ten whooping cranes released in Louisiana in February . Who would believe that within a year of the restoration of a Lawrence County, Illinois floodplain, two endangered birds could find it? This recently happened when a breeding pair of whooping cranes took a break from their northern migration to enjoy the newly restored wetland. Whooping cranes are considered one of the most endangered wetland-dependant species in North America. These magnificent creatures, found only in North America, are the tallest birds on the continent, and are beloved for their distinctive call and intricate mating dance. In , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that the total population of whooping cranes in the U.S. was fewer than 400. Whooping cranes generally mate for life, and may return to the same watering holes again and again over the years. The creation of the 330-acre floodplain, in the historical Purgatory Swamp between the Wabash and Embarras Rivers, was an almost immediate boon for migrating and regional wildlife. As soon as the restoration work was completed, water pooled into a wet area that attracted the pair of whooping cranes, who stopped by this week. The cranes had previously been banded as No.4 Female and No. 16 Male, according to a source with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and are probably on their way back to their nesting site in Wisconsin or Canada. This floodplain project was one of 11 Illinois Emergency Watershed Protection – Floodplain Easement Program projects funded by the Obama Administration’s American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of (Recovery Act). In the past century, over half of the floodplains in Illinois have been altered by levees, lock and dams, and stream channelization. Water that enters these lands not only takes longer to drain, but also causes millions of dollars in crop damage. To help reduce damage to flood-prone lands, and the associated costs for farmers and local governments, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service offers landowners a chance to take flood-prone areas out of production through conservation easements, beginning the process of restoring these lands to their original function as floodplains. Though restoring a floodplain is not a quick process, some benefits are visible almost immediately—like the appearance of the pair of endangered birds! And some of the benefits of wetlands, like downstream flood prevention and water quality protection, are less visible, but just as important. Learn more about NRCS ARRA Programs.

"Event in the Big Apple is No Small Peanuts  You may not see the natural connection between peanut farmers and New York City. However, I recently had the chance to see both worlds collide during a National Peanut Board meeting in the big apple. In addition to the normal items of business, the board also planned some unique peanut-inspired events for New Yorkers. The National Peanut Board is one of the more than 20 industry Research and Promotion Programs that my agency – the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) oversees. These self-help programs that are requested for and completely funded by the industry are charged with developing cutting edge marketing campaigns and supporting nutrition research that benefits all of the industry’s members. The Peanut Board recently invaded the streets of New York to connect the city to the more than 7,000 peanut farming families the board represents. This proved to be very successful as everyone soon learned that our peanut farmers have a strong connection to New Yorkers and to people all over the world.

"National Partnership Office, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jan 28,  Kristin Merony and Tammy Randall-Parker, a Forest Service district ranger and a ski instructor at Telluride Mountain Resort, after Kristin’s first solo run down the mountain after a day of ski lessons. (U.S. Forest Service) A new year means new resolutions and new adventures to embark upon. As many of you sit down to contemplate your goals of the year, I would like to suggest learning to ski or snowboard on national forests. January is Learn to Ski and Snowboard Month, which means that on many resorts learning now can be the easiest and most affordable time to head to a forest near you. The U.S. Forest Service is host to 122 ski areas. The most visited forest, the White River National Forest, has 12 ski areas. Last winter, I ventured onto the Uncompahgre National Forest in Colorado as a true beginner to the sport of skiing. Even today, I can vividly recall the distinctive “click” as my boots locked into my rental skis for the first time. As I looked around at the other skiers and snowboarders effortlessly cruising on the crisp high-country powder I became excited. I knew I would soon be like them, schussing effortlessly down the mountain. Or so I thought. As Colorado’s newest resident, I had to see for myself what it takes to be a skier. Looking around the ski area, I saw children fly past me without ski poles and seasoned experts sliding off the lift with a graceful ease before gliding down the slopes – backwards. I could only imagine how they looked at me. I wobbled back and forth trying just to stand. At that moment I thanked myself for the wisdom to seek out lessons from a professional ski instructor. The slopes I envisioned conquering would have to wait. “The first day is always the toughest,” said my instructor, Tammy Randall-Parker, a Forest Service district ranger and a certified ski instructor. She promised to take me step-by-step through the process from basic mechanics to stopping at full speed, turns on one leg and seemingly endless trips up the magic carpet. Hours later, after getting the feel for it, Tammy finally gave me the clear to take on my first green circle, or the easiest terrain with a gentle slope. I remember that as I pushed off with my ski poles, held my breath and slowly made my way down. All the while, I kept repeating her advice in my head:  “Shift your weight, roll your toes, pick up your foot, glide.” Sounds simple, but without her guidance and tips I would have never made it 10 feet. Lucky for me, Tammy has a lot of experience with newcomers. “When you see their face light up with the big smile as they finish their very first run it’s infectious - like looking in a mirror,” she said. “They instantly forget about the boots that were hurting them and all the falls that came before. Now, they have conquered there first run and will be back to see me tomorrow to learn more and enjoy their new love of skiing.” Newbies like myself have learned how to ski or snowboard on national forests for a very long time. Now, as an employee, I know the agency is very proud to provide a place for people to learn how to slide on snow. Learning to ski with a qualified instructor is the best start to make sure everyone on the mountain has a safe and enjoyable experience like I did. Thanks to Tammy, I did not venture into any terrain I was not prepared for. But in case, she also taught me how to navigate between other skiers and snowboarders who were enjoying their day, too. While on the mountain that day, I learned even more. Forest Service snow ranger Shelly Grail provided a list of tips for skiers and snowboarders to keep them safe while having fun on the mountain. New experiences are always scary at first. However there are plenty of resources out there to get you connected to skiing and snowboarding and make the activity a little less daunting. For example, there is a skiing and snowboarding program for grade-school children in Colorado where fifth and sixth graders have the opportunity to ski for free at certain areas. Learning new things, especially sports, can be difficult. But those new ventures also can create life-long memories; I will never forget as we turned in our rental gear, my instructor turned to me, gave me a high five and said, “You are officially a skier.” I don’t think I stopped smiling the entire ride home. The bright sunshine and clear blue skies of Colorado served as a perfect backdrop for Kristin Merony as she prepared to learn how to ski at Telluride Mountain Resort, which operates on the Uncompahgre National Forest.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) divides the U.S. states by region, and we're going to first take a look at the Upper Midwest Region, which includes Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Each of these states has their own agricultural accomplishments, but together accounted for over 16% of the national total value of agricultural products sold in . All three states rank in the top 10 for the total value of agricultural products sold, which includes sales of all products produced by farmers in each state. Producers in Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin together provide much of what we see on our breakfast plates. Let’s break our fast on ag census blogs and start this monthly series with breakfast foods and the state rankings for these important staples.  Pancake mix and bread: Minnesota is second in spring wheat production and third in buckwheat production.  Oatmeal and cereal: Minnesota is second, Wisconsin fourth and Iowa sixth in oat production.  Scrambled eggs: Iowa is first, Minnesota eighth and Wisconsin 17th in egg layers for the kitchen table.  Bacon: Iowa is first, Minnesota second and Wisconsin 18th in hog inventory.  Maple syrup: Wisconsin is fourth, Minnesota 11th and Iowa 14th in maple syrup production.  Sugar: Minnesota is first in sugarbeet production.  Milk: Wisconsin is second, Minnesota seventh and Iowa 10th in milk sales.  Honey: Minnesota is fourth, Wisconsin 16th and Iowa 19th in honey production. So, thank farmers for all the commodities they produce – especially when you start your morning at the breakfast table or treat yourself with breakfast for dinner!

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Florida in  Conservation  Mar 05,  Project Grow students at TERRA Environmental Research Institute are given instruction on the steps to collect field used in USDA’s National Resources Inventory (NRI). Photo by: Yolanda Rivera, NRCS Florida. Students at a public high school in Florida are receiving some hands-on experience and invaluable mentoring from the staff at USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) as a result of a USDA grant. Project Grow aims to educate high school students about careers and college education requirements for career positions with NRCS in an agency effort to meet future staffing needs. NRCS is shifting to a younger age group for recruitment to evaluate if it’s effective in raising awareness for potential new staff members. The grant in helped fund workshops for this school year and the next for high school students at TERRA Environmental Research Institute in Miami-Dade County. The 1.5-hour sessions share the educational requirements for various NRCS positions as well as hands-on activities to demonstrate skills, methods and tools used by staff. Each workshop is personalized from the perspective of the NRCS staff member who shares their unique educational background, experiences and career path.  So far this year, NRCS soil scientists, district conservationists, soil conservationists, agricultural engineers and resource conservationists have presented. Next school year, NRCS staff in southern Florida will present on career positions specializing in natural resources inventory, engineering, soil science, range conservation and grazing lands management. “The presentations and hands-on activities have been very instrumental in providing my students with many lessons,” said Surey Rios, a teacher at TERRA. “We are looking forward to the next presenters.” The visits from NRCS staff were important because it helps students see the real-world applications of concepts that they are learning and hear the life stories of other adults, Rios said. She also said they enable students to learn about careers beyond those of their parents and about different education tracts. Project Grow is funded through a two-year grant from NRCS in partnership with Florida International University, Fairchild Tropical Botanic Gardens and TERRA. TERRA is a public high school for students who excel in math and science, coinciding with the background for many NRCS positions in the management of natural resources on private lands in the United States.

"Eastern Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Nov 18,  The impressive entryway arch, by designer Mario Constantini, welcomes visitors to the Milwaukee Rotary Centennial Arboretum. (Courtesy Milwaukee Urban Connections/ Jean Claassen) The Forest Service recently celebrated the opening of the Milwaukee Rotary Centennial Arboretum at the Urban Ecology Center - Riverside Park in Milwaukee. In , the USDA Forest Service, Eastern Region proudly joined Urban Ecology Center partners – the Rotary Club of Milwaukee, Milwaukee County Parks and the River Revitalization Foundation – in this exciting project. The designation as a Forest Service’s Children’s Forest adds an element of wonder to the space. As visitors explore this outdoor play space, they will discover interpretive stations to help them forge a deeper connection with nature. Only one of 22 children’s forests throughout the country, this Milwaukee forest is one of only three located within a major urban area. As you pass under the archway into the arboretum, you find yourself climbing a hill surrounded by beautiful native plants and trees. Descending the hill, you catch a glimpse of the Milwaukee River gently flowing. Moving from this “prairie” scape, you find yourself in the forest, searching out “imaginature stations,” signified by a leaf imprint on a small wooden tree ring– like a built in scavenger hunt! When you get to the river, you can preview recent plantings, as well as non-native invasive species treatments on the river bank. You may even see ducks floating along, or people having fun careening down the river in a canoe. And, that is just the beginning! “I encourage visitors to come out to the new space and get your hands dirty by planting some native plants,” said Milwaukee Urban Connections coordinator Jean Claassen. “Visitors will also have the opportunity to receive a first-rate tour of the new arboretum from UEC educators.” Visitors were able to witness the symmetry of nature and art through a beautiful painting by well-known artist Louise Phillips, who was on hand to dedicate it to the children’s forest. Phillips aspires to donate one of her paintings to each children's forest across the country. “A partnership truly flourishes when both parties have similar goals and missions. A key goal of the Eastern Region’s Urban Connections program is to connect urban residents with nature and encourage more kids in the woods,” said Eastern Regional Forester Kathleen Atkinson.  “The mission of the UEC is to foster ecological understanding as inspiration for change, neighborhood by neighborhood. Because of this symmetry, we are excited about the possibilities of this partnership – and one great outcome is the Milwaukee Rotary Centennial Arboretum.” Signage at the new Milwaukee Rotary Centennial Arboretum features information related to its designation as a Children’s Forest.

"USDA also announces record $2.3 billion investments under the Western Water Framework; Funding builds on Administration’s historic water conservation efforts, which have stabilized short-term western water supply and are investing in long-term solutions  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .24  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@usda.gov  WASHINGTON, Aug. 1, – Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will invest $400 million with at least 18 irrigation districts to help farmers continue commodity production while also conserving water across the West. This funding – which will support irrigation districts and producers in using innovative water savings technologies and farming practices while producing water-saving commodities in the face of continued drought – is expected to conserve up to 50,000 acre-feet in water use across 250,000 acres of irrigated land in production, while expanding and creating new, sustainable market opportunities. This historic funding builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to conserve water, increase the efficiency of water use, upgrade existing infrastructure, and overall strengthen water security in the West. With historic water conservation enabled by President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Reclamation announced in May it had staved off the immediate possibility of the Colorado River System’s reservoirs from falling to critically low elevations that would threaten water deliveries and power production. Due to record conservation investments as well as improved hydrology, Lake Mead levels today are the highest since May . The Administration is now working to ensure the long-term sustainability and resilience by focusing on long-term water conservation in several basins across the west. ""Agricultural producers are the backbone of rural communities across the West and many of them are struggling under prolonged drought conditions,” Vilsack said. “USDA is taking an ‘all hands’ approach to help address this challenge, including these new partnerships with irrigation districts to support producers. We want to scale up the tools available to keep farmers farming, while also voluntarily conserving water and expanding markets for water-saving commodities.” Partnering with Irrigation Districts to Support Water Conservation, Produce Water-Saving Commodities USDA worked to select irrigation districts based on several commodity production and water management-related criteria in order to maximize the ability to achieve program objectives, leveraging available from the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Reclamation to ensure close alignment and partnership. USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) provided and analysis to support the preliminary selections. Districts that have been preliminarily selected for potential inclusion in this program include:  Black Canyon Irrigation District, Idaho  Brooklyn Canal Company, Utah  Central Oregon Irrigation District, Ore.  Central Arizona Irrigation and Drainage District, Ariz.  Corcoran Irrigation District, Calif.  East Columbia Basin Irrigation District, Wash.  Elephant Butte Irrigation District, N.M.  Glenn – Colusa Irrigation District, Calif.  Greybull Valley Irrigation District, Wyo.  Hidalgo & Cameron Counties Irrigation District 9, Texas  Huntley Project Irrigation District, Mont.  Imperial Irrigation District, Calif.  Maricopa – Stanfield Irrigation and Drainage District, Ariz.  Palisade Irrigation District, Colo.  Quincy Columbia Basin Irrigation District, Wash.  Solano Irrigation District, Calif.  Sutter Mutual Water Company, Calif.  Truckee-Carson Irrigation District, Nev. The preliminary selected districts may receive up to $15 million each in the awards and will enter into sub-agreements with the producers participating within the district. Depending on available funding, awards to additional districts may be possible. Producers who participate will receive payments for voluntarily reducing water consumption while maintaining commodity production. The needs of producers will determine the specific strategies for water conservation, including irrigation improvements, shifts in management practices, shifts in cropping systems, and other innovative strategies. USDA will learn from the diversity of strategies used and identify additional opportunities to maintain and expand water-saving commodity production in the future. Participating producers and irrigation districts will commit to ensuring continued commodity production in the areas where water consumption is reduced. USDA is working to finalize agreements with the preliminarily selected districts, which will include the details of each individual district’s water-saving strategies, commodities to be produced, and specific budgets. Following the finalization of those awards, producers within the participating districts will work directly through their irrigation districts to participate. USDA and the preliminarily selected districts will provide more details on the agreements and opportunities for producers to directly enroll. “Maricopa-Stanfield Irrigation and Drainage District is pleased to be working with USDA to implement practices and projects that save water and improve efficiencies at a time when the historic drought in the southwest has put so much pressure on our agricultural producers. Investing in agriculture is an investment in America,” the District said. “Quincy-Columbia Basin Irrigation District is excited to enter into partnership with USDA to help bring Federal dollars to local growers. Our top priority is providing efficient and dependable irrigation water to our constituents, and we look forward to working with USDA to explore new water-efficient practices in the Columbia Basin,” the District said. “Greybull Valley Irrigation District (GVID) is extremely excited to explore water conservation efforts with the USDA Water-Saving Commodities team, this is a great opportunity for the District and their producers. GVID is always looking for ways to conserve water while supplying their producers with a steady flow for their crops, livestock, underground pipelines and pivots. The District is looking forward to discovering other conservation measures that would be very beneficial for all GVID members,” GVID said. Investing in Water Conservation in Tribal Communities and Acequias In addition to the preliminarily selected districts announced today, USDA is also announcing a Tribal set-aside within the program, targeting up to $40 million in funding for additional awards within Indian Country. USDA will work with the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Tribes, and Tribal producers to reduce water consumption and maintain land in agricultural production – supporting the production of water-saving commodities. USDA is partnering with BIA to use available and ensure meaningful engagement with Tribes to establish selection criteria that reflect the specific needs and water management systems within Indian Country. Additional information for further engagement and selections will be provided in the weeks ahead. USDA will also include targeted assistance to support water-saving commodity production for acequias, recognizing that many irrigators in the Southwest are formed under the community-based acequia model instead of the irrigation district model. Additional information regarding targeted assistance to acequias that reflects the historical nature of their water distribution structure will follow. Additional information for further engagement with Tribes and acequias will be provided in the weeks ahead. Historic Investments in Western Water Complement Water-Saving Commodities Program USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is working to help producers and communities conserve water, manage and prepare for the effects of climate change and build drought resilience in the West through its Western Water and Working Lands Framework for Conservation Action (Western Water Framework), which was launched in . The Western Water Framework describes how NRCS assistance is used to address water resource related issues in 17 states in the West. In fiscal year , NRCS provided $2.3 billion in conservation investments that help producers and communities in Western states better steward water resources, including investments that also support climate change mitigation. This total includes a boost of 9.7 percent or $213.3 million from the Inflation Reduction Act. The Western Water Framework includes key NRCS conservation programs, including the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP). Within EQIP NRCS has created a WaterSMART Initiative (WSI), to coordinate investments with the Bureau of Reclamation’s WaterSMART investments in priority areas. For Fiscal Year , NRCS selected 9 new priority areas and is continuing to offer funding in 36 prior approved areas, making $29.7 million in EQIP funding available through the WSI across 16 states. EQIP and CSP provide conservation planning and funding to help with implementation of conservation practices. Practices like irrigation water management improve irrigation efficiency and mitigate climate change. Meanwhile, practices like conservation crop rotation, cover crop, residue and tillage management, no-till, and nutrient management help producers build resilience to future drought. ACEP gives producers and landowners tools to protect wetlands, grasslands and agricultural lands which can be used to conserve water. Together, these efforts by FSA and NRCS advance USDA’s efforts to create more, new, and better market opportunities, sustainably grow agricultural productivity to feed a growing population, and help farmers and natural resource managers manage and prepare for the effects of climate change.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Mar 18,  It’s a special time of year as we welcome spring and celebrate several holidays. Many families and communities will be celebrating with their Easter, Eid, and Passover traditions. Whether you’re celebrating your Easter dinner with ham, Eid lunch with lamb, or Seder meal with brisket, remember to keep food safety at the forefront. In a season of different traditions and foods, USDA offers the same Food Safety Steps for everyone:  Be sure to allow plenty of time to thaw a frozen ham, lamb, or brisket with the three safe thawing methods: refrigerator, cold water, or microwave thawing.  FSIS recommends the following minimum internal temperatures when cooking meat and poultry items:  Beef, pork, veal and lamb steaks, chops, roasts: 145 F  Fish and shellfish: 145 F  Ham, fresh or smoked (uncooked): 145 F  Eggs: 160 F  Ground meats: 160 F  All poultry (breasts, whole bird, legs, thighs, wings, ground poultry, giblets, and stuffing): 165 F  When reheating already cooked meat and poultry items that have cooled, they should be reheated to at least 165 F. USDA recommends reheating cooked meat and poultry products on the stove top, in the oven, or in a microwave. Keep in mind the “Danger Zone” between 40 and 140 F — a temperature where foodborne bacteria multiply rapidly and cause foodborne illness. To prevent entering the Danger Zone, perishable foods, such as kebabs, brisket, or ham, should be discarded if left out for longer than two hours. To prevent food waste, refrigerate or freeze perishable items within two hours, or keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold.  Divide leftovers into smaller portions and refrigerate or freeze them in shallow containers, which helps leftovers cool quicker than storing them in large quantities. Leftovers can be kept in the refrigerator for three to four days or frozen indefinitely, but quality will decrease after three to four months. Learn more about the safe handling of beef, ham, and lamb products. If you have questions about preparing meat, poultry or egg dishes, contact USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline to talk to a food safety specialist or chat live at www.ask.usda.gov from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 12,  Warm Fire, . Over the last three decades, fire season lengths have increased by 60-80 days and annual acreages burned have more than doubled to over 7 million acres annually. In addition, growing housing development in forests has put more people and houses in harms’ way, also making firefighting efforts more expensive. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service, Southwestern Region, Kaibab National Forest. Forests significantly contribute to our quality of life, but climate change is adversely affecting natural resources in rural and urban areas across the U.S. A new report released by the White House, the National Climate Assessment, explores many related issues including how a warming planet affects our forests. With contributions from U.S. Forest Service scientists, the report is one of the most comprehensive examinations of climate change and its effects on forested land. It concludes that a warming climate will complicate future management of public, private and tribal forests. “Climate change is currently triggering multiple, sometimes contrasting, responses from our forests,” said Dave Cleaves, U.S. Forest Service Climate Change Advisor. “Longer growing seasons and gradually warming temperatures are helping trees grow faster in some areas, but in other areas, these longer and warmer growing seasons increase late summer moisture stress and reduce tree growth.” The Forest Service integrates climate change awareness, mitigation and adaptation into the management of its 193 million acres through the Climate Change Performance Scorecard.  For example, this tool has encouraged national forests to identify vulnerable water resources, plant more climate-resilient tree species, research carbon storage capacity and more. Some of the other ways the Forest Service manages wildlands includes reducing the potential for large crown fires expected in a warmer climate by removing hazardous fuels and managing for lower stem densities in dry forests, managing forest genetic diversity to increase resilience to a warmer climate and restoring riparian areas adjacent to streams to ensure cold-water fish habitat during summer low-flow periods. Public and private forests in the U.S. will increasingly be vulnerable to ecosystem changes and tree mortality through fire, insect infestations, drought and disease outbreaks. At the same time, the need for healthy forests will only continue to increase. Forests provide an expanding opportunity to support emerging bioenergy markets and carbon credit systems. It is likely such uses will interact with the demand for wood products, healthy watersheds and recreational opportunities. There will also be continued economic pressures encouraging a shift from forestland to agricultural or urban land uses. According to Linda Joyce, a Forest Service scientist, and one of the authors of the report, climate-smart management practices are being developed and implemented, and the agency is maintaining its focus on retaining forests as forests restoring forest health and resilience, and reforesting private and federal lands. However, Joyce emphasized that implementation of climate-smart management practices can be increased only through effective integration of scientific information in management of our national wildlands.

Private landowners can also adopt these strategies, as well as others such as: 1. Developing and implementing climate-smart management practices. 2. Creating carbon credit systems that support reforestation and afforestation efforts. 3. Partnering with government agencies to access funding and expertise for forest conservation and restoration projects. 4.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 07,   Mother’s Day is just around the corner and most of us have yet to find that “perfect” gift for mom. But don’t panic. Let the U.S. Forest Service help out. You read that right. The Forest Service wants you to give mom the gift of nature in all its innate perfection. And all you need to do is take her to your nearest national forest or grasslands. For instance, if you live in Washington State, the Olympic National Forest, with its dramatic mountain range, conjures up images of the European Alps. The beauty doesn’t end there, though. The Olympics’ varied landscape includes lush rain forests, deep canyons, high mountain ridges and ocean beaches. Taking mom on a drive through this incomparable backdrop would be a scenic tour to brighten her day. Just south of the Olympic National Forest is the Gifford Pinchot National Forest (named for the founder of the Forest Service). Within the forest is one of the most famous volcanos in the world, Mount St. Helens. A visit to the Forest Service-managed Mount Saint Helens National Volcanic Monument is well worth the trip and will make for a Mother’s Day to remember. Looks can be deceiving: Mount St. Helens from its south facing slop looks as if had never erupted. Photo Credit: Robert H. Westover. Not all forests are full of trees, though. Some Forest Service land is filled with millions of cacti. So, if you happen to be in Arizona, take mom to the awe inspiring Sabino Canyon on the Coronado National Forest just north of Tucson, Ariz.  (Some of the trail is handicapped accessible.) You’ll want to hike the wonders of the Seven Falls, but mom will have to be a sturdy hiker because the trail is about 8 miles round trip and you’ll have to cross a stream a dozen times as you zigzag through the valley to and from the falls. But the views are well worth it. Like a giant rock-ribbed cathedral rising up from the valley floor, the canyon suddenly opens up to the vista of the Seven Falls splashing down a natural staircase feature that climbs over a thousand feet directly in front of you. But if forests and mountains don’t excite mom, don’t forget that the Forest Service manages millions of acres of grasslands in the heart of the ancient prairie lands of the West. From northern Texas to North Dakota, these serene grasslands seem to unfold forever across landscapes uninterrupted by mountain ranges. Aside from taking in the scenic views, you can do many other things on Forest Service grasslands. For instance on the Pawnee National Grassland you can camp, hike, mountain bike, or even go horseback riding. If you live in North Carolina, visiting the Pisgah National Forest is a must. Surrounding the historic town of Ashville, N.C., and near the cradle of American forestry, the Biltmore Estate, the Pisgah has many fun activities for mom and family. Whitewater runs through the mountains of the forest creating deep river gorges, world-class whitewater, premier trout streams, scenic waterfalls and reservoirs with undeveloped shorelines. For a truly breathtaking experience that she won’t soon forget, take mom to Wilson Creek which offers great adventures for hiking, scenic viewing, mountain biking, fishing, camping, horseback riding and backpacking! There is just so much you can do on your national forests and grasslands. You might discover taking mom into the woods (or grasslands, or desert) will be something you’ll want to do every Mother’s Day—or any other day of the year!

"Communications Director, USDA Rural Development, Tennessee in  Energy  Rural  Feb 01,   USDA Business and Cooperative Programs Administrator Judith Canales convened a roundtable of renewable energy experts from the southeast in Nashville on January 26, to discuss development and marketing of bioenergy technologies and advanced biofuels. Despite an unexpected snow the night before, participants traveled in from Memphis and Knoxville as well as Middle Tennessee. FSA and Rural Development State Directors Gene Davidson and Bobby Goode hosted the Administrator and Ed Harlan of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Louis Buck of Tennessee Biomass Supply Cooperative, Pete Nelson of Memphis Bioworks, Atha Comiskey and Bart Comiskey of Clean Cities of Middle Tennessee, Paul Melgaard of Eco Energy, Terry Ruse of Clean Fuels Development Coalition, Warren Nevad of the Tennessee Renewable Energy Economic Council, Dan Stasser of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Stan Boyd and David Owenby of the Tennessee Department of Transportation and Rural Development Tennessee Energy Programs Coordinator Will Dodson. Canales opened the forum with the idea that, ""By making renewable energy sources commercially viable based on feed stock available in each region of the country, we create sustainable opportunities for job creation and economic development, and keep more energy dollars in the community."" The spirited discussion covered a range of challenges on the horizon for the emerging bioenergy industry from traditional fuel providers to misperceptions about the tradeoff between food and fuel crops. Canales emphasized that changes are coming to the USDA energy programs that will allow applications to be submitted year round and to encourage geographic and technological diversity. Canales and others brought up the regional nature of biofuel production. Regionally significant feed stocks mentioned included cellulosic switch grass, wood pulp and sucrose-rich crops. With the commercial availability of existing flex fuels growing rapidly, participants called for a fresh examination of regulations intended to encourage their use. ""Greater use helps drive down production costs and will encourage more stations to carry fuels like E20, E30 and E85 as they come online,"" said Goode. ""We can help drive the change to cleaner fuels by doing more to take advantage of flex fuels in fleet vehicles and by educating consumers on the benefits of using more renewable American-made energy resources."" Coop Manager Louis Buck said that with the advances being made in bioenergy production today he looks forward to a time when farmers send power down wires to the city and get a check delivered back in the mail. Electronic mail, presumably. During the roundtable, Canales also announced the award of a $25,000 Rural Energy for America (REAP) grant to the Tennessee Biomass Supply Cooperative. According to Buck, ""The investment will be used for research into commercializing a new, more efficient technology for generating hydrogen from what is typically regarded as low-potential biomass feed stock.""

"Deputy Administrator for Office of Policy Support, Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Aug 09,   As directed by Congress in , USDA is re-evaluating the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP)—the estimated cost of an affordable, nutritious diet. The TFP is used to calculate SNAP benefit levels. To complement the re-evaluation efforts and gather insights from those who will be impacted by the result, USDA recently hosted five listening sessions with SNAP participants, researchers, advocates, and others. Here’s some of what we heard: Families are struggling to get enough food with current SNAP benefit levels: Dr. Valerie Smith, a Tyler, Texas pediatrician, said she sees “too many families and children of all ages who consistently don't have enough food to make it through the month [to] decrease food insecurity and set children up with healthy eating habits for the rest of their lives.” Limited resources push families to make less healthful choices: “It is hard to choose between having enough to eat and trying to get healthier,” said one SNAP participant, describing the difficult choice to limit fresh food purchases in favor of packaged products that were sometimes less healthful but more affordable. Additional SNAP benefits can promote nutrition security—and make better futures possible: A member of the Association of State Public Health Nutritionists explained that increasing SNAP benefits would not only help families afford nutritious food, but also with “advancing overall health outcomes, lowering healthcare costs, and improving the economy.” USDA appreciates those who shared their time and their experiences with us, as we work to make SNAP as effective as possible.

"Posted by Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack in  USDA Results  Rural  Jun 09,   Cross posted from the White House blog: This morning, President Obama signed an Executive Order establishing a White House Rural Council, the first entity of its kind established to focus on policy initiatives for Rural Americans.  The President’s signature on this document represents a truly historic moment for the nation.  I am honored to serve as the Chair of the Council and work directly with my Cabinet colleagues from across the federal government to improve the economic conditions and quality of life for millions of Rural Americans. President Obama has already established an impressive record in rural areas, which the Rural Council will build on.  The Administration’s record includes substantial investments in rural America to modernize our Nation’s infrastructure, provide broadband access to 10 million Americans, enhance energy independence, expand educational opportunities, and provide affordable health care.  Nevertheless, the President believes that even more needs to be done in order to fully capitalize on the emerging opportunities in Rural America.  Despite recent advances, rural communities continue to struggle to maintain the population and businesses needed for sustained economic growth. The White House Rural Council will focus on actions to better coordinate and streamline federal program efforts in rural America, and to better leverage federal investments.  The collaboration will result in better programs and services in rural communities and maximize the benefits of those programs. Economic growth, prosperity, and the creation of quality jobs are on the minds of every citizen.  This morning, the White House Rural Council met and discussed ways to increase the availability of working capital investment.  This is absolutely essential in order for small towns and rural areas to attract new businesses, spur growth and create jobs.  This is especially true in the sectors of economic growth involving new technological innovations and development of renewable energy – areas where Rural America has the most promise, but faces the most difficult competitive challenges. In addition, I am greatly looking forward to utilizing the Rural Council as a means of connecting with Rural America and to continue the important dialogue the Administration has worked to establish with rural communities since regarding the needs and challenges that Rural America faces.  In the coming months, my Cabinet colleagues and I will be communicating Rural America to ensure that every American is aware of the programs and services they can access.  And we will get the most direct and current input from rural stakeholders to ensure we provide the best service possible. In the end, millions of Americans are counting on us to ensure that young people growing up in rural places have a bright future ahead – that they can envision a tomorrow that includes a job, and a vibrant rural community that they can call home.  Ensuring that tomorrow begins with the actions we take today.  And today, I am proud to be part of the President’s White House Rural Council and to help “Win the Future” for Rural America.

"Public Information Coordinator, Mississippi Rural Development in  Rural  May 03,   U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack joined Obama Administration Cabinet members Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan, as well as Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate, Small Business Administration Administrator Karen Mills, and other state and local officials to tour areas in Alabama and Mississippi affected by last week’s tornadoes. After visiting devastated sites in Birmingham and nearby areas, the group crossed over to Mississippi, where they surveyed the damage done to Smithville, a town of approximately that was almost literally wiped off the map. In Smithville, Miss. the senior administration officials were joined by Mississippi’s USDA Rural Development State Director Trina George, who had made the trek from her home in central Mississippi in the pre-dawn hours on Thursday, the day after the tornado hit. State Director George viewed damaged areas in Maben, Amory, and parts of Chickasaw County on Thursday. She had monitored the tornado, keeping in contact with local officials as the tornado went through Mississippi on Wednesday. She linked up on Thursday morning with local USDA personnel in Oktibbeha County, arriving only hours after the tornado had passed through. She also toured damaged areas in Neshoba and Kemper Counties that afternoon. Secretary Tom Vilsack toured the area of Smithville, Mississippi and saw firsthand the heavy damage caused by the tornado. He is seen in this photo talking to one of the victims of the disastrous weather. Behind him is USDA Rural Development State Director Trina George of Mississippi. Secretary Vilsack and State Director George were two of a number of Obama Administration Cabinet officials, federal administrators, and local leaders to see the damage caused by tornadoes in Mississippi and Alabama. “It is heartbreaking to see this damage and to talk to the people who are victims of the tornado,” said George. “I was able to not only see the physical damages, but I was able to listen to some of the actual victims, many of whom had lost everything. However, I can report that USDA Rural Development has programs that can offer some relief to these unfortunate victims.” George cited USDA Rural Development programs such as funding to replace and repair single-family homes, shared community facilities and the water and wastewater systems in the damaged areas. “I want to make sure that people know about the availability of our programs, especially our single-family home loan and home repair loan programs, so that they can rebuild their homes and businesses and continue to have clean water.” George has a history of fast action on disaster relief. Most recently, she was on the scene the day after tornadoes ran thru Holmes and Yazoo Counties in and made sure that USDA Rural Development programs were a part of both the immediate and long-term relief efforts in those counties. Local officials in both counties credited George and USDA Rural Development for their fast work in making resources available, especially to the homeowners who lost their homes in that disaster. “These people have lost everything but their spirit. For them to see the highest officials in our nation’s government, including Cabinet secretaries and head of relief agencies coming to what is left of their town to see the damage personally,” Said George, “I can’t convey to ya’ll how uplifting that is to those people.

"Technical Information Specialist, USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline, Food Safety Education Staff in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Dec 23,   ¡Esta es la época para el jamón! Si usted es fanático del jamón, esta es la época para usted.  Aparte del Día de Pascua, más jamones son servidos durante las fiestas de invierno que en ninguna otra época del año.  Solamente visite un familiar o amigo y probablemente le será servido este platillo tan fácil de preparar. Desafortunadamente, es muy fácil contraer enfermedades relacionadas a los alimentos si usted come jamón que ha sido dejado a temperatura ambiente o que ha sido expuesto a otras practicas incorrectas. El Servicio de Inocuidad e Inspección de los Alimentos (FSIS por sus siglas en ingles) del Departamento de Agricultura de los Estados Unidos (USDA por sus siglas en inglés) recomienda que se sigan los siguientes pasos para que tanto los anfitriones como sus invitados tenga una fiestas seguras. Comprando el Jamón Cuando compre uno, la temperatura el momento en que se compra es importante.  Cuarenta grados en la temperatura segura cuando se compran jamones refrigerados.  Cuando compre jamón asegúrese que la temperatura a la que ha sido guardado sea 40 °F o menos. Lleve el jamón a su casa y refrigérelo en un lapso de dos horas.  Las bacterias crecen rápidamente en la llamada “Zona de Peligro” la cual es entre los 40 °F y los 140 °F. Cuando compre un jamón en una tienda o restaurant, manténgalo caliente – al menos a 140 °F. Los jamones enlatados y los jamones secos son seguros a temperatura ambiente. Guardando el Jamón Algunas personas piensan que como el jamón es “curado” pueden refrigerarlo por más tiempo que otras carnes. Aunque el jamón tiene una vida más larga que las aves y carnes crudas, el jamón no dura para siempre. Las fechas en los paquetes de jamón son fechas de “compra”  y no definen cuanto tiempo puede guardar el jamón en su refrigerador – a menos que el jamón sea guardado al vacio en una planta de inspeccionada por USDA. Usted puede guardar jamón perecedero usando los siguientes limites de tiempo: Jamón crudo, cocido y cortado en lascas, o no cortado en lascas, 3-5 días; Jamón cocido, 3-4 días.  Para más tiempos de almacenamiento vaya a PregúnteleaKaren.gov y busque bajo “almacenamiento de jamón”. El jamón de cualquier clase puede ser congelado indefinidamente pero para mejor calidad este debe ser consumido en 1-2 meses. Un jamón complete (“country ham”) puede ser guardado a temperatura ambiente por un año.  Luego de un año la calidad de este puede bajar. Un jamón enlatado puede ser guardado a temperatura ambiente por hasta dos años. Cocinando el Jamón Cocine todo jamón crudo y jamón listo para comer a una temperatura interna mínima de 145 °F medida por un termómetro de cocina mientras el jamón está todavía en la fuente de calor. Ponga el horno a 25 °F. Para ver las temperaturas de cocinar estimadas, vaya a PregúnteleaKaren.gov y escriba “temperaturas para cocinar jamón” para obtener una tabla de temperaturas al cocinar. Para salubridad y calidad, permita que la carne repose por tres minutes antes de cortarla o consumirla. Por preferencias personales algunos consumidores prefieren cocinar las carnes a temperaturas más altas. Puede recalentar jamones cocidos pre empacados en una planta inspeccionada por USDA a 140 °F y los otros a 165 °F. “Pregúntele a Karen”, la representante virtual de FSIS está disponible las 24 horas en PregúnteleaKaren.gov o mediante el uso de teléfonos inteligentes en  m.pregunteleakaren.gov.

"Washington Middle School Students Give Back for Third Annual Day of Service  Over the past three years, USDA has welcomed seventh-graders from Alice Deal Middle School in Washington, D.C. to participate in “Deal Gives Back,” a day of service that empowers students to serve their community. This year was no exception. Alongside local volunteers, 118 students and faculty spent a day at USDA’s People’s Garden planting, weeding, and tilling soil to better understand how community gardens can increase access to fresh, healthy food choices in communities where nutritious options aren’t easily accessible. All work and no play? Not a chance. After a warm welcome from USDA Assistant Secretary for Administration Dr. Gregory Parham, the students checked out demonstrations from the Agricultural Research Services’ (ARS) Bee Research and Systematic Etymology Labs to learn about insect classification, research, and the vital role pollinators play in growing healthy fruits and vegetables.

"Recreation, Heritage and Volunteer Resources, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Dec 22,  Civic Works corps members from Baltimore, Maryland featured in the film “Discovering the Boulder-White Clouds.” (Courtesy The Corps Network/Levi Novey) Used with permission.  On a chilly Friday afternoon in Washington, D.C., local employees, partners, and visitors took refuge from the cold outside for a special film-screening event in USDA’s Jefferson Auditorium, “Engaging the Next Generation of Conservation Stewards.”  Five short films debuted to an audience of more than 80 partners and guests. This point, in itself, may have you wondering, “So What?” However, it’s the goal of the films and the potential for affecting the lives of young people that make this an important event.  The videos aimed to illustrate the importance of engaging youth in conservation, and inspiring the next generation of environmental leaders. The films displayed a variety of recreational, service, volunteer, and work experiences, while illustrating the community, career, and cultural benefits of exposing youth to the outdoors.  “It’s really important for people to understand the value of places like this, but it’s also good to take that ethic back to your communities too,” said Levi Novey of the Corps Network, who led a group of inner-city Baltimore youth with CivicWorks on an expedition to the Boulder-White Clouds area.  Many of the young people featured in the films shared that these were their first time experiencing the great outdoors, and the impact this had on their perception for conservation and public land stewardship. In one video, for example, a network of Latinos advocating for the health of the Colorado River led a group of Latino youth on an adventure of a lifetime navigating the river through the Grand Canyon with the goal of influencing Latinos to be future advocates for the river.  “Feeling the water is a slap in the face with our history, with our culture, and it’s just wonderful,” said Rosalia Salazar of Las Vegas.  Others even mentioned how these experiences exposed them to career options they had not previously considered, expressing aspirations of working with the Forest Service, and other federal public land agencies. “Being to a place like this [brings] a difference in people. I see a connection between what I do and coming [here],” said Jamaal Weems of CivicWorks in Baltimore. “The connection is how to keep the environment a place where people can come at peace, a safe environment, a safe place… If it was up to me, I would do my best to help protect the environment because this is a beautiful place.”  Interspersed between films were remarks made by USDA Under Secretary Robert Bonnie, speakers from the U.S. Department of Interior, The Corps Network, Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, AmeriCorps, Student Conservation Association, and a young corps participant. The videos were unique because they presented diversity of people, places, and projects. The films aimed to demonstrate the honest and transformative experiences of the next generation of diverse conservation leaders, many from minority backgrounds.  “For a lot of these youth, [they] are marginalized in society and they don’t have that many opportunities like this [so] I think it means that much more to them. Culturally, it’s part of their genetic memory…is that memory and that connection to the land and that appreciation of nature. I feel a re-introduction to that part of themselves and that part of their story” said Jesus “Chucho” Ruiz of Chicanos por la Causa.  The films advocate for a strong work ethic from the participants, indicating that their work and service not only benefits them today, but will help to preserve those benefits for future generations to come.  “Films like this are critically important, because they convey to viewers the positive impact of engaging with youth and veterans. They highlight the key contributions these people provide to 21 CSC programs, and, critically, demonstrate how these programs can shape the lives of participants in a constructive and rewarding way.  Both viewers and participants are exposed to life changing experiences they will never forget,” said Meryl Harrell of USDA.  The hope is that the participants will share their experiences with others, and continue to develop themselves as stewards of the land.  Visit The Corps Network website to view the short films.

This is the nation's largest, single-day volunteer effort for public lands sponsored by the National Environmental Education Foundation. This year’s theme is: “Helping Hands for America’s Lands.” National Public Lands Day is one of six fee-free days in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, National Get Outdoors Day, and Veterans Day Weekend. Fees are waived generally for day use, such as picnic areas, developed trailheads and destination visitor centers. Fees are not waived for concessionaire-operated facilities or for overnight use such as camping or recreation rentals. “America’s national forests and grasslands belong to all of us,” said U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell. “These beautiful places have so much to offer, and we hope you’ll get outside and volunteer on National Public Lands Day to enjoy these places for yourself, while improving them for future visitors.” NPLD events include diverse activities such as planting trees, learning about bats, cleaning up rivers, and much more.  Participants can contact their nearest forest or grassland for event information or visit the National Public Lands Day web site. This year, many Forest Service sites will offer educational activities focusing on wildfire prevention. National Tribal Lands Day will also take place on Sept. 28 and celebrate healthy lands, people and tribal culture. Activities will encourage volunteerism, outdoor recreation and environmental education on land that is owned and managed by sovereign tribal governments. In , about 175,000 volunteers served at 2,206 National Public Lands Day sites in every state, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories, making it the largest participation in the event’s history.

"Conservation That Works  Cross posted from the White House Council on Environmental Quality blog:  I was recently in Atlanta, Georgia to speak at the North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference about Working Lands for Wildlife, a new effort to focus both conservation dollars and wildlife management expertise on the recovery of seven at-risk, threatened or endangered wildlife species. This unique approach to conservation concentrates federal resources on private working lands—home to a majority of candidate and listed species under the Endangered Species Act. Working Lands for Wildlife was developed by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior through their membership in the White House Rural Council. Working with farmers, ranchers and forest landowners is critical to President Obama’s vision of an economy built to last, one where rural communities provide clean air, clean water and wildlife habitat to generate economic opportunities for outdoor recreation and jobs, while protecting farm and ranch traditions.

Historically hot, dry conditions covered many of the nation’s key agricultural regions during July.  Preliminary provided by the National Weather Service indicated that July rainfall totaled less than 50 percent of normal in a broad area stretching from the central and southern Plains into the Mid-South and Midwest.  No measurable rain fell during July in several locations.  Meanwhile, monthly temperatures generally ranged from 4 to 8°F above normal across the northern and central Plains and the Midwest.  It was the hottest July on record in cities such as Rockford, Illinois; Denver, Colorado; and La Crosse, Wisconsin, breaking all-time records set in , , and , respectively. USDA analysis of the latest U.S. Drought Monitor shows that the overall percentage of U.S. corn and soybeans in drought stabilized during the week ending July 31.  In fact, U.S. corn in drought dropped slightly from 89 to 88%.  Soybeans in drought also fell a point, from 88 to 87%.  However, the percentage of corn in the two worst drought categories (D3 to D4, or extreme to exceptional drought), climbed from 37 to 40%.  Soybeans in extreme to exceptional drought rose to 39% on July 31, up from 35% a week earlier.  Severe impacts also persisted in other agricultural sectors.  For example, hay in extreme to exceptional drought rose from 23 to 28%, even as hay in drought declined slightly from 66 to 64%.  Similarly, 72% of the domestic cattle inventory was in drought at the end of the July, down a point from a week ago, while cattle in D3 and D4 jumped from 28 to 33%.  The bottom line is that there was further drought intensification during the last seven days of July in the hardest-hit areas of the Plains, Midwest, and Mid-South, while late-July rainfall provided some drought relief in parts of the eastern U.S. and across the nation’s northern tier.  Total drought coverage in the conterminous U.S. fell a percentage point during the week ending July 31, from 64 to 63%. Weather Outlook:  An unusually strong summer cold front will reach the northern Plains on Friday and cross the Midwest during the weekend.  Scattered showers and thunderstorms will precede and accompany the cold front, mainly across the nation’s northern tier.  Rainfall associated with the cold front’s passage could reach 1 to 2 inches from the Dakotas into the Northeast.  However, only isolated showers can be expected across the core drought areas of the Plains and Midwest.  In the front’s wake, below-normal temperatures will prevail across the northern and central Plains and the Midwest, although hot weather will return to the High Plains by early next week.  Meanwhile, extreme heat will persist into next week across the south-central U.S.  Elsewhere, five-day rainfall totals could reach 1 to 3 inches, with locally higher amounts, in the Southeast.

"U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Sep 27,  Centennial Job Corps camp crew cleaning hose returned from the fire line. Forest Service photo In the back parking lot of the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), seven workers wear neon green shirts with the Camp Crew logo written across the back. And they stand out. They are young and their bright T-shirts contrast with those of the more seasoned personnel. As the crew works among large mounds of fire hose spread throughout the lot, it’s obvious they have one thing on their mind: meticulously preparing the hose for the next fire. As the camp crew works to support the fire operations, military veteran Loren VanHorn supports them as the Camp Crew Boss. Five years ago, VanHorn was exploring retirement options after serving 20 years in the military when a former supervisor and friend mentioned the Centennial Job Corps in Nampa, Idaho.  He’s been with Centennial ever since. Centennial Job Corps’ Loren VanHorn leads a Camp Crew at the National Interagency Fire Center. Forest Service photo “My job and goal is to prepare and mentor these students for the challenges of fire support assignments, working in a stressful environment as a team, and supporting them in-part with the skill sets I learned in the military: leadership, honor and a work ethic,” VanHorn said. For the fire season, the Boise National Forest worked with the Center to hire four retired military veterans to oversee two Camp Crews consisting of ten students each. These veterans bring command presence, leadership, solid work ethic and the ability to make decisions under stress. They serve as excellent student mentors for future career ambitions. The Centennial Job Corps program has several trade programs for all students including carpentry, welding and nursing. Camp Crews also work at Incident Command Posts providing support to the logistic sections and have even helped radio technicians on incidents.

Expanding access to the Summer Food Service Program is an important part of ending childhood hunger in the United States. Many children from low-income families depend on school meals for breakfast and lunch, but when school is out, those meals are no longer available.  For this very reason, USDA offers the SFSP, a federally funded program administered by states that reimburses organizations for meals served to children during summer.  As a community organization, school, university, local government, or individual, you can get involved!  You can sponsor the program and operate multiple feeding sites. Or you can become a feeding site and work with an existing sponsor to provide kids free nutritious meals. And of course, you can always volunteer at summer feeding sites.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement in  Equity  Initiatives  Apr 23,  Kristina Edwards learned about the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Scholars Program her senior year in high school. One year later, she was named an Scholar and remained one for the entirety of her time at Prairie View A&M in Texas. “Receiving this honor made me proud of my accomplishments,” she said. “I was excited and relieved. The scholarship made me feel financially secure and enabled me to confidently focus solely on my education.” Monetary benefits of the program include a full-ride scholarship covering tuition, room and board, fees and the cost of books. Scholars also have the opportunity to participate in internships at USDA. Kristina became interested in agriculture, specifically nutrition and dietetics, to improve her health and break the generational cycles of chronic disease in her family. She wanted to concentrate solely on nutritional science until she interned with the USDA Economic Research Service and the Farm Service Agency and discovered skills she didn’t even know she had. “I learned about analysis, interpreting , and presenting it in a unique way,” she said. “Those skills I gained in my internship opened me up to things I never thought I’d excel at. I didn’t think of myself as a or numbers person, but it turns out I’m actually pretty good at it.” The scholarship also introduced her to the USDA liaison at her university, Horace Hodge, who played a critical role in assisting Kristina with her aspirations. “Even today, I still connect with Horace and keep in touch,” she said. “He made me feel important enough that it felt like having a personal mentor.” USDA liaisons like Horace serve as key representatives for USDA across America, connecting communities, students, faculty and staff, farmers, ranchers, foresters and others to the Department’s programs and initiatives. Kristina expressed gratitude and shared insight about the program to future scholars. “I’m glad I had this experience because I now have a more well-rounded background,” she said. “Students need to be open-minded and open to working in an area that may not exactly match your background, because you may discover strengths.” Today she still makes a difference in the agriculture realm, performing analytics as a fellow for a humanitarian group that provides support in the food security sector. After completion of the fellowship in , she plans to obtain her master’s degree and potentially work for a government agency.

"USDA Rural Development Arizona Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  May 25,   Janie Hipp is passionate about her work. Hipp, a Senior Advisor to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, delivered the keynote address at the National American Indian Housing Council national conference going on in Phoenix, Arizona, this week. She noted that one of the first things that Secretary Vilsack did when he walked in the door was to create an Office of Tribal Relations—a move that impressed the straight-talking Hipp. “Historically, we have had maybe one person trying to work across 17 agencies scattered in just about every county across the country…and around the globe,” she told the nearly 500 attendees. The creation of a Tribal Relations Office, staffed out of the Secretary’s budget during a time of budget cutting, shows a genuine commitment by this Secretary and this administration to accelerate the work between the department and the hundreds of tribes with whom it works. Hipp is a member of the Chickasaw Nation. She told the crowd that the Office is working to increase the number of consultations, create guidebooks for tribes to simplify access to USDA programs, and streamline interdepartmental regulations to make it easier for tribes to work with the diverse array of federal agencies offering services to tribes. Hipp also encouraged the audience to take advantage of the upcoming meetings being held across all of Indian Country regarding the Keepseagle settlement—a settlement she and the Court called “fair and equitable.” She should know. She holds a J.D., an LL.M. in Agricultural Law, taught at several law schools, worked for the Oklahoma Attorney General, was an Administrative Law Judge for the Cherokee Nation, provided insight on US agriculture in China, Russia, Slovakia, Chile and Turkey, and co-founded the Intertribal Native Women and Youth in Agriculture. According to Hipp, the Keepseagle claims period meetings will be held June through December of this year. She also noted that there will be tribal consultations beginning in June to get input on how the Agriculture Department might streamline its regulations. Janie Hipp’s passion for her work is obvious when you hear her speak. It is also effective, as evidenced by the trust so many have put in her. Recently Hipp was given responsibility as head of the Office of Tribal Relations along with the Food and Nutrition Service for USDA’s participation in Let’s Move in Indian Country. A part of the First Lady’s Let’s Move! Initiative, Let’s Move in Indian Country will build on efforts to combat childhood obesity in Indian Country by supporting and leveraging ongoing efforts by a number of Federal agencies, encouraging public/private partnerships and energizing tribal leaders to develop ideas that fit the unique characteristics of their tribes.

You’ve heard the saying “move it or lose it.” When it comes to citrus trees, it’s “Move It AND Lose It.” When you move citrus trees, you risk losing America’s citrus altogether – think breakfast with no fresh oranges, grapefruit or even juice.

"NRCS Pennsylvania in  Conservation  Mar 28,   Located in the heart of a “food desert” in the city of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Joshua Farm is a unique one-acre operation that is growing produce for locals through the use of a seasonal high tunnel. Founder Kirsten Reinford and daughter Havah at Joshua Farm, a unique one-acre operation in Harrisburg, Penn., that grows over 40 varieties of fresh produce for local families. The high tunnel (also known as a “hoop house”) makes urban farming possible and extends the growing season. Joshua Farm installed its high tunnel with the help of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Joshua Farm is managed by Harrisburg residents Kirsten Reinford and Joshua Mortiz. It grows over 40 varieties of fresh produce for over 45 local families. In just seven years, Joshua Farm has made a substantial impact on the community. The farm is a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) business, where members share in the farm’s expenses in exchange for a portion of the harvest. Joshua Farm also allows members to provide volunteer labor as payment for CSA shares. The longer growing season the high tunnel enables allows both the farm and its shareholders to benefit from higher productivity. The result is that Joshua Farm has fresh fruits and vegetables from May through October. Shareholders receive a harvest selection on a weekly basis during the 22-week growing season. Joshua Farm is part of Joshua Group, a non-profit that offers tutoring, mentoring and scholarships to underprivileged students. Through the farm, the organization teaches inner-city students where food comes from and how to grow food. The farm also employs up to six students and offers small cooking classes for young people. Vegetables growing in the high tunnel at Joshua Farm. The high tunnel, with funding assistance from NRCS, makes urban farming possible on small acreage and supplies fresh produce for longer periods to a large city population near Harrisburg, Penn. Thanks to a separate USDA grant, Joshua Farm also sells organic produce directly to local residents using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, formerly called food stamps, through the use of a swipe card machine. Joshua Farm provides a model for meeting food needs in an underserved community. But all communities benefit from stronger connections to food systems, and from having access to fresh, local produce. USDA supports local and regional food systems across the U.S. through its Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative and Compass. The Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass is an online multimedia narrative with stories, pictures and an interactive map of USDA-supported activities in all 50 states. With the Compass, you can navigate USDA resources for food; meet farmers, ranchers, businesses and communities that are participating in local food chains; and learn about local and regional food projects across the country.

"-Young, Under Secretary, Research, Education, and Economics & USDA Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  May 15,  We are at a pivotal moment for USDA and U.S. agriculture. Last week, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and I launched the “USDA Science and Research Strategy, -: Cultivating Scientific Innovation (, 21.4 )”. The strategy reflects a three-year vision for transforming U.S. agriculture through science and innovation. The message is clear: our agricultural and forestry systems must be more productive, profitable, resilient, and sustainable than ever before. These systems must work for all who need them, not just for a few. The Science and Research Strategy is our answer to how research and innovative technologies can advance agricultural production while simultaneously tackling the world’s greatest challenges. In this Strategy, we’ve identified USDA’s highest scientific priorities. Aligning with USDA’s Strategic Plan for -, (, 9.6 ) these priorities reflect input from our stakeholders and partners. USDA’s five science priorities are:  Accelerating Innovative Technologies & Practices  Driving Climate-Smart Solutions  Bolstering Nutrition Security & Health  Cultivating Resilient Ecosystems  Translating Research into Action Our crosscutting priorities reflect the expert feedback from scientific leaders across USDA and external stakeholders from across our diverse agricultural enterprise. These new priorities represent the complexity of the obstacles we face and will guide how USDA plans to meet this moment through science, , innovation, and partnerships. Interwoven throughout this Strategy and centered at the heart of each priority is our commitment to equity. By supporting a more equitable and just science enterprise, we will drive real and meaningful impact for the people we serve. Our Science & Research Strategy is meant to spur innovation and collaboration across all sectors. This is a call to action for our stakeholders and partners nationwide to propose bold, audacious actions to advance the priorities we’ve set forth. Join the conversation! As we implement this Strategy over the next three years, your voices are critical. I encourage everyone to review this plan and share how your work intersects—or could intersect—with these priorities. Through open science, transparency, and collaboration, we can find revolutionary solutions to transform our nation’s food and agricultural systems to benefit the many and the most. Working together, in alignment with USDA’s Science & Research Strategy, let's continue to push the boundaries of possibility for agriculture and forestry to create a better world for all.

"U.S. Soybeans Help Feed the World  It takes more than just a bountiful harvest to succeed in today’s agricultural marketplace.  Many farmers find strength in numbers by pooling resources and expertise to grow and sustain their businesses in both the U.S. and international markets. For soybean farmers, the United Soybean Board (USB) works to maintain and expand domestic and foreign markets and uses for soybeans and soybean products. Working through the U.S. Soybean Export Council, the USB annually conducts about 140 projects in international markets to promote U.S. soy products.  Comprising 70 soybean farmers, the USB facilitates trade servicing and technical support programs with importers, processors, livestock producers, and aquaculture operations.  Another important component of the soybean marketing effort is to invite international buyers, processors, and other users of U.S. soy products to the United States to understand and see firsthand the U.S. soybean production, processing, distribution and transportation systems.

"Deputy Under Security for USDA’s Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services in  Food and Nutrition  Trade  May 21,   I recently returned from Nairobi, where I got a firsthand look at USDA's food aid programs. Due to volcanic ash in Europe, my arrival was delayed by 36 hours.  I tried to outmaneuver the cloud by taking the scenic route -- Washington to Boston to Amsterdam to Paris to Nairobi.  While I enjoyed my multi-airport tour, Mother Nature still got the best of me.  She added further insult by holding my luggage in a city other than Nairobi. During my time in Africa, I gained an appreciation for the excellent results that the World Food Program (WFP) and private voluntary organizations are producing with resources provided by the U.S. food aid programs. Senator George McGovern and I visited programs that are helping adults and children with HIV and AIDS. While it was heartbreaking to see so many infants, children, and adults with this disease, U.S. Government programs are providing relief and hope to these children and families. Meeting with the recipients of the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition program was the highlight of the early part of my trip. Senator McGovern and I visited a school located in the slums of Nairobi.  After walking through the mud and open sewers of the slums, we came upon the Stara School, which provides a respite for nearly 600 students.  The WFP is using U.S. food donated through the McGovern-Dole program to feed the children lunch every school day. The children, all of whom are HIV positive or have at least one parent with HIV, greeted us with warm smiles, poetry and dance. For many of these children, the school lunch is their only meal each day. We had the opportunity to help the teachers and parents serve lunch to the students--an experience I will never forget.  The energy of the students and positive outlook of the teachers attest to the impact of the program on these young lives. Traveling with Senator McGovern has provided a unique opportunity to gain knowledge of the history of U.S. food security and food aid programs.  Senator McGovern has been working to end global hunger since the Roosevelt Administration, and continues today as he works tirelessly for WFP, an organization he helped found.  I am so proud to be part of the team at USDA that administers the Food for Peace and McGovern-Dole food aid programs that were authored by Senator McGovern. As the Obama Administration implements the Feed the Future Initiative, we owe a great debt to Senator McGovern, who has provided a wealth of knowledge and a deep commitment to global food security.

CACFP administrators and program operators receive support from many advocacy organizations who help ensure children and adults participating in CACFP receive nutritious meals. Below is a story from one of those advocacy organizations, the Child Care Food Program Roundtable. By Chris Clark, Child Care Food Program Roundtable In , First Lady Michelle Obama’s initiative to end childhood obesity, Let’s Move!, celebrated its fifth anniversary. To mark the occasion, she issued the challenge which encouraged all Americans to do five things to lead a healthier lifestyle. The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) community heard this call to action and developed its own CACFP Take ACTION Challenge. That Challenge was launched at the CCFP Roundtable Conference, where over 500 conference attendees got up, got moving and performed the Dance! The Challenge is a yearlong initiative aimed at creating national CACFP awareness, including its collaborative role in quality child care, healthy children, food security and childhood obesity prevention. It recognizes and celebrates CACFP participants’ and professionals’ efforts to get over 1.9 billion CACFP healthy meals and snacks served in family child care homes, centers and after school programs to over 3.8 million children and adults each year. It consists of five categories, each with a list of corresponding activities. Categories include CACFP Take Action Launch, USDA Resources and Best Practices, Health and Wellness, Educate and Advocate and CACFP Campaigns. Participants select the activities they are interested in undertaking, complete the activities, take a picture and tell their story. At the end of the Challenge—at the CCFP Roundtable Conference in Rancho Mirage, Calif. – the following awards will be presented: CACFP Gold, Silver, Bronze and Commended. To date, submissions have been received from child care providers, sponsors, USDA and state agencies in over 35 states. Additional challenge partners are: Child Care Food Program Roundtable; Food Research Action Center (FRAC); Team FNV; Let’s Move! Child Care; T & L Foundation; California Department of Education; National Farm to School Network and USDA. Some fun and creative examples of Challenge submissions received to date include: Involving kids in taste testing recipes and creating their own recipe books to take home Forming intramural sports teams and exercising together at work Getting infants and young kids moving by listening to the Fruit and Veggie Swag collection of songs and videos Inspiring others to join the Challenge through friendly competition Starting a boot camp style fitness program for friends and colleagues Building a healthy culture calls for action within and across sectors, because progress in one area will advance progress in another.

"Successes of the New Era in Civil Rights at USDA  In April , Secretary Vilsack called for a new era in civil rights and directed the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights (OASCR) to help lead a comprehensive effort to improve USDA’s record.  That meant correcting errors, learning from past mistakes, and charting a stronger path for the future where all Americans are treated with dignity and respect by USDA employees.  To make these goals a reality, my staff and employees across USDA have been working extremely hard over the past two and a half years and I am very proud to highlight some of the strides we’ve made. To begin with, we want to make sure that USDA’s policies, regulations and decisions are inclusive and respect the rights of all the American people.  To make sure USDA agencies are in compliance with civil rights regulations and policies, OASCR conducts reviews to determine the civil rights impact of any new policy, action, rule or decision.  Since , we have doubled the number of reviews conducted, improved the quality by providing training to folks who conduct them, and worked with agencies within USDA to improve their decision in nearly a third of the cases we reviewed.

"Acting Deputy Under Secretary, USDA’s Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 08,  Cooking is love made visible. My mother has a jar in her kitchen with the phrase, “Cooking is love made visible.” I can say for a fact that her food spreads a lot of love, and I think the same could be said about school food service professionals. I recently attended the Annual National Conference of the School Nutrition Association, where I met many devoted school food professionals who serve on the front lines of USDA’s National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs, ensuring our children are well-nourished throughout the school day. One thing that was abundantly clear about the folks I met was how much they care about the programs and the children they serve. The School Nutrition Association Annual Conference draws thousands from across the nation. For anyone not familiar with the conference, it is a huge gathering, drawing thousands from across the nation and featuring hundreds of educational sessions and a truly impressive Exhibit Hall. This year, staff from USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service spoke at nearly thirty sessions, hosted several resource booths in the Exhibit Hall, and operated a customer service center where we provided on-the-spot technical assistance. I had the opportunity to speak at the conference’s General Session, and it was a pleasure to thank school food service staff, industry, and the Association for all their efforts and share with them USDA’s vision for the school meals programs. I also had the chance to hear the inspiring story of Chef Jeff Henderson, a TV chef who speaks out about ending the cycle of poverty and childhood hunger. Growing up in poverty – and experiencing the hunger and uncertainty associated with that – led Chef Jeff into drug dealing and eventually prison, but he built a new life for himself through cooking. But the real highlight of the conference, for me, was the opportunity to sit down with a small but diverse group of school food professionals to hear what’s on their mind. I was fortunate to join a listening session where we discussed everything from staff training to procurement to program oversight. I was grateful for all of the thoughtful, honest feedback. Opportunities to hear directly from our customers are extremely valuable – not just for me, but for all of my staff. Customer service is one of our top priorities at USDA, but we can’t provide top-quality service without input from our customers. We need to hear from school food professionals – what tools and resources they need, how things are working on the ground, and their ideas for program improvement – in order to know how to best serve them. Our team has already started brainstorming ways to act on the feedback we received while at the conference, and I look forward to continuing the dialogue. USDA strives to provide schools, States, and our partners with excellent service so they can pass that on to those who participate in our programs. We want to make administering the programs as easy as possible so school nutrition professionals can focus on what really matters – serving our nation’s children nutritious meals to set them up for future success. Opportunities to hear directly from our customers are extremely valuable to USDA.

"National Organic Program Deputy Administrator in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Mar 20,  Across the U.S., there was about 4 percent increase in the number of certified organic operations in the last year, and nearly a 245 percent increase since . American organic farmers and producers are at the forefront of innovation and entrepreneurship.  Organic production contributes to building a stronger rural America by creating economic opportunities for farms and businesses of all sizes. In the U.S. alone, there are now 18,513 certified USDA organic operations, representing nearly a 245 percent increase since .  And there are over 25,000 certified organic operations in more than 120 different countries around the world. Each year, the National Organic Program (NOP), part of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service, publishes the official list of certified operations. Through this online tool, you can search to see whether an operator is certified, find certified farms and operators in a particular state, or get a list of certified operators that produce a specific product.  The listed in the database is also available for download in Excel format going back to . The newly released shows that the largest number of U.S. certified organic operations remain on the west coast, in New England, and in the upper Midwest. The also shows an increased rate of domestic growth of about 4 percent throughout U.S. regions, resuming previous trends. Internationally, there appears to be a decrease in the number of operations in areas with equivalency agreements, because operations in those countries no longer need dual certification. By minimizing duplication of certifications, equivalence agreements can provide great cost-saving for even the smallest of producers. The database increases the transparency and integrity of the organic system, allowing consumers and stakeholders to search for information pertaining to organic certification, and increases the NOP’s oversight ability of accredited certifiers. It provides a way to identify and connect organic stakeholders across the supply chain. Through the NOP, USDA has helped farmers and businesses create an industry that has grown to $35 billion annually in U.S. retail sales. USDA has a number of new and expanded efforts to connect organic farmers and businesses with resources that will ensure the continued growth of the organic industry domestically and abroad.  We help organic stakeholders access programs that support conservation, provide access to loans and grants, fund organic research and education, and mitigate pest emergencies. The new Agricultural Act of (Farm Bill) includes provisions that will make a big difference to the organic community, including additional funding to assist organic producers and handlers with the cost of organic certification, and funding to improve the NOP’s certified operations database and technology systems. Greater Federal support could mean even more organic farms and production in the U.S. to meet continued growth in consumer demand.  Additional information about USDA resources and support for the organic sector is available on the USDA Organics Resource page. The list of certified organic operations reflects the continued increase in domestic operations. There are now 18,ates.

"Posted by Tammye Treviño, Administrator, USDA Rural Development Housing Programs in  Rural  Jan 31,   Rural Development is the lead Federal agency that works to ensure that rural families have access to safe, well-built, affordable homes.  In February , the agency initiated a two-year, pilot refinancing program in 19 states hardest hit by the Nation’s housing downturn to help eligible USDA borrowers reduce their monthly housing costs. Today, USDA announced that the program is expanding to include eligible rural residents in Puerto Rico, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. USDA’s expansion of this program will help more rural borrowers refinance their mortgages to reduce their monthly payments and ease their financial burdens.  As our economy continues to recover, this refinancing program will enable rural families living in USDA-financed homes to take advantage of historically low interest rates. Since unveiling this initiative almost one year ago, USDA has been able to help almost 3,400 homeowners across the country take advantage of historically low mortgage rates.  These refinanced loans total more than $453 million. And that’s good news for housing as much-needed capital enters America’s recovering housing market. USDA Rural Development is proud of our effort to help re-energize housing.  Last year, in addition to our refinancing efforts, the agency also helped more than 153,000 individuals and families in rural areas obtain safe, affordable homes through our single-family direct and guaranteed loan programs. And Rural Development helped bring safe, affordable multi-family housing to more than 270,000 low- and very-low-income families, thanks to $904.7 million in rental assistance to bring rents to an affordable level. At USDA, our work builds upon the efforts of the Obama Administration to help responsible borrowers and strengthen the housing market. Due to expansion of the USDA refinancing program, residents in 35 jurisdictions can pursue lower monthly mortgage costs.  The original states in the two-year pilot program are Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Tennessee. I strongly encourage every homeowner in participating states with a USDA Single Family Guaranteed or Direct loan to learn more about the program and see if it can help them by contacting their local Rural Development office.  For a list of state offices, please visit:   Category/Topic:  Rural  Tags:  Alaska  Arkansas  Colorado  Idaho  Kansas  Missouri  Montana  North Dakota  Oklahoma  Puerto Rico  RD  Single-Family Housing Guaranteed and Direct Programs  South Dakota  Tammy Trevino  Texas  Utah  Washington  West Virginia  Wisconsin","What states, in addition to the original 19, have been added to the USDA refinancing program that enables eligible rural residents to refinance their mortgages and reduce their monthly housing costs?","In addition to the original 19 states (listed as Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Tennessee), the USDA refinancing program has been expanded to include eligible rural residents in Puerto Rico, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin."

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 10,  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides nutrition assistance to about 42 million Americans in need each month. USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) ensures that benefits are as convenient and easy to use as possible, however, historically there have been challenges when it comes to connecting participants with local farmers. Fortunately, modern technologies and innovative solutions have emerged to bridge this gap. By embracing online purchasing and mobile payment systems, FNS is creating a more efficient, inclusive, and mutually beneficial relationship between SNAP participants and farmers. Thanks to a partnership between USDA and the National Association of Farmers Market Nutrition Programs (NAFMNP), direct marketing farmers are now able to accept SNAP payment online. The first direct marketing farmer enabled to accept SNAP online is River Queen Greens, a vegetable farm in New Orleans, Louisiana. SNAP online payments increase accessibility for River Queen Greens customers. “Having the capability for SNAP online payments makes the purchasing process much more seamless,” said co-owner Annie Moore. Until recently, accepting SNAP payment online was an option primarily available for traditional brick and mortar retailers. As a result of the partnership with NAFMNP, SNAP participants can now purchase produce online from participating local farmers for pick-up or delivery. NAFMNP MarketLink’s Online SNAP solution will help small farmers attract new SNAP customers while providing SNAP participants with better access to fresh, locally grown produce. A win-win for all parties involved! Thousands of direct marketing farmers apply for SNAP authorization each year. As part of our ongoing support for these farmers, USDA recently opened the competition for the Mobile Application Cooperative Agreement for SNAP Farmers and Markets. Through this grant, up to $4 million in funding will be provided to up to two grantees over a three-year period. The grantees will provide technical assistance to direct marketing farmers selling at farmers’ markets, roadside stands, or pick-your-own operations, who wish to become SNAP authorized and enable them to use their mobile phone to conduct transactions. As with past grants, farmers marketing directly to consumers would continue to be provided with a mobile app and a card reader to accept SNAP payments using their mobile phone. The current grant competition is open for applications between July 6-September 5, . USDA is also helping SNAP participants access more healthy foods from local producers. The SNAP Healthy Incentives Programs encourage healthier eating by incentivizing the purchase of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy foods at participating retailers, including at farmers’ markets. To find out how your local farmers market can participate in an incentive program, you may visit the SNAP Healthy Incentives page. For more information about the SNAP Online Purchasing program and the full list of retailers approved to provide SNAP online purchasing, visit the SNAP Online webpage. USDA also recommends visiting your local retailer’s website to find out whether grocery delivery is available for your location.

"Michigan USDA Public Information Officer in  Initiatives  Rural  May 17,   Recently I attended a presentation and groundbreaking near Midland, Michigan, for a unique USDA Rural Development Community Facilities project:  A residential treatment center for the Ten Sixteen Recovery Network. This is an unusual type of project for our agency.  Our community facility projects tend to involve a police car, fire truck or township hall.  Several people at the event (including news reporters) remarked on this.  I pointed out that while a project of this kind may be uncommon, there is nothing usual about it being considered.  Fire trucks and police cars tend to dominate community facilities because these tend to be the applications we receive. USDA Rural Development State Director for Michigan James J. Turner and members of the Ten Sixteen Recovery Network break ground for their residential treatment facility. USDA Rural Development provided a loan and a grant for the new 20-bed, 7,500 square-foot substance abuse treatment facility.  The applicant is contributing $510,000 for a total project cost of almost $2 million.  The grant funds were made available through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The facility will be built on a horse farm off of highway M-20 – a beautiful site that is secluded and tranquil – exactly the kind of atmosphere needed to help people find inner peace and the strength to break an addiction.

"Public Affairs Specialist, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Apr 30,  Island Lake landscape in Wyoming's Wind River mountains on the Bridger-Teton National Forest. Photo by Scott Clemons. Hoping to find ways to reverse a potential environmental disaster, several land managing federal agencies are working together in the Greater Yellowstone Area, which includes the Shoneshone, Gallatin and Teton National Forests, to address the wide spread loss of whitebark pine trees due to the effects of climate change. The new interagency agreement, which includes the U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service and BLM, is designed specifically to coordinate inventory, monitoring and management of whitebark pine. The agreement seeks also to explore new collaborative projects to help protect and restore the species throughout the 15 million acre region surrounding Yellowstone National Park. “We need a landscape-scale approach to large scale issues like this.  The Forest Service has a lot to offer with land management, science and landowner services all under one roof.  Yet, working with other federal agencies can help us address problems more efficiently and effectively,” said Dave Cleaves, U.S. Forest Service climate change advisor. Whitebark pines grow in the very highest reaches of the Greater Yellowstone Area and scientists consider them a foundation species because they create conditions necessary for other plants and animals to survive in an Alpine region where winters are long and bitterly cold. The pines also produce a calorie-rich nut that several keystone animal species in the region including grizzly bears, red squirrels and Clark’s nutcrackers, depend upon to survive the long and bitterly cold winters that are a hallmark of the Greater Yellowstone Area. The whitebark pine plays and important role in clean drinking water as the sheer size of the tree also helps maintain watersheds. In winter its bulk serves as natural snow fences, and in spring that same bulk helps shield the resulting snow banks from the sun, thus allowing for a relatively slow and even snow melt.

"Addressing California’s Water Challenges Through Action and Collaboration  Cross posted from DOI News: California is in the throes of the worst drought in the 160 years during which records have been kept. As a result, the state’s overextended water system is in crisis. All segments of California’s economy— one of the largest in the world—are experiencing the effects of this drought. The economic, social and environmental impacts on agriculture, industry, jobs, communities’ drinking water and the ecosystem will reverberate across the country, and that is why actions need to be taken to address the situation not just in the short term, but also to sustain the state over the long run. Following two years of dry conditions, on January 17, California Governor Jerry Brown proclaimed a State of Emergency for drought. Subsequently, the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce have committed to helping California prepare for and lessen drought impacts. In addition, as called for in President Obama’s Climate Action Plan, the National Drought Resilience Partnership, which includes the Department of the Interior, Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Energy, will help align federal resources and policies to better support response to drought impacts and build long term sustainability and resilience in California’s water system.

"Spring Climate Trends Changing in the Northeast  All this month we will be taking a look at what a changing climate means to Agriculture. The ten regional USDA Climate Hubs were established to synthesize and translate climate science and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers that are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA's Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate. You might have noticed spring-like weather in the Northeast is arriving earlier than usual.  There is reliable evidence from many studies that conditions in the Northeast and upper Midwest have become warmer and wetter in recent decades, especially before the coming of winter and spring.  The spring-like warmth has snow melting faster and plant growth starting sooner.  On average, the last spring frost in the Northeast is about a week earlier now than it was 30 years ago.  The change is not as positive as one might expect since the start of growth for many plants has shifted even earlier than the last frost date leading to increased chances of frost damage.  This happens most often when unusually warm temperatures in March are followed within 2-5 weeks by a frost event.  In , record high March temperatures were followed by record low temperatures (for the date) at the end of April with terrible consequences for fruit growers across Michigan, Ontario, New York, Vermont, and surrounding states.  In some places losses were almost total.  In something of a repeat, unusual warmth in the Northeast this past winter was interrupted by very cold outbreaks in mid-February and early April.  This combination was particularly bad for peaches in New Jersey, Connecticut, parts of New York, and other northeastern states where greater than 90% losses have been reported.

"Minerals and Geology Management, and L.F. Chambers, Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 26,  A fossilized tree stump on the Gallatin National Forest. The stump is part of a huge forest that was buried in a volcanic eruption 50 million years ago. (U.S. Forest Service photo) Imagine nearing the remote, rugged crest of the Gallatin Range in Montana’s Gallatin National Forest. As you scramble up-slope, you put your hand against what appears to be a lightning-blasted stump for balance. But the stump is not weather-polished wood—it’s made of stone. These are the 50-million-year-old remains of redwoods, pines and sycamores which make up the Gallatin Petrified Forest, where fossilized tree trunks are preserved in so much detail that cellular structures may be seen under a microscope and growth rings are often visible to the naked eye. But how did these trees turn to stone? Transport yourself back to the Eocene epoch, when a 9,200-foot volcano rose ominously out of a forested valley. A thin, dark plume of steam and ash shoots up from the angry crater.  The 3-foot-thick trunks of mature redwood trees in the valley swayed and heavier branches crack and fall from the stress of earth tremors that become increasingly violent over a period of weeks. Suddenly, with a wrenching ground spasm and booming roar, the plume morphs into a thick roiling column of ash and volcanic ejecta that rockets 19 miles up into the stratosphere, spilling outward as it rises. The fallout coalesces into a thick debris cloud that spreads across the horizon in only minutes, turning day into night. Massive quantities of charged volcanic particles inject into the atmosphere generating a near-continuous series of lightning flashes accompanied by peals of deafening thunder. Volcanic ash fall begins to pour from the sky at rates up to a foot an hour. Torrential rains join the ash fall, and flowing slurries of ash and coarse volcanic debris—which had eroded from the steep slopes of nearby inactive volcanoes—quickly choke off stream channels crossing the forested valley. Viscous floodwater slurries of volcanic sediment overtop natural levees and sweep inexorably across the forest floor, depositing thick layers of coarse sediment while airborne volcanic debris shower down. Heavy, wet volcanic ash strip trees of their foliage and branches. The vegetation, rooted in place, is doomed. As the eruption tapers to a halt, a once lush, verdant forest transforms into an eerily silent, sterile, bleak gray landscape. The naked boles of dead tree trunks poke out of a thick blanket of volcanic debris. Mineral-saturated groundwater circulates through the volcanic sediments, where the buried trunks already begin to absorb silica molecules into their pores, initiating the process of fossilization which will continue for millennia. But, nature is resilient even in the face of catastrophic geological forces, and within months, seeds and spores of pioneer plant species borne by the wind and the droppings of birds flying overhead settle and germinate in the nutrient-rich volcanic soils.  Within a decade the plain is covered in grasses—small clusters of young trees and shrubs beginning to poke above. The surrounding volcanos remain dormant, and within 25 years as patches of woodland develop, the forest’s rebirth is well underway. Seven hundred years later, a new forest emerges to the same majestic grandeur as its predecessor buried below. Suddenly, a new volcanic plume arises against the horizon and the earth tremors again—a cycle that would repeat more than 24 times in the Greater Yellowstone area. Today, you can visit this ancient forest. Stop by one of the Gallatin National Forest offices for directions and to obtain a permit allowing the collection of a small sample of petrified wood from the Special Management Zone. Small pieces that are loose on the ground are suitable for collection, but petrified trunks preserved in place must not be damaged or disturbed.

"Deputy Administrator of the AMS Livestock, Poultry and Seed Program in  Food and Nutrition  May 15,  An infographic illustrating beef marbling. Selecting the right USDA grade of beef for your dish will help guarantee culinary success. Click to see a larger version. Grilling season is upon us.  It’s time to enjoy that wonderful smell of meat cooking across neighborhood backyards. With so many choices available at your store and meat counter, choosing the best cut of meat for your dish can be overwhelming. With a bit of beef knowledge, you can avoid that problem, and be the king or queen of the barbeque. We’ve covered the basics of USDA beef grades, explaining the difference between USDA Prime, Choice or Select. This time around, we’re going to look at the marbling – or fine threads of fat – within different grades of meat.  Marbling is what gives beef its flavor, juiciness and tenderness.  USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) employs 200 highly-skilled beef graders who, sometimes with the help of electronic monitoring, evaluate several factors that determine the grade, including the amount and distribution of marbling. Selecting the right USDA grade of beef for your dish will help guarantee your culinary success.  When beef is cooked, the degree of tenderness is mostly dependent on the amount of fat in the meat.  USDA Prime beef has the highest marbling score or fat content, followed by USDA Choice. USDA Select has only slight marbling. Beef cuts with less marbling, such as USDA Select, can be cooked on the grill just like USDA Choice or USDA Prime grades but may need to be monitored a little closer and cooked a little less to keep it as tender as possible.  Cuts with more marbling, such as USDA Prime, may be grilled with high heat to a medium or medium rare for excellent results in flavor and tenderness.  Certain cuts, such as the tenderloin (filet) and top blade (flat iron), may naturally be more tender –regardless of the degree of marbling or the USDA grade. The USDA grade shields are regarded as symbols of quality American beef.  Large-volume buyers such as grocery stores, military institutions, restaurants, and even foreign governments use the quality grades as a “common language” within the beef industry, making business transactions easier.  The shields also mean you can shop with confidence, knowing that your beef will have the quality and consistency that you count on to make your dishes delicious. The next time you visit the supermarket or your favorite steak house, apply your beefed up knowledge on marbling, tenderness and grades to grill your beef to perfection!

"USDA Agricultural Research Service Information Staff in  Research and Science  Jan 28,   This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. As a boy, Steven Cannon helped his grandfather in the garden grafting fruit trees, all the while developing an interest in plants. As an adult, Cannon has followed in his grandfather’s footsteps, working with USDA as a scientist—but only after first taking a different, though ultimately, complementary career path. After graduating college, Cannon worked various jobs, including one as an educational software designer that used his knack for computing.  In , he rekindled his early interest in plant biology, earning a PhD and practical experience as a postdoctoral researcher assigned to a genome mapping project. In , he accepted a position as a plant geneticist with the USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Corn Insects and Crop Genetics Research Unit in Ames, Iowa. Cannon didn’t simply cast aside his love of computing for his new career in plant genetics, however. Instead, he combined his two interests—so successfully, in fact, that on December 23, , he was named as a recipient of the Presidential Early-Career Award for Scientists and Engineers by President Obama. Since joining ARS, Cannon has hit the ground running, with significant contributions in projects to sequence the genetic code, or genome, of soybean, chickpea, and other legume crops that underpin the health and wellbeing of consumers worldwide. Cannon’s computer skills proved valuable—from working with a team to improve SoyBase, a popular Internet resource among plant breeders and scientists, to successfully leading the Legume Information System Web site redesign, another online tool used by researchers worldwide. Cannon’s fascination with plants that he cultivated as a boy has translated into important findings today about the evolutionary “road” that legumes have taken over the past 60 million years or so—particularly their relationship with root bacteria that turn nitrogen into forms that help them grow. Cannon and colleagues’ efforts is geared toward fostering developing new, improved legume varieties to better meet humankind’s increasing global need for food, feed, fiber, and fuel. “We need to make faster progress in crop improvement and the best way of doing that is by knowing where important traits and genes reside,” says Cannon. “Whatever we learn about soybean is going to be useful in these other crops and vice versa.”  Category/Topic:  Research and Science  Tags:  ARS  Iowa  Plant biology  plants  President Obama  Presidental Award  Science Tuesday","What innovative approach did Steven Cannon combine to excel in his career as a plant geneticist, where he leveraged his background in computing to advance research in soybean genetics and legume crop improvement?","Steven Cannon combined his background in computing with his interest in plant biology, successfully leveraging his computer skills to advance research in soybean genetics and legume crop improvement."

"Posted by J.P. Pendleton, Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Rural Development, Montana in  Rural  Oct 25,  Last Chance Café manager Peggy Tobin shows off a homemade apple pie baked by a volunteer co-op member.  It is an iconic fixture of rural America – the local diner. Not just a restaurant, but a social hub for a community, and when the local café in Sunburst, Montana closed in it seemed one more nail in the coffin of a small town facing decline. Just over one hundred miles north of Great Falls, Montana along Interstate 15, and only nine miles south of the Canadian border you’ll find Sunburst, population 400. Much had changed and disappeared from Sunburst since the closing of a local refinery in the early seventies and now the loss of the café left the community with no family-friendly place to eat. Sure the local bar had bar food, and there were chicken fingers and corn dogs at the deli counter of the grocery store, but a place to sit down for a cup of coffee, conversation, and a good meal was gone – possibly for good. By , local resident Peggy Tobin and some fellow community members started to explore options to bring their hometown café to life once more. They initially dismissed the idea of a cooperative, thinking it only applied to phones and electricity – but upon speaking with Brian Gion, Executive Director of the Montana Cooperative Development Center in Great Falls, plans began for the formation of a community cooperative to operate the Last Chance Café. Funded through the Rural Cooperative Development Grant program from USDA Rural Development, Montana Cooperative Development Center has assisted 123 entities and guided the formation of 37 cooperatives since its inception in . The reopening of the café as a cooperative has provided more than just jobs for the local residents. “It wouldn’t work without our volunteers,” said Tobin. “We have ladies coming in to bake pies and breads for the restaurant, or just to clean dishes and tidy up the place. It’s become a great opportunity for folks to get out and be active, and help support local businesses here in Sunburst.” Providing the equivalent of three full-time jobs, a project this size might seem inconsequential in the larger economic picture, but for Sunburst it’s a focal point for the community. New development is on the horizon through a wind power project, and a newly-opened U.S. Border Patrol station has brought more life into the town. With a year of operation under their belt, Tobin and her partners are proud of what they’ve accomplished at the Last Chance Café. “We have people driving all the way here from Great Falls just for our clam chowder [every other Friday night] and our homemade pies. It seems we’re getting a bit of a name for ourselves, and we’re thrilled to have the customers.” As we recognize National Cooperative Month, it is appropriate to applaud the hard work of the Montana Cooperative Development Center, and the determination of the Last Chance Café cooperative in Sunburst, Montana.

USDA’s summer meal programs – the Summer Food Service Program and Seamless Summer Option – reduce food and nutrition insecurity and help ensure kids are healthy and ready to learn when they return to school in the fall. Nationwide, thousands of dedicated organizations sponsor summer meal programs and work tirelessly to offer high quality meals that are appealing and nutritious. The Turnip the Beet Award showcases summer meal sponsors that go above and beyond to serve kids appetizing, high-quality meals. Recently, the Food and Nutrition Service recognized 98 summer meal sponsors with Gold, Silver or Bronze awards for going the extra mile in . The complete list of Turnip the Beet Award Winners can be found on the Food and Nutrition Service website. If you know a summer meal sponsor in your area that’s excelling at serving kids, nominate them for a Turnip the Beet Award through this Turnip the Beet nomination form! Looking ahead to summer , we look forward to better serving kids in rural areas, thanks to legislation passed by Congress. Historically, the on-site, group feeding requirement for summer meals has been a barrier for some rural communities trying to connect kids with healthy meals. The challenges include the lack of transportation, centrally located facilities to host a site, and funds to support enrichment activities – to name a few. Now, approved summer meal sites in certain rural areas can distribute meals to kids without requiring them to be served in a group setting. This means program operators can use alternative models to better meet their communities’ needs. For example, instead of serving in-person meals, an approved school or library could potentially allow families to pick up a week’s-worth of meals for their children. These flexible meal service options are monumental wins in the fight to end childhood hunger and they’re expected to benefit nearly eight million children in rural areas.

"Nutritionist, Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 06,  Dave’s Herb-Stuﬀed Mushrooms The MyPlate Team offers the final “Makeover Monday” recipe this week on the USDA blog and the MyPlate Facebook page. I love mushrooms and could probably eat them every day. They come in a variety of sizes, shapes, , textures, and flavors and can be worked into every meal. On their own, mushrooms are pretty healthful – very low in calories, free of cholesterol and (almost) free of fat. They are also naturally low in sodium, high in potassium, and are generally high in vitamins and minerals. Stuffing mushrooms just makes something wonderful ever better!  But what you stuff in these tasty little vegetables can make or break the dish. Typically, mushrooms are stuffed with foods containing saturated fats and sodium. So, if you’re trying to watch one or both of these in the New Year, consider various herbs and spices! Herbs and spices do a nice job of seasoning many of my favorite foods. When I decided long ago to reduce my intake of saturated fats, I knew that my taste buds would miss the flavors of these fats and the foods that contain them, but I didn’t want to settle for a bland diet. So, I invested in several healthy cookbooks and read (and reread) the chapters on herbs and spices. The results have been quite impressive. They say that “variety is the spice of life,” but I like to think that “spices add variety to life.” Along with the spices came exciting and unlimited flavor combinations. Now, I choose whatever suits my mood. (Is there anything more inviting than a kitchen that smells of sautéed fresh rosemary?) Start adding more flavor to your plate in and you’ll see what I mean.

"State and Private Forestry, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 20,  Forest Products Laboratory contributes to developing codes and standards for mid- to high-rise wood structures. Photo credit: USDA Forest Service The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that several million earthquakes occur in the world each year. Some, such as the devastating earthquake in Nepal and the series of earthquakes that destroyed infrastructure, homes and communities in Christchurch, New Zealand in , capture global attention. After natural disasters such as these, rebuilding a city needs to be efficient and cost-effective, with an eye towards resilience in the face of future disasters. Engineered wood building systems like glulam and cross laminated timber, also known as CLT, are well suited to meet these needs as they are often prefabricated offsite and can be quickly installed. That helps communities bounce back from disaster in a shorter time frame while minimizing waste. Furthermore, just as trees flex in high winds, timber structures flex in earthquakes, placing wood construction systems at the forefront of seismic design for resilience. CLT is relatively new to North America, having first gained popularity in Europe. CLT panels are typically constructed by laminating three or more layers of lumber together, with each layer perpendicular to the neighboring layer to create a solid wood panel. These panels are a renewable building material that is strong and versatile, and utilize smaller wood elements from sustainably managed forests. Many of our nation’s forests have become overstocked as a result of past fire suppression policies.  Today, the U.S. Forest Service is working with partners to remove small diameter trees, restoring the density and composition of our forests to better support natural fire regimes and provide benefits that we rely on, including clean water, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities. Using the byproducts of these restoration treatments creates viable markets for smaller trees, decreasing the cost of forest restoration treatments and creating jobs in rural and urban areas along each stage of the supply chain. To promote the adoption of innovative wood building technologies, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is sponsoring the U.S. Tall Wood Building Prize Competition in partnership with the Softwood Lumber Board and the Binational Softwood Lumber Council.  This competition showcases the architectural and commercial viability of advanced wood products in tall-building construction, growing this emerging market and ultimately supporting employment opportunities in rural communities, maintaining the health and resiliency of U.S. forests, and advancing sustainability in the built environment. Additionally, USDA is working to stimulate demand for forest products and expand the use of wood in building through research into innovative ways to use wood and fiber. The U.S. Forest Service Forest Products Laboratory, based in Madison, Wisconsin, has been an integral part of developing safe and sustainable products, including different applications for engineered wood products like CLT. Part of Forest Service Research & Development, the FPL has invested over $2 million in research and technical support for the use of wood as a green building material for housing developments and other building projects. One facet of this research, spearheaded by FPL researcher Bob Falk, is looking to enhance human safety in the face of tornados.  Each year in the U.S., tornadoes results in more than 80 deaths and 1,500 injuries. Through the development of a “Do-It-Yourself” tornado safe room that can be constructed by anyone with basic construction skills using innovative wood products, the research has the potential to greatly reduce casualties associated with these natural disasters. In early April, Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the award of over $9 million awarded to expand and accelerate wood energy and other wood product markets. These federal funds will leverage $22 million in investments from partners, resulting in a total investment of $31 million in 23 states.

"USDA Meteorologist, Office of the Chief Economist in  Conservation  Jul 12,  U.S. Corn Areas Experiencing Drought. Reflects July 10, U.S. (click to enlarge) On July 11, USDA’s World Agricultural Outlook Board cut the estimate for the U.S. corn crop by 1.82 billion bushels to “reflect expected impacts of persistent and extreme June and early-July dryness and heat across the central and eastern Corn Belt.”  The 12% cut, which left the projected U.S. corn production at 12.97 billion bushels, is a direct result of the nation’s worst drought in a generation—since . Yesterday, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack also announced that more than 1,000 counties across in 26 states would be designated as disaster areas due to the worsening drought. According to the July 10 U.S. Drought Monitor, 78% of the U.S. corn was within an area experiencing drought.  Drought-free sections of the Midwest are currently restricted to parts of western Iowa and the northern tier of the Corn Belt. During the next several days, a deep pool of atmospheric moisture over the southeastern U.S. will continue to focus drought-easing rainfall in that part of the country.  Additional rainfall totals of two to four inches can be expected from the western Gulf Coast region into the Tennessee Valley.  However, very little rain is forecast to spread north of the Ohio River, which will continue leave much of the Corn Belt in desperate need of moisture.  Some late-week rain will occur across the upper Midwest, although totals will be generally less than an inch.  During the next several days, high temperatures above 90°F will be common across the Midwest, and readings may approach 100°F in the southern Corn Belt.

"USDA Office of Communications in  Conservation  Research and Science  Technology  Feb 27,  This graphic shows past records and predictions based on the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Provided the by U.S. Forest Service.  Weather….  We all care about it. In many communities, local TV and radio weather forecasters are celebrities, and for good reason.  While we can’t do much about the weather, it affects us all every day. During last week’s Agricultural Outlook Forum two sessions drew exceptionally large crowds.  One was the Friday afternoon “Weather and Agriculture” segment and another was the morning “Markets and Weather” presentation.  While no one can say for sure what the weather outlook will be for the summer growing season, Brad Rippey, agricultural meteorologist with USDA’s Office of the Chief Economist (OCE), Eric Luebehusen, OCE ag. meteorologist and Anthony Artusa, meteorologist with the Climate Protection Section of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration made some observations and predictions in the afternoon session.  The snowpack in the West’s Sierra Nevada is far below normal.  The Western winter wet season has been a bust, with winter precipitation less than 10 percent of average in some areas.  California, the Great Basin and southern Great Plains are in drought.  The meteorologists said California, the lower gulf coast and much of New Mexico, Arizona and Texas could see above normal temperatures and below normal precipitation in March, April and May.  According to Rippey, “We need a miracle March in to avoid major problems in California.”  The most current information is available through NOAA’s Seasonal Drought Outlook map and the USDA drought monitor. The morning session featured a discussion on ways producers and forest owners can increase resilience to climate variability.  Filling in for a speaker who was forced to cancel because of a snowstorm, Dr. Carolyn Olson of the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) discussed how soil texture matters in times of drought.  “Good soils produce good yield,” but as importantly, good soil has increased water holding capacity.  Additionally, conservation practices like cover cropping increase the ability of soil to retain water and increase resilience to climate change.  Adam Chambers, with the NRCS Air Quality and Atmospheric Change Team in Portland, Oregon, outlined practices that can increase the sequestration of carbon and reduce greenhouse gasses.  “Can we produce more food, fiber and fuel while also increasing conservation?  I think we can,” he said.  He talked about how the agriculture sector is a leader in the areas of water conservation and nutrient management, and that more producers are working voluntarily to keep more carbon in the ground.  Working with organizations like Ducks Unlimited by providing Conservation Innovation Grants, and setting up carbon credit trading systems, he said, USDA can move the effort forward. Finally, Bill Hohenstein, director of the USDA Office of Global Climate Change outlined the Secretary’s recent announcement of the creation of seven regional climate hubs, to act as an information storehouse for producers, and repositories of scientific on climate change.

"USDA Forest Service, Research and Development in  Forestry  Research and Science  Aug 30,  Field assistants measure mahogany tree diameter near the agricultural town of Agua Azul in southeast Pará, Brazil. Photo by J. Grogan This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. The very name mahogany is synonymous with luxury and sophistication. This beautiful wood has been traded internationally since the Spanish discovered natural forests around during colonization of Mexico and Central America. Mahogany is more than a pretty plank – its strength, light weight, resistance to rot, and structural stability made it an ideal timber for ocean-going vessels as well as furniture. Mahogany also occupies an important position in the ecosystem insofar as it is a large tree that emerges above the forest canopy. Many other species depend on it for habitat and survival. Sadly, mahogany’s great value has also been its undoing over the past half century or so as modern industrial logging techniques made it commercially viable to extract mahogany from primary forests hundreds of miles from the nearest village or town in the Amazon Basin. “The future of mahogany as we know it depends on whether sustainable harvest systems can be designed for natural forests where mahogany still survives, especially in South America,” said field ecologist Jimmy Grogan, whose mahogany research has been funded by the Forest Service through the Institute of Tropical Forestry since . To assist forest managers in sustaining timber production of mahogany from natural forests so the species may continue to benefit current and future generations, Grogan and his colleagues developed the Big-Leaf Mahogany Growth & Yield Model that simulates logging and then “grows” populations between harvests according to demographic algorithms constructed from 15 years of annual census in Brazil. The model simulates actual mahogany populations in Brazil. Once the population is in the model, it is programmed with several rules or parameters, such as the number of years between harvests, the minimum legal cutting diameter (currently 60 cm in Brazil), the percentage of commercial-sized trees that must be retained after logging for regeneration purposes, and the minimum density of commercial trees below which logging is not allowed. Grogan’s work also receives generous support from Brazilian timber companies that own the sites where he and his colleagues conduct their research. The Big-Leaf Mahogany Growth & Yield Model was built from demographic published in scientific journals over the past decade. The Model and articles on which it is based are available online at   Category/Topic:  Forestry  Research and Science  Tags:  Amazon  Brazil  mahogany  Para  REE  Science Tuesday","What are the key considerations for designing sustainable harvest systems for natural mahogany forests, as required for maintaining the species' future viability?",The key considerations for designing sustainable harvest systems for natural mahogany forests include: 1.

"Look to Idaho's Ponderosa Pine Scenic Byway for Fall Color Vistas  One of the first excursions Idaho locals recommend to newcomers is the Ponderosa Pine Scenic Byway along Highway anley, Idaho. The popular route traverses foothills, high-elevation forests and scenic river canyons in the heart of the Boise National Forest and Sawtooth National Recreation Area. Although beautiful in any season, fall is my favorite time of year for exploring Highway 21.

"Acting Midwest Public Affairs Director, Food and Nutrition Service with guest author Stephen Petro, Fondy Farm Director and Chief Operating Officer in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Nutrition Security  Apr 06,  Last fall, Stacy Dean, USDA’s Deputy Under Secretary for Food Nutrition and Consumer Services, visited the Fondy Farmers Market, Milwaukee's 105-year-old, largest, and first farmers market in Wisconsin to accept SNAP! The market is run by Fondy, a nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing access to healthy, local food and economic opportunity across the greater Milwaukee area and is an impressive model in so many ways. While at the market, Dean met with the market manager, FoodWIse, the Milwaukee Farmers Market Coalition, other community partners, and the farmers who play a critical role in increasing access to fresh, local produce. Every Fondy project is community-driven and leverages existing networks to support local producers and entrepreneurs to meet the needs of the community. Several years ago, Fondy saw farmers, primarily HMoob farmers, dropping out of farming. The reason? Many didn’t have access to quality land or stable long-term leases. With several sources of USDA funding, including the Community Food Projects Competitive Grants Program (CFPCGP) and Environmental Quality Incentive Program, the organization launched the Fondy Farm Project. Through the project, 40 acres of long-term, high-quality leased land became available to the historically underserved farmers who grow food for Milwaukee area residents. Long-term land access allowed farmers, many of whom identify as HMoob, to invest in their farms and serve diverse customers by growing culturally relevant crops without a fear of losing their land. The CFPCGP also provided capacity-building equipment, allowing producers to grow and process more food. It was inspiring to learn that the market’s farmers are seeing an increase in SNAP purchases, due in part to a nutrition incentive program - Milwaukee Market Match. The match program is run by Fondy with support from FoodWIse, a SNAP Ed partner, which also delivers nutrition education at the market. FoodWIse supports the Milwaukee Farmers Market Coalition, which works towards policy, systemic, and environmental changes to establish and maintain inclusive SNAP/EBT programs at multiple markets across Milwaukee. This important program not only stretches the purchasing power of SNAP recipients, but increases their intake of fruits and vegetables. Most importantly, by spending at the market, money is kept in the community and with local farmers. It’s a WIN-WIN for the farmers and the community! Milwaukee County allocated $1.1 million of American Rescue Plan Act funds to sustain the match program at ten markets across the county in . That’s a whole lot of fruits and veggies! At the end of her visit, Deputy Under Secretary Stacy Dean added that meeting and speaking with market and community members, as well as SNAP participants, is one of the most rewarding parts of her job and reminds her how much the work at USDA matters — to farmers and to community members in Milwaukee and across the country.

The theme of the evening was food safety, and Under Secretary for Food Safety, Dr. Elisabeth Hagen, provided keynote remarks. Last week we were honored to host USDA’s 3rd annual Iftar commemorating the month of Ramadan and the contributions of USDA’s Muslim employees.  More than 200 attendees, including USDA employees, Muslim community members, and representatives from faith-based and secular non-profit organizations, gathered at USDA headquarters for an evening with a themed focus on “Food and Faith: Setting a Safe and Healthy Table.” The lead speaker of the evening was Dr. Elisabeth Hagen, Under Secretary for Food Safety.  She spoke about the work of USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service on prevention via inspection, as well as consumer education programs on safe food handling techniques.  Dr. Hagen also reminded the audience that food preferences are cultural.  USDA inspection personnel work in more than 6,000 plants across the country to ensure that food is safe when it reaches the table.  Inspectors and veterinarians  who work with Halal red meat and poultry establishments are trained to ensure that animal slaughter is completed according to Islamic  law, while at the same time following agency regulations. The evening also included special recognition for Islamic Relief USA, for their work to end hunger in America and around the world.  Islamic Relief has partnered with USDA to help run the Summer Food Service Program at 30 meals sites this summer.  Dr. Abed Ayoub, CEO of the non-profit organization, accepted the award saying, “We cannot fill our stomachs while the children down the street go hungry.” More than 200 employees and community members gathered at USDA headquarters to mark the department’s 3rd annual Iftar dinner.

USDA Muslim employees, including Dr. Maqbool Qureshi from the Food Safety and Inspection Service and Dr. Parveen Setia, form the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service, were also recognized for their outstanding volunteerism in planning the Iftars and leading the employee-run Organization of South Asian Americans in Agriculture.  Iftar guests also had the chance to hear from Rashad Hussain, President Obama’s Special Envoy to the Organization of the Islamic Conference. Ramadan falls on the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and is a time of fasting, prayer, sacrifice, and worship for Muslims around the world.  Throughout this month, Muslims fast during the day, abstaining from consuming food or drink from dawn to dusk.  Iftar is the meal at which Muslims break their fast at sunset.  Last week’s Iftar was the 3rd to be held at USDA, following in the footsteps of the “new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world,” called for by President Obama.   As Dr. Hagen stated, the annual Iftar “has become an important way for our department to show respect, honor, and appreciation to the Muslim community.”  Category/Topic:  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Tags:  Dr. Elisabeth Hagen  Food Safety  FSIS  Iftar  Max Finberg  Summer Food Service Program","What is the primary theme of USDA's 3rd annual Iftar dinner, which was attended by over 200 employees and community members?","The primary theme of USDA's 3rd annual Iftar dinner was ""Food and Faith: Setting a Safe and Healthy Table,"" with a focus on food safety."
"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Apr 23,  Nature’s color abounds in a forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. USDA photo by Bob Nichols. The word “agriculture” does not usually come to mind when one thinks of forests, but perhaps it’s time that it should. “The forest products industry employs nearly 1 million people and contributes $254 billion to America’s economy through sales and payroll,” said Eric Norland, a national program leader at USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). In addition to the well-publicized environmental benefit trees have in mitigating the effects of climate change, forests are economically and socially important to individuals and communities. Trees also play an increasingly important role in sustainable energy, including fueling aircraft. According to Norland, more than 10 million family forest owners account for 262 million acres of the nation’s 751 million acres of forestland. Most of the wood that becomes construction lumber, furniture, paper, and other products comes from privately owned forests. NIFA’s Renewable Resources Extension Act (RREA) grants support Cooperative Extension programs that give practical information to help landowners sustain the forests that provide wood, wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration, clean and plentiful water, and other environmental and economic benefits to their local communities. NIFA’s forestry programs include research to understand the impacts of climate, drought, and insects on forests and education programs that train the next generation of natural resource scientists and land managers. One example is the NIFA-funded project, the Ohio Woodland Stewards Program, managed by Ohio State University. The program focuses on providing woodland owners a variety of forestry skills. In , 612 landowners and natural resource professionals responsible for managing over 300,000 acres of woodland around the state attended workshops and other programs. The program’s website offers scores of publications with forest and related information. In addition, NIFA is supporting research into silvopasture, the practice of combining forage plants, trees, and livestock. In this integrated system, trees provide shade and cooling for livestock, which in turn encourages forage growth. Eventually both the livestock and the trees go to market, potentially increasing profits for farmers. NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

"Initiatives  Jun 07,   Written collaboratively by: The People’s Garden Team Today, Sam Droege with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) led a workshop on The Native Bees in Your Garden at The People’s Garden at USDA Headquarters. Did you know there are about 4,000 species of bees in North America and that one eighth of them have not even been named yet? Despite their importance, there has been little research on native bees. Much of what we know comes from before the ’s when collecting and studying insects was popular. Since there has been little research, we do not know if there have been wide spread declines in native bees like there have been with the non-native honeybees. Sam and other scientists and taxonomists are working together to create online identification guides for the bees of North America. You can find out more about this collaborative project at National Biological Information Infrastructure. Did you know that most of the native bees do not sting?  Only the few “colonial” bees (bees that form colonies) will sting and only if trapped or if their hive is attacked.  Most “bee” stings are in fact from wasps, like yellow jackets, not bees.  Sam noted that in general bees are vegetarians while wasps are meat eaters.  While bees are attracted to and pollinate flowers, wasps generally do not. Honeybees are important for agriculture since native bees are frequently not available around industrial farms.  The reason is that industrial farmland is devoid of the natural habitat native bees need.  Instead, beekeepers bring in beehives to provide pollination services. Another problem is that the pesticides used to eliminate insect pests in agricultural land also kill bees and other beneficial insects.  Because of the lack of research, we do not know the impact of pesticides on native bees or the honeybees. The presentation ended with a tour of the garden and Sam showing the attendees all the many bees peacefully pollinating the garden. Throughout the month of June, The People’s Garden is celebrating pollinators in honor of National Pollinator Week, June 21-27 with workshops and exhibits.

"in  Conservation  Energy  Rural  Apr 24,  Secretary Vilsack renewed an historic agreement to accelerate the adoption of innovative waste-to-energy projects & energy efficiency improvements on U.S. dairy farms Cross posted from The Huffington Post:  U.S. dairy producers are leading the way in productivity and innovation when it comes to sustainable practices. Earlier this afternoon, I joined Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy CEO Tom Gallagher to renew an historic agreement with the dairy industry to lower greenhouse gas emissions and to accelerate the adoption of innovative waste-to-energy projects on U.S. dairy farms which help producers diversify revenues and reduce utility expenses on their operations. Today's extension of the Memorandum of Understanding is an acknowledgement of the dairy industry's legacy of stewardship and its ongoing commitment to improve our farms. This pact extends the agreement I signed during climate talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, in . Since then, millions of dollars have been awarded to the dairy industry for conservation improvements, grants, research, renewable energy and efficiency. Not only is this funding helping dairy producers make their operations more sustainable, it is also helping their bottom lines. Consumers are likely to increase dairy purchases if they believe dairy is environmentally friendly in addition to being nutritious, good-tasting and a good value. Since , USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service has provided funding that has helped more than 6,000 dairy farmers plan and implement conservation practices to improve sustainability. NRCS support for the dairy industry has resulted in 354 on-farm and in-plant energy audits as well as 18 conservation innovation grants for dairy-related projects during the past three years. USDA support for agricultural and waste-to-energy research has played a key role in the agreement's success to date. Since signing the MOU, USDA has made nearly 180 awards that helped finance the development, construction, and biogas production of anaerobic digester systems with Rural Development programs, such as the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program, Value Added Producer Grants, amongst others. These systems capture methane and produce renewable energy for on-farm use and sale onto the electric grid. Additionally, during this period, USDA awarded approximately 140 REAP loans and grants to help dairy farmers develop other types of renewable energy and energy efficiency systems at their operations. This agreement is a prime example of how the public and private sector are working with America's farmers and ranchers to take care of our planet. U.S. dairy producers are making great strides in sustainable practices and it is our job to continue to support them as excellent stewards of the land. With the recent celebration of Earth Day, it is important to recognize the impressive efforts of our nation's dairy farmers. Dairy producers have taken a voluntary, proactive approach to conservation and thus serve as an exemplary model of the Obama Administration's overall energy priorities. I am confident that this agreement will help the dairy industry reach its long-term goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by .

The conference brought in over 200 people, a large number in a rural state with just over 200 certified organic operations.  MOA President Nate Brown noted, ""The Montana Organic Association annual conference is our biggest event of the year and has been the lifeblood of the organization for the past 12 years.  We feel the conference is a great way to bring together Montana's organic community every year for a weekend of learning and socializing in order to keep up with the growing organic market in our state."" Montana is a leading producer of certified organic wheat, dry peas, lentils and flax.  MOA provides the state’s organic community with valuable education, information, support, assistance, promotion, and representation. While many of the participants were longtime friends and organic farmers, the conference also brought in new faces, as more and more farmers consider the organic option. Throughout all the presentations, and several field visits, there was one common theme: the demand for organic products keeps on growing. The conference was attended by a full spectrum of the organic community and featured a keynote address by Senator Jon Tester.  Participants found the USDA presentation timely and complimentary to the conference goals of building a business and staying in business. MOA members shared locally-produced organic food at almost every meal, and Friday evening featured a rousing fundraising auction to raise funds for the organization. As producers look ahead to planting their crops in , many participants were interested in the USDA Market News on grains, new risk management and crop insurance tools, and further education on the organic certification process.  Participants also discussed the shortage of organic supply to meet the growing demand for organic products, the organic certification process, and the organic standards. I was thankful to see firsthand how MOA’s conference brings together Montana's organic community to help keep up with the state’s growing organic market.  I was able to share information about various USDA programs and services – including the Organic Literacy Initiative and the Sound and Sensible initiative – that are making organic certification more accessible, attainable, and affordable. We are excited to be collaborating with many partners in support of a diverse community of organic stakeholders, and we have launched a number of new and expanded efforts to connect organic farmers and businesses with the resources they need to ensure the continued growth of the organic sector domestically and abroad.  In fact, USDA has a one-stop-shop for information on all of our programs and opportunities for the organic community.  Be sure to check it out.

"Deputy Director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 22,   “So, how fortunate are you?  Are you free?  Can you eat?” -Excerpt from JCPA Hunger Seder Haggadah On Thursday, April 14th, US Department of Agriculture Under Secretary Kevin Concannon and several representatives from the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships joined Members of Congress and members of the anti-hunger community to observe an annual “Hunger” Passover Seder in an intimate gathering at the Capitol Visitors Center. Sponsored by the Jewish Council for Public Affairs (JCPA), this third annual Hunger Seder,  and over 40 others like it across 22 states, told the traditional story of oppression, struggle and ultimate liberation, but with a unique voice and group of participants.  Similar Hunger Seders were held across the country, coordinated by JCPA.  Collectively, the group reflected on an oppression still present in our communities today-- that of hunger and poverty -- and asked each person to renew their dedication to justice and pledge their efforts toward nourishing and protecting vulnerable people in our communities. The Haggadah was customized to speak to the experience of hunger in our communities, led the group, cup by cup, through four new promises about hunger: We will feed our communities today. We will seek out those in need and act to nourish ourselves and our neighbors. We will use our power to persuade our leaders to act to abolish hunger in our communities. We will create a world where all Americans and all people are free from hunger. US Department of Agriculture Under Secretary Kevin Concannon and several representatives from the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships joined Members of Congress and members of the anti-hunger community to observe an annual “Hunger” Passover Seder in an intimate gathering at the Capitol Visitors Center. Under Secretary Concannon highlighted the role of the Jewish community in advocating for important changes the Administration is leading to address hunger and improve access to nutritious food through the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act. Various readers – from precocious school children, to respected Hunger heroes like Congressman Jim McGovern (MA) and Ambassador Tony Hall – read aloud reflective passages that called upon spiritual people to embrace the spiritual responsibility of addressing hunger. We were pleased to be joined by David Myers, who directs the DHS Partnership Center, Acacia Salatti, Deputy at HHS Center and Roxana Barillas, Deputy at the USDA Center.  “Each drop of wine,” they read, “represents our humanity diminished by the presence of hunger.”  Reciting their parts, children who participated walked in the shoes of individuals, other children and families who benefit from nutrition programs that provide them with a school meal at free or reduced price; pregnant women and their children with WIC benefits; and the more than 43 million whose next meal is better with the help of SNAP benefits (formerly Food Stamps). The Seder closed as the group spoke about the tradition of filling the empty cup at the table – Elijah’s cup – a task that is accomplished only with drops of wine from each participant’s glass.  The symbolism of this act was truly a call of action of for the group, and an embodiment of the individual as well as communal efforts to create a world free from hunger.

"USDA Rural Development Kentucky State Director in  Rural  May 30,   Recently, I spoke at the grand opening of the Daisy Hill Assisted Living facility in Versailles, Ky.  In visiting this facility, I reflected on the future of this and other facilities and their importance as we anticipate the droves of baby boomers seeking to maintain a quality of life as they transition to assisted-living. The facility was financed through USDA’s Business and Industry Guarantee Loan program.  The $4.5 million loan guarantee to Pinnacle National Bank of Nashville has provided the owners an opportunity to create a beautiful facility for the residents. Facilities like Daisy Hill are going to be especially important, as the demand for elder care facilities increase with the aging of our baby boomer generation. In Kentucky, we have seen an increase in the last decade of nearly 45 percent in the boomers who reached the age of 55-64 – this is according to the U.S. Census.   Their share of the state total population rose from 9.2 percent to 12.ate Center. Kentucky Rural Development State Director Tom Fern (right) speaks at the opening of the Daisy Hill Assisted Living facility in Versailles. USDA Rural Development guaranteed a loan for the facility, creating jobs and providing a quality facility for area seniors. USDA photo. This dramatic increase is only the first wave of “becoming of age” for the baby boomer generation.  We can anticipate the ‘second wave” of boomers to be even more dramatic.  There is no question the demand for assisted living facilities like Daisy Hill will continue the upward trend over the next decade. While the primary focus of assisted living facilities is about providing residents and families with quality services.  There is an equally important secondary focus, and that is to bring opportunities for economic development and jobs to the community. The jobs being created by the opening of Daisy Hill is just the beginning of job creation opportunities for Versailles and surrounding communities.  New opportunities for local businesses to provide products and services will also bring greater economic growth to the community – and hopefully will result in the creation of even more local jobs. The new Daisy Hill Assisted Living facility in Versailles, Ky., provides a bright, welcoming setting for senior citizens. The building was funded with a USDA Business Loan Guarantee. (USDA Photos) USDA Rural Development is multi-faceted in what funding programs it offers.

"Pacific Southwest Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Nov 21,  Members of the Round Valley Indian Tribe retrace the route of the Nome Cult walk, a forced relocation of Indians from Chico, Calif., to Covelo, Calif. (U.S. Forest Service) Many of us may think of the forest as a place to reflect upon times long past. There may even be a bit of nostalgia in those ruminations. Yet for members of the Round Valley Tribes, a recent walk through the Mendocino National Forest in California was more than a time to contemplate—it was a time to remember an agonizing event in history. This autumn marked the 150th anniversary of the Nome Cult Walk, a forced relocation of 461 Native Americans from Chico, Calif., to the Nome Cult Reservation, near Covelo, Calif. Only 277 of those completed the forced march that passed through what is the heart of today’s Mendocino National Forest. Those who did not complete the journey were too sick to go on, some escaped, and others were killed. The Nome Cult Walk was one of several military-enforced relocations of Native Americans throughout California in the mid-s. During those moves, Native Americans were not only taken from their tribal lands, but were also forced to live with many different tribes. Sometimes those people forced to live together had been longtime rivals. One result of the Nome Cult Walk relocation was the creation of the Round Valley Indian Tribes. This federally recognized tribe exists today and includes the Yuki, Wailacki, Concow, Little Lake Pomo, Nomlacki, Pit River, Maidu and Nissinan tribes. Nearly two decades ago, descendants of the Nome Cult Walk began an annual commemoration of the forced relocation of their ancestors. September marked the 18th year that members of the Round Valley Indian Tribes retraced the original 100-mile route across the Sacramento Valley through the rugged North Coast Ranges. Three generations of Native Americans partook in this year’s tribute. “It is important that our youngest members take part in this annual event,” said Kenneth Wright, president of the Round Valley Indian Tribes. “The theme of the walk is ‘Honor Their Memory–A Path Not Forgotten.’” Eduardo Olmedo (left), Grindstone District Ranger, and Kenneth Wright, Round Valley Indian Tribes President, enjoy the shade after a morning of hiking the Nome Cult trail on the Mendocino National Forest. (U.S. Forest Service/Denise Adamic) Not all of the participants hiked — some offered moral support, made camp, or cooked meals for the walkers. At the culmination of the weeklong event, the entire group descended into Covelo for various celebrations sponsored by the Round Valley Indian Tribes. The closing celebrations served as a meaningful way to end the week of remembrance. “While the Nome Cult Trail is a tragic chapter in our state’s history, it is also a story about the resilience and strength of California Indians,” said Mendocino Forest Supervisor Sherry Tune. “It is an important legacy for their decedents and for all Californians.” November is Native American Heritage Month and the theme is “Guiding our destiny with heritage and tradition.  The Mendocino National Forest encompasses over 913,000 acres of rugged landscape in northwestern California, and is a three-hour drive north from San Francisco. It is the only one of California’s 18 national forests not crossed by a paved road or highway. Three generations of Native Americans commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Nome Cult Walk. Not all of the participants hike—some provide moral support, make camp, or cook meals for those who trek the 100-mile route.

(NRCS photo/ Gary Larson) Most college juniors look forward to summer break as a time to relax without any responsibilities. Not Kelsey Bulman. In the summer of , she began volunteering with the Earth Team of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service. For her efforts, Bulman won Minnesota’s Earth Team Award in and was honored with a National Earth Team Volunteer Award. Last summer Kelsey, who had just graduated, worked every day to gain experience and build her knowledge of conservation management, ultimately logging 414 hours. “It felt like being a kid again, going to the farm with Dad, watching as NRCS helped put conservation on our farms,” she says. “Volunteering for Earth Team was a natural fit for me.” As a volunteer, Bulman assisted the Caledonia, Minn., field office staff with the planning and application of conservation practices. “Kelsey helped with so many different projects,” says district conservationist Gary Larson. With a degree in conservation management, Bulman was able to assist with both the administrative and technical sides of conservation planning, helping the agency while building her skills. She worked with landowners to get signatures on design plans, helped more than 20 Conservation Reserve Program participants with re-enrollment and collected surveys for conservation practice cost estimates that will help determine future cost-share rates. “That experience is invaluable,” says Larson. “Our office really appreciated having her help.” “I would love to work as an employee for NRCS one day,” says Bulman. “This opportunity has allowed me to see each position in NRCS and the ones that interest me the most.” She goes on, “I was lucky enough that my Dad’s pond project with NRCS had already been approved, so I got to see that from start to finish. As a kid, I didn’t know how complex conservation practices were, for the landowner or NRCS.” About her Earth Team volunteer experience, she summarizes, “I enjoyed helping and being on the land, and I plan to be back again this year.” Follow NRCS on Twitter.

"NRCS Illinois in  Conservation  Jan 08,  Ron Farris, landowner, and NRCS employee Danette Cross look over his conservation plan. In southern Illinois, along the Mississippi River, you can see a diverse landscape of woodlands, open wild areas and farmland. But that wasn’t the case about 20 years ago, after the Great Flood of ravaged the area. That summer, all of these ecosystems resembled a moonscape with most of the vegetation removed. In the wake of the flood, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) offered easement purchases through its Emergency Wetlands Reserve Program to help landowners take frequently flooding cropland out of production and restore functional wetlands. In Alexander County alone, landowners enrolled seven easements covering 3,089 acres. This compilation of easements forms a “contiguous piece of Mississippi River floodplain,” says Dave Hiatt, NRCS biologist, providing prime habitat for local wildlife as well as migrating wildlife. “Each easement connects a larger area that gives migrating birds a place to rest and feed before traveling on,” he says. “Located at the top of the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, this locale is now a major migration staging area.” This map shows acres enrolled in EWRP in outlined in red. Wetlands also help reduce damage from floods, contribute to groundwater recharge and carbon sequestration and provide recreational opportunities. They are among the most biologically diverse ecosystems in the world. Even during significant droughts like the one experienced in Illinois and other parts of the country this past year, wetland areas support wildlife and plant species. Once a landowner places his or her land in a conservation easement with NRCS, he or she retains the title to the land and the right to control access and recreational use, and still pays taxes on the property. Alternatively, the landowner can sell the property. In this case, the U.S. Forest Service purchased 3,000 acres of land encumbered by easements from landowners in order to restore the wetlands, which are adjacent to the Shawnee National Forest. Other easements purchased in Alexander County over the past 20 years have added another 2,367 acres of wetlands to the Wetlands Reserve Program; nearby Union and Jackson counties have several easements totaling thousands of acres in NRCS programs. NRCS biologist Hiatt calls these wetlands a beautiful “string of pearls along the Mississippi.” These “pearls” help clean the water and support native flora and fauna that we can all enjoy for years.

"USDA Food and Nutrition Service Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Mar 19,  USDA Food and Nutrition Service Administrator Audrey Rowe wants to make sure that children and teens have access to healthy meals in and out of school. When school lets out, millions of children look forward to camps, pools, and blockbuster movies.  However, many children will also experience hunger.  When school is in session, low-income students receive free or reduced-price school meals that help families stretch their food budget.  When the school year ends, those school meals are no longer available to those students and some families will struggle to fill this gap. We here at the USDA have been working hard to reduce childhood hunger when school is out.  One way we are accomplishing this goal is through the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) for Children demonstration project.  The project, funded by Congress in , has shown clear results in reducing very low food security among children, the most severe form of childhood hunger.  A rigorous evaluation indicated that Summer EBT for Children: Reduced the most severe form of childhood hunger by 33% Allowed children to eat more healthfully.  Children in the demonstration project ate 13% more fruits and vegetables, 30% more whole grains and 10% more dairy Reached 30-75% of children eligible for free and reduced-price school meals With strong evidence of reducing severe childhood hunger and encouraging healthy eating, the President’s Budget included a request for $30 million to support scaling up the Summer EBT for Children demonstration project in the budget request.  In summer , eight states and two Indian tribal organizations (ITOs) took part in the project and all together they reached 100,000 children in low food security households. Additional funding to scale up Summer EBT for Children would not only reduce childhood hunger when school is out and encourage healthier eating, but allow us to learn more about food insecurity among children and the best approaches to reducing it long-term.  We will continue to share the results of our projects with all of our anti-hunger partners and continue to work with them to end childhood hunger once and for all.

"USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  Aug 28,   USDA/EPA National Workshop on Water Quality Markets graphic. (Click for the registration link) For most people, water quality markets are probably a new concept. They are not something you hear about on the news every day, even though frequently cover the need to clean up rivers and lakes. But to some—like states, utilities, and farmers—they represent an opportunity, and should be on the radar. Water quality markets can reduce costs of cleaning up waterways by allowing sources with high costs of meeting water quality requirements to purchase credits from sources that have lower costs of making the same water quality improvement. Agricultural producers often have lower costs of improving water quality, which makes farmers and ranchers prime candidates to supply water quality credits. USDA supports the participation of farmers, ranchers and forest landowners in water quality trading as a voluntary way to put more conservation on the ground, and improve water quality. The Department develops tools to calculate water quality benefits and resources on how to structure trading programs. Furthermore, the Department provides funding to support the development of water quality trading markets through NRCS Conservation Innovation Grants. And now, in partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency, USDA is offering the public an opportunity to learn more about water quality markets. The EPA-USDA Water Quality Markets Workshop is bringing a host of experts involved in water quality trading markets together to share their experiences and provide a wealth of information to those interested in starting or participating markets. The event will take place September 15-17 in Lincoln, Nebraska, and includes regional forums where participants can learn more about trading programs in their area. The Workshop will do more than provide information—it will also highlight the history of collaboration on water quality trading within the federal government. USDA and EPA signed a partnership agreement in to work together on environmental markets, including water quality markets. Tools and resources developed under the agreement will be previewed at the Workshop, and participants will learn how they can apply to water quality planning and management. Workshop participants will also get a taste of the larger partnership that has developed in support of water quality markets—including a look at the National Network on Water Quality Trading. The National Network is composed of representatives from agriculture, industry, state, and environmental groups from across the country working to help others develop and participate in water markets.  The National Network recently released Building a Water Quality Trading Program, which identifies common trading issues and the options, considerations, and examples important to developing a program. There are plenty of reasons to attend next month’s Workshop—it will be an excellent forum to learn more about water quality markets. Registration closes August 31st.

"Senior Policy Advisor for Rural Affairs with the White House Domestic Policy Council in  Energy  Rural  Oct 10,  Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) and other emerging wood technologies are being used in new construction projects around the world, like these apartment buildings in Vaxjo, Sweden. (Photo credit: Midroc Property Development)  Cross-posted from the White House Rural Council:  As part of the Obama administration's commitment to mitigate climate change, USDA, in partnership with the Softwood Lumber Board and the Binational Softwood Lumber Council, is announcing the U.S. Tall Wood Building Prize Competition. This competitive prize, open to teams of architects, engineers, and developers, will showcase the architectural and commercial viability of advanced wood products like Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) in tall buildings. Advanced wood products are becoming the latest innovation in tall building construction. Products like CLT are flexible, strong, and fire resistant. In construction, wood products can be used as a successful and sustainable alternative to concrete, masonry, and steel. Using wood also reduces greenhouse gas emissions by storing carbon and simultaneously offsetting emissions from conventional building materials. By some estimates, the near term use of CLT and other emerging wood technologies in buildings 7-15 stories could have the same emissions control affect as taking more than 2 million cars off the road for one year. Wood can also help struggling rural forest communities. During the Recession, the drop in new construction and decline in home remodeling had a deep impact on wood manufacturing. However, if CLT and similar advanced wood products can penetrate just 5 - 15% of the non-residential North American market, that would mean roughly 0.8 - 2.4 billion board feet of lumber consumed annually. To put that in real-world context, roughly 35 jobs are created for each million board feet of wood processed. The winner of the Tall Wood Building competition will receive support for incremental costs of pioneering wood construction techniques to address the engineering design and code variances needed to incorporate wood technologies into new building sites. The competition requires that the winning project team source a share of materials from rural, domestic manufacturers and domestic, sustainably managed forests in order to jumpstart new production and economic opportunities in rural America. The launch of this competition is part of USDA's overall strategy to promote the use of wood as a green building material. In addition, the White House Rural Council hosted the Building With Wood: Jobs and the Environment workshop in March . USDA's Forest Service has also partnered with WoodWorks to provide outreach and technical support for architects and engineers of wood construction, supported a new commercial-scale CLT manufacturing facility in Columbia Falls, Montana, and invested more than $2 million in research and technical support for emerging wood technologies through the Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin. Wood is a readily available and renewable building material that creates jobs and stimulates the economy. It can be used in urban or rural settings to build energy-efficient houses, buildings, and other needed infrastructure. It is successfully being used around the world and can help mitigate climate change. As Secretary Vilsack said at the March Workshop, ""Wood may be one of the world's oldest building materials, but it is now also one of the most advanced."" Additional information about the competition is available at www.tallwoodbuildingcompetition.org. Winners will be announced in .

"Southeast Regional Office, Public Affairs in  Food and Nutrition  May 28,  When Rebecca and Parker Catt became parents, they faced a new set of challenges, including making the right choices in deciding what their baby James should be fed. After Rebecca heard about the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) from a friend at the gym, she went to a WIC clinic near her home in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. There she discovered she qualified for the program and signed up. Now among nearly 80,000 active WIC participants in Mississippi, Rebecca says that WIC has not only helped them get nutritious food for their baby, it has also helped them become more financially stable. ""It’s helped us save money so we can pay more on our other bills,"" Rebecca said. ""It’s really helped out my family and I’m sure it will help out multiple people.” “The value of the WIC program is not only to provide supplemental foods, the nutrition education is invaluable because as children grow, parents will understand why they should feed their children certain healthy foods,” said Diane Hargrove, director of the Mississippi Department of Health WIC Program. And Mississippi is now in the process of making WIC benefits delivery more convenient by transitioning from issuing benefits through paper checks to using WIC Electronic Benefits Transfer (eWIC) cards. Like the paper checks, the eWIC cards can be used for purchasing approved foods from authorized grocery stores. The state began statewide rollout last month and Hattiesburg, Meridian, and Tupelo are currently transitioning to eWIC. “We are excited about Mississippi’s transition to eWIC which will offer participants a wider variety or authorized foods and allow them to make purchases at their convenience,” said Southeast Regional Administrator Willie Taylor of the USDA Food and Nutrition Service. “We know that good nutrition is key for being healthy and having a productive life.” Families like the Catts truly appreciate all the support. “The people at the WIC clinic are super nice and helpful,” said Rebecca. “WIC to me means good nutrition, overall, I just love it.” Learn more about the USDA WIC program here: www.fns.usda.gov/wic.

"Deputy Under Secretary, USDA Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Jul 22,  School meals play a major role in shaping the diets and health of young people. FNS photo. With nearly 31 million students now participating in the National School Lunch Program each day, sound nutrition at school plays an essential role in supporting a healthier next generation.  But when the new standards were developed by pediatricians and other child nutrition experts, USDA was also looking for students to enjoy the healthier offerings they receive. And according to a new report, the majority of our nation’s children are accepting these new school meals.  This great news is part of a just-released study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that finds 70 percent of elementary school leaders nationwide reported that students like the healthier school lunches that rolled out in fall .  Other highlights of the research include: Respondents at 70 percent of elementary schools reported that students liked the new lunches. Across all grade levels, most respondents reported that students complained initially in fall , but that far fewer students were complaining by the time of the surveys in spring —showing that students like healthy food as they grow more accustomed to it. Respondents from elementary and middle schools where a large proportion of the student body was eligible for free or reduced-price lunch reported that very few of the students were discarding the meal. The Administration is dedicated to paving the way for a healthier future for our nation’s sons and daughters. Students across the country are enjoying a healthier school environment with more nutritious options as a result of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act.  To address public concern about our nation’s obesity epidemic and our children’s current and future health, the updates significantly increased the amount of whole grains, low-fat dairy, fruits and vegetables in the meals, and set limits for sugars, fats and sodium. These new standards have resulted in healthier meals for tens of millions of kids across the country.  The lead author of the study, Lindsey Turner, explained, “Our studies show that kids are okay with these changes, and that there have not been widespread challenges with kids not buying or eating the meals.” We know that these types of changes in schools can have a positive impact on students.  Earlier research found that school-based programs that encourage healthy eating, physical activity and positive attitudes toward body image are among a range of interventions that can help reduce levels of childhood obesity. Our children’s ability to learn in the classroom, grow up healthy, and reach their fullest potential depends on what we do right now to secure their future.  And it appears as if they and their families are embracing this commitment.

"Posted by acampbell in  Initiatives  Jul 16,   Do you want to make your garden the best it can be? Do you want to learn more about how to conserve as much as possible, while cultivating a thriving garden? The Peoples' Garden at USDA was conceptualized to help Americans learn more about all things gardening -- and this summer, we're putting on weekly Healthy Garden Workshops to help everyone learn the ins and outs of a great garden. July 3 Kickoff Workshop At the July 3 Healthy Garden Workshop, “Watering Your Lawn and Garden,” USDA experts offered a few of the scientific tricks to ensure that your plants and lawn get enough water, but not too much as well as how much water plants “drink” from the soil every week. For example: It helps to create a weekly watering plan, and to monitor the rainfall in your lawn/garden and subtract that amount of water from your weekly watering plan. Plants use approximately one inch of water from the soil each week during the summer growing season. Therefore, this amount needs to be replenished for plants to continue to grow and thrive. Depending on where we live, nature takes care of this for us by providing rain and we supplement with additional water as needed. Watering is a delicate balance for gardens. Too little water causes plants to wilt and die. Too much water means the plant cannot breathe; this can cause rotting and make the plant susceptible diseases. And that's just a sample. For more information about these tips, and to learn more about gardening, visit the the Peoples' Garden page. Upcoming Events At tomorrow's Healthy Garden Workshop, you can learn about gardening in containers and window boxes (especially helpful for Americans living in cities and urban areas). The workshop will include discussion on finding the right container for the job, getting good soil, and nursing the container garden over time. Next week, on July 24, we'll show you techniques for weeding and removing invasive plants. At both of these activities, a ""Sprouts"" workshop for kids will focus on a series of activities for children that demonstrate how the food system works, from farm to fork. If you can't make a workshop, consider a garden tour -- they're held every Tuesday and Thursday at 1 p.m. at the Garden. You can also always follow ongoing updates from the Peoples' Garden project on Twitter. or visit the Peoples' Garden page online.  Category/Topic:  Initiatives  Tags:  Plant Health  Workshop","""What is the key to balancing watering for your garden, and how can you use rainfall data to inform your watering plan?""",The key to balancing watering for your garden is to create a weekly watering plan that takes into account both the amount of water plants need (approximately one inch per week) and the rainfall in your area. This involves monitoring rainfall and subtracting it from your planned watering amount to avoid overwatering.

"Tribes Remember the Nome Cult Trail  Many of us may think of the forest as a place to reflect upon times long past. There may even be a bit of nostalgia in those ruminations. Yet for members of the Round Valley Tribes, a recent walk through the Mendocino National Forest in California was more than a time to contemplate—it was a time to remember an agonizing event in history. This autumn marked the 150th anniversary of the Nome Cult Walk, a forced relocation of 461 Native Americans from Chico, Calif., to the Nome Cult Reservation, near Covelo, Calif. Only 277 of those completed the forced march that passed through what is the heart of today’s Mendocino National Forest. Those who did not complete the journey were too sick to go on, some escaped, and others were killed.

"Acting Arizona Rural Development State Director in  Rural  Jun 16,   The parents were leery about another rental, fearing having to move yet again. Rather serendipitously, the mother saw information on line about USDA Rural Development housing programs. She made a call that changed their lives. As it turned out, the house that they eventually found and qualified for was part of a “green home” renovation in conjunction with other local agencies. The family was able to purchase their home with a loan direct from Rural Development, give their four children a stable home and neighborhood, and the home itself has proven to be so efficient that they are saving monthly on their utility bills. The family received homebuyer education classes and credit counseling as part of the programs they participated in. The mother said “We are lucky to have found out about you! We have nothing but high praise for the process. Thank you for your dedication to helping families like ours purchase a home.” In Yavapai County another Rural Development program has helped families transition into stable home situations and sometimes rescued them from homelessness. With this program non-profits are able to rent for $1 a year Non-Program Real Estate Owned (foreclosed) REO homes owned by Rural Development. During the ten year rental agreement, the non-profit uses the home as transitional housing. In Cottonwood, Arizona, a church entered into such an agreement with USDA nine years ago. Since then, they have helped five families. The church limits the time a family can stay to two years and during that time they provide the family with job training and credit counseling. They also charge a “rental fee” to the family. Rent is calculated based on the family’s income and expenses. The rent that is received is used to do any repairs and upkeep, pay property taxes and insurance and any remaining amount is put into an escrow account for the family to use as a down payment when their two year rental agreement is up. According to the spokesman for the church, the tenants are also to put an additional 20 percent  above that rental amount into the account—a way to teach the value of saving. The second family who lived in the home included a mother and her two children. The family was living in a homeless shelter before moving into the house. In the two years that they were in the home, they learned important life skills such as maintaining the property and making regular payments. We built the houses that helped build this great nation after World War II. We helped build the communities and many of facilities and infrastructure that make them function. In the tradition of barn-raising, we have given these rural communities what they needed to help themselves. And they have shown their gratitude by working to ensure that their debts are repaid so we can help the next small town or rural resident in the same way we helped them.

"AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow, Office of the Chief Scientist and Paul M. Zankowski, Senior Advisor for Plant Health and Production and Plant Products, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Aug 14,  Indoor and vertical farming may be part of the solution to rising demands for food and limited natural resources. Photo credit: Oasis Biotech Imagine walking into your local grocery store on a frigid January day to pick up freshly harvested lettuce, fragrant basil, juicy sweet strawberries, and ripe red tomatoes – all of which were harvested at a local farm only hours before you’d arrived. You might be imagining buying that fresh produce from vertical farms where farmers can grow indoors year-round by controlling light, temperature, water, and oftentimes carbon dioxide levels as well. Generally, fresh produce grown in vertical farms travels only a few miles to reach grocery store shelves compared to conventional produce, which can travel thousands of miles by truck or plane. Beyond providing fresh local produce, vertical agriculture could help increase food production and expand agricultural operations as the world’s population is projected to exceed 9 billion by . And by that same year, two out of every three people are expected to live in urban areas. Producing fresh greens and vegetables close to these growing urban populations could help meet growing global food demands in an environmentally responsible and sustainable way by reducing distribution chains to offer lower emissions, providing higher-nutrient produce, and drastically reducing water usage and runoff. Recently, USDA and the Department of Energy held a stakeholder workshop focused on vertical agriculture and sustainable urban ecosystems. At this workshop, field experts shared thought-provoking presentations followed by small group discussions focusing on areas such as plant breeding, pest management, and engineering. Workshop attendees from public and private sectors worked together to identify the challenges, needs, and opportunities for vertical farming. A report on this workshop will be released to help inform Departmental strategic planning efforts for internal research priorities at USDA and external funding opportunities for stakeholders and researchers. We’re excited about the potential opportunities vertical agriculture presents to address food security. That’s why USDA already has some of these funding and research opportunities in place. The National Institute for Food and Agriculture has funding opportunities (, 1.22 ) that could support future vertical agriculture conferences and research. Similarly, the Agricultural Research Service is working on a project to increase U.S. tomato production and quality in greenhouses and other protected-environments. We look forward to continuing our partnership with our customers, both internal and external.

"Environmental, Economics, and Demographics Branch Chief, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  USDA Results  Conservation  Sep 21,  Farmers can help ensure there is enough agricultural labor in the United States at critical times in the production cycles by taking part in the Agricultural Labor survey. Throughout the course of the year, hired labor makes planting and harvesting of America’s farmland possible. On my family’s Illinois farm, we relied on both paid and unpaid friends and family to bring in our hay.   Nearby farmers however relied on seasonal migrant labor to harvest vegetables.  Today I’m a statistician overseeing the analyses and publication of environmental, economic and demographic on U.S. agriculture.  In that role, my team produces on farm labor that provides the basis for employment and wage estimates for all farm workers directly hired by U.S. farms.  It is also used by the U.S. Department of Labor to administer the H-2A agricultural guest worker program.  The H-2A program allows farmers and ranchers to hire foreign guest workers for seasonal jobs critical to American agriculture.  Agricultural labor is defined as any activity performed on a farm in connection with production of agricultural commodities. The Department of Labor relies on the we provide to monitor labor demands in the farming sector at key points during the year. They can then make decisions related to the supply of guest workers to meet reported labor demands.  And this is where our farm labor surveys comes in. We reach out to farmers and ranchers to conduct an agricultural labor survey twice each year in April and October. In the past, we collected the four times a year, once per quarter.  Several years ago we combined the quarters and began collecting only twice a year. With this approach, we were able to reduce both costs and demands on the survey participants, while still collecting and publishing information. Currently, the April survey collects for a specific week in January and April, and the October survey collects for a specific week in July and October. is collected for the week containing the 12th of each month. One of the easiest ways for farmers to help ensure there is enough agricultural labor in the United States at critical times in the production cycles is to take part in the Agricultural Labor survey. So I ask all farmers who receive the survey form in a few weeks to take the time to fill it out. Only with accurate can farmers, ranchers, policymakers and others make decisions that help the farm businesses and strengthen U.S. agriculture.

"US Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 23,  Members of the Highway 89 Stewardship Team ceremonially broke ground in early May to begin construction on two wildlife underpasses in northeast California. Photo credit: Sagehen Creek Field Station Every year in the U.S. roughly 200 people are killed in as many as 2 million wildlife-vehicle collisions and at a cost of more than $8 billion, according to the Western Transportation Institute. But the U.S. Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest Research Station scientists, along with their collaborators in the Highway 89 Stewardship Team, are paving the way to reduce those statistics with their latest project. The team broke ground last May on its second and third wildlife underpasses along a 25-mile stretch of Highway 89 between Truckee and Sierraville, California. “Studies have shown that well-placed wildlife crossings, coupled with fencing, can reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions by as much as 75 to 100 percent,” said Sandra Jacobson, a wildlife biologist with Pacific Southwest Research Station. While wildlife crossings exist across the country, the Highway 89 crossings will be unique in their value to science. Built to near identical dimensions and only located a mile apart from each other, the underpasses will allow scientists to manipulate conditions to learn what might make an underpass more appealing to wildlife. For instance there might be things that cancel out noise or add cover within the tunnels that might promote use among smaller animals. The tunnels are adjacent to the University of California, Berkeley’s Sagehen Creek Field Station in the Sagehen Experimental Forest, which will give scientists access to the forest’s research facilities and monitoring equipment.

"USDA Food Waste Challenge Team in  Food and Nutrition  Nov 24,  On average, these polts will take 4 to 5 months to make weight. It takes a lot of natural resources, energy, labor, and love to raise the estimated 46 million turkeys that will be consumed this Thanksgiving. Show your appreciation by making sure you waste as little food as possible. Photo courtesy of USDA. Thanksgiving is a time to appreciate all that is good in our lives and to spend it in the company of friends and family while enjoying great food.  It is also a time to reflect on the bounty of our food supply.  Each year, as I put away the leftovers from my Thanksgiving dinner, I marvel at the abundance. I also can’t avoid pausing to consider how much food is wasted in this country. USDA estimates that on average, American consumers waste about one-fifth of food that is available to them, equivalent to about $371 per person annually.  That’s enough money to buy about 21 whole turkeys for each person in the country. Wouldn’t it be great if we could make reducing food waste one of our Thanksgiving traditions?  A tradition we practice throughout the year? Reducing food waste starts with meal planning. Before you start shopping, take stock of what you have in your refrigerator and cupboards so that you don’t end up tossing extras.  A friend of mine uses an “Eat Me First” bin, so that the most perishable items are not lost at the back of the refrigerator. On Thanksgiving, using up the food currently in your refrigerator is particularly important to clear room for all of those Thanksgiving ingredients and post-Thanksgiving leftovers.  Careful menu planning and portion control helps to minimize waste.  When buying a turkey, USDA recommends allowing for one pound of turkey per person. Thanksgiving leftovers can be substantial, particularly when the gatherings are large.  Take time to make sure leftovers are refrigerated within two hours from when they are hot and have guests leave with something tasty to take home and eat later.  Leftovers can be delicious and the reason for gathering once more with friends and family. Many of my friends host Leftover Parties the day after Thanksgiving, which can sometimes spark debate among the partygoers as to whose pecan pie was better.  “The Friday after Thanksgiving is like a de facto National Leftovers Day – it’s the one day of the year where almost everyone enjoys leftovers,” says Jonathan Bloom, a food-waste author and blogger.  Of course, if you don’t have time to party with leftovers, you can simply store them.  Leftovers can be kept in the refrigerator for three to four days or safely frozen for up to a year. Thanksgiving is the perfect time to begin food waste reduction strategies in your household that can gradually become habit for every day of the year.  No one wants to throw delicious Thanksgiving food into the trash or compost bin, but shouldn’t we treat all food that we eat with the same amount of respect year-round? So here’s a toast to a Happy and Food Waste Free Thanksgiving.

"NRCS Mississippi in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Aug 03,  NRCS Supervisory District Conservationist Kelvin Jackson helped tomato producer Danny Daniels expand his farm and make it more environmentally friendly. For Danny Daniels, tomatoes take first place. He loves growing them so much, they’re the bulk of the produce raised on his Meridian, Miss. farm. The retiree–turned–tomato guru started growing the fruit a few years ago. Tomatoes are finicky, and Daniels saw growing them successfully as a challenge. Danny Daniels’ tomatoes are one of the staples of the Meridian, Miss. farmers market.  To improve his operation, Daniels contacted USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) about installing a seasonal high tunnel. High tunnels have a metal frame wrapped in plastic and are easy and fairly cheap to build. They are designed to extend the growing season into the cold months, helping to increase productivity, keep plants at a steady temperature and even conserve water and energy. Daniels enjoys his first high tunnel so much, he plans to apply for a second. He is considering cut flowers for the second high tunnel. While he knows flowers may be a challenge, they sure can’t be harder than tomatoes. There is a growing demand for cut flowers in the Meridian area for banquets, weddings and other events, he says. NRCS Supervisory District Conservationist Kelvin Jackson helped tomato producer Danny Daniels expand his farm and make it more environmentally friendly. In addition to the cut flowers, Daniels plans to expand his repertoire beyond the ‘Early Girl’, ‘Celebrity’ and ‘Bella Rosa’ hybrid variety tomatoes he has mastered. He will also try out other popular Mississippi produce, such as squash, zucchini and peppers in the garden near his inaugural high tunnel. NRCS funds high tunnels, like the one on Daniels’ farm, as part of USDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative, launched in to help local food systems thrive. You can search the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass for high tunnel projects near you. Daniels definitely makes an impact on the Meridian-area food system, as he sells his produce at a local farmer’s market and from a vegetable stand in front of his farm. He plans to put more emphasis on his vegetable stand this year, which is located in the outskirts of Meridian, in reach of town dwellers in search of local produce. Buying local is not only good for the local economy, but is also better for the consumer, he says. A seasonal high tunnel allows Danny Daniels to lengthen his growing season by six to eight weeks.

"Making the Grader - USDA's New Program Offers Veterans a Path into Agriculture  Over the last eight years, we’ve seen an increase in the number of veterans turning to agriculture for their post-service career. While many choose farming and ranching, others seek employment in the agriculture industry as well as federal service. USDA employs more than 11,000 veterans, and we’re looking to increase that number through a new apprenticeship program. The program, which is being launched this week by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) in partnership with the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), is a registered national apprenticeship that will grow a pool of talent for USDA. Although it is open to anyone interested in a career in agriculture, we are especially proud that it offers America’s veterans one more way to join our ranks.

"Making California and Minnesota a Magnet for New Jobs  While many manufacturing companies provide well-paying jobs and play a vital role in creating vibrant, healthy rural communities, sometimes rural communities may struggle to attract these companies. To help bridge this gap, the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership (IMCP) was created. This Administration-wide effort brings together federal departments and agencies to provide coordinated assistance to communities to become more attractive for manufacturers. Recently, USDA hosted two IMCP events in Minnesota and California with diverse audiences of about 120 stakeholders representing manufacturing businesses, lenders, economic development organizations, universities and community colleges, small businesses development centers, and local leaders among others.

"Harvest Time: Celebrating Native American Heritage and Traditional Foods in FDPIR  Autumn is a time to reflect on all that we have to be thankful for, as we enjoy the harvest of nature’s bounty during gatherings with family and friends. In Indian Country, culture and tradition are sustained through shared meals with family and the community. Traditional foods are a powerful way for each new generation to connect with and honor its history and its ancestors, and participants in USDA’s Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) have access to more traditional foods than ever this year. November, Native American Heritage Month, is an especially fitting time to celebrate the addition to FDPIR of bison, blue cornmeal, wild rice, and wild salmon – foods that not only nourish a body but sustain a culture. In collaboration with the FDPIR community, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service and Food and Nutrition Service have been working to identify culturally relevant foods to procure and offer through FDPIR, a program that provides healthy food and nutrition education to an average of 92,500 income-eligible individuals living on or near reservations across the United States each month. The food package offers more than 100 domestically sourced, nutritious foods, including a variety of meat, poultry, fish, dairy, grains, and fruits and vegetables. In both fiscal year and , USDA received an additional allocation of $5 million dedicated to traditional and locally-grown foods.

"A Reflection: Celebrating Eight Years of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships  Looking back at USDA’s efforts to help rural America thrive, I am truly proud of the impact our diverse partners, both from faith and secular communities, have had within their communities. On behalf of the USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, I would like to say thank you to our partners these past eight years as well as reflect on a few notable highlights of the work we have achieved together. USDA touches the lives of all Americans every day, whether they realize it or not. While our programs to reduce food insecurity are well known, our nation’s most vulnerable citizens can still be hard to reach.

"USDA People’s Garden Intern in  Conservation  Forestry  Initiatives  Jun 29,  The People’s Garden exhibit at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in the Reinventing Agriculture area of Campus and Community.  Wednesday was opening day of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival on the National Mall.  The Festival features three great themes.  One of the themes entitled “Campus and Community” is a program that commemorates the 150th Anniversary of the founding of Land grant universities and the USDA. The People’s Garden Initiative is thrilled to have an exhibition in the Reinventing Agriculture area of Campus and Community. Please stop by to see it and talk gardening with USDA’s Executive Master Gardeners! Like us, universities from across the country are demonstrating how they engage communities through gardening. The Festival runs June 27 to July 1 and July 4-8 from 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Our living exhibit showcases different types of gardens that qualify as People’s Gardens and demonstrates several relatively simple, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly practices that both beginner and expert gardeners can implement to make our communities healthier places to live, work and play. The types of gardens demonstrated include all access, edible, pollinator, and container. These gardens surround a shed with sustainable features like designing with reclaimed materials, making and using compost, setting up a rain barrel, and installing a green roof.  20-minute demonstrations on these sustainable practices are offered daily. Visitors have been quite curious about the sheds design, who built it and what it is made from. I talked with Bob Snieckus, National Landscape Architect for USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and Michael Roggerson, Lead Carpenter at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) for answers.  USDA landscape architect Bob Snieckus (far right), Professor Clarence W. Pearson, Jr. (third from left) from the University of the District of Columbia, and architecture students from the District of Columbia spent a day assembling the frame of the shed on the National Mall. How did you come up with the idea of this shed?  Bob Snieckus: Matt Arnn, Chief Landscape Architect for the U.S. Forest Service, and myself came up with this idea to showcase sustainable shed design. We wanted to show people at the Folklife Festival how organic material can be used. This shed features different species of urban timber, open and airy construction, and a green roof.  How did UDC contribute in the process of planning and building the shed? Michael Roggerson: The shed was built in partnership between USDA and UDC, a Land grant university here in Washington, DC. Clarence W. Pearson, Jr. in the Department of Architecture and Urban Design at UDC worked with Bob Snieckus on the design plans for the shed. We built the shed at our university in about a week from morning until evening, while USDA oversaw the project. We had about ten architecture students total building it, and about five or six per day.  How did the shed get moved from UDC to the National Mall?  Bob Snieckus: The plans were originally designed for the shed to be built and remain in the People’s Garden at USDA Headquarters. I learned to modify the design so that it could be assembled and then disassembled and transported from UDC to the Festival site.  What are the different elements of the shed? Bob Snieckus: The door is white oak that came from fallen and removed urban trees from the District of Columbia.  We used red oak and poplar for the siding. The floor rim joists are naturally insect resistant black locust. The shed has a green roof and rain barrel attachment. The soil and plants that we put on the roof add an extra pounds, so we had to design a structure to hold more weight than a normal shed. We used posts and ceiling joists made from fir trees to hold up the plywood roof. Where can you buy this type of reclaimed wood? Bob Snieckus: There are a few lumber mills around the area in D.C. and Maryland. The mills stockpile the trees from various sources and then cut the wood to the sizes that you request. Most of the wood comes from trees that were old or diseased and were lining streets and railroad tracks. The Urban Forestry Administration is a good place in the District of Columbia government that has a lot of info on what types of wood to use. They can also help you with your design and source of wood. How durable and long-lasting is this shed? Bob Snieckus: Very. It will last for years and years. That’s because in the base we used black locust which naturally prevents termite decay. We also sealed the wood with a liquid water proofing material so that weather won’t speed up decay.  What do you plan to do with the shed once the festival is over? Bob Snieckus: We hope to move it to The People’s Garden on the corner. We want to add shelving and hooks so that gardening tools can be stored in it.

"Posted by acampbell in  Forestry  Aug 10,   This week, the U.S. Forest Service celebrates the 65th birthday of one of its most prolific workers -- Smokey Bear. This afternoon in the Whitten Federal Building, area children and the public joined the agency for Smokey's official birthday celebration, where Forest Service officials had nothing but praise for his work. ""Smokey Bear is one of the most beloved symbols in American history and his important message has been communicated to generations of Americans during the past sixty five years,"" said U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell. James Hubbard, Deputy Chief of the Forest Service for State and Private Forestry, said that even though Smokey's been around long enough that he might be eligible to retire, there's still lots of work to be done. With thousands of people enjoying America's national forests every year, Smokey's message continues to be vital. Hank Kashdan, Associate Chief of the Forest Service, thanked the kids in attendance for the birthday cards they delivered to Smokey, and outlined Smokey's 65-year history for the crowd -- from the beginning of the Forest Service's fire education efforts with Bambi and friends, to Smokey's debut in . Following his remarks, Forest Service employees read Smokey's story, in both English and Spanish. After the reading, the Alexandria Choral Society's Children's Choir sang the Smokey Bear Song for the crowd, and after some chanting for Smokey, he came out to join the party ... For 65 years, Smokey Bear has been there to help the Forest Service remind America: ""Only you can prevent wildfire."" That's an important reminder, considering most fires aren't started by nature. In fact, 90% of wildfire is caused by our leaving fires unattended or coals burning. From his first day on the job, Smokey has been there to help Americans understand how their actions can affect the future of one of our most important national treasures.

The U.S. Forest Service responded by sending a technical team to assess the damage and subsequently recommended future mitigation and management strategies. Thus, a cooperative exchange program between the Jewish National Fund/Keren Kayemeth Leisrael (JNF-KKL) and the U.S. Forest Service was born. Earlier this fall, a team from the Forest Service’s Rocky Mountain Region, headed by Deputy Regional Forester Maribeth Gustafson, hosted a small group of guests from Israel. They included Minister of the Environment Amir Peretz; David Leffler, director general from the Ministry of Environmental Protection; Efi Stenzler, the JNF-KKL World Chairman; David Brand, the KKL Chief Forester, and four other staff members.

"Posted by Anita J. (Janie) Dunning, Missouri State Director, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Jul 09,  State Director Dunning , Ms. Fincher and her family in her new home.  Last year for Homeownership Month we visited Rita Fincher to whom we had made a Single Family Housing Direct loan to help purchase a home.  I was so impressed with her story last year that I decided I wanted to go back and visit her to see “what difference a year had made in her life with her new home.”  Here is her story. Last year Missouri Rural Development and Ms. Fincher proved that you are never too old to purchase a home.  Whatever the age, everyone should be given a fair opportunity to achieve the American dream – home ownership.  This is what makes our country so great. Ms. Fincher spent her life raising 10 children in a small mobile home in Park Hills, Missouri.  After her children left the nest, Rita’s mobile home literally began falling in around her.  Last year, at 86 years “young”, Ms. Fincher’s grandson decided to repay his grandmother by helping her find her first home.  Gene Coleman, Rita’s grandson who works as a realtor in St. Louis, Missouri, wanted his grandmother to finally be able to live in a home she could call her own.  Coleman was aware of a foreclosed vacant home owned by a local bank.  Fincher applied for a loan with USDA Rural Development through the Farmington, Mo., Office and was determined eligible through USDA Rural Development’s direct home loan program.  The team collaboration did not stop there.  The house was in need of additional care.  USDA Rural Development, along with Rita’s local bank, her family, church, friends, and neighbors all provided her with financial support to make the improvements to the home.  Last year Rita said, “Even though it needed lots of work, I knew from the beginning that the house would be perfect for me.  I am so thankful for the help from everyone – my family, my friends, and the staff at Rural Development.”  The visit I made with Rita and her family, who came to celebrate with her, was very rewarding.  Her gratitude for finally having a home was apparent.  All this being said I wanted to go back, a year later, and see how she was doing.  I was not disappointed. 87-year old Rita Fincher plays a guitar in her USDA-financed home Rita and her family again rolled out the red carpet for me and my staff.  She was so excited that we came back to see her.  Now Rita is 87 years old, very active in her church, is a door greeter and I understand if you miss her she will hunt you down to give you a hug.  She tells everyone that her house is her castle.  I asked her to tell me how she was feeling now, a year after getting the home.  She told me that she is fortunate that when she wakes up every morning and opens her eyes she is in this nice, beautiful home.  She says that having this home has really helped her with her health and that before she was very sick but her home has made her young again.  And young she is!  Ms. Fincher plays the guitar and piano and has taught her great grandson to play as well.  She played the guitar for us and she really got it on with “When the Saints Go Marching In.” Before we left she told me she had one more request from me.  She wanted her grandson to play “Amazing Grace” on the guitar and have all of us sing it with her as she felt so blessed to have us all in her life.  What can I say, whether we carried a tune or not, we sang with Ms. Rita. I would like to thank Rita Fincher for allowing us to play a role in one of the largest triumphs in her life.  She is a true inspiration to us all and it really was my pleasure to help Rita and her family celebrate this milestone in her life – even at age 87 years young!

"Office of Communications in  Conservation  USDA Results  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Technology  Feb 03,  In the 151 years since the U.S. Department of Agriculture was founded, America's oldest industry has evolved to meet the changing needs of our modern agricultural landscape. From growing overseas markets, building a 21st century rural infrastructure, and finding ways to address the challenges of climate change, USDA has worked beside farmers, businesses, and community leaders to streamline programs and spur innovative solutions for today's challenges. For USDA, that also means looking inward and changing the way we do business. We have done this by designing initiatives that collectively utilize the full scope of our mission, better focusing resources and staff across the Department to meet the needs of the communities we serve using modern tools, technology, and processes. USDA's recently expanded StrikeForce for Rural Growth and Opportunity initiative illustrates this trend with a broad commitment to rally available tools and technical assistance to combat persistent poverty in rural communities in 20 states. Our Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative aims to support the rapidly expanding local and regional food market with new products and services, as well as tailored cross-agency web resources and that illustrate opportunities and promote local and regional food systems. And finally, through the Blueprint for Stronger Service, USDA responded to the uncertain fiscal environment by streamlining mission critical work and taking a close look at operations to find ways to cut costs and modernize processes to be better stewards of taxpayer dollars - with great results. Over the next month we'll share more about the ways that USDA has evolved to meet the needs of modern agriculture in America. We'll use hashtag  on social media to share these stories, but we want to hear from you too. In the video above, Secretary Vilsack asked you to lend your voice to our collective story of how YOUR community has evolved to meet the needs of the 21st century. A new hospital?

"NASS, Outreach and Diversity Director in  Research and Science  Mar 27,   For a decade, USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service and community-based organizations (CBOs) have placed a high priority on improving the cover­age and response of minority and hard-to-reach farm and ranch operators in the Census of Agriculture. CBOs partner with NASS to help reach these underserved agricultural producers and encourage them to participate in the Census. As the CBOs educate and motivate the producers they serve to complete their Census forms, these producers become part of the that represent the accurate picture of agriculture across the nation. The partnerships are serving both the CBOs’ mission of providing service to every producer and NASS’s goal of counting every farmer and rancher in the Census of Agriculture. In the following blog, one of NASS’s longstanding CBO partners, Ralph Paige, shares his thoughts on the importance of the ongoing Census of Agriculture. The Census of Agriculture is Your Voice for Our Future By Ralph Paige, Executive Director, Federation of Southern Cooperatives There is little rest for America’s farmers and ranchers this spring. We must ensure our voices are heard and the future of our farms are represented by responding to the Census of Agriculture. As organizations such as the Federation of Southern Cooperatives work to develop, advocate and support public policies to benefit black and other family farmers in low income rural communities, there is no better time than the present to share the story of America’s black and African American farmers. One of the best ways to do this is to respond to the Census. The U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census first counted minority farm operators in for the 12th decennial census of population. Over the past century special efforts have been made to improve coverage of minority farm operators in the Census. The last Census of Agriculture counted 41,024 black operators on 32,ates. The number of black producers grew by 9 percent from , and the number of black women farm operators grew by 53 percent. As we look to the future, we wonder what the Census of Agriculture will reveal about black and African American farmers and the contribution they make to America’s food and fiber system. Knowing that information from the Census of Agriculture is used to shape local, state and national farm services, programs and policies, it’s vital to continue to share our story and be counted. Conducted only once every five years by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, the Census provides detailed covering nearly every face and facet of U.S. agriculture. The Census of Agriculture looks at land use and ownership, production practices, expenditures and other factors that affect the way farmers strive to survive and grow in today’s world. The wealth of available from the Census includes information on small, family farms as well as large farms; information on young farmers and older farmers; and insight into traditional, rural farming versus trends in areas such as lifestyle and urban farming. The information gathered is important, so it can provide an accurate and complete picture of U.S. agriculture and those who farm America’s agricultural land. And, the information will not only tell our story today, but it help all of us plan for tomorrow. Our communities depend upon it. If you have not yet responded, I encourage you to do so today. Farmers can return their forms by mail or online by visiting, www.agcensus.usda.gov. If you have questions about the Census of Agriculture, call 1-888-4AG-STAT . The Census of Agriculture is your voice for our farming future.

"Let’s Move Faith and Communities, Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Jun 16,   Anyone can be healthy “if you eat right and try to get moving,” said a young participant in Move Across Missouri, a program developed in partnership with University of Missouri Extension 4-H and the Missouri Beef Industry Council. Move Across Missouri encourages 4-Hers to increase their physical activity and track the time they spend moving through the Presidential Active Lifestyle Award (PALA), which challenges kids to log 60 minutes of physical activity for five days out of the week for six out of eight weeks. The PALA is one of four challenges First Lady Michelle Obama has issued to communities to reverse childhood obesity through the Let’s Move! initiative. Move Across Missouri is just one of many moves 4-H is making to carry out one of its core goals: healthy living. 4-H strives to equip youth with healthy living knowledge and skills that will prepare them physically, emotionally, and socially to meet the challenges of the 21st century. With leadership from the 4-H National Headquarters, 4-H has made big strides in engaging not just folks in Missouri but 4-H’ers across the country in the PALA challenge. When the First Lady launched Let’s Move Faith and Communities on November 29, , 4-H’s Professional and Volunteer Development National Program Leader Doug Swanson, 4-H National Headquarters at the USDA, announced three ambitious commitments: Cooperative Extension Master Gardeners, with the involvement of many 4-Hers, will develop 2,600 school gardens in . Through the Master Gardener program, we anticipate that well over 650,000 pounds of fresh produce will be provided to local families who have that need.  Over 1 million young people will be involved in community gardening in some way.  Also this coming year, 4-H is committed to having 250,000 4-H youth incorporate regular physical activity into their 4-H club experiences on a yearlong basis. We anticipate that 100,000 of those youth will achieve the President’s Active Lifestyle Award.  4-H will reach all 6 million of our young people with the message that they can live a healthy life. We have set a goal to help 3 million 4-H young people develop the skills to make healthy decisions over the next three years. And 4-H is well on its way!

"New Land Ownership Add Value to Many Policy and Research Questions  Whether they farm the land themselves or rent it out to others to farm, those who own agricultural land are taking measures to keep the land in their families. This is good news for those who worry about the United States losing agricultural land to competing pressures. At USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, we just released the findings from a survey of agricultural landowners conducted earlier this year. It confirmed some things we know already and generated lots of new information that farmers, policymakers, businesses and others will use to understand more about who owns farmland, who has and will have access to farmland in the future, what kinds of conservation and production decision landowners are making, and lots more.

"National CEAP-Grazing Lands Component Leader, NRCS in  Conservation  Feb 24,  Wyoming cowboy herding beef cattle. Photo courtesy of Travis Dewitz Nature provides numerous benefits that people value. In the conservation world, we call these benefits ecosystem services. On rangelands, some ecosystem services can be bought and sold in traditional market systems – like forages, meat, and other animal products from livestock. Other ecosystem services are not typically bought or sold, but nevertheless have value – like cleaner water, better air quality, and reduced risk from drought or flood. Conservation practices can increase the value of both types of ecosystem services. But, how do we put a dollar value on non-marketable services on rangeland? And how do we tie those dollar values to USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) conservation practices? With these concepts and questions in mind, NRCS partnered with Earth Economics to do a pilot study to estimate non-market ecosystem services in the central Great Plains. Funded by the grazing land component of the Conservation Effects Assessment Project, the resulting Earth Economics study report, “Accounting for Nature’s Value with USDA-NRCS Conservation Practices in the Central Great Plains,” explains the framework and approach used to link practices to ecosystem services and put a dollar value on them. On rangelands, conservation practices can be associated with many non-market ecosystem services, such as rejuvenation of native grasses and shrubs, whose roots can trap, slow, and filter rainwater and runoff. This filtration not only improves water quality in nearby streams and rivers for downstream drinking water, irrigation, and recreation. It also protects human property from flooding and improves wildlife habitat, leading to potentially better hunting, fishing, and aesthetics. These benefits extend well beyond a ranch’s fence line. Estimating the benefits of rangeland conservation investments should include the value of both on-site and off-site ecosystem services. Putting a dollar value on these ecosystem service benefits in NRCS policy and program decisions would improve conservation outcomes and perhaps give ranchers even more incentive to adopt NRCS conservation measures. The pilot study (, 6.4 ) estimates that brush management and prescribed grazing (two commonly used NRCS rangeland practices) increased ecosystem service values by $15 million to $33 million from to , an average increase of $1.7 million to $3.6 million per year or $2.28 to $4.93 annually per acre. The ecosystem services that contributed the most to the total value were air quality (35%); water quality (19%); climate stability (12%); disaster risk reduction (10%); recreation and tourism (7%); water capture, conveyance, and supply (7%); soil retention (4%); habitat (3%); and aesthetics (3%).

"in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 24,   At USDA, we are working hard to ensure that America’s next generation has access to the healthy foods they need to grow, learn, achieve, and eventually to compete and succeed on a global stage. We are focused on feeding a healthier future, but we are also learning that the country as a whole is making the shift towards a more health-conscious society. USDA recently released a study that shows that the diets of American adults are improving. More people are reading nutrition labels and using that information to make healthier food choices at the grocery stores. We are eating out less and sitting down around the supper table with family more. At USDA, we have made it a priority to support this progress by ensuring that our programs empower the American public to make smart choices every day at school, at home and in their communities. We are offering more nutritious food options and backing that up with the best available science-based advice on what to eat and why to eat it. Our MyPlate symbol makes it easier for people to visualize what a healthy meal should like on the plate, and is being used around the country in school cafeterias, in nutrition education programs and on food packaging. Tools like the SuperTracker are helping people establish and apply proper nutrition and dietary habits in their everyday lives. We have also partnered with the Treasury and Health and Human Services Departments to help improve access to nutritious food in underserved communities. With our external and federal partners, we are supporting initiatives that expand healthy food options in communities, improve people’s ability to purchase that food, and create economic opportunities for America’s farmers and small businesses across the country. Americans now have expanded opportunity to access healthy products from local farmers and ranchers through farmers markets, thanks in part to a more than 50 percent increase in the number of markets supported by USDA. Shoppers using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits now have access to more fruits and vegetables, as a result of USDA and our partners’ concerted efforts to expand SNAP card reader technology to nearly 4,000 farmers markets across the country. Through our Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), which serves more than half of all babies born in the United States, we are ensuring that very young children get the vital nutrients they need during their most vulnerable years. Recent credit WIC for its key role in the tremendous progress we’ve in the fight against childhood obesity, as rates among low-income children are now declining for the first time since the s. Our schools are building upon that progress by serving healthier breakfasts, lunches and snacks—chock full of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy and lean protein—to students. Ninety percent of our nation’s schools are fully meeting the new nutritional standards for school meals and we expect the remainder to follow soon behind. This progress is due in part to the commitment of public and private entities—not just USDA and this Administration, but our local leader partners in schools, small businesses, and state capitols across the country—charged with implementing practical, modern policies that work out in the real world, not just inside the Beltway.

"Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE) in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Mar 24,   Dan Forgey has always had an abiding respect for the land that he’s farmed for more than 40 years, which is why, as manager of the 8,500-acre Cronin Farms in Gettysburg, South Dakota, he strives to build soil health—and yields—sustainably. First, he shifted the farm to 100 percent no-till in . Then in , after spending years developing diverse crop rotations, he received a grant from Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education, a USDA-funded grants and outreach program, to test the introduction of cover crops into his system. This move has given him higher yields with fewer inputs, and therefore better profits. Dan Forgey builds soil health naturally by using diverse crop rotations, cover crops and no-till, thereby reducing his reliance on chemical inputs. Photo courtesy The Furrow Magazine (John Deere Co.). “This is what the country needs. Between cover crops and no-till we are doing things to better the soil nature’s way,” Forgey says. Over the years, Forgey has diversified the farm to include 12 crops—including grains, oilseed crops and forages for his 750-head cow-calf operation. He plants them in long rotations in order to combat weeds, which present a major challenge in no-till systems. His SARE-funded cover crop research showed that a mix of turnips, cowpeas and lentils increased corn yields by 18-20 bushels per acre compared to control plots. Now, Forgey is helping other growers adopt the soil-building strategies. Potter County, where he lives, and nearby Sully County have become a hotbed of no-till in the last 20 years, where an estimated 80-90 percent of growers now use the practice. But cover crops have been slower to catch on, partly because not enough growers have demonstrated which covers work well in local growing conditions. Forgey has worked hard to share his success with cover crops with neighbors. He has conducted on-farm tours, held field days, spoken at regional conferences and recently been profiled in the national agricultural media. Many of his neighbors have taken notice. Seven producers—their operations ranging in size from 3,500 to 18,000 acres—planted cover crops for the first time in after seeing Forgey’s plots. To hear Forgey’s story in his own words, check out the recently-published video series about Cronin Farms, produced by SARE and Cooking Up a Story.

"Minnesota USDA Public Information Officer in  USDA Results  Rural  May 23,   Walking through AGCO’s campus in Jackson, Minn., almost feels like walking through a small city. There are large buildings, busy people heading in different directions, vehicles humming up and down roads and the constant buzz of activity and production. If AGCO was its own city, it’d be growing. Officials from USDA Rural Development and Federated Rural Electric Cooperative recently visited AGCO to highlight how a Rural Economic Development Loan is partially financing an expansion project that will increase production and create about 200 jobs. The no-interest, 10-year loan is going toward a new 75,000 square-foot addition that will add a state-of-the-art visitor’s center and additional production space. The expansion is helping AGCO roll out production of the Massey Ferguson series and the Challenger MT600 series of high horsepower wheeled tractors. “We’re a part of the community here in Jackson and we’re proud to be expanding and adding more jobs in the region,” said Eric Fisher, AGCO’s Director of Operations. AGCO’s workforce is expected to grow from 850 to almost 1,100. The company is currently producing about 50 tractors per month of the new series.  Combined with current tractor production volumes the company will product over 2,500 tractors in Jackson this year. USDA Rural Development makes loans to local utility cooperatives which are passed through and re-loaned to area businesses for expansion and job creation projects. Federated Rural Electric and Rural Development have a strong partnership and have teamed to assist several local businesses in the region.

"Deputy Under Secretary of Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  Feb 11,  USDA Deputy Undersecretary Ann Mills (ninth from left) visits with Leopold Conservation Award winners at USDA last week. USDA photo. “Water conservation begins where the first drop of rain falls…most likely on private working lands.” This is a favorite saying of Tom Vandivier, a Texas cattle rancher and recipient of the Sand County Foundation’s Leopold Conservation Award (LCA). Tom was one of more than two dozen recipients of the LCA – which recognized landowners for achievement in environmental improvement on agricultural land – in Washington, D.C. last week.  I was fortunate to meet with them here at USDA headquarters to talk about the importance of conservation and the need to spread the message that investing in conservation practices on our farm and ranch lands not only protects water, air and wildlife – it also makes economic sense. Jill Giacomini Basch is a LCA recipient who, with her father and three sisters, owns a family dairy in Marin County, Calif.  I had a chance to meet with the Giacomini family during my tour of several California farms last month. Jill explained that conservation improves the way they run their business. Partnerships with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and others have helped them protect their land and water resources, and ensure their dairy will be prosperous for the next generation. “We have very close ties with NRCS and other programs,” Jill said. “They have helped us with our water allocation -- above ground storage pond facilities and spring well drilling.  With the USDA we were able to utilize new technology to install a methane digester to help mitigate waste run off into the nearby lagoon, but also eventually the Point Reyes National Seashore.  Because of the methane digester, we generate about 65 percent of our on farm energy needs.” “Much of the work we’ve done has been through NRCS programs,” Tom added. “NRCS is very important to us.  We’re very much about conservation. The stewardship practices that we’ve accomplished on our property have enhanced water resources in the state of Texas.  I think it’s a message that needs to be spread so others can take similar stewardship practices and hopefully have the same results in their perspective states.” Jon Bednarski, LCA recipient, shared his story as well.  He started farming 12 years ago outside of Louisville, Ky.  After meeting with NRCS, he discovered he was farming a “sensitive” piece of land, upstream of Louisville’s drinking water source. Since then he has managed his operation to help protect water quality. The group discussed the need for conservation in the face of extreme weather – including the significant drought conditions in 11 western states.  As we were meeting, the U.S. Senate was in the process of voting on the Agricultural Act of . I talked about how important this legislation is to providing the tools and programs necessary for USDA to help farmers, ranchers and forestland owners manage the risk and uncertainty associated with extreme weather and climate change.  Conservation programs will be streamlined to better target limited resources to areas of highest need, while building on record conservation and stewardship efforts already underway.  I also previewed Secretary Tom Vilsack’s announcement of USDA’s new regional hubs to help agriculture and forestry mitigate the impacts of a changing climate. The group also discussed the importance of passing on to the next generation the passion for agriculture and land stewardship.  There is a new energy in America around opportunities in agriculture. The Agricultural Act of will provide our communities with additional support to attract new economic opportunity and create jobs.  We all agreed that outreach and education is crucial.  USDA will continue to work with the LCA recipients and other partners to make that happen.  To view a video about the meeting click here.

"Special Assistant to the Deputy Administrator, AMS Livestock, Poultry and Seed Program in  Food and Nutrition  Nov 13,  Highly prized for its rich flavor, Wagyu beef is among the finest beef in the world. USDA’s certification programs have successfully helped the industry market its brands with USDA integrity for over twenty years. Photo courtesy Premshree Pillai. Used with permission. When consumers hear the term Kobe, the first thought that comes to mind is typically not a city in Japan, but rather a juicy steak right off the grill.  Kobe beef is globally renowned for its rich flavor, juiciness, and tenderness or high marbling content.  Kobe beef is cuts of beef from the Tajima strain of Wagyu cattle (which mean Japanese cattle), raised in Kobe, Japan.  But did you know you can find Kobe-style beef produced right here in the United States? Since , U.S. producers have worked to offer American Kobe-style beef that features the same characteristics, marbling and flavor that defines Japan’s Kobe beef by bringing herds of Kryoshi and Akaushi breeds of Wagyu cattle to the United States.  The same closed herd and multi-trait selection process used for Kobe beef was adopted and is now used by various U.S. trade associations (American Akaushi Association, the American Wagyu Association, and the Texas Wagyu Association) that promote and uphold the industry standards. Highly prized for their rich flavor, these cattle produce what some would argue is among the finest beef in the world. USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) provides certification services to beef producers for a number of marketing programs making labeling claims concerning breed of cattle and carcass characteristics, including American Kobe-style beef. These characteristics go beyond the requirements for the official USDA grades and are often the basis for approval of meat product labels making marketing claims. AMS created specifications to assist breed associations and processing entities to market branded products to consumers.  For the American Kobe-style beef specifications, AMS worked with our industry partners at Heart Brand Beef, Clear Creek Farms, American Certified Kobe Beef/Certified Wagyu Beef, Morgan Davis International Wagyu Beef, and Rosewood Wagyu Beef. AMS certification programs assure consumers that the products they purchase meet specified requirements and provide USDA’s quality stamp of approval. Our certification programs have successfully helped the industry market its brands with integrity for over twenty years.  Many companies across the U.S. have had their Kobe-style American beef certified through AMS, assisting them in marketing their products. Wagyu cattle have been extensively studied in Japan and in the United States, and university studies have shown that marbling in Wagyu beef has a composition that is significantly lower in saturated fat and cholesterol and higher in omega monounsaturated fatty acid.  AMS is proud to help consumers all over the world enjoy the elegance and excellence of American Kobe-style beef.

"Deputy Administrator of the National Organic Program in  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Dec 20,  Expanding trade for U.S. organic products—like the carrots pictured above—creates opportunities for small businesses and increases jobs for Americans who grow, package, ship and market their organic products. This is the fourteenth installment of the Organic 101 series that explores different aspects of the USDA organic regulations. Are you a certified organic operation looking to increase your market presence? USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) recently published two fact sheets that explain the basics of importing and exporting organic products to assist organic producers and processors in accessing new markets for their products. Expanding trade for U.S. organic products creates opportunities for small businesses and increases jobs for Americans who grow, package, ship and market organic products. During this Administration, USDA has streamlined trade with multiple foreign governments. Trade partnerships allow U.S. organic products to be sold as organic in multiple countries, including Canada, the European Union (EU), Japan, and Taiwan without maintaining certification to multiple standards. Many additional countries accept USDA organic products without a specific trade partnership.  Thanks to these partnerships, U.S. organic operations can tap into many larger international markets. U.S. organic exports to Japan are currently estimated at $80 million, with growth due to the partnership expected to reach at least $250 million in 10 years.  In , the U.S. exported around $73 million of organic products to the EU and close to $2 billion to Canada.  Organic import and export is published online by USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and you can also build customized . Imported products must be certified in one of two ways to be sold as organic in the United States. First, products can be certified to the USDA organic regulations through the traditional certification process. USDA authorizes organizations around the world to certify farms and businesses. Secondly, the U.S. currently accepts most products certified to the Canadian, European Union, or Japanese organic standards. In addition to organic requirements, traded agricultural products must meet all general or commodity-specific import and export requirements for the destination country. The requirements for importing and exporting organic products vary by country. For example, general requirements for organic products imported to the U.S. include: Labeling. Organic products sold in the U.S. must meet all USDA organic labeling requirements. Import Codes. For certain organic products, traders must use harmonized tariff schedule codes for tracking purposes. Grading. Imported and exported agricultural commodities must often meet product size, grade, quality, and maturity requirements through AMS grading services. Health Inspection: Shipments must include permits, sanitary certificates, and phytosanitary certificates to ensure the product is healthy and free from pests. Meat, Poultry, and Processed Egg Products. USDA only allows imported meat, poultry, and processed egg products from countries with inspection standards equivalent to U.S. standards. Through trade partnerships, consumers benefit from a wider range of organic products year-round. The United States and our many trade partners are committed to ensuring that all traded organic products meet the terms of the partnerships, retaining their organic integrity from farm to market.

"Louisiana's ""Teddy Bear"" is Making a Comeback  On the brink of extinction in , the Louisiana black bear was added to the threatened and endangered species list. At the time of listing, more than 80 percent of suitable Louisiana black bear habitat was lost. The bottomland hardwood forests of the Louisiana Delta were cleared for row crop production; roads, homes and towns were built; and humans began encountering the shy, but curious, Louisiana black bear more often. The habitat fragmentation, or isolation of suitable patches of hardwood bottoms, affected the bears’ ability to travel for food, to find mates or simply to relocate to a more desirable spot to live.   Sarah Haymaker, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Louisiana  Posted in  Conservation  Jun 11,   2 Responses",What conservation efforts are being made to protect the Louisiana black bear and its habitat in the bottomland hardwood forests of the Louisiana Delta?,"Unfortunately, there is no specific information provided about ongoing conservation efforts or what efforts were made previously.

"Administrator, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Initiatives  Research and Science  Mar 15,   This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the U.S. Department of Agriculture blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the agency’s rich science and research portfolio. During this week – National Agriculture Week—agriculture groups all across the country are coming together to recognize and promote agriculture’s numerous contributions to society. National Agriculture Week also gives the farm community an opportunity to reach out to students and educators to reinforce the importance of agricultural education in the classroom.  To that end, new classroom lesson plans that meet National Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources standards along with outreach kits are available to teachers and students. As the Administrator of the United States Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), I have a deep passion for the importance of math and statistics in everyday life. My experiences with the U.S. Census Bureau and the United Kingdom’s Office for National Statistics have instilled the need to promote education on surveys and to all ages. Recently, I was personally involved with the Census at School project and have worked to expand it to the United States. This interactive project gives students the opportunity to conduct their own survey and then access and analyze the responses from different countries. Working on this project, gave me a great opportunity to collaborate with education leaders around the country and contribute to their efforts of bringing first-class education to the classrooms. At NASS we have a strong commitment to helping students better understand agriculture through statistics and the importance of statistics to the farming community, rural America, and society as a whole. Our agency has partnered with the National FFA to develop curricula using the current Census of Agriculture . These lessons plans are aimed at students from kindergarten level through 12th grade. We strongly encourage all students and educators to tap into these valuable resources. The materials are all free of charge and are available online via the NASS website and the FFA Learning Center.

"Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  May 11,   This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA's rich science and research portfolio. When Americans think of the United States Department of Agriculture, they understandably think about the millions of farmers and ranchers who produce our food, feed, fiber, and fuel - the most productive in the world. But there is another group of Americans directly impacted by the work of USDA - the millions of our children who are fed through our child nutrition programs such as the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. A recent study sponsored by the Food and Nutrition Service examined how well schools across the country met USDA nutrition standards for key nutrients like protein, calcium, and vitamin C.  Several of us at the USDA Economic Research Service realized that we could use that same set to look at the characteristics of schools that met the fat requirements and, more importantly, what successful steps some schools are taking to do just that. The set is small, but it is nationally representative.  We found many statistically significant associations between fat content and school policies despite the small nature of the sample. A number of school policies and practices were associated with lower fat lunches: * participation in programs that promote fresh fruits and vegetables or locally grown food; * providing low-fat milk as the only milk choice; * eliminating French fries or dessert from the menus; * eliminating vending machines in middle and high schools; and * excluding a la carte foods from elementary school menus. The meal planning method also showed a pattern. In the traditional “food-based” method, each meal must consist of certain food item categories (e.g., meat, vegetable, starch). Some schools have moved to a nutrient-based method that plans meals according to nutrient content. And some have opted for an intermediate, “enhanced food-based” plan that combines the food-based method with more fruits, vegetables, and grains. The traditional meal planning method was used more by schools with the highest fat content. The only school characteristic that was strongly associated with lower fat meals was being in an urban location compared to a suburban or rural one. The strength of so many associations between school food policies and lunch fat content provide some interesting food for thought in addressing current concerns about nutrition for children.

"Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  USDA Results  May 23,  Eric Luebehusen, agricultural meteorologist for USDA’s Office of Chief Economist and World Agricultural Outlook Board details the creation of the United States Drought Monitor to a White House Water Summit attendee. Communities across the United States are facing water challenges, impacting millions of lives and costing billions of dollars in damages. Recent events, including record-breaking drought in the West and severe flooding in the Southeast have elevated a national dialogue on the state of our Nation’s water resources and infrastructure. These challenges are why on March 22, the White House hosted a Water Summit to correspond with the United Nations World Water Day.  The meeting raised awareness of water issues and highlighted potential solutions to building a sustainable and secure water future. Following a slate of presentations outlining innovative solutions to water quality and quantity challenges, attendees were invited to review interactive demonstrations of projects including technologies that help communities and businesses manage the challenges of long term drought. Eric Luebehusen, agricultural meteorologist for USDA’s Office of Chief Economist and World Agricultural Outlook Board, gave a live demonstration of the making of the United States Drought Monitor (USDM). The USDM is a groundbreaking product that has been used by the Department as a trigger mechanism for providing billions of dollars in USDA emergency aid to farmers and ranchers. As one of two USDA authors of the USDM, Luebehusen highlighted the various types of used by the authors and the partnerships that have developed across the Federal government through the years to strengthen this unique tool. He also provided insight into the substantial role that USDA played in migrating the USDM from a hand-drawn map, to one based in a state-of-the- art Geographical Information System (GIS). Participants saw detailed assessments of the drought in their home states as Luebehusen explained the products that best describe the current level of drought in their particular locales. For example, in California, USDM authors use snowpack measurements and reservoir levels to accurately track drought.  In other regions, different measurements like 3-month rainfall accumulation, might be provide a more accurate depiction of drought conditions. “I was very pleased with the amount of interest and interaction our US Drought Monitor display generated,” said Luebehusen. “We actually had folks from multiple states come up to our display and comment on the current drought depiction, with some going so far as to offer some feedback and suggestions for this week’s map!” “I concur with Eric’s sense of pride with USDA’s role in shaping the Drought Monitor over the years.  Several of the attendees expressed their gratitude that we take the time to produce such an important product. The Department itself shows its confidence in the product by using it as a trigger mechanism for multi-billion dollar programs,” said Mark Brusberg, Deputy Chief Meteorologist in USDA’s Office of Chief Economist. USDA has been at the forefront of transitioning the US Drought Monitor to a state of the art Geographic Information System. The USDM is jointly produced by the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the National Drought Mitigation Center. Since the inception of the USDM in the late s, the USDA Drought Monitor Team has been at the forefront of acquisition, building partnerships with providers of information to both ensure the sustainability of necessary products and facilitate creation of new types of information useful to the drought communities.  Several of these partnerships were on display at the USDA booth, including the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail, and Snow (CoCoRaHS) Network, an example of effective collection by citizen scientists through a coordinated volunteer network. “At the USDA, we take a great deal of pride in our contributions to the Drought Monitor, not only from an authoring perspective, but also from a developmental perspective, spearheading the effort to get the Drought Monitor based on a much more dynamic Geographic Information System Platform,” said Luebehusen. The United States Drought Monitor is just one of the important ways USDA uses state of the art and research to support communities facing water quantity and quality challenges due to changing climate and extreme weather. The White House Water Summit served as an important platform to highlight the ongoing work of the federal family in bringing modern solutions to water challenges now and into the future.

This was one of the many cool facts that kids and adults learned perusing the USDA exhibits at the USA Science & Engineering Festival this past weekend.   I joined thousands of people during this three-day event designed to revive interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and promote careers in those fields. Innovation is the foundation for new products and processes in agriculture and relies heavily on a solid knowledge base of STEM subjects.  For USDA, educating our next generation of innovators is a top priority.  Supporting the Administration’s goal to invest in our youth, USDA contributed about $92.5 M in towards the federal STEM investment.  There have been great achievements made in agriculture science, but many challenges remain, including food security, helping farmers adapt to variable weather conditions and maintaining a clean, safe water supply.  In order to meet our future food and agricultural challenges, we need to train more students in the STEM subjects to keep up with our scientific needs. USDA employees from the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Forest Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) enthusiastically volunteered their time at the festival.  Many participants visited the USDA exhibits -- answering trivia questions, learning about termites, inquiring about careers at USDA and getting to see how well someone really washes their hands. Deputy Under Secretary Ann Bartuska talks with kids and parents about the value of Ag Education Whatever the motivation, observing thousands of kids and adults getting ""into” science, makes me confident that we are science strong in Washington, D.C.  USDA science agencies are committed to delivering on their mission to help ensure a healthy, productive, safe and sustainable food and agricultural system, while protecting our healthy and our precious natural resources. Whether it’s developing our youth in programs like 4-H or empowering students through higher education by providing scholarships and post-doctoral fellowships, USDA will continue to encourage students to pursue careers in science.

"Counselor for Agricultural Affairs-Vietnam, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Nov 18,  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack (right) speaking at Hanoi University of Agriculture, Hanoi, Vietnam on Wednesday, November 16, . There are many things that Americans are known for, including dreaming big, working hard to turn those dreams into a reality, and reaching out to help others who are also trying to make their dreams come true. During his trip to Hanoi, Vietnam, earlier this week, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack—whose own personal story and history of public service epitomizes these very characteristics—challenged a packed auditorium of more than 600 students and faculty at the Hanoi University of Agriculture (HUA) to be the generation whose dreams transform their communities, their country and their world. HUA, Vietnam’s oldest and largest agricultural university, was the perfect setting for this message, as many of its alumni have been instrumental in helping Vietnam transform in just 25 years from a food aid recipient to one of the world’s top agricultural producers and exporters. In fact, Vietnam is one of the world’s fastest growing economies and an important market for U.S. agricultural products. In the past decade, Vietnam jumped from the fiftieth to fifteenth position as a market for U.S. farm exports. At the same time, the United States has become a growing market for Vietnamese goods such as rice, coffee, cashew, spices and seafood. Two-way trade between the United States and Vietnam is strong for each partner. Although Vietnam no longer faces the problem of chronic food shortages, Secretary Vilsack reminded the students that new threats to the country’s food supply—whether from the impact of climate change to the decimation of crops and livestock through disease—needed to be anticipated, countered and controlled. “What is the best way to do that?” asked the Secretary. Embrace science—just like Dr. Norman Borlaug. When Secretary Vilsack told the capacity crowd about Dr. Borlaug’s green revolution, the estimated 1 billion lives he saved, and the World Food Prize he established, you could almost feel the dreams taking flight from the eager students. Secretary Vilsack closed his remarks by challenging the audience to aspire to make a difference, not by dreaming of things as they are, but as they should be. I know that somewhere in that auditorium, someone is going to do just that. Note: Vilsack is visiting with Asian Pacific partners in Vietnam and China to help strengthen trade relations and support the American brand throughout the region.

"-Reed, Deputy Administrator, Agricultural Research Service and Dr. Melanie Abley, Senior Advisor, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Jan 21,  USDA is collaborating with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the Closer to Zero (C2Z) initiative. C2Z provides a crucial framework for the work that must be done to reduce heavy metal content in foods, but particularly in foods consumed by infants and children, our most vulnerable group. USDA has a wealth of expertise to support FDA in solving this challenge that impacts all Americans. The Agricultural Research Service studies every facet of how plants uptake heavy metals from the soil so that we can find ways to mitigate heavy metals in foods to the greatest extent possible. The National Institute for Food and Agriculture’s vast partner and stakeholder network plans to collaborate in developing and sharing targeted communications on how women who are pregnant and/or lactating, infants, and young children can reduce their exposure to toxic elements in foods. Its investments in agricultural research, education, and extension will help develop -driven approaches to reduce toxic elements in the food production system. The Food Safety and Inspection Service will provide essential oversight for assessing metal contamination in foods. FSIS serves as a critical link in notifying appropriate USDA and FDA offices if elevated levels of a concerning substance are detected in food. As part of their overall mission, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) encourages consumers to follow a healthy dietary pattern, which is important at every stage of life. The benefits of a balanced diet can help minimize adverse effects of consuming excess of any one food. FNS continues to coordinate with its FDA partners to ensure that USDA nutrition assistance program policies, guidance, and education are informed by current food safety regulations and guidance. As USDA continues its focus on ensuring all Americans have access to nutritious and safe foods, Closer to Zero efforts bring us closer to that goal.

It doesn’t matter whether or not they have experience in agriculture -- if they are passionate about making a career in agriculture, we want to help them achieve their goal. Prime examples of this are the employees who are in the pilot year of our Agricultural Commodity Grader Apprenticeship. Half of the participants came from careers that were far removed from agriculture: Charles Horton is a retired Air Force master sergeant. He served as an aircraft machinist and welder for 24 years. Paul Derdzinski was an Army ammunition specialist who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. The former staff sergeant has a Bachelor of Science in Information Security and Risk Management. Jeff Dezort was an artillery cannoneer for four years in the Marine Corps. He served in Iraq, and when his term of service ended, he worked as a Department of Defense contractor in Kuwait. He then went to college and earned his Bachelor of Science in Management. The apprenticeship program is only one of many ways for America’s veterans to join our ranks. More information about opportunities available at AMS can be found on the Careers page of our website. USDA also works with federal partners like the Department of Labor (DOL), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense to inform our service members about the wide variety of loans, grants, training and technical assistance for Veterans who are interested in agriculture. Relationships with organizations like the Farmer-Veteran Coalition and Hiring Our Heroes opens the agriculture industry and the thousands of high-skilled jobs to veterans. Again, we thank you for your service to America. At AMS, we are especially proud that many of you have chosen USDA to continue that service.

"Public Affairs Intern, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 20,   One of our Nation's most pressing health challenges today is obesity with one in three children in America either overweight or obese.  Low-income individuals are particularly at-risk.  That’s why First Lady Michelle Obama launched Let’s Move! The campaign mobilizes the combined resources of the federal government, state and local governments, foundations, business and nonprofit organizations to help solve the problem of childhood obesity within a generation so that children born today will reach adulthood at a healthy weight and live healthier lives. The recently announced Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP) in Massachusetts will empower low-income Americans to eat more nutritious food and has the potential to strengthen the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program that serves as a critical safety net to the most vulnerable in our society. The Food and Nutrition Service and First Lady Obama believe increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, especially in the place of higher calorie foods, can help move America towards healthier lifestyles and a healthier future.  The Farm Bill authorized $20 million for pilot projects to evaluate health and nutrition promotion in the SNAP.  Through HIP, FNS will be able to determine if incentives provided to recipients at the point-of-sale increase the purchase of fruits, vegetables or other healthful foods among SNAP participants. The evaluation of this pilot, still in the early development stages, will offer solid evidence on whether a financial incentive can influence fruit and vegetable purchases and consumption.  The Healthy Incentives Pilot will enroll 7,500 randomly selected SNAP households to receive incentives. For every dollar participants spend on fruits and vegetables using their SNAP Electronic Benefit Transfer cards, 30 cents will be added to their benefit balance - thus cutting the cost of fruits and vegetables by almost one-third. Hampden County, Massachusetts was chosen to be the first county in America to use the HIP.  Massachusetts was selected competitively due to its broad pilot proposal that included very thorough and strong design, implementation, staffing and management plans. Hampden County is a mix of 27 urban, rural, and suburban cities with a total of 50,000 SNAP households.  The majority of recipients are concentrated in the areas of Springfield, Holyoke, and Chicopee.  Massachusetts will begin operating the pilot in the fall of .

"Family Farm Co-op in Missouri Shows Commitment to Food Safety  For more than four generations, Amish farmers in the Kansas City area have abided by a simple tenet:  farm sustainably and care for the earth to preserve their way of life for future generations.  Good Natured Family Farms (GNFF), a cooperative of 18 Amish family farms in Missouri, is using GroupGAP, a new USDA audit program, to help them safeguard their future by building strong markets for the high-quality, local foods they produce. In August, the group made USDA history as the first to receive an official USDA Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) certification through our new GroupGAP program. Since , the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has provided the traditional USDA GAP audit program to the fruit and vegetable industry. GAP is a voluntary program that verifies its participants follow U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and industry best practices to minimize risks of food safety hazards when producing, handling, and storing fruits, vegetables, and other specialty crops.

"in  Conservation  Dec 06,   America’s farmers, ranchers and landowners have led the way in recent years to conserve and protect our soil, water and wildlife habitat. With the help of Farm Bill programs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has worked with a record number of producers since – more than 500,000 of them – to get this important work done. Ever since the Dust Bowl, we’ve known that investments in conservation on working lands and other wild areas is important. And this week, a new report amplified our understanding for the critical importance of the Farm Bill in protecting natural resources in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. The report showed that over the past seven years, conservation efforts have reduced the amount of nitrogen leaving fields by 48.6 million pounds each year – about 26 percent – and reducing phosphorus by 7.1 million pounds, or 46 percent. These conservation practices are also preventing soil erosion, helping to ensure that our farm fields across the Chesapeake Bay Watershed remain vibrant and productive in the years to come. Conservation practices have lowered the estimated amount of eroded soil by about 15.1 million tons every year, or 60 percent. Put another way, that’s enough soil to fill about 150,000 railcars. In addition to ensuring healthy cropland and clean water, these programs strengthen wildlife habitat that boosts outdoor recreation. From hunting and fishing, to camping and hiking, outdoor recreation adds more than $640 billion in benefits to our economy each year. The Chesapeake Bay watershed initiative is just one of many landscape-scale initiatives undertaken by USDA in recent years. From the Mississippi River Basin to the Ogallala Aquifer, USDA has worked with producers to enroll millions of acres in targeted landscape initiatives – and today’s report once again highlights the positive impact this work can have across the nation. From clean soil to healthier water, the benefits of conservation impact every American – and they’re one reason why USDA is pressing Congress this fall to provide a comprehensive, multiyear Food, Farm and Jobs Bill that continues our record conservation efforts. A new Farm Bill would continue targeted conservation efforts on working lands that ensure soil quality, water quality, erosion control, forest restoration, and wildlife habitat.  It would continue major working land programs such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and Conservation Stewardship Program, through which USDA has provided more than 190,000 landowner contracts since , as well as the Conservation Reserve Program under which we have held a signup each year during this Administration. A new Farm Bill would also ensure that tens of millions of acres remain in conservation practices by linking crop insurance compliance to conservation program participation. Across the nation, our farmers, ranchers and landowners are stepping up to protect our natural resources. They deserve our support – and the most important thing that can happen today is for Congress to achieve passage of a new Food, Farm and Jobs Bill that stands by producers and continues our long legacy of conservation.

"Conservation Innovation Grants to help improve technologies and approaches for natural resource conservation  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .14  Contact:Sarah Maxwell 720-  AudioMOLINE, Ill., Sept. 15, - Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced today the award of $15.7 million in Conservation Innovation Grants (CIGs) to 47 organizations that will help develop and demonstrate cutting-edge ideas to accelerate innovation in private lands conservation. The Secretary made the announcement while visiting a farm in Illinois.""These grants promote creativity and problem-solving efforts that benefit farmers and ranchers and protect our natural resources,"" Vilsack said. ""They're critical in sparking new ideas and techniques for conservation on America's private lands and improving the environment.""The grants announced today are funded through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program. Grantees must work with producers and forestland owners to develop and demonstrate the new technologies and approaches. At least 50 percent of the total cost of CIG projects must come from non-federal matching funds, including cash and in-kind contributions provided by the grant recipient.Vilsack made the announcement while visiting a corn and soybean farm owned by David and Tamara Erickson and their sons, Nicholas and Bradley. The Ericksons have a five-year Conservation Stewardship Program contract with USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service and have also received technical assistance from NRCS. The Secretary saw soil conservation practices including ""no till"" and grassed waterways to reduce runoff. He viewed soil cores which demonstrate the benefits of efforts to improve soil health.The National Corn Growers Association and the National Association of Conservation Districts, both involved with conservation activities in Illinois, are receiving grant awards to demonstrate the use of best management practices such as conservation tillage, cover crops and advanced nutrient management to address soil health concerns. Almost half of the grants announced today support the agency's priority of getting more conservation on the ground by improving the health of our nation's soils. The National Corn Growers Association will receive almost $1 million to promote soil management practices aimed at improving productivity, profitability and environmental outcomes in seven states. The National Association of Conservation Districts will receive $750,000 to fund a project to significantly increase the number of farmed acres nationwide (including Illinois) that are successfully managed for soil health.Other organizations, tribes and academic institutions will receive funding for conservation projects. For example, the University of California will receive almost $229,000 for the second phase of a project to support using native bees to supplement crop pollination. Montana State University will receive $50,000 to study ways to improve sage grouse chick and brood survival. The University of Missouri will receive almost $368,000 to work on an energy recovery system that field tests show could reduce energy consumption in poultry houses by 40-50 percent. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University will receive almost $382,000 to continue to develop procedures to improve soil health and increase the acreage being managed with conservation tillage practices. In Arizona, the Navajo Nation will receive over $28,000 for mule deer conservation efforts, and the First Nations Development Institute will receive almost $69,000 to develop a conservation planning process, led by Navajo livestock producers on the Navajo Reservation.Seven of the approved grants support conservation technologies and approaches to help farmers and ranchers who historically have not had equal access to agricultural programs because of race or ethnicity, or who have limited resources, or who are beginning farmers and ranchers.A full list of recipients is available here: in the following States were selected for awards: Ala., Alaska, Ariz., Ark., Calif., Colo., Fla., Ga., Hawaii, Idaho, Ill., Ind., Iowa, Kan., La., Minn., Miss., Mont., Mo., N.C., N.D., Neb., N.Y., Ohio, Okla., Ore., Penn., S.C., Tenn., Texas, Utah, Va., Vt., W.Va., Wash., Wis., and also the District of Columbia.Soil health is the foundation and future of sustainable agriculture, enabling producers to fare better against drought and other climatic extremes while increasing production. They have greater water holding capacity, increase water infiltration, reduce soil erosion, decrease soil compaction, improve crop productivity, and improve our natural resource condition.NRCS has offered this grant program since , investing in ways to demonstrate and transfer efficient and environmentally friendly farming and ranching. In the past years, the grants have helped develop trading markets for water quality and have shown how farmers and ranchers may use fertilizer, water and energy more efficiently. Since through this year's funding, 323 projects were or are slated to be awarded for a total $126 million investment in novel conservation.To enhance the value and adoption of previous CIG results, a new search tool is available on the website for past awarded projects.For more on this grant program, visit USDA's Conservation Innovation Grants webpage.The announcement of today's funding was made possible by the Farm Bill. The Farm Bill builds on historic economic gains in rural America over the past five years, while achieving meaningful reform and billions of dollars in savings for taxpayers. Since enactment, USDA has made significant progress to implement each provision of this critical legislation, including providing disaster relief to farmers and ranchers; strengthening risk management tools; expanding access to rural credit; funding critical research; establishing innovative public-private conservation partnerships; developing new markets for rural-made products; and investing in infrastructure, housing and community facilities to help improve the quality of life in rural America.

"How USDA & Partners Eradicated Oriental Fruit Fly from Florida  There’s a good reason why USDA and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) constantly monitor more than 56,000 fruit fly traps they have strategically placed across Florida. An outbreak of exotic fruit flies—one of the most destructive pests of fruit and vegetables—could threaten Florida’s powerhouse agricultural industry. By detecting these pests early and responding rapidly, USDA, FDACS, county officials, and growers can avoid large-scale agricultural losses and keep valuable export markets open. In August , some of those traps captured Oriental fruit flies (OFF) in Miami-Dade County. The OFF attacks more than 430 different fruits, vegetables, and nuts, including avocado, mango, guava, papaya, and pitaya. All of these crops and more grow in the county, which is Florida’s top producer of tropical fruit, tropical vegetables, and ornamental nurseries. The county’s $1.6 billion agricultural industry supports 11,000 jobs.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Jun 25,  Temiloluwa Salako, a Cultivar with RootDownLA, shows off a grain plant called amaranth that is growing in one of the program’s community gardens. Salako was recently accepted to Pitzer College after writing an essay about his experiences with this community food project. It began with the desire of a group of South Los Angeles high school students to increase access to more effective nutrition education at their school.  They started small—a monthly guest speaker, bags of veggies, cutting boards, and nutrition education. Now, their efforts have blossomed and manifested into RootDownLA, a community food project operating in three South Los Angeles neighborhoods with the help of the youth participants, referred to as Cultivars. As a recipient of a $226,705 Community Food Project grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), this youth-driven organization works closely with members of the community to grow fresh fruits and vegetables and provide access to more quality food. The major encouragement of all of RootDown LA’s activities is for people to choose to eat good food. “In , the NIFA grant let us develop a 13-week training program that prepares youth to increase supplies of fresh food in their communities,” said Megan Hanson, RootDown LA’s executive director. “Youth trainees learn to design, install, and maintain gardens that are located in the yards of homes that neighbor their schools. These youth also distribute food from gardens within the community.” Hanson added, “We are making the consumption of fresh food a more realistic daily option for community members by growing food right in neighbors’ yards and promoting and distributing it both in and around the high schools where students and their families interact every day.” The impact also goes beyond nutrition and access to food; RootDown LA provides employment for local youth to manage activities at their various sites. Many early participants are now paid staff who handle day-to-day operations and manage youth interns and the network of neighborhood gardens. “The youth in our programs have had tremendous success demonstrating that they are completely capable of co-creating and facilitating effective nutrition, cooking, and horticultural programs that get more of their neighbors wanting to eat their veggies,” Hanson said. NIFA’s Community Food Projects Competitive Grant Program administers all community food project grants, seeking to increase self-reliance within communities, access to quality foods, community outreach, and provide assistance to projects. “There is that saying, ‘Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.’ Well, RootDown LA taught me that it’s not about how much space you have, it’s about how you use the space,” said Jocelyn Ramirez, one of RootDown LA’s Cultivars. “Why feed your lawn when your lawn can start feeding you?” NIFA’s mission: Invest in and advance agricultural research, education, and extension to solve societal challenges. NIFA’s vision: Catalyze transformative discoveries, education, and engagement to address agricultural challenges.

"in  USDA Results  Jul 14,  Tennessee Gourmet Co-Owner and Cumberland Culinary Center Manager Sue Sykes shows off new equipment purchased with help from a USDA Rural Business Enterprise Grant at Cumberland University's Cumberland Culinary Center. Born and raised in New England I can’t claim to know the finer details and intricacies of the delicious and competitive world of barbeque.  So when I came to Tennessee to highlight economic development opportunities at Cumberland University’s Cumberland Culinary Center I was pleased to see first-hand just how intense that competition can be  and how that competition is fueling small business opportunities and growth in rural Tennessee. The Cumberland Culinary Center is a community kitchen and small business incubator that has received support from USDA’s Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG) program. The center is a great example of the opportunities that exist when we brings together federal, state and local resources. The center is designed to meet the growing needs of farmers, agri-entrepreneurs and other businesses by helping them overcome the financial obstacles and start-up costs of constructing a commercial kitchen. One such entrepreneur is Ron Reed, owner and expert at Ron Reed’s Signature Barbeque Sauce Company. Ron was one of six small businesses, and four barbeque sauce companies utilizing the facility to cook and prepare his signature sauce.  Ron uses the kitchen on a basis and pays a rental fee that grants him access to equipment that would otherwise cost him tens of thousands of dollars and prevent him from pursuing his dream. The importance of these programs for developing and strengthening rural economies is clearly stated in Ron’s own words: ”USDA's commitment to the future of rural communities truly does impact folks like me. I have always had a passion for cooking and an entrepreneurial spirit. The support that the USDA has provided to the Cumberland Culinary Center has given me the opportunity to take my passion and turn it into a growing business, that one day will assist with adding jobs to our local community.” Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan joins Ron Reed at the Cumberland Culinary Center.  Now this is where the competition started to heat up. The Center is also home to another three barbeque entrepreneurs - R&R Condiments, producer of OL’ SOUTH Fine Swine Bar-B-Que Sauce, BBQ Fight Club sauces, and Smokey’s Gourmet Products, producer of Smokey Cornwall’s BBQ Sauce. Not wanting to get caught in the middle of what clearly involves a lot of time, hard work, and culinary creativity, I will leave judgment on this battle to the more seasoned barbeque connoisseurs. If you have a small business or a dream that you want to pursue, I encourage you to follow in Ron’s footsteps and reach out to your local USDA Rural Development office.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Forest Service in  Energy  Forestry  Apr 12,   The USDA Forest Service’s Fuels for Schools and Beyond program promotes and encourages the use biomass to energy as a renewable and natural resource. Recently the U.S. Forest Service recognized the Darby School District in Montana for success in the Fuels for Schools Program for their innovation, cost savings and energy efficiency and in particular Darby High School’s biomass system. It’s part of a pilot program funded by a grant from the Forest Service’s National Fire Plan. In , the Darby School District was the first in the state to have a biomass system. Since installing the biomass boiler the program has provided significant savings – up to $200,000 this past year alone helping the school system meet its yearly budget requirements. Because Darby High School has successfully demonstrated the use of forest biomass as a renewable energy source, other regions in the West have used the Darby boiler system as a best practice example. Burning wood is considered ""carbon neutral"" because, as trees grow, they pull carbon out of the atmosphere and when they die, decompose, or are burned they release that same amount of carbon. With this, there is no net gain of CO2 in the atmosphere and growing plants and trees will continue to cycle that CO2.  Compare this to the burning of fossil fuels like petroleum and natural gas, which release old carbon that has been deep in the earth for millions of years, creating a carbon imbalance in the atmosphere which contributes to global warming. By promoting and developing the utilization of forest biomass for energy, the Fuels for Schools and Beyond program achieves several goals in the national interest: Strengthens local economies. Reduces national dependency on foreign oil and non-renewable fossil fuels. Reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Provides financial incentives for treating hazardous fuels by creating markets for otherwise wasted woody material. Encourages community engagement in national forest management. Reduces and stabilizes heating costs for public facilities. Reduces air pollution from open-pile slash burning. Darby High School students learn about the biomass system, part of a pilot program funded by a grant from the Forest Service’s National Fire Plan and aid from the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation.

"Beginning Rancher Applies Tribal Traditions and USDA Risk Management Tools to Help Grow Her Business  Shawna Kalama is a proud member of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs and the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation. She’s also a beginning rancher, pursuing her dream the past few years near the Cascade Mountains on the Yakama Indian Reservation in Washington State. Kalama has successfully leveraged several USDA programs to simultaneously support both her entrepreneurial education goals and her growing livestock operation. She began earning her business degree at Heritage University, and recently participated in a risk management education program, sponsored by the USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA). This week, the agency announced that $8.7 million in cooperative agreement funding is available for the risk management education program for fiscal year .

"Climate Change Challenges Water Resources on National Forests  Most people do not realize that more than half the water in the United States comes from watersheds managed on forests. Used in homes, on ranches, in industry and for energy production, water resources in forests provide important services to people, as well as habitat for a wide variety of aquatic life. Our rapidly changing climate, however, is challenging our watersheds with both wet and dry extremes - more severe droughts, more frequent and larger floods, more soil moisture stress and lower stream flows during the dry season, less of a snowpack reservoir, and other effects. In a unique pilot project, 11 national forests around the country are assessing the vulnerability of their water resources and watersheds to such changes.

"Acting USDA Rural Development, South Dakota State Director in  Rural  Nov 18,  Winyan Toka Win Garden is a two-acre organic garden supporting the Cheyenne River Youth Project, in Eagle Butte, South Dakota. USDA celebrates National Native American Heritage Month in November with a blog series focused on USDA’s support of Tribal Nations and highlighting a number of our efforts throughout Indian Country and Alaska. Follow along on the USDA blog.  When the Cheyenne River Youth Project (CRYP) first began its organic garden in , staff members at the 26-year-old not-for-profit youth organization scarcely could have imagined where that little garden would take them. Now, 16 years later, the thriving two-acre Winyan Toka Win (“Leading Lady”) garden located in Eagle Butte, South Dakota is the beating heart of the youth project — and it’s quickly becoming a veritable micro farm. Today, sustainable agriculture at CRYP supports nutritious meals and snacks at the main youth center for children four to twelve and at the Cokata Wiconi teen center.  It also provides fresh ingredients for the seasonal Leading Lady Farmers Market. To continue pursuing the long-term vision for the initiative, CRYP has invested in a new irrigation system, a composting system and a garden redesign. The most recent garden upgrades began last fall when CRYP began the process of installing the new irrigation system, made possible through the USDA Rural Development Community Facilities program. Julie Garreau, CRYP’s executive director, said she hopes the new planting areas and water system will allow the youth project to increase its yields by up to 50 percent and also to increase outdoor-classroom use among teen interns who wish to become gardeners and farmers. The internships available for youth summer interns, ages 12-17 allow work on special wellness projects and on programs related to the two-acre, naturally grown, pesticide-free Winyan Toka Win garden. Interns commit to working a total of 60 hours at CRYP’s East Lincoln Street campus before school resumes in the fall. Thanks to funding from Diabetes Action Research (DARE) each intern receives a $500 stipend at the conclusion of his or her summer internship. Ethnobotanist Steven Bond worked closely with CRYP to design the new irrigation system and develop the new garden layout to increase production. Bond currently works for the Intertribal Agriculture Council as technical assistance specialist in the Eastern Oklahoma Region and Western Region. “Steven has a wealth of knowledge about sustainable stewardship of the land, and his input was immensely helpful in starting to design and implement an even more sustainable and productive garden at CRYP,” Garreau said. Bond has worked with CRYP in the past, discussing nutrition with staff for youth cooking classes and teaching community classes in Modern Gardening Basics and Advanced Gardening / Farming. “CRYP is a valuable resource for this community and should be considered an excellent example for other tribes and nontribal communities,” said Bond. “The Intertribal Agriculture Council was honored to be included by the youth project in its mission to increase the quality of life of children and the Cheyenne River community by providing resources and also sharing with folks ways to develop sustainable agriculture practices to generate wealth and ensure sovereignty.” By late May CRYP completed all underground installations and all new mounds. Staff, teen interns and volunteers then began planting each of the six new growing areas, complete with their drip lines and irrigation system support. By the end of summer the team had planted radishes, lettuce, squash, carrots, beets, broccoli, cabbage, tomatoes, several pepper varieties, strawberries and asparagus. CRYP closes out another successful growing season and will continue to thrive and expand thanks to hard work led by committed volunteers and staff and partnerships and resources from USDA Rural Development, South Dakota Department of Agriculture, Native Agriculture and Food Systems, Honor the Earth, Running Strong for American Indian Youth, the Wellmark Foundation, Northwest Area Foundation and the J.R. Albert Foundation. Learn more about the Cheyenne River Youth Project and its programs.

"National Forests Contribute to Alaska's Record Salmon Harvest  Alaska’s Chugach and Tongass national forests are sometimes referred to as salmon forests, producing all five species of wild Pacific salmon: king, coho, sockeye, pink, and chum. Salmon is vital to Alaska’s economy, and last year’s statewide commercial salmon harvest is being noted as a banner year. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game announced the salmon harvested in set a new record at 272 million fish. About 45 percent, or 122 million, of these commercially harvested salmon relied on habitat managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Much of the harvest consisted of pink salmon, the most abundant of salmon found in Alaska. Don Martin, the aquatic and fish program leader for the Alaska Region, said that 95 percent of the habitat where pink salmon spawn in Southeast Alaska is on the Tongass National Forest.

"USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Legislative and Public Affairs in  Animals  Plants  Sep 17,  Cows on small farm. Last year brought some interesting weather to our country. A multi-day severe weather event included an EF3 tornado that carved a 68-mile path from Mississippi to Alabama.  Parts of Colorado had flooding so severe it destroyed thousands of homes, and wiped out 200 miles of state roads and 50 state bridges.  Winter Storm Nemo dropped a record snowfall of 31.9 inches in Portland, Maine.  And, California recorded its driest year ever—fueling wildfires that burned some 8,000 acres in Southern California. Any disaster, whether it’s a flood, tornado or earthquake, can catch you off guard and leave you in danger. It’s important to have an emergency plan in place for your family. And if you raise livestock, an emergency plan is important as well.  Using the American Veterinary Medical Association’s (AVMA) procedures to prepare now, you can quickly and easily safeguard your livestock when disaster strikes. Prepare – Get a Livestock Evacuation Kit Include feed, water, supplements, supplies (medications, rope/lariat, halters/leads, cleaning supplies, knives, etc.), and papers (veterinary records and proof of ownership). Review your kit regularly to ensure contents, especially feed and medicines, are fresh. Plan – What You Will Do in an Emergency Determine if you are able to evacuate (This should be based on the type of disaster and the safety and stability of the shelter). Determine where you will go if you have to leave (Identify friends or relatives who could house livestock during the disaster, including fairgrounds or other livestock evacuation locations). Determine how you will evacuate (Decide how livestock will be transported/housed and prearrange an evacuation site).  In case you are not home: Designate a neighbor to tend to your livestock (This person should be familiar with your livestock, know your evacuation procedures, know where your evacuation kit is kept, and have your emergency contact information). Make sure livestock has some form of identification (microchip, ear/leg tag, leg band, tattoo etc.). Stay Informed—Know About Types of Emergencies It’s always a good idea to find out what types of emergencies could happen where you live and whether you need to make any specific preparations because of them. (A good basic emergency plan is to keep your livestock with you; what’s best for you is typically what’s best for your livestock. Plan to stay if it’s safe to do so, or leave if ordered to evacuate.) When disaster strikes, follow instructions of local emergency management to safeguard you, your family, and your livestock.

USDA and DHS welcomed 26 veterinarians responsible for evaluating animal disease outbreaks from 11 Spanish-speaking countries to a training called the International Transboundary Animal Disease (ITAD) Course, funded by the Organismo International Regional de Sanidad Agropecuaris (OIRSA).  The course, provided entirely in Spanish, helps familiarize veterinarians with ten of the most serious animal diseases.

"USDA Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Mar 18,  More than 4,200 markets and direct marketing farmers now redeem SNAP benefits across the country. Farmers’ market incentive programs, which couple access to healthy foods with incentives to purchase healthy products while at the market, help SNAP recipients consume a healthy diet. As spring marches closer, farmers markets across the country are ramping up or reopening for the season. In addition to year-round staples like local milk, meat, and grains, the stars of the season—asparagus, onions, new potatoes, lamb, and greens of all varieties—are beginning to make their debuts. In a few months’ time, the markets will be in full swing, bursting with berries and zucchini and other summer fruits and vegetables. Here at USDA, we’re working hard to ensure participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have access to this healthful, local bounty. Remarkable progress has been made in providing better access to the nation’s 8,200 farmers markets and farm stands; more than 4,200 markets and direct marketing farmers now redeem SNAP benefits.  Beyond providing heightened access to farmers markets, we know that coupling access with incentives to purchase healthy products while at the market helps SNAP recipients consume a healthy diet. A new report from USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service makes clear that private sector organizations share the goal of increasing access and incentives, and are willing to dedicate financial resources to ensuring the success of this approach. Researchers for the Farmers Market Incentive Provider Study interviewed representatives from more than 100 organizations that provide financial incentives to SNAP participants redeeming their benefits at farmers markets.  Wholesome Wave is a great example of a not-for-profit organization that partners with 305 farmers markets in 24 states with nutrition incentive programs for doubling SNAP, WIC, and Senior Farmers Market vouchers at farmers markets. The USDA report researched how these organizations design and run their incentive programs, how they choose markets to participate, and how they evaluate the success of their efforts. The study also identified challenges that they face; it’s no surprise that securing sustained funding topped the list. Farmer’s market incentive programs are discovering new partnerships and affinities with health care organizations, local public health efforts, philanthropies, donors, and others in support of their work.  But the need for institutional local support far exceeds current private reserves.  In that regard, I am happy to report that the new Agriculture Act of enacted and signed by President Obama provides additional support for incentive programs.  Although the details are still being finalized, the legislation includes $100 million in grant money to provide federal matching funds for incentive projects that increase the amount of fruits and vegetables bought by SNAP households.  State, local, and tribal agencies; nonprofits; SNAP-authorized retailers; and economic development agencies, among others, are eligible to apply for the grants. I’m encouraged by the efforts of the many incentive providers and partners highlighted in the study, and pleased that soon USDA will be able to contribute much needed financial resources to augment the impact of these important programs. It’s clear that in working together we can help SNAP participants fill their farmer’s market baskets with items sure to support a healthy diet and a healthy farm economy in communities across the country. And that is the kind of ‘yield’ that both farmers and consumers alike can applaud. Editor’s Note: To further enhance SNAP redemptions at farmers markets, USDA also recently funded the creation of MarketLink.org, a website that assists farmers markets in becoming SNAP-authorized and helps them determine whether they are eligible for no-cost Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) equipment.

"Communications Coordinator, USDA Office of Communications in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Feb 07,   What do dairy farmers, NFL stars, and the Secretary of Agriculture have in common? They all braved the winter weather and traveled to the site of Super Bowl XLV to support the Fuel Up to Play 60 (FUTP60) program. FUTP60 conducted a kids’ football clinic at the NFL Experience, an interactive theme park at the Dallas Convention Center. The clinic, aimed at kids,  focused on the fundamentals to improve nutrition and physical activity in their schools and personal lives. Kids from the local school district and beyond arrived at the converted Astroturf playing field, anxious to get moving. The buzz in the air wasn’t from the Katy Perry song reverberating throughout the arena; it was the excitement of kids anxiously awaiting the chance to run on the field to learn from the pros – Cowboy’s linebacker DeMarcus Ware and Colts’ wide receiver Reggie Wayne. After encouraging the kids to eat healthy and stay active, Secretary Vilsack introduced them to the dairy farmers on hand, who are working hard to provide kids across the nation with the dairy products that are so critical to a nutritious diet. While two major dairy states were represented in the Super Bowl, I have to say that it looked like more of the farmers on hand were backing the Steelers, rather than the Green Bay Cheeseheads. As the players took to the field the kids were all high-fives and cheers. The impact and influence of high profile players and role models, committed to living a healthy and active life, cannot be overstated. You could see it clearly in the wide-eyed stares and smiles of every child as they clung to every word from the NFL pros. As the players and kids ran through ladder and reception drills the excitement was overwhelming – we were all ready to suit up for the big game.  Not wanting to get hit by an overthrown pass from DeMarcus, I headed to the sideline where parents stood with cameras in hand and was caught up in a conversation between Secretary Vilsack and a Steelers fan.  The Steelers fan pointed out his son and said that he couldn’t be happier to see him out there active, healthy, and having a great time. Two years ago the father promised his son they could go see the Steelers play in the Super Bowl, but when the big day came, his son was in the hospital receiving a bone marrow transplant.  Fast-forward two years and this father kept his promise to take his son to a Steelers Super Bowl. Not only did they get to go, he watched on as his son joined NFL greats running, laughing and playing in perfect health. While the Super Bowl is the ultimate goal for any aspiring football player, the Fuel Up to Play 60 events were a dream come true for the kids, as well. The energy in the convention center was contagious and everyone thought of how to bring this excitement to communities across the country. Suffice it to say that FUTP60 has some big goals and some big names on board to reach those goals.

The White House Rural Council will focus on actions to better coordinate and streamline federal program efforts in rural America, and to better leverage federal investments.  The collaboration will result in better programs and services in rural communities and maximize the benefits of those programs. Economic growth, prosperity, and the creation of quality jobs are on the minds of every citizen.  This morning, the White House Rural Council met and discussed ways to increase the availability of working capital investment.  This is absolutely essential in order for small towns and rural areas to attract new businesses, spur growth and create jobs.  This is especially true in the sectors of economic growth involving new technological innovations and development of renewable energy – areas where Rural America has the most promise, but faces the most difficult competitive challenges. In addition, I am greatly looking forward to utilizing the Rural Council as a means of connecting with Rural America and to continue the important dialogue the Administration has worked to establish with rural communities since regarding the needs and challenges that Rural America faces.  In the coming months, my Cabinet colleagues and I will be communicating Rural America to ensure that every American is aware of the programs and services they can access.  And we will get the most direct and current input from rural stakeholders to ensure we provide the best service possible. In the end, millions of Americans are counting on us to ensure that young people growing up in rural places have a bright future ahead – that they can envision a tomorrow that includes a job, and a vibrant rural community that they can call home.  Ensuring that tomorrow begins with the actions we take today.  And today, I am proud to be part of the President’s White House Rural Council and to help “Win the Future” for Rural America.

"Tlingit Master Carver Restores a 74-year-old Totem in Alaska  In a small U.S. Forest Service workshop in Juneau, Alaska, a skilled Alaska Native artist is meticulously bringing a traditional artifact back to life. Tlingit Master Carver Wayne Price of Haines has begun the process of restoring the totem, which has overlooked the Auke Recreation Area near Juneau for more than 70 years. In , Frank St. Clair, a Tlingit from Hoonah, and two members of the Civilian Conservation Corps, originally carved the Yax té or Big Dipper totem, which symbolizes a “place where a strong tribe flourished.” The Aak’w Kwáan, according to historical documents, were Tlingit people and among the first to settle in the Juneau area.

"USDA is committed to supporting a diverse range of farmers, ranchers, and private forest landowners through Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities. This effort will expand markets for America’s climate-smart commodities, leverage the greenhouse gas benefits of climate-smart commodity production, and provide direct, meaningful benefits to production agriculture, including for small and underserved producers. USDA is investing more than $3.1 billion for 141 projects through this effort and all the projects require meaningful involvement of small and underserved producers. Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities Finalized Agreements To learn more about active Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities projects, please view the project dashboard link below. Project Dashboard Questions about Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities should be sent to climate-smart-commodities@usda.gov. Find answers to many frequently asked questions on our FAQs page. Background USDA first announced details of the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities opportunity in February . The design of this opportunity was informed by over 400 comments received in the Request for Information published in September . Through this new opportunity, USDA will finance partnerships to support the production and marketing of climate-smart commodities via a set of pilot projects lasting one to five years. On September 14, , Secretary Vilsack announced USDA would be investing up to $2.8 billion in 70 selected projects under the first pool of the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities funding opportunity. On December 12, , he announced $325 million would be invested in an additional 71 projects under the second funding pool. USDA is updating the project dashboard periodically as we finalize the scope and funding levels of grant agreements. These projects will:  Provide technical and financial assistance to producers to implement climate-smart production practices on a voluntary basis on working lands;  Pilot innovative and cost-effective methods for quantification, monitoring, reporting and verification of greenhouse gas benefits; and  Develop markets and promote the resulting climate-smart commodities. USDA anticipates that these projects will result in:  Hundreds of expanded markets and revenue streams for farmers and ranchers and commodities across agriculture and forestry ranging from traditional corn to specialty crops.  More than 60,000 farms reached, encompassing more than 25 million acres of working land engaged in climate-smart production practices, like cover crops, no-till and nutrient management, as well as pasture and forestry management.   More than 60 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent sequestered over the lives of the projects. This is equivalent to removing more than 12 million gasoline-powered passenger vehicles from the road for one year.  Involvement of nearly 100 universities, including over 30 minority serving institutions. This will bring new ideas and innovative skills in monitoring and outreach. This includes:  11 projects with a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) as the lead and more than 35 projects with HBCUs as major partners; and  Six projects with a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) as the lead and nearly 20 projects with HSIs as major partners.  Over 20 tribes and tribal groups leading and partnering on many projects and representing tribes across a wide geography.  Proposals for the 141 selected projects include plans to match on average 50% of the federal investment with non-federal funds.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Kentucky in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Oct 06,  Larry E. King worked with NRCS to build a seasonal high tunnel on his farm in Whitley County. Larry E. King was raised in a family with farming roots. The very land he now farms in McCreary County, Kentucky was purchased by his mother during World War II.  He remembers his mother telling him, “If we didn’t raise it, we didn’t have it.” In his late teens, King raised strawberries on the farm. His life moved away from farming at 17 when he followed in his two brothers’ footsteps and joined the Air Force. For six years, King was stationed out of Little Rock, Arkansas where he worked with the mobile support systems out of the Military Airlift Command. After his military assignment, he finished college and worked for the U.S. Forest Service Civilian Conservation Corps. After a long career with the Forest Service, Larry retired a few years ago, bringing him home to the 34-acre family farm. “I look at this place more like a homestead than a traditional farm, because I use it to help veterans who want to get started farming,” he said. “I’m a farmer, but I’m also a philosopher.” King grows blueberries, raspberries and grapes in addition to potatoes, greens, tomatoes, onions, eggplant, okra, peas and green beans. And now, thanks to a conservation program through USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), he has a new seasonal high tunnel to use as what he considers a learning center. The tunnel is used to raise fruits and vegetables, and it helps promote local food sources as it lengthens growing seasons, allowing them to be grown earlier and later than normal. NRCS provides technical and financial assistance for landowners, like King, interested in seasonal high tunnels and other conservation practices through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or EQIP. Also, through EQIP, NRCS is helping King transition his operation into an organic one, a multi-year process. Organic farming refers to ecologically-based systems used to produce food and fiber. It relies on preventative practices for weed, insect and disease problems, uses nontoxic methods to manage problems if they do occur and improves the natural resources of the farm, including soil and water quality. NRCS offers assistance to farmers who are already certified organic or interested in becoming certified. Farming comes with many challenges, but he appreciates each one. He runs the farm on his own and occasionally has the help of his “student” veteran farmers. King said he finds farming to be therapeutic and wants to share that with his fellow veterans. He said he has a passion for helping others get on their feet, which he said is why he has worked with local governments in the area. He has worked with the local government and the Grow Appalachia program to establish a local farmers market and processing center. He continues to work with the Growing Warriors project to establish additional markets. His advice to those who want to get started farming is: “You can learn from both good and bad so don’t give up.” King is a member of the Disabled American Veterans, the American Legion, Growing Warriors and Kentucky Proud’s Homegrown by Heroes.  He looks forward to expanding his operation.

"On the Map: The Land, Water and Conservation Fund  There is a Federal program that you may not have heard of, but it is responsible for conserving millions of acres of recreational and conservation lands for Americans to enjoy, and it helps fund local parks, provide access to rivers and trails, and preserve wildlife habitat in every state in the Union.  This program is the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) and each year, the Department of the Interior and Department of Agriculture request funding from Congress to support grants to states and high priority federal recreational and conservation investments. Locating and learning about these special places is now easier than ever through a new interactive map. The map enables everyone to explore the 173 public projects proposed for investment in 43 states, including important waterfowl nesting habitat in the Prairie Potholes, battlefields and historic sites from Pennsylvania to Washington, scenic vistas in iconic locations like Maine’s Acadia National Park, and recreation sites in national monuments in California and Arizona. Land and Water Conservation funds secure access for the American public to their Federal lands.  For 50 years, the law has been one of the most successful programs for recreation and conservation in our history. LWCF has provided funding to local communities that supported the construction of more than 40,000 city parks, hiking and biking trails, and boat ramps, and access to thousands of acres of fishing and hunting and  important wildlife habitat.

"Farm Service Agency in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 24,  Dairy policy experts presented programs to assist the Dairy Industry Advisory Committee find solutions to price and income volatility in the industry. Pictured from l to r: Andrew Novakovic, DIAC chairman; Chuck Nicholson, Ph.D., California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo; Mark Stephenson, Ph.D., University of Wisconsin; Scott Brown, Ph.D., Food and Agricultural Policy research Institute; Wayne Knoblauch, Ph.D., Cornell University.  Unless policies are changed, the volatility and price fluctuations seen by the dairy industry within the past two years will become more severe, according to a panel of dairy policy experts who presented their research findings yesterday during the USDA Dairy Industry Advisory Committee meeting. “There is an issue. There is a problem,” said Charles Nicholson, Ph.D., agribusiness professor at California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo. “There has been an extreme level of volatility and [if policies do not change] the length and depth of the increases and decreases will grow greater and deeper.” Nicholson, along with three other experts addressed the 17-member advisory committee at the USDA headquarters in Washington, D.C., offering industry projections for the next eight years and several solutions that could help reduce price and income variability. “I’m optimistic about the next 10 years,” said Scott Brown, Ph.D., program director of livestock and dairy at the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) at the University of Missouri. “Although the volatility could be great, on average it looks better than what we just came out of.” From -09, dairy farmers suffered a loss in income as consumers and businesses cut back on the amount of milk and milk-based products they bought, creating a surplus and driving prices down. During the first quarter of , milk prices — which are based on commodity markets and fluctuate with global demand — dropped from $16.80 per cwt to $12.23 per cwt due to oversupply. Policy changes to avoid these types of fluctuations were presented in a 53-page document, along with several other , outlining three programs — Legislation Introduced by Costa and Sanders, The Marginal Milk Pricing program and Elements of the Foundation for the Future program — that would allow a percentage growth in milk production per year and a market access fee per hundredweight to be paid on either all milk or marginal milk at the producer’s choice. Brown cautioned that although policy change is needed, a careful decision must be made in order to avoid negative consequences. “A policy or procedure that eliminates volatility may sound good, but there may be side effects,” said Brown, who alluded to an accumulation of dairy product stock, which could overhang the market. “That would cause the industry to have a slower and even longer recovery period.” This is the third meeting of the Dairy Industry Advisory Committee, which was formed by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack earlier this year to review the issues of farm milk price volatility and dairy farmer profitability.

"USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service Southwest Regional Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Nov 19,  Students from Success Preparatory Academy lead the pledge of allegiance at the kick-off of the No Kid Hungry campaign in New Orleans on November 12.  I had the honor of participating in the kick-off of Share Our Strength’s No Kid Hungry campaign in New Orleans, Louisiana, on November 12.  I say it was an honor because of the importance of the project and the dedication and sincerity of the partners who have come together to make it happen. Share Our Strength is an important partner in our efforts to combat hunger and improve the nutrition of Americans in need.  USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) oversees 15 nutrition assistance programs that serve as a national safety net against hunger and serve one in four people over the course of a year. These programs are critical to the health and well being of so many people which is why we’ll continue to seek the help of partners on all levels -- federal, local, state, nonprofit and community to ensure all those eligible for nutrition assistance can access these programs.   The No Kid Hungry campaign seeks to increase participation in federal nutrition assistance programs including School Breakfast Program and the Summer Food Service Program. Very timely, as Congress works to strengthen our child nutrition programs by reauthorizing the Child Nutrition Act. With a strong reauthorization bill, we can ensure that our children have a healthy start in life and provide the nutritional foundation that will carry them through to adulthood. So overall, I have a good feeling about our chances for making a real difference in New Orleans and for children nationwide.  At the No Kid Hungry kick-off, it was great to see students from Success Preparatory Academy, a New Orleans charter school, participate in the event. Seeing these kids put a face on the group we are serving and showed us how children can succeed when they have access to steady and healthy meals, and a nurturing school environment. A few of the partners in the No Kid Hungry initiative were represented at the kick-off. Left to right are: Tracy Rosser, senior vice-president of Walmart, Mississippi River Delta Division; Bill Ludwig, regional administrator for Food and Nutrition Service Southwest Region; Mitch Landrieu, mayor of New Orleans; Carol Carter, director of Sojourner Truth Neighborhood Center; and Billy Shore, founder and executive director of Share Our Strength.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Apr 22,  As we celebrate our planet this Earth Day, we highlight ongoing research being conducted at USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) exploring how a seaweed species could potentially reduce methane emissions in livestock production. According to NASA, it is a misconception farm flatulence leads to excess atmospheric methane. In fact, the natural, digestive regurgitation and belches from livestock ruminants contribute most to environmental methane emissions. Ruminants are grazing animals with digestive systems that ferment the cellulose in grasses and other vegetation they eat. Methane gas is released as a fermentation byproduct. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says methane accounts for about 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions — and enteric (intestinal) fermentation accounts for approximately 2.7% of that. To help this issue, scientists are turning to a seaweed compound called bromoform, which could reduce enteric methane emissions by as much as 82% when fed to ruminants as a small portion of their diet. Studies are underway to determine the seaweed species with the greatest potential to reduce methane. Researchers at the USDA-ARS U.S. Dairy Forage Research Center plan to include seaweed as part of dairy cattle’s diet to evaluate both lactation performance and enteric methane emissions. Expanding this nutritional supplement nationwide, and perhaps globally, could markedly reduce methane emissions, and that’s something worth boasting—not belching—about this Earth Day.

Credit: US Forest Service, Grey Towers NHS A beautiful, blue stone mansion with its slate roof and turrets, known as Grey Towers, in Milford, Pa. has been a sanctuary for visitors from around the world to learn about conservation and natural resources. Fifty years ago on Sept. 24, , President John F. Kennedy dedicated the Grey Towers National Historic Site and the Pinchot Institute for Conservation Studies as a “living memorial” to America’s first forester and two-term Pennsylvania governor, Gifford Pinchot. On Sept. 19-22, the Forest Service, the Pinchot Institute and the Grey Towers Heritage Association will celebrate Grey Towers’ golden anniversary with public and private events, receptions, lectures, honored guest speakers, public visitation and family programs. This commemoration is an opportunity for the Forest Service, and its partners and collaborators to celebrate Pinchot’s legacy and highlight the many contributions he made to the Forest Service and beyond. What better way to honor the conservation legacy of the father of American conservation than by offering the Pinchot home as a public center for tours, meetings, study and research.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 07,  NRCS Chief Jason Weller spoke at an event yesterday hosted by Ducks Unlimited and the USA Rice Federation. Chief Weller celebrated the good work of rice farmers who provide critical habitat for ducks and other migratory waterfowl. From L to R in the chairs: Betsy Ward, President and CEO of USA Rice; John Owen, Chairman of USA Rice Producers’ Group; George Dunklin, President of Ducks Unlimited; Dale Hall, CEO of Ducks Unlimited; and Dr. Mark Petrie, report author and Director of Conservation Planning at Ducks Unlimited. USDA photo by Tom Witham. Rice is not just for people but for the birds, too. And a new report underlines the value of rice fields as habitat for migratory birds and other waterfowl. The working rice lands report, released this week by Ducks Unlimited and the USA Rice Federation, shows that replacing rice fields with restored wetlands would cost an estimated $3.5 billion. Plus, a large amount of food available to migratory birds during winter comes from rice fields: 44 percent in California’s Central Valley and 42 percent along the Gulf of Mexico coast. Jason Weller, chief of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, (NRCS) joined the two partners for the report’s unveiling today, noting the important relationship the agency has with both groups as well as American farmers. “We applaud the many rice producers who integrate extra conservation measures into their rice production to maintain water quality and provide much-needed waterfowl habitat,” he said. “The partnership between Ducks Unlimited, USA Rice and USDA offers increased technical and financial assistance to help producers accomplish these goals on their land.” Rice farmers have used voluntary conservation work to improve their rice operations while also providing valuable habitat to birds and other environmental benefits. For example, through the former Wetlands Reserve Program (now the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program), NRCS has worked with more than 12,500 farmers – and many partners like Ducks Unlimited and USA Rice Federation –  to enroll almost 2.9 million acres of wetlands. After the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, NRCS launched a new initiative, the Migratory Bird Habitat Initiative that created almost a half of million acres of critical shallow water habitat that year, providing refuge from the oil slick to millions of migratory and wintering birds. Over the next two years, farmers put conservation practices on more than 82,000 acres of land through the initiative. A large part of their work was ensuring lands in the flyway would continue to be suitable for shallow water habitat. This initiative’s successes can be seen across the country. In Texas, when Taylor Wilcox of Chambers County flooded his rice fields earlier than normal through the initiative, he noticed a swelling of waterfowl and shorebirds on his land. “We have seen an exceptional increase in the amount of diversity of wildlife populations,” Wilcox said. And in Mississippi, DeSoto County rice farmer Lan Burns typically measures his yield in rice, soybeans and milo. But after participating in the initiative, he was also able to measure on the amount of migratory birds he housed. “It was great to see NRCS and farmers help with the catastrophe on the coast,” he said of how, by flooding his land early, he was able to provide forage and shelter for a wide variety of species. To hear a USDA audio report about the event, please visit the Rice Growers and Beneficial Habitat for Waterfowl audio report.

"Deputy Director of Capacity Building and Development, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Aug 13,   The Waters family farm in Orrick, Mo. had a few unusual guests last week when dozens of African ministers came to learn about their corn, soybean and wheat farm. To embrace the 9th African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Forum’s theme, “New Strategies for a Changing World,” the organizers made some innovative changes, splitting the forum between Washington DC and Kansas City, Mo. Why Kansas City? As a major agricultural hub, Kansas City was ideal for bringing American and African agribusinesses and investors together. It also took the forum beyond policy discussions and into the field, literally. It was the perfect place to demonstrate the close relationship between American farmers and “the people’s department,” as USDA was originally named by Abraham Lincoln. Tom and Karla Waters explained how they plant, harvest, store, and sell crops in their seventh generation farm operation. USDA Farm Service Agency’s county director and an extension agent discussed how the Department supports smallholder farmers and large scale operations such as the Waters’ 5,000 acres through research and training at land-grant universities, and marketing and credit programs. In the Foreign Agricultural Service, I oversee capacity building and development programs, many in Africa. I talked about how our technical assistance programs help give farmers in Africa the same knowledge and tools available to farmers in the United States, through partnerships and coordination with farm groups, governments, and other public and private organizations. The ministers and delegates asked questions about purchasing seeds, planting cycles, irrigation, value-added end products, how prices are determined, and how to make a profit. On the policy side, they gained valuable insight about the Farm Service Agency’s network of service centers where farm loan managers, rural development officers, and extension agents serve the agricultural needs of communities throughout the United States. By seeing the producer-government relationship in action at the farm, I hope the ministers and delegates will take some new ideas and practices to use back home.

"Rural Development Arizona Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  Jan 24,   Rain poured through the roof of the old Black Canyon, Arizona, fire station, making the floor slippery and rusting the tin that covered the roof. Nonetheless, the one ambulance and fire truck that would fit into the aging metal shed still faired better than the other five vehicles parked outside. Those vehicles were not only pelted by rain and hail, but Arizona’s scorching sun baked them during much of the year—rotting the tires, fading the paint, and drying out the parts and equipment. Parking the vehicles outside also meant that the theft risk was greater, which increased insurance rates. A dilapidated trailer from the 70s was parked next to the shed. Three bunk beds were crammed into the small bedroom for use by fire crews. “It’s hard to recruit firefighters when they have to be housed in those conditions,” said Fire Chief Tom Birch. On January 21, a large crowd gathered to officially cut the ribbon for a new fire station for Black Canyon City. The new building has plenty of room—which means that all of the Department’s vehicles can be parked inside. It also has office space, a reception area, kitchen and three bunk rooms. The total project cost was $1.5 million. USDA Rural Development funded over half of that total. The Fire Department and their long list of building fund contributors made up the difference. That list of community supporters took two full pages of small type to list in the grand opening program. Chief Birch was joined at the ceremony by Fire District Board Members past and present, and the contractor and architect for the new facility. Also on hand were Arizona State Director of USDA Rural Development Alan Stephens, Bureau of Land Management District Manager Angelita Bulletts, Yavapai County Supervisor Tom Thurman and USDA Community Programs Director Leonard Gradillas. “Because of the distances involved in this rural area, our volunteers are to be here at the station during their shifts,” said Birch. “Morale has soared since we got the new station.” The Spacious interior of Black Canyon City Fire Department Building-Residents line up for a potluck meal.  There are lots of other pluses with the new fire station.  The station is built on land close to the interstate for rapid deployment, and because the vehicles can be parked inside, BCCVFD was upgraded to a Class 5 insurance rating—significant because that means lower rates which get passed along to their customers. Three days after Chief Birch and his crew moved into the new fire station, they were called upon to help with a fire in the brush land to the north. “We had a call from the State Forester asking if we could help by providing a pre-stage location for their rapid-response team,” said Birch. “There would have been no way we could have provided that kind of support and assistance before,” he added. “We had the space to be able to accommodate the equipment and the personnel. Our efforts helped ensure that the brush fire did not become a bigger disaster.” To find out more about how USDA’s Community Facilities Programs can help your community, click here.

"Chugach National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Oct 21,  Ski athletes come from all over the world to train on the Chugach National Forest, spending 25 to 30 hours a week in the challenging, variable conditions found on Eagle Glacier. The Alaskan Pacific University operated seven camps, each with about 20 athletes this summer. (Courtesy U.S. Ski Team Women’s Coach/Coach Matt Whitcomb) America’s elite, Olympic-bound Nordic skiers have a high-altitude secret they hope will give them an edge in Sochi, Russia, during the Winter Olympics in late February. Team members take a 10-minute helicopter ride from sea level up to Eagle Glacier on Alaska’s Chugach National Forest, the most northern national forest in the U.S. The environment there mimics what they expect to find in Sochi. The glacier, 5,500 feet above Girdwood, Alaska, is home to the Thomas Training Center operated under permit by the Alaska Pacific University Nordic Ski Center. The ski center was established in the late s as a model for creating international success in American Nordic skiing. “Right now we have three ladies who have skied in the top 10,” said Erik Flora, center director and head coach. “We have Kikkan Randall, who is the overall sprint World Cup leader last year, and World Champion Holly Brooks, who is fifth in the World Cup, and Sadie Bjornsen, who is also in the top 10 in the World Cup. Right now we are one of the only clubs with three ladies in the top 10 in the World Cup. And a lot of that is due to skiing up here.” The glacier presents variable conditions like those that skiers are likely to encounter when they race overseas in the world championships or the Olympics. Whether it’s soft, slushy snow or hard snow, it all helps to build technique and fitness. The regular presence of fog and clouds require skiers to sharpen all of their senses. Flora and his team have used those conditions to their advantage, re-creating the trails and experience racers will confront in Sochi. Noah Hoffman, a member of the men’s team who hopes to compete in Sochi, described the trails in Russia as some of the most difficult  he’s ever skied in the world, with the longest climb of any race course he’s ever seen. Flora created a similar layout on the glacier. “To be able to practice a climb of that length and that sustained effort is really important,” said Hoffman. “Sochi also has some rolling terrain with moderate steepness of hills, and on another section of the course out here [on Eagle] Erik was able to mimic that and get us a good feel for the upper part of the Sochi trail.” From the moment they exit the helicopter, walk off the rocks and onto the glacier, skiers recognize what a special place it is. Globally, there are four or five major summer skiing snowfields or glaciers that cross country skiers practice on in the summer. Eagle is unique in that you can stay in a warm dormitory right at the glacier’s edge. “There’s no other place in the world that’s like Eagle Glacier,” said Holly Brooks, a member of the U.S. Women’s ski team. “This is the only place you can sleep right next to a glacier and train twice a day. You wake up in the morning and walk out on snow.”  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Tags:  Alaska  Alaska Pacific University Nordic Ski Center  Chugach National Forest  Eagle Glacier  Forestry  FS  Olympic Winter Games  Russia  Thomas Training Center","""What unique training advantage does the Eagle Glacier in Chugach National Forest offer to elite Nordic skiers preparing for the Sochi Olympics?""","The Eagle Glacier in Chugach National Forest offers elite Nordic skiers a unique training advantage by providing variable conditions similar to those they will encounter at the Sochi Olympics, including soft and hard snow, fog, and clouds, allowing them to develop technique and fitness while mimicking the experience of racing overseas."

"The Future is Here ... and it's Made of Wood  It’s a good time for building with wood products. More architects and contractors are returning to this renewable, sturdy, all-purpose material after decades of what some might consider an undue reliance on concrete and steel. In furthering that message, I was pleased to join WoodWorks, a nonprofit organization supported by a $1 million grant from the U.S. Forest Service, to host more than 350 architects and builders this year at the Wood Solutions Fair in the District of Columbia. The fair promoted the use of wood in commercial buildings in helping maintain sustainable forest management, addressing wildfires, droughts, extreme storms and insect epidemics.

USDA photo. Thirty-five participants, consisting of native entrepreneurs and organizations that provide services to entrepreneurs attended the first ever Entrepreneur Fair (E-Fair) held in Pickstown, South Dakota earlier this month. The E-Fair was co-hosted by the South Dakota Indian Business Alliance (SDIBA) and Yankton Sioux Economic Development Department (YSEDD); providing time and resources into making the day a reality.  The purpose of the fair was to encourage, support, educate, and provide networking opportunities for the native entrepreneurs of the Yankton Sioux Tribe. The fair provided valuable resources to each small business owner through a structured program to include topics such as access to loans for the different stages of entrepreneurship, resources available, technical assistance in developing a small business, customer service and sales skills, barriers that prevent access to main stream financial institutions, and what is a CDFI. “The Native entrepreneurs that attended are excited and hyped up to continue their small business ventures,” said Flo Hare, Economic Development Administrator.  She added, “There will be a follow up meeting for the local entrepreneurs in early March on their progress and provide a forum for support and networking.” The local entrepreneurs brought their small businesses to the fair in different developmental phases. Such businesses included, Sacred Hoop Design (Native jewelry made from natural resources such as buffalo bone), White Swan Community Development (Aqua-ponics/greenhouse), Startastic Creations (StarQuilts), D-3 Nature Woodworks, LLC, Snackies, Dacotah Rivers, LLE (Native Herbal Bath and Body Products) and others including a landscape and taco truck businesses. Two small businesses set up booths at the fair, Sacred Hoops sold authentic native made jewelry and Indigenous, an American blues-rock group that came to prominence in the late s. The band originally consisted of two brothers, Mato Nanji, Pte, along with their sister, Wanbdi, and their cousin, Horse. In attendance were 11 individual entrepreneurs and 15 service organizations including USDA Rural Development staff.

"USDA Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 04,   The White House on June 2 convened a national forum to seek action on the problem of anti-microbial resistance. The development of antibiotics was one of the most significant medical achievements of the last century, and has helped to save millions of lives. But their overuse or misuse has resulted in the rise of bacteria strains that are resistant to antibiotics. The White House has unveiled a National Action Plan designed to advance the appropriate use of antibiotics in food animals as well as promote collaborations among partners in medicine, veterinary medicine, and public health. This is consistent with a “One Health” approach that embraces the idea that a disease problem impacting the health of humans, animals, and the environment can only be solved through improved communication, cooperation, and collaboration across disciplines and institutions. USDA, which helped develop the National Action Plan, was pleased to join our many Federal partners and continue our work with the agriculture industry at the forum. USDA continues to research alternatives to antibiotics, including vaccines, to reduce the use of medically important antibiotics and develop new tools to prevent and treat diseases that impact the health, welfare, and production of livestock, poultry and fish. For example, recent findings by USDA Agricultural Research Service scientists suggest that lysozyme, an enzyme used in many foods and beverages can serve as a natural alternative to antibiotics used to improve feed efficiency and growth in pigs. And through our shared goal, USDA will continue working with the agriculture industry to optimize stewardship of antibiotics in food animals.   In addition, collaborations among partners in medicine, veterinary medicine, and public health are being promoted to support a one health approach to the issue of antimicrobial resistance.   There are a number of entities in the agriculture sector that are trying to address antibiotic stewardship. Specifically, Food producers and retailers are taking actions such as voluntarily phasing out the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion, providing responsible use to suppliers from whom they purchase meat, and funding research for alternative management practices that reduce the need for antibiotics.  Some store owners are committing to purchase from suppliers who already have or are phasing out the use of medically important antibiotics or that can provide them with antibiotic-free meat and poultry.  Animal pharmaceutical companies are committed to align their medically important antibiotic products with FDA’s guidance, including removing growth promotion uses and changing marketing status to require veterinary oversight of product use.  Further, the companies investing in vaccines, best management practices, on-farm hygiene, and proper nutritional innovations that will benefit animal health while lessening the reliance on traditional antibiotics. Animal feed industry organizations and livestock and poultry farmers are educating producers and ranchers about the FDA labeling changes that will bring all feed uses of medically important antibiotics under the oversight of licensed veterinarians.  These educational campaigns are helping to make farmers aware of antimicrobial stewardship programs and keeping them updated on best practices for antimicrobial use and policy. Livestock and poultry farmers are conducting education and outreach campaigns to make farmers aware of antibiotic stewardship programs and keeping them updated on best practices for antibiotic use and policy. Veterinary, animal agriculture, and meat associations are developing and updating species-specific judicious use , conducting education campaigns on judicious use, and encouraging collection efforts. The organizations are committed to magnifying education outreach efforts through their vast networks by distributing educational material, holding symposiums to bring those in public health and agriculture together, and conducting regional workshops on new antibiotic use and veterinary oversight policies. And, general agriculture, food system non-government organizations are conducting education and outreach and developing standards with an accompanying verification program for the judicious use of medically important antibiotics in food producing animals.  Through this multidisciplinary approach, USDA’s objective remains to preserve, maintain or reduce health risks to animals, humans, the environment and society.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Forestry  Oct 29,  Mexican free-tailed bats exiting Bracken Bat Cave. Photo credit: USFWS/Ann Froschauer Most people associate pollination with bees and birds but often forget the work of their furry colleagues: bats. Bats take the night shift, playing a major role in pollinating crops and spreading seeds. One important bat is the Mexican long-nose bat, which dwells in large colonies. Their range includes the southern parts of Texas, California, New Mexico and Arizona. Throughout time, plants and mammals have shared a dependency on one another that is mutually beneficial. So naturally, these bats feed on flowers, including those of valuable commercial crops, like figs, dates, mangoes and peaches, which have flowers that only open at night. These mammal pollinators are finicky eaters with a specific palate. Dining on plant pollen and drinking sweet nectar is a delicacy at its batty-best. They tend to enjoy a flower that’s mild in scent and not bright in color. Simply speaking, white or pale crop flowers attract the night pollinators to feed on them. Mexican long-nose bats can fly extensive distances to gather nectar from specific plants. A lesser long-nosed bat pollinates a cross section of a saguaro cactus flower. Photo by Merlin D. Tuttle, Bat Conservation International. “When they are in Texas and New Mexico, they feed on the nectar of agave flowers too,” said Cyndee Watson, a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The common feeding features of pollinating bats are elongated snouts and tongues, combined with smaller and fewer teeth. This aids in the rapid collection of nectar. “Bats get pollen on their faces and bodies and go to the next flower. That is how cross pollination happens,” Watson said. Mexican long-nose bats visit up to 30 flowers each night, feeding and transporting pollen. They use a sonar system, through which the echoes of sound waves determine the shapes of surrounding objects. Because the powerful echoes emit higher frequencies and vibrations, bats can detect the existence of swift flying predators, too. The seeds and fruits that compose part of our diet would not exist without the interaction between flowering plants and pollinators, including bats. Bats serve a purpose with other popular pollinators, and they’re just as important as the day shift birds and bees, which feed on daytime flowering plants. Some states where large populations of bats live are also working to ensure bats always have a place to call home after a nighttime feeding. “Texas is trying to install bat condo structures where the furry friends can make a home,” said James Rogers, a wildlife biologist with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service. NRCS works with farmers, ranchers and forest landowners to implement conservation practices on the ground that have numerous environmental benefits, including ones that provide habitat and food for pollinators. For example, through the Farm Bill, landowners have an opportunity to receive financial assistance through conservation programs and practices, which can include planting cover crops and riparian buffers that target these beneficial pollinators. Bats’ survival depends on improved conservation practices to ensure they have healthy ecosystems to hang around in. Throughout the summer, wildlife biologists conduct nighttime surveys to learn more about the many bats that live in the Coconino National Forest. Scientists gather information about species, population, and habitat. This bat from the genus Myotis is having its wing examined.

"AMS Public Affairs in  Farming  Organic  Jun 02,  The last few years have seen the U.S. dairy industry weather some storms, including an unprecedented global pandemic and the related supply chain disruptions, which forced producers to dump millions of gallons of milk that no longer had a market. Through it all, USDA continues to support the industry. For this year’s National Dairy Month, we’d like to highlight two major ongoing USDA programs that focus on the dairy industry. In January, we announced the new Organic Dairy Marketing Assistance Program (ODMAP). ODMAP was established to help mitigate market volatility, higher input and transportation costs, and unstable feed supply and prices that have created unique hardships in the organic dairy industry. Under ODMAP, USDA’s Farm Service Agency is making $104 million available to organic dairy operations to assist with marketing costs. ODMAP began May 24 and runs through July 26, . And since their inception in , Dairy Business Innovation (DBI) Initiatives have been supporting dairy businesses in the development, production, marketing and distribution of dairy products. DBI Initiatives provide direct technical assistance and grants to dairy businesses, including niche dairy products, such as specialty cheese, or dairy products derived from the milk of a dairy animal, including cow, sheep and goat milk. Through programs such as these and ongoing agency support, USDA works to protect, grow and develop the U.S. dairy industry. Happy National Dairy Month!

"Champions of Change: Moving Chefs to School in New Haven, Connecticut  Cross posted from the Let's Move! blog:  Last week I had the wonderful opportunity to join 5 chefs from across the country, all of us being recognized as a Champion of Change. Working together as a team the six of us joined in a discussion with Under Secretary Kevin Concannon and Chef Sam Kass to discuss opportunities and challenges of the Chefs Move to Schools, a program of the Let's Move! initiative. The true spirit of Chefs Move to Schools (CMTS) is to engage children in their classroom through food. The program has morphed into a fun and educational program benefitting both school children and school nutrition professionals. One practice that is becoming popular is to have the program benefit both these groups; first by getting kids excited by a chef demo then having the chef step into the school kitchen, not to comment about the food, rather to work hands on with the kitchen staff to help re-educate them on basic kitchen skills. This quick educational lesson is often welcomed by the staff who see it as an opportunity to network with a local chef. Engaging organizations is important to seeing through with the success of CMTS. The American Culinary Federation, School Nutrition Association and Share Our Strength are the top three organizations involved to see through with the success of CMTS.

"NRCS Nevada in  Conservation  Jan 10,  An important meadow is fenced to protect critical habitat for sage-grouse. In the middle of Nevada, miles from anywhere, eight Native American young adults spent their summer working to improve sagebrush habitat for the greater sage-grouse. Habitat for this ground-dwelling bird, native to much of the American West, has been dwindling in recent years, due to fencing, wildfires and invasive species. The young adults, all residents of the Duck Valley Indian Reservation and the Battle Mountain Indian Colony, range in age from 18 to 26. They were happy to find work that would let them be outdoors and physically active. Their employment was made possible by a partnership between the Bootstraps Program of University of Nevada Cooperative Extension in Lander County and USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The Bootstraps Program teaches life skills and job responsibility by combining formal classroom instruction with real outdoor work experience. NRCS’ role was to provide technical guidance and financial assistance through its Environmental Quality Incentives Program. Pinyon and juniper trees are cut to provide optimal growth conditions for native sagebrush. The eight young people are working to restore sage-grouse habitat on 1,000 acres of public land and 400 acres of private land. Restoration means the removal of invasive pinyon pine and juniper trees in order to provide optimal conditions for the native sagebrush that provides food and cover for the greater sage-grouse. In June, the Bootstraps workers received intensive training from Extension specialists covering use of chainsaws, two-way radios, satellite phones and GPS units, as well as safety, first aid and basic job skills. Once trained and equipped, they started work. They removed only certain pinyon pine and juniper trees. They left old-growth trees standing, as well as trees on steep slopes, because removing them would create other problems, like erosion. The cut trees were left on the ground to protect the soil from erosion and provide shelter for wildlife. When the crew wasn’t cutting trees, they were fencing springs and meadow areas to protect them from overuse by livestock or wild horses. Meadows are critical habitat for young sage-grouse. An important meadow is fenced to protect critical habitat for sage-grouse. All of the young adults say they have enjoyed the experience—especially working outside, and with their hands. Most of the pinyon pine and juniper will be cut this fall, and next year a new Bootstraps crew will finish it and start work in other areas.

"A collaborative agreement for use of NOAA satellites will help the Interior and Agriculture Departments detect wildfires early, track wildfires in real time, and provide for public safety and air quality modeling  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .24  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@usda.gov  WASHINGTON, July 23, — The Biden-Harris administration today announced it is taking additional steps to safeguard western communities in the face of increasingly dangerous and intense wildland fires by building advanced wildfire detection capabilities using satellite technology. The Department of the Interior and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s Forest Service have signed an agreement with the Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to use the NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite — R series (GOES-R) to rapidly detect and report wildfire starts. Supported by a $20 million investment from the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—$10 million each from Interior and Agriculture— this new agreement will use advanced remote sensing capabilities to improve the speed and accuracy of wildfire detection. President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, is bringing much-needed assistance to communities across the country — deploying innovative tools to tackle wildfires, increasing the resilience of lands facing the threat of wildland fires, and better supporting federal wildland firefighters. The law includes $5 billion for these Departments over five years to invest in preparedness, fuels management, post-fire restoration, and fire science. “This partnership is one of the many ways we are investing in technology to improve firefighter and community safety,” said Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack. “Wildland firefighting will always require highly skilled individuals working on the ground, but with more real-time information we can reduce the risks to crews and pilots, and improve our response time, reducing the risk to impacted communities.” “This collaborative effort demonstrates how the federal government is deploying resources from President Biden’s historic Investing in America agenda to improve its emergency response capabilities and address increasingly frequent and extreme climate-driven wildfires,” said Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland. “By using expanded satellite capacity to pinpoint wildfire ignitions and provide real-time for wildfire managers, this partnership with NOAA will enable the Interior and Agriculture Departments to respond to wildfires more rapidly and make informed decisions for firefighting operations and public safety.” “Now more than ever, the impacts of climate change are increasing the threat of wildfires across the country and thanks to President Biden’s commitment to investing in America, NOAA has been able to significantly improve fire weather forecasts to keep communities safe,” said Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “This new partnership, a result of the most ambitious climate agenda in history, will help expand our ability to detect wildfires, improve response times, and keep families in western communities out of harm’s way.” Use of NOAA’s GOES-R satellite will enable the Interior and Agriculture Departments to detect wildfires early, provide firefighters a more detailed look at wildfire conditions, allow faster hot spot detection, and provide the ability to track wildfire progression in real time. GOES-R series satellites are frequently capable of detecting wildfires before they are spotted on the ground or reported to 911. The satellites can also be used to pinpoint the exact location of a fire after smoke occur. These improved capabilities will support interagency efforts to protect people and communities from increasingly devastating wildfires. GOES-R satellite observations are not only valuable for detecting wildfires but are also critical for observing and monitoring smoke from those fires. The ability to monitor smoke plumes in near real time is particularly useful in directing firefighting efforts from the air. Deploying airplanes and helicopters for wildfire suppression efforts is often hampered by poor visibility. GOES-R satellites can help guide decisions for deploying flights by providing information on the exact location and drift of smoke from a fire. The smoke detection and monitoring information also enable better air quality forecasts to help safeguard public health. These improvements help equip communities with the information they need to assess risks and develop climate solutions—a key objective of the National Climate Resilience Framework. Today’s effort supports recommendations by the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission, which was established through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and charged with making recommendations to improve federal policies related to the mitigation, suppression, and management of wildland fires in the United States. In September , the Commission released a comprehensive report (, 5.3 ) to Congress outlining 148 recommendations to improve the nation’s relationship with wildfire. This collaboration advances recommendations for expanded use of wildfire detection systems and improved collaboration across organizations and jurisdictions. # USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer, and lender.","What advanced satellite technology will be used by the Interior and Agriculture Departments in partnership with NOAA to detect wildfires early, track their progression in real-time, and provide critical information for public safety and air quality modeling?","The NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite — R series (GOES-R) will be used by the Interior and Agriculture Departments in partnership with NOAA to detect wildfires early, track their progression in real-time, and provide critical information for public safety and air quality modeling."

"In Case You Missed It: Study Finds Offering Healthier School Snacks Helps Kids Make Healthier Choices at Home  Last week, researchers from Michigan State University, Oakland University, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, and the Michigan Department of Education came out with a new study showing that when schools offer healthier snacks in vending machines and a la carte lines, students’ overall diets improve. Students in schools that offered healthier snacks consumed more fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and not just at school—at home, too. This is encouraging news for schools and school nutrition professionals as they begin implementing the Smart Snacks in School standards, which will ensure that students are offered healthier food options during the school day. Smart Snacks in School requires more whole grains, low fat dairy, fruits, vegetables and leaner protein, while still leaving plenty of room for tradition, like homemade birthday treats and bake sale fundraisers.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Mar 23,  ARS scientists have shown that some tree nuts such as pistachios actually have fewer calories than previously thought by improving the method used for estimating calories. We all love nuts, but we’re careful not to eat too many because of the high fat calories. Now, there may be less to worry about. In a series of studies, USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) physiologists David Baer and Janet Novotny looked at how many calories of almonds, walnuts, and pistachios are used by the human body. There are a lot of factors to consider, such as whether the nuts are raw, roasted, or ground, and how well they’re chewed. Over the years, nutrition science has become more sophisticated, and research by ARS scientists is showing that counting calories isn’t always as simple as it may seem. The concept behind this is “bioavailability.” For example, while an ounce of almonds has approximately 160 calories, not all of those calories may be used by the human body. This is the idea of “bioavailability.” When food is eaten, it is broken down into its nutritional components, and its calories are burned for energy. However, just because nutrients are present doesn’t mean the body will readily use them. The question of whether those nutrients are “bioavailable” is being examined by scientists in the ARS Food Components and Health Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland. This lab is part of the Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center. In their study, Baer and Novotny found the calorie uptake from pistachios was 22.6 calories per gram—5 percent less than the currently accepted 23.7 calories per gram. An ounce of pistachios has 161.9 calories, but only 153.8 calories are bioavailable. That may not sound like a lot, but a calorie reduction of 5 percent can be quite significant on a daily basis. There’s also a bonus. In their study, they found that pistachios lowered LDL cholesterol by 6 percent, but didn’t significantly change total plasma cholesterol. Providing accurate information about metabolizable energy (ME) content—or calories—of foods is important for reliable food labeling and has health ramifications, according to Novotny. In another study, the team found that a 1-ounce serving of walnuts contained 146 calories, which is 39 calories—or 21 percent—less than the amount in the label, according to Baer. This finding could explain why some of us don’t gain excessive weight from eating nuts. Baer and his colleagues also looked at almonds, and here, too, found the trend continuing. Almonds were found to have 32 percent fewer calories of ME than determined by the Atwater factors: 129 calories instead of 168-170 calories. The way nuts are processed also impacts their ME value. In whole raw nuts, the fewest fat calories were taken in. Chopped nuts provided the next fewest compared to the label, and nut butters were consistent with the fat calories on the label. So, don’t be afraid to eat those nuts!

This means that only a portion of the calories counted for nuts like pistachios, almonds, or walnuts are actually metabolized for energy, resulting in a lower caloric content than previously estimated."

"Ohio Statistician, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Conservation  Aug 07,  Up 42% since the last Census of Agriculture, Ohio’s agriculture is really growing! Check back next Thursday for another Census Spotlight on another state and the Census of Agriculture. The Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture. The Census of Agriculture results are out and, just as many predicted, Ohio continues to grow agriculturally. True to our rich history, the Buckeye State is a large contributor of corn, soybeans, winter wheat, milk, hogs, poultry, and floriculture and nursery. And that is just a few of our many commodities produced in Ohio. According to the census results, there are 75,462 farms (ranking 7th nationally) on 13,960,904 acres of farm land in Ohio. Even though was a drought year, Ohio ranked 13th nationally in total sales by topping $10 billion, a whopping 42 percent increase from just five years ago, which was the last time my agency conducted the Census of Agriculture. We also ranked 10th nationally in crop sales with just under $6.6.billion and 20th nationally in livestock sales with just under $3.5 billion. The majority of our agricultural income in Ohio traditionally comes from crops and was no exception. Ohio growers produced more than 436 million bushels of corn and sold nearly $2.9 billion worth of this crop. Our local growers also produced more than 200 million bushels of soybeans which results in sales of more than $2.7 billion and 31 million bushels of winter wheat, with total sales amounting to more than $223 million. Not to be outdone, the Livestock industry is also well represented in the Buckeye State. Ohio farmers had milk sales of over $938 million in , placing Ohio into 11th nationally in that category. And hog sales were just below that number at over $788 million in sales. In the poultry industry, Ohio ranked 2nd nationally with a layer inventory of over 28 million layers. The impact this industry has on Ohio agriculture is especially noticeable on a more local level. Ohio’s Darke and Mercer counties ranked 2nd and 3rd nationally among top layer counties in the U.S. In addition to these two major agricultural sectors, the floriculture and nursery industries were also well represented in Ohio. On the floriculture side, Ohio growers surpassed $228 million in sales, ranking 6th nationally. Nursery growers sold more than $181 million in , ranking 7th nationally. On the demographics side, the average age of Ohio farmers is 56.8 years, which is below than the national average of 58.3 years. More than 5,000 Ohio operators are under the age of 35 and over 20 percent of our principal operators have been operating any farm less than 10 years. Women are the principal operator on over 11 percent of Ohio farms. These are just some of the exciting facts about Ohio agriculture.

"Posted by acampbell in  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Mar 01,   In keeping with USDA’s commitment to addressing global food insecurity through school feeding programs, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced that USDA will donate more than 100,000 tons of U.S. agricultural commodities valued at nearly $170 million in fiscal year under the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition (McGovern-Dole) Program. The McGovern-Dole Program helps support education, child development and food security in low-income, food-deficit countries that are committed to universal education. The program has helped feed millions of children over the years and one example of the success of this program can be found in Senegal. Children in 112 primary schools and 21 pre-schools and mothers and infants in 58 maternal and child health nutrition (MCHN) centers in the Matam region of Senegal are eating a daily meal and much more due to a Counterpart International (CPI) project funded by USDA’s McGovern-Dole Program. Most people in the Matam region are extremely poor and face high rates of malnutrition. In addition, the area receives little rainfall and food prices are inflated, making food unaffordable for vulnerable households. As a result, roughly 30 percent of children under the age of five are stunted in height and 58 percent of women of child-bearing age suffer from anemia. To improve this situation, USDA donated more than 9,500 tons of crude degummed soybean oil, vegetable oil, textured soy protein and used the proceeds to provide a daily lunch to 17,774 primary school children and 1,800 pre-school children. After nearly three years of operation, this school feeding program has achieved a large measure of sustainability. Successes achieved by CPI include: - National and local governments created school feeding divisions, allocating more than $2 million to school feeding activities and setting aside additional funds to purchase supplementary food ingredients. - Nearly 450 teachers and Parent-Teacher Association members were trained in managing school feeding activities and providing proper nutrition. - More than 22 villages are implementing school garden activities by growing cabbage, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, eggplant and carrots. - Nearly 250 head nurses, community health workers, pre-school teachers and pre-school management committee members at MCHN centers were trained in weighing techniques, infant nutrition, breastfeeding, hygiene and illness prevention. - In addition, a joint project with the U.S. Peace Corps is reducing dependence on fuel wood for cooking by providing mud stoves to select recipients to prepare school meals and training people in 30 villages on mud stove construction techniques. These accomplishments resulted in USDA renewing its McGovern-Dole agreement this year with CPI for another three years to achieve an even greater degree of sustainability.

"in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 27,  Today, USDA is furthering its commitment to improving the way that our youngsters eat by establishing science-based, common-sense standards for snacks sold in schools. The new “Smart Snacks in School” nutrition standards will positively impact more than 50 million American youngsters by ensuring that they are offered only healthier foods at school. Based on feedback from nearly 250,000 parents, teachers, school food service professionals, and the food and beverage industry, we carefully balanced science-based nutrition standards, based on recommendations from the Institute of Medicine and the Dietary for Americans, with practical and flexible solutions to promote healthier eating at school. I’m proud that we were able to develop meaningful standards that compliment the healthier school meals introduced last fall and make the healthy choice, the easy choice for students across the school food environment – by encouraging snacks that contain whole grains, low-fat dairy, fruits, vegetables or protein as their main ingredients, and placing sensible limits on sugar, fat, and salt. We were able to achieve this goal while still giving schools flexibility to continue important traditions like fundraisers and bake sales, and preserve parents’ ability to send in homemade lunches and birthday cupcakes. The new standards are also appropriately limited in scope and do not apply to foods sold at venues such as after-school sporting events or weekend school plays. But we also recognize that decisions on what standards make the most sense for their communities should happen on the local level, which is why we’ve set only minimum standards that act as a consistent national baseline to provide greater certainty for food and beverage companies and for schools. States and schools with more stringent standards than what we’ve released today will be able to maintain their own policies. As with the new school meals, we know that change takes time. That is why schools and snack food companies will have an entire school year to prepare for the necessary changes, and we will offer training and technical assistance every step of the way. In fact, a wide range of healthy options are already available in most food and beverage companies’ portfolios, in response to the growing call by parents and schools for healthier snack foods. The Smart Snacks in School nutrition standards are the next step in our efforts to improve the health of America’s young people, but we know there is more work to be done. USDA and our partners are working hard to ensure that all children have access to affordable, nutritious food, so that America’s next generation of leaders grow up healthy and strong.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .23  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@usda.gov  WASHINGTON, April 3, – U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced that the Department is investing $40 million to provide high-speed internet access for people living and working in rural areas in New Mexico. Today’s investments are made possible because of funding from President Biden’s historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which provides $65 billion to expand reliable, affordable, high-speed internet to all communities across the U.S. The announcement reflects the goals of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda to rebuild our economy from the middle-out and bottom-up through investments such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. “The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has given USDA unprecedented resources to close the digital divide in rural America,” Secretary Vilsack said. “Connecting rural Americans to reliable, high-speed internet helps farmers and businesses operate more efficiently and break into new markets. It helps build and keep wealth in rural communities. USDA is committed to making sure that people, no matter where they live, have access to high-speed internet. That’s how you grow the economy – not just in rural communities, but across the nation.” The $40 million in grants comes from the fourth funding round of the ReConnect Program. The Department will announce additional investments in the coming weeks. USDA has invested $1.7 billion since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration through the ReConnect Program to bring high-speed internet access to rural Americans. The three projects being announced today in New Mexico are:  The Western New Mexico Telephone Company Inc. is receiving a $23.8 million grant to deploy a fiber-to-the-premises network to provide high-speed internet access to people in Catron County. The company will make high-speed internet affordable by participating in the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Lifeline and Affordable Connectivity Programs (ACP). It also will provide a $34.99 monthly plan with 75 megabits per second upload and download speeds for subscribers within the project area who are enrolled in the ACP.  The E.N.M.R. Telephone Cooperative is receiving a $2.6 million grant to deploy a fiber-to-the-premises network to provide high-speed internet access to people in De Baca, Guadalupe, Harding, Quay, San Miguel, Socorro and Union counties. E.N.M.R. will make high-speed internet affordable by participating in the FCC’s Lifeline and Affordable Connectivity Programs. This project will serve socially vulnerable communities in De Baca, Guadalupe, San Miguel and Socorro counties.  The Peñasco Valley Telephone (PVT) Cooperative is receiving a $13.9 million grant to deploy a fiber-to-the-premises network to provide high-speed internet access to 550 people, 48 farms and 11 businesses in Chaves, Eddy, Otero and Lincoln counties. PVT will make high-speed internet affordable by participating in the FCC’s Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). PVT also offers a program that can provide free internet for households participating in the ACP. This project will serve socially vulnerable communities in Chaves, Eddy and Otero counties. Background: ReConnect Program To be eligible for ReConnect Program funding, an applicant must serve an area that lacks access to service at speeds of 100 megabits per second (Mbps) download and 20 Mbps upload. The applicant must also commit to building facilities capable of providing high-speed internet service with speeds of 100 Mbps (download and upload) to every location in its proposed service area. Background: Bipartisan Infrastructure Law President Biden forged consensus and compromise between Democrats, Republicans and Independents to demonstrate our democracy can deliver big wins for the American people. After decades of talk on rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure, President Biden delivered the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law – a historic investment in America that will change people’s lives for the better and get America moving again. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides $65 billion to ensure every American has access to affordable, reliable high-speed internet through a historic investment in broadband infrastructure deployment. The legislation also lowers costs for internet service and helps close the digital divide, so that more Americans can take full advantage of the opportunities provided by internet access.

"Director of Sustainability Development, USDA in  Conservation  Dec 15,  Researchers at USDA Agricultural Research Service help reduce food waste by developing new ways to extend food shelf life and by creating new food products, biobased plastics, and animal feed from food waste. USDA photo by Stephen Ausmus. Less than 2 years ago, the USDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched the U.S. Food Waste Challenge, with the goal of reducing food waste in the United States.  We set an ambitious goal of having at least 400 businesses, schools, and/or organizations join the challenge by letting us know what they are doing to reduce food waste in their operations.  USDA also committed to finding ways in which its 33 agencies and offices could help reduce food waste through policy, partnerships, and research. As of today, we have surpassed our membership goal by signing up 1,313 participants in the U.S. Food Waste Challenge. The number and diversity of participants joining the challenge are indicative of a growing movement to reduce food waste that is spreading across the country. Founding members, Rio Farms, Unilever, General Mills, and the Food Waste Reduction Alliance have been joined by members from across the food supply chain.  Hannaford, a supermarket chain in the Northeast, recently joined the U.S. Food Waste Challenge and shared the many ways in which it keeps food from ending up in landfills.  Using the “food recovery hierarchy,” Hannaford tries to reduce food waste at the source by having fresh products delivered on a daily basis instead of 3-4 times per week.  Daily deliveries lead to more accurate ordering, less food waste, and improvements in quality.  Safeway, another supermarket chain participating in the U.S. Food Waste Challenge, donates the wholesome, edible food that goes unsold in their stores to feed hungry people.  In , Safeway recovered and donated 72 million pounds of food to hunger relief organizations. Other participants in our challenge like K-12 schools, universities, and sports teams are also involved in food recovery and donation activities.  With the help of organizations like Campus Kitchens and Food Recovery Network, over 120 colleges and universities have started food recovery efforts in their dining facilities to donate wholesome unsold food to local food pantries.  Sports teams like the Milwaukee Brewers and movie studios like NBC Universal have also signed up for the challenge because of their work with Rock and Wrap It Up!, an organization that recovers and donates unsold food at sporting events and movie shoots. Moving down the food recovery hierarchy, some participants in our challenge keep food from landfills by converting it to livestock feed.  Four Minnesota schools in the Chisago Lakes School District have their food waste picked up by Barthold Pig Farm, where it is then heated and fed to pigs. The 72 McDonalds’ in Hawaii now sell their used cooking oil to Pacific Biodiesel, where it is then recycled into fuel. Not to be outdone by all of our U.S. Food Waste Challenge participants, the USDA also delivered on reducing food waste through our policies, partnerships, and research.  USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) continues to study and provide estimates on how much food goes uneaten at the retail and consumer level.  The estimated pounds, monetary value, and calories of food loss that USDA ERS helps policymakers, the food industry, and nonprofits better explain the food waste issue to the public, make recommendations, and set targeted goals. Through the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the USDA is researching and developing new products that help 1) reduce food spoilage; 2) reuse waste from food processing to produce new value-added products; and 3) recycle food waste into livestock feed or biobased products such as biodegradable plastics. ARS, for example, helped Gorge Delight, a grower-owned business, develop a 100% fruit bar that uses blemished or damaged apples and pears from their orchards that would have otherwise been discarded.  Not only does ARS’s work help reduce food waste, but it also creates new economic opportunities in rural areas. For consumers and families, USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has updated the “Ask Karen” website, which is visited over 10 million times a year, to answer people’s questions on how to safely handle, prepare, and store food.  FSIS, which is responsible for ensuring that the nation’s commercial supply of meat, poultry, and egg products is safe and correctly labeled, recently streamlined procedures for donating wholesome misbranded meat and poultry products.  In April , as a result of this directive, FSIS was involved in the donation of approximately 84,310 pounds of misbranded pork sausage.  The misbranded product was donated to the Westmoreland County Food Bank and Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. Finally, here at USDA headquarters in Washington, D.C., the cafeteria, which serves up to 3,000 people a day, has found some innovative ways to reduce food waste.  The dining service company, IL Creations, holds “Happy Hour” from 2:30 pm – 3:00 pm, at which food is sold at a 30% discount to reduce the amount of unsold leftovers.  For people with eyes bigger than their stomachs, USDA has promoted composting and made it easy for employees by placing composting bins all over the building.   In , USDA headquarters composted about 2,650 pounds of food waste per week.  This represents about a 10% increase from , which is double our original goal of a 5% increase. The goal we had for launching the U.S. Food Waste Challenge was to help inspire organizations and individuals across the food supply chain to start reducing, recovering, and recycling food waste in their day-to-day operations.  What we didn’t expect was how much your energy, passion, and support would push us to do more.  Indeed there is so much more work to be done to reduce food waste in America, and we want to continue working on this issue for years to come. USDA FSIS recently changed on donation of mislabeled meat and poultry products. In April , this new directive led to 84,310 pounds of misbranded pork sausage being donated to local food pantries instead of being dumped into a landfill.

"NRCS in  Conservation  May 15,  Construction crews working on the dam in October . On any sunny day in Faulkner County, Arkansas, you will find people boating, swimming, and camping at Lake Bennett in Wooley Hollow State Park. This 40-acre lake was named after Dr. Hugh Hammond Bennett, the first chief of USDA’s Soil Conservation Service, today known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). In April , that peaceful setting was threatened when record rainfall and floodwaters caused the downstream face to erode on the lake’s 80-year-old dam. The major weather event reduced the stability for the masonry rock core of the dam. Partnering to Reduce the Danger Although the dam was still fully functioning, the downstream slope had to be repaired. Without repair, the erosion could cause the dam to burst, washing out roads, flooding the Park Ranger’s home, and releasing tons of sediment. The community turned to the NRCS for help. “Funding through the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program helped to rebuild the back slope of the dam to its stable, pre-disaster condition,” said Walt Delp, state engineer for NRCS in Arkansas. “Being able to work on a project 80 years after our agency’s founder established has been an honor.” NRCS partnered with the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism on the Lake Bennett EWP project. Sharing the cost for construction, NRCS also provided engineering assistance and ADPT provided administrative support. EWP allows communities to quickly address serious and long-lasting damages to infrastructure and to the land by assisting local sponsors to prevent of further damage from natural disasters. Preserving the History Making the repairs to the dam also preserved an important piece of conservation history. Lake Bennett watershed project was built in in partnership with the Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps to study the effects of water run-off, silt, and erosion. This was the first project in the United States built to scientifically study a specific watershed. As a result of these studies, a new philosophy of land management was born. Principles tested at Lake Bennett laid the foundation for soil conservation practices considered common today. Strip cropping, terracing, crop rotation and planting soil-retaining vegetation are now soil protection methods used nationwide. “With the historical significance of the structure and the impact it has had on soil conservation across the country, I’m thankful I had a part in ensuring that the dam is here for years to come,” Delp said. More Information USDA offers a variety of risk management, disaster assistance, loan, and conservation programs to help agricultural producers across the country weather ups and downs in the market and recover from natural disasters as well as invest in improvements to their operations.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Caribbean in  Conservation  Initiatives  Aug 22,  First Lady Wilma Pastrana Jiménez and others plant seeds in People’s Garden. Puerto Rico’s First Lady is a big fan of the home garden, and actually, the garden at the governor’s mansion, called La Fortaleza, is part of USDA’s national garden movement. First Lady Wilma Pastrana Jiménez’s garden was the first People’s Garden at a Puerto Rico state government facility and the third on the island. The garden joins more than 2,000 across the nation as part of the People’s Garden Initiative, started in by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. “Our experience planting fruits and vegetables in the garden at Palacio de Santa Catalina has been rewarding to us,” Jiménez said. “We are glad that this place has become an inspiration to others. Our team is instrumental in creating awareness on the importance of healthy eating habits in all our communities.” People’s Gardens have expanded to all 50 states, three U.S. territories – including Puerto Rico – and eight foreign countries. They are located at faith-based centers, on federally leased or owned property, at schools and other places within the community. Lush herbs and vegetables grow in La Fortaleza People’s Garden. “This is about a nation’s goal,” Jiménez said. “It is also the reason to spread the educational program ‘Siembra Vida,’ or ‘Planting Life,’ in the schools throughout the island. We are confident that the seed we are planting today will grow for many years to come.” The People’s Garden Initiative engages USDA agencies, including USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, to help “sow” gardens across the county. Late last year, NRCS Caribbean Area Director Edwin Almodóvar honored Jiménez for her efforts, which are important in a place like Puerto Rico. “We import over 80 percent of what we consume on the island,” Almodóvar said. “We have had food security issues in the Caribbean for a long time. We are vulnerable to storms, markets and to many other things that happen globally.” But the island’s good weather and fertile soil make it perfect for growing food, whether it’s in acres, feet or pots. He said he is glad the First Lady is working to promote home gardening. “For the first time, the Governor’s Mansion in Puerto Rico has a vegetable garden in the backyard,” he said. “Many students and visitors tour the vegetable garden, and it is a great educational component that not just exposes them to the work of USDA, but shows how with minimal space you can save money and enjoy while learning and eating healthy.” Puerto Rico’s other two People’s Gardens are located at the Mayagüez Field Office on the USDA Tropical Agriculture Research Station grounds and at the Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in San Juan.

"More than $1 Billion from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to be Invested to Increase Access to High-Speed Internet for People Living in Small Towns Across the Nation  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .22  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@usda.gov  WASHINGTON, August 4, – U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development Under Secretary Xochitl Torres Small today announced that the Department will begin accepting applications on September 6 for funding to expand access to high-speed internet for millions of people in rural America nationwide, part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to investing in rural infrastructure and affordable high-speed internet for all. USDA is making the funding available under the ReConnect Program, which received new funding from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. “High-speed internet connects people and businesses to new markets and helps people in rural America build brighter futures,” Torres Small said. “For too long, too many rural communities have been left out of the digital economy. This funding will help everyone in America – regardless of where they live – because rural people provide the everyday essentials our country depends on. Investments like the ones we are making through President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help close the digital divide across rural America.” USDA is making additional funding available for high-speed internet in Round 4 of the ReConnect Program. The Department will begin accepting applications on September 6 for up to $150 million in loans, up to $300 million in loan/grant combinations, and up to $700 million in grants. The Department will use funds appropriated under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, also known as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides a historic $65 billion investment to expand affordable, high-speed internet to all communities across the U.S. The application deadline is November 2. USDA has made several improvements to the ReConnect Program for Round 4.

"NIFA Programs Support Soil Health  According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), one-third of the planet’s soils are degraded. This condition is caused by a number of natural factors, including wind and water erosion and nutrient imbalances, but people also leave an indelible impact on the earth. About 38 percent of the worlds’ surface is dedicated to agriculture to feed a population of 7.2 billion. That population is projected to increase to over 9 billion by .

"Economic Research Service in  Research and Science  Sep 12,  Manufacturing employment declines were the highest in the Eastern U.S. between and . Compared to urban areas, in , manufacturing represented a greater share of both private nonfarm rural jobs and rural earnings . A new report from USDA’s Economic Research Service, Rural Manufacturing at a Glance, examines the manufacturing sector in rural America. Manufacturing jobs in rural areas totaled about 2.5 million jobs in and pay relatively well; among all rural sectors, only mining had higher median earnings. The manufacturing sector’s share of employment and earnings in rural areas began to exceed its share in urban areas in the s, when import competition forced domestic manufacturers to lower costs. Rural areas generally have lower wages, property taxes, and land prices, making these areas relatively attractive to manufacturing firms. Overall, manufacturing is no longer the driver of job growth that it once was. Between and , a period that included two recessions (in and -09), manufacturing employment fell close to 30 percent. In addition, 71 percent of U.S. counties experienced a decline in manufacturing employment. Counties with the largest relative declines were concentrated in the eastern United States, the traditional hub of U.S. manufacturing. Despite the relative importance of manufacturing to the rural economy, economic restructuring is altering job opportunities for rural areas of the country. Rural manufacturing employment was smaller both in relative and absolute terms in than in . There were 21 percent fewer manufacturing jobs while total employment grew almost 7 percent. That is, manufacturing employment became a smaller piece of a larger pie. When a manufacturing plant closes in a community, there is a reduction in local employment, earnings, and government tax revenue. To better understand factors affecting manufacturing plant survival, another ERS study, released in May, followed the plants from until the end of , if they survived that long. It found that rural plants have a higher survival rate than urban plants. All else being equal, plants in urban counties were 23 percent less likely to survive than plants in rural counties.  Survival rates were significantly lower for textile and apparel manufacturing industries than other industries. In rural America, textile and apparel manufacturing plants had a 26-percent survival rate between and . During the same period, rural plants as a whole had a 57-percent survival rate. Trade-related policy changes and automation were two of the reasons for textiles and apparel manufacturing declines during the study period. Manufacturing is relatively more important to the rural economy than the urban economy.

This led to a shift of manufacturing jobs from urban areas to rural areas, where wages, property taxes, and land prices were generally lower."
