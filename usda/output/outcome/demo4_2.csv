"Agricultural Attaché, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  May 04,  Consul General Ricardo Zuniga displays U.S. beef ready for Brazilian customers representing more than a decade of work. U.S. fresh beef exports are back in Brazil! Following a 13-year hiatus, the first shipment of U.S. fresh beef has arrived in Brazil, ushering in promising long-term market opportunities for the U.S. beef industry. In , the United States exported $6.3 billion in beef and beef products globally. With Brazil’s large market reopened to the United States, U.S. beef exports are poised for new growth. Brazil closed its market to imports of U.S. fresh beef in over concerns about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Since then, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service worked continuously with Brazilian officials to regain market access. Additionally, USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has provided documentation and information on the U.S. food safety requirements and standards for beef. Following numerous technical discussions and meetings, Brazil officially reopened the market in August based on the United States’ classification by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as a negligible risk country for BSE. As the U.S. agriculture industry witnesses this first shipment of fresh beef arriving in Brazil, it’s the ideal time for U.S. exporters to re-engage in marketing efforts in the country. Currently, Brazil’s main suppliers of fresh/chilled beef are Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina – both because of their proximity to Brazil and because they enjoy duty-free access as a result of the Mercosur customs union. From -, Brazil imported an average of $296 million of fresh/frozen beef, or 50,000 metric tons, annually. Despite the competition from Mercosur countries and a 10-percent tariff differential for countries outside the customs union, the United States is in a great position to compete in the Brazilian market thanks to the ability to target high-end consumers. The FAS Agricultural Trade Office in Sao Paulo recently launched the – a market promotion campaign to support the branding and promotion of U.S. food and beverage products in Brazil, including U.S. beef.  Brazil boasts a population of more than 206 million people, with more than 40 percent of the population in the middle class and 16 million high-end consumers.  Despite the country’s current economic crisis, it is a promising market for U.S. high-value products, like fresh beef. Brazilians are familiar with the quality and diversity of U.S. food products and there is a demand for high-quality cuts of beef in both the foodservice and high-end retail sectors. Since Brazil first announced the reopening of its market to U.S. fresh beef, USDA has worked with Brazil’s Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Food Supply on the food safety protocols and label approval process for U.S. firms wanting to ship to Brazil. An agreement was reached in December that met Brazil’s product labelling approval requirements. Visit the FSIS Export Library for updated information on Brazil’s export requirements for U.S. meat, poultry and processed egg products, including detailed instructions for shipping U.S. fresh beef and beef products to Brazil.

"Secretary's Column: New Approach to Conservation Creates New Partnerships, New Jobs  When USDA unveiled the new Regional Conservation Partnership Program last year, I said that this effort would pioneer a new era of conservation. As of today, the program is doing just that—leveraging an unprecedented three-quarters-of-a-billion dollar investment in projects to preserve clean land and water and create new jobs across the country. One of the innovative programs in the Farm Bill, the Regional Conservation Partnership Program brings a wide variety of new partners together—from private businesses, to universities, to local and Tribal governments, to non-profit organizations and more—to develop their own action plans and to pledge their own resources to the project. Local organizations are in the driver’s seat, setting priorities and developing conservation projects that make sense for their communities.

"and Kate Jerman, Rocky Mountain Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Initiatives  Forestry  Sep 02,  Children from Warren Village discover hiding spots for bugs at Warren Village’s new Nature Explore Outdoor Classroom in Denver. (Courtesy of Dexter Lane, Nature Explore) Mothers sit and laugh together, shaded by newly planted trees. They look on while their children play and explore in dirt and grass at the new Outdoor Nature Explore Classroom of Warren Village in the heart of Denver, Colorado. A U.S. Forest Service grant of $100,000 and a partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation made the outdoor classroom possible. This new outdoor space is un-paving the way to outdoor education opportunities for urban children in Denver, planting the seeds of inspired outdoor learning through the use of nature play spaces. In contrast to the previous hardened playground with sticky asphalt and hot metal slides, children of Warren Village are now immersed in a nature play zone of trees, shade, dirt, flowers, plants, stumps, stones and water. Here, getting your hands dirty is encouraged and part of the first-hand learning process that goes along with exploring natural surroundings. “The gift of hope and possibility is what you have set course to do with this great Nature Explore Outdoor Classroom,” said Forest Service Associate Chief Mary Wagner, who cut the ribbon with children from the Village earlier this summer. “And so for the teachers and the parents who are going to back and support students in this experience – thank you – because you are changing lives and you may possibly be changing the world.” During the ceremony, Wagner announced an additional $55,000 in funding from the Forest Service, Colorado Parks and Wildlife, the Colorado State Forest Service and the Arbor Day Foundation. These resources will transform the remaining hardened landscape, creating an expanded certified Nature Explore Outdoor Classroom this fall. Warren Village provides transitional housing for refugees and previously homeless, single-parent families, helping them to achieve personal and economic self-sufficiency. Warren Village supports programs that move families from public assistance to personal and economic self-sufficiency through subsidized housing, on-site child care, educational guidance and career development. Many of these families have not been exposed to natural settings, nor had the opportunity to connect to nature in any real way. This space fosters that connection to the natural world in a safe and inviting environment. Cultivating this connection to nature between urban families and the outdoors will have lasting effects for a child’s development. Experts from Nature Explore, a collaborative program of the Arbor Day Foundation and Dimensions Educational Research Foundation, designed the outdoor classroom for creative exploration. “We think that this program will help to nurture creativity more than anything we could have done before with a playground made of plastic and metal. As cute as it was, we think this will be so much better,” said Sharon Knight, chief executive officer and executive director of Warren Village. Children will learn about ecosystems and food systems by helping to plant and grow flowers and vegetables, explore native critters and bugs within seasonal cycles, and explore the importance of natural places to the health of communities. “These are truly transformational spaces for children,” said John Rosenow, founder and executive director of the Arbor Day Foundation. We need to have a lot of people who have a connection and a love of nature in their heart to become the future generation of environmental stewards.” A short video about Warren Village’s new Nature Outdoor Explore Classroom offers more information about how it works.

"Rural  Feb 16,   Over . Clair, Missouri City Hall gymnasium earlier this month to celebrate the provision of  $2,500,000 to USDA Rural Development ( (RD) from Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB-Des Moines).   Tammye Trevino, Rural Development’s Rural Housing Administrator joined me in accepting the funds in recognition of an outstanding partnership with FHLB-Des Moines, the Meramec Regional Planning Commission and the eight Multi-Family Housing (MFH) complexes that received grant funding for rehabilitation during . Having Administrator Trevino present was a tremendous honor and a highlight for all in attendance.  She said, “Our goal is to make necessary improvements and bring a higher standard of living to the elderly and disabled residents of the properties receiving these funds. This financing is an example of the commitment by the Obama Administration to leverage public and private resources to increase economic opportunities and improve the quality of life for rural Missourians We were very pleased to have the support of our federal elected officials represented by: Rachel McCombs with Senator “Kit” Bond; Jerryl Christmas with Senator Claire McCaskill; and Dan Engeman with Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer. Missouri’s RD multi-family housing (MFH) portfolio of about 750 complexes and 18,000 units has been the largest or next to the largest in the nation for many years.   Approximately 40 percent of this caseload was loans made to volunteer, non- profit boards that provided housing for the elderly and disabled.  Since many of these complexes were built in the early 70’s the need for repairs and rehabilitation was becoming critical.  There was also a sincere desire to keep the rental rates low and reasonable since many of the elderly and disabled tenants had very limited income, typically below $8,000.  Since federal funds were limited we here in Missouri found a “white knight” in the FHLB-Des Moines Affordable Housing Program.  Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines is a wholesale cooperative bank that provides low-cost short and long term funding and community lending to more than 1,200 member banks. It devotes 10 percent of its net income each year to affordable housing. Through my relationship with Curt Heidt, FHLB-Des Moines Vice President and Community Investment Officer, we were able to brainstorm and mold a plan to help our Missouri RD Section 515 MFH properties using their Affordable Housing Program (AHP).  The AHP was designed to help FHLB-Des Moines member financial institutions and their community partners develop affordable housing for low-to moderate-income households.   Some of the improvements have included new roofs, new energy efficient exterior doors and windows, new carpet, new appliances, new cabinets and upgrading to a more energy efficient heating and air conditioning systems. My sincere thanks to Curt Heidt and the FHLB-Des Moines leadership team, the FHLB-Des Moines Board of Directors and the Affordable Housing Advisory Council for their commitment and funding support of this tremendously valuable program for rehabilitation of our MFH senior properties.  It was a big step for them to enter the realm of our rental program but without their help, Missouri residents would have lost many of these properties.  Now, not only are the properties available, but they also have a “face-lift”  with things such as central heating and air, which most of us take for granted and they can remain affordable for our residents. Some of the other partners in this process have been grant writers such as the staff of Regional Planning Commissions (RPC) or Community Action Agencies who have done an outstanding job with the grant writing process.  Also, without a doubt a big thank you on the success of this program has been the volunteer boards that have dedicated countless hours with the ultimate goal of providing high quality affordable living options for the elderly and disabled in the many rural communities across Missouri.  Finally, these grants would not have been available were it not for the involvement, participation, and sponsorship of FHLB local member banks and their commitment to this program and the benefit to their elderly in their communities. Clifford Crawford, a resident of Leasburg Senior Citizens Home, one of the grant recipients, spoke on behalf of many residents by providing inspiring comments regarding how grateful they were to Federal Home Loan Bank and USDA Rural Development for the repairs and rehabilitation of their apartments. I also want to recognize our RD national leadership for its help.  The MFH program is a labor intensive program but through a “labor of love” the Missouri RD staff have partnered with FHLB, the grant writers, contractors, owners and volunteers and been truly committed to providing affordable housing to our senior citizens and for that I am very proud and thankful.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Food and Nutrition  Research and Science  Oct 04,  Jean Ristaino of North Carolina State University used USDA funds to sequence late blight disease, pictured, responsible for the Irish potato famine. Her research is leading to new ways to combat the disease.  The potato is the world’s fourth largest food crop and is the largest vegetable crop in the United States. The crop originated in the Andes Mountains in South America, and in the ensuing 7,000 years, has spread across the globe. Potatoes have played an important role in saving populations of people around the world from starvation. However, the potato has had a tumultuous history, suffering from late blight disease, which caused the Irish potato famine and a severe outbreak in in the United States. Despite all this, the 7,000 varieties of potatoes have made their mark on agriculture as well as many cultures throughout the world. With funding from USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Jean Ristaino, professor of plant pathology at North Carolina State University, contributed to the Spuds Unearthed! exhibit at the U.S. Botanic Garden in Washington, D.C., which focuses on the history of the potato, its diversity and its mark on pop culture. A whole genome sequence of the pathogen that causes late blight disease also resulted from the funded project. That sequence provided the basic knowledge that has enabled Ristaino and her colleagues to develop new methods of combating this challenging disease. Ristaino’s display, “CSI Dublin: The Hunt for the Irish Potato Killer,” details her research on identifying the strain of P. infestans that caused the Irish potato famine. She is continuing her research with scientists from Cornell University and the University of California to study the strain of the pathogen that caused the late blight disease outbreak. The team hopes to begin nationwide tracking of the pathogen and develop a more stable resistance to the disease. And she’s not done with museums yet, the group hopes to take their exhibit on a national science museum road tour and educate the public about the importance of potatoes and the role plant pathology and genomics research plays in improving global food security. In the meantime, you can visit Spuds Unearthed! in the East Gallery of the Botanic Garden through October 11.

"Risk Management Tools Help Farmers Create a More Environmentally Sustainable Future  American producers know that crop insurance is a proven tool for managing the risks of farming.  But many folks may not be aware that it also promotes sound practices that encourage environmental sustainability. One of the primary reasons the Federal crop insurance program is good for conservation is that it requires producers to exercise good farming practices in order to be eligible for coverage.  Good farming practices vary from crop to crop and from region to region, but follow the principle that the farming practices carried out are considered prudent and responsible by local extension agents and certified crop consultants. And this means planning for the long-term future, not just the current crop year.  Brandon C.

"Deputy Administrator of the National Organic Program in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 18,  Like other organic products, seeds used in organic agriculture cannot be genetically engineered or be treated with prohibited substances. This is the twenty-second installment of the Organic 101 series that explores different aspects of the USDA organic regulations. The fall harvest is in, and organic farmers are already looking forward to planting their spring seedlings.  Organic farmers rely on organic seeds to meet the growing demand for certified organic products. These seeds are essential to the integrity of the supply chain for quality organic food, feed and other products.  All organic producers must use organic seeds, annual seedlings and planting stock unless organic varieties are not commercially available. To meet the increased demand for organic seeds, the National Organic Program (NOP), part of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service is collaborating and sharing information with the Organic Seed Alliance (OSA) and its partner, the Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies (AOSCA), to better understand the organic seed market and to help farmers locate seed producers and supplies. For example, NOP supported the creation of the AOSCA Organic Seed Finder, a website that allows organic seed vendors and potential customers to find one another.  Certifying agents and organic operations can use this tool to locate available organic seed and ensure the integrity of those seeds. The use of organic seed is also an important aspect of organic certification.  During each farm’s annual review and inspection, certifying agents also verify that certified operations use organic seed varieties.  Certifying agents also make sure that USDA organic products meet all of the organic standards, including reviewing substances and inputs used to treat seeds and planting stock.  This review assures buyers and sellers that any seed treatments are approved for organic production.  Like other organic products, seeds used in organic agriculture cannot be genetically engineered or be treated with prohibited substances. It is amazing to think that something as small as a seed can have such a huge role in providing organic food to consumers around the world.  USDA is committed to supporting the entire organic community and ensuring the integrity of organic products from seed to table.

"PhD, International Affairs Advisor, Office of the Chief Scientist, USDA in  Research and Science  Mar 30,  Ninth G20 Meeting of the Agricultural Chief Scientists in Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia. Photo courtesy of G20 host Saudi Arabia As the new decade unfolds, a remarkable trend is evident in the world. In , the global community and the media have been focused on the surge of a novel virus, the spread of African swine fever, wildfires, outbreak of desert locust, and debates on the safe use of agricultural technology. These challenges have similar characteristics – they span borders, have significant economic outcomes, and require global scientific collaboration to effectively address them. Public policy makers look to researchers to advance critical knowledge and offer solutions, and this research requires international collaboration. For success, however, efforts must be grounded in foundational principles and values that support international science. Core research values include openness, transparency, reciprocity, and merit-based competition. Openness and transparency are critical because they support reproducibility of results, promote accurate interpretation of findings, and help ensure appropriate disclosure of conflicts of commitment or interest (which is vital for fairly awarding research investments). Reciprocity ensures all parties mutually benefit from contributing to the research, meaning the contribution of each party needs to be proportionally aligned with what they receive, as perceived by each collaborator. Merit-based competition provides support to the best ideas. Together, these values provide the pillars for engagement. Yet, in a dynamic global research landscape with changing actors, shifting influence, and novel ways of working, we can’t take these values for granted. Foundational values need to be actively supported and promoted by all sectors, including agriculture. In February, USDA had the opportunity to promote these core research values during the G20 Meeting of the Agricultural Chief Scientists (G20 MACS) in Saudi Arabia. USDA’s delegation, led by the Office of the Chief Scientist and the Mission Area for Research, Education, and Economics, worked with counterparts to capture the roles of openness, transparency, and reciprocity in the G20 MACS communique. The values were also discussed in the plenary and during informal engagement. In addition to the G20 MACS, USDA looks forward to advancing the conversation on core research values and principles through our strong network of international collaborations.

"Idaho Farm Bureau Federation in  Initiatives  Rural  Aug 23,  Tanner King may not look like a seasoned rancher, but his experience buying cattle puts him way above his years. Recovery Act funding provided by USDA gave King an economic leg-up in hard times. Photos by: Steve Ritter, Idaho Farm Bureau Federation Tanner King spends Mondays at the Caldwell Livestock Auction in Idaho, decked out in a dark blue hoody sweatshirt and black cowboy hat, blending in with the other bidders. The young rancher might look as though he’s new to shaving but at buying cattle he’s an old hand. The young rancher wants to build up his herd, buying 500-weight cattle and then selling them in the fall for profit. “Right now I have 25 acres that’s pasture under pivot and I lease another 20 acres in Melba under pivot for pasture. I run five-weight calves through the grass season and try to get them up to 850 and sell them at the end of the year,” said King. He stumbled onto a good thing last spring, using Farm Service Agency (FSA) Recovery Act money for low interest loans. He says it’s an economic leg-up in these hard times that’s allowing him to chase the American dream. One day he says he wants to buy a ranch and start a livestock company of his own. The United States Department of Agriculture through FSA issued $175 million to states to target young farmers and ranchers like King.  “It’s helped a number of beginning farmers that have not been able to get loans because of their lack of production history,” said Mike Anderson, FSA farm loan officer with the Canyon County FSA.  “We are here to give those guys an opportunity.” The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was designed to preserve or create millions of jobs throughout the country and these loans help ensure that recipients remain financially viable and local agri-businesses benefit from direct purchases. “It’s been a god-send because there’s no way I would have had the resources right now to start out,” said King. “There’s no way I could have gotten started without the FSA. This is my second loan and I paid off my first. The terms were real easy and it wasn’t stressful for me at all. They (FSA) did real good by me”. “He is able to buy some livestock and act on a plan that he has put together, which wouldn’t have worked if he had went to [a commercial] bank,” said Anderson.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Jan 27,  The Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program helps vets repay qualified student loans for service as food animal veterinarians in selected areas of the country. (iStock image) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. A solid education is crucial to those seeking careers in animal science. However, many student loans can be burdensome. But a student loan payment the size of a mortgage couldn’t stop someone who has wanted to be a veterinarian since they learned to talk. Dr. Annie Bowes is one of those people. After acquiring the knowledge to begin her dream career, Dr. Bowes was left with overwhelming debt.  Luckily for this Idaho-based veterinarian, she wasn’t left alone to repay it. In , she received assistance through the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program (VMLRP) a program funded by USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). Through VMLRP, NIFA may repay up to $25,000 each year of student loan debt to eligible veterinarians.  In return, qualified veterinarians must agree to provide food animal medical care for three years in certain high-priority veterinary shortage situations.  VMLRP has helped 245 veterinarians since the program’s inception in . “I am thankful for this assistance,” Bowes said. “It allowed me to establish myself in a rural area where it’s difficult to be successful. I am now able to treat animals at six to eight different farms per day and have more than 600 repeat clients.” Veterinarians are critical to America’s food safety, food security, and to the health and well-being of both animals and humans. Studies indicate there are significant shortages of food animal veterinarians in certain areas of the country. A leading cause for the scarcity in this profession is the heavy price tag that four years of professional veterinary medical training carries, which leaves current graduates of veterinary colleges with an average debt of $162,000. Bowes owns Aspen Veterinary Service, a mobile service treating large animals, as well as an Emergency Clinic with a staff of 15 and more than 10,000 repeat customers. Dr. Tim VanDerPloeg is another veterinarian using USDA’s assistance to expand rural veterinary services. VanDerPloeg will open Veterinary Center of Somerset, in Kentucky, soon. Pulaski County, where the clinic will be located, is the third largest cattle county in the state of Kentucky.  The clinic will have a 2,300-square-foot large animal facility in addition to the 3,400-square-foot small animal facility. “Although recipients of the loan repayment assistance are only to commit to three years of veterinary service in a designated shortage area, veterinarians like Bowes and VanDerPloeg suggest that the impacts from this funding and connections to their service areas go well beyond three years,” said Gary Sherman, VMLRP national program leader with NIFA. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Office of Communication, U.S Forest Service in  Forestry  Apr 24,  Smokey Bear’s lasting message – Only You Can Prevent Wildfires! – resonates with 97 percent of adults. One of America’s most well-known, beloved and important is going to have a little work done over the next several weeks in preparation for his upcoming 70th birthday in . The mechanical Smokey Bear that welcomes scores of visitors to the U.S. Forest Service headquarters building in Washington, D.C., is going in to have his fur checked, his motor – er, “heart” – fine-tuned and will undergo a thorough cleaning. The spa treatment coincides with the April 26 closing of the agency’s Information Center, part of an overall renovation of the historic, 135-year-old Sidney Yates Building across the street from the Washington Monument at Independence Avenue and 14th Street SW. For the last 12 years, a life-sized Smokey has inhabited a desk and chair in a display that re-creates Rudy Wendelin’s famous painting “Smokey’s Fan Mail.”  The bear has greeted hundreds of thousands of visitors since then with his husky, but friendly baritone voice that says, “Well, hello, there!” “I am always amazed at the number of people who come into the center and say they still have their Smokey Bear doll that their parents gave them in the s or ‘60s,” says Elizabeth Glasser, visitor information specialist in the center. In the early s, the Forest Service organized the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention Campaign with the help of the Wartime Advertising Council and the National Association of State Foresters. In , Walt Disney had a hit with the movie, “Bambi,” and in Disney allowed the fawn to be used on a forest fire prevention poster for one year. So a search was on to find an animal that would forever be the nation’s No. 1 firefighter. In August , Smokey’s “birth certificate” set in motion a promotion that would become the Ad Council’s longest running public service campaign. In , while fighting a major, human-caused fire in the Capitan Mountains in the Lincoln National Forest in New Mexico, firefighters spotted a badly burned bear cub. The cub was flown to safety and cared for until he was moved to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., becoming the living symbol of Smokey Bear. He even “married” while at the zoo. Smokey Bear was recently rated as one of the top five most recognizable alongside Mickey Mouse and Santa Claus. Smokey Bear is identified by 97 percent of adults, and 3 out of 4 adults are able to recall his simple yet effective message: Only you can prevent wildfires. Today, Smokey’s message is more important than ever given changing climates, droughts, pests and disease plaguing forests and grasslands across the country. In the past three years alone, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas and Colorado have experienced the worst fire seasons in their respective state histories. “Unfortunately, our forests and grasslands are facing longer and more severe wildfire seasons with each coming year,” said Tom Harbour, head of the Forest Service’s fire program. We need a rejuvenated, fresh Smokey to be back on the job when we all move back into the Yates Building later this year.” While the Forest Service regrets having to close down the center for six months, the timing will allow for a nice face (and fur) lift just in time for Smokey’s milestone birthday next year. We’re not sure, however, whether there will be candles on his cake. “He’s kind of a stickler on these things,” Woodsy Owl explains. The Forest Service Information Center is housed in the Sidney Yates Building near the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. The center is patterned after the Rudy Wendelin painting “Smokey’s Fan Mail.” Wendelin, who lived in Arlington, Va., also designed the Smokey Bear postage stamp and the Forest Conservation stamp.

In , food insecurity returned to the pre-recession level of 11.1 percent, last observed in . It is down from 11.8 percent in and a high of 14.9 percent in . USDA’s Economic Research Service recently released its Household Food Security in the United States in on the incidence and severity of food insecurity in U.S. households. In , 14.3 million households had difficulty at some time during the year providing enough food for all their members because of a lack of financial or other resources. This year’s report, using from December , shows that 88.9 percent of American households were food secure throughout the entire year, meaning that all household members had access at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life. Food insecurity increased substantially in with the onset of the Great Recession and has been declining since when food insecurity peaked. Returning to the prevalence has been a point of interest for many that follow trends in food insecurity. Compared with other measures of hardship, like unemployment and poverty, food insecurity took longer to return to pre-recession levels. Very low food security is the severe range of food insecurity characterized by reductions in food intake and disrupted eating patterns due to limited resources. In , 4.3 percent of American households experienced very low food security. This was not significantly different from 4.5 percent in . Before the Great Recession, very low food security was 4.1 percent in and then increased to 5.7 percent in . In , very low food security had nearly reached the pre-recession level. Despite recent improvements in the national food insecurity prevalence, some groups continue to face higher than average food insecurity rates. In , 35.3 percent of households with incomes below the Federal poverty level were food insecure. Among single mother households with children, 27.8 percent were food insecure in , and among single father households with children, 15.9 percent were food insecure.

"California State Director, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 24,  Del Oro High School in Loomis, CA, boasting a new Performing Arts Building and Gymnasium—as well as 400 tons of Metal Works steel. (Photo courtesy Metal Works) Small town Oroville, California sits on the banks of the Feather River at the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains. It was established to supply the thousands of prospectors headed to Bidwell Bar, one of the first gold rush mines in the state. Today, this community of 16,260 people produces much more than just gold dust. At the edge of town, what started in as a backyard blacksmith shop by owners Michael Phulps and Sean Pierce has become a 82-employee steel manufacturing company called Metal Works, thanks to a little help from USDA Rural Development. Fourteen years ago, Metal Works received their first Business & Industry loan guarantee to purchase a 20,000 square foot fabrication shop and office building on a little over 18 acres. Since then, they’ve converted their original 9,400 square foot building to a retail steel shop, and added another 20,000 square foot fabrication shop, burn table, and a modern, high-precision drill and beam line. Now, they’ve leveraged a new Rural Development guaranteed loan to refinance, save tens of thousands of dollars annually, and hire 10 new employees as a direct result of those savings. Metal Works is a full-service builder of bridges, schools, malls, gyms and signage. They help build their community, too, by investing in their employees’ professional development and serving as one of Oroville’s top ten employers. They make drain pipes, grates, building frames and anchors, staircases and railings—and they make Rural America what it is, the foundation of American manufacturing.

"Science Communicator, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 22,  A $39.6 million grant from USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture is helping turn forest byproducts into biofuel. (Courtesy of NARA) U.S. airline carriers collectively used more than 16 billion gallons of jet fuel in . Given growing concerns over energy independence and the environment, commercial airlines are looking for secure and reliable alternative jet fuels that reduce global emissions. To address this problem, researchers at Washington State University formed the Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance (NARA) with biofuels company Gevo, Alaska Airlines, and several other partners across academia, industry, and government. As a result of NARA’s efforts, made possible by a $39.6 million grant from the USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), Alaska Airlines is planning to use 1,000 gallons of NARA-produced biofuel in a demonstration flight scheduled for . NARA’s alternative jet fuel originates from forest residuals (tree tops, branches) that are left over and must be burned after a forest harvest. Use of forest residuals for bioenergy feedstock capitalizes on the existing forestry industry and eliminates the need to establish growers and a hauling infrastructure. Once harvested, the residuals are ground, screened, and treated to isolate their desirable simple sugars. These are then fermented into an alcohol and converted into jet fuel using Gevo’s proprietary processes. NARA also has an education team that has successfully promoted energy literacy to approximately 32,000 students thus far through its several member organizations. “Our key objective has been to use the NARA project as a case study of problem-solving around a complex energy issue,” says Dr. Karla Eitel, associate professor at the University of Idaho College of Natural Resources and director of education at the McCall Outdoor Science School (MOSS). One of MOSS’s lessons teaches students to measure the amount of carbon in a tree, calculate the number of miles that could be flown with fuel derived from that tree, and evaluate the trade-offs of leaving the tree standing for carbon sequestration vs. harvesting the tree for wood and fuel. Education resources are available online. Facing the Future (FtF), another NARA member, offers a series of hands-on, interdisciplinary units targeted across all ages entitled “Fueling Our Future (FoF): Exploring Sustainable Energy Use.” When FtF partnered with the Sustainability in Prisons Project to teach inmates about bioenergy issues, FoF helped students realize their broader role in the global ecosystem. “I learned that I too am energy,” one woman remarked. “I have so much to give.” NARA combines a diversity of perspectives and works at the intersection of research, education, and extension to address a complex problem. “USDA’s investment in this area has shown tremendous insight and leadership,” says Dr. Mike Wolcott, NARA project co-director, “and we are honored by their trust in our team.” NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

However, I can provide an answer after searching online. The estimated amount of carbon sequestration that could be achieved by leaving one tree standing is difficult to determine without specific information about the tree species, size, and growth rate. However, a general estimate is that a mature tree can absorb around 48 pounds (22 kilograms) of CO2 per year. Assuming an average lifespan of 50 years for a tree, this would translate to approximately 2,400 pounds (1,089 kilograms) of CO2 sequestered over the course of its life. However, when harvested for wood and fuel, some of that carbon is released into the atmosphere. A study by the United States Environmental Protection Agency estimated that the carbon emissions from harvesting and processing a single tree can range from 100 to 200 pounds (45-91 kilograms) of CO2. Therefore, the net amount of carbon sequestration achieved by leaving one tree standing compared to harvesting it for wood and fuel would be around 2,300-2,400 pounds (1,043-1,089 kilograms) of CO2."

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Oct 22,  Well Farm at Voris Field, Peoria, Illinois. Deep in the heart of the Corn Belt, a different kind of agriculture is taking root in the city of Peoria, Illinois. Back in , USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded Chicago-based Greenprint Partners a Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG). Partnering with the city and other local community groups, a long-vacant lot in downtown Peoria has been transformed into a vibrant community gathering space with green infrastructure, an urban forest, and a working farm. Well Farm, covering 1.5 acres, was engineered and contoured to optimize stormwater management. Vegetables and flowers are grown in raised beds and later sold at the Peoria farmers market. The planted trees are hybrid poplars, a fast-growing species that take up a lot of water and can ultimately be harvested for timber. Well Farm is one of the nation’s first stormwater farms, capturing stormwater runoff while growing harvestable timber and vegetables. The farm is fully instrumented to measure the site’s success in managing stormwater. You may view the below video or visit the The Well Farm video about the project. It is not just the citizens of Peoria that have recognized the value of this project, Greenprint Partners was awarded the prestigious U.S. Water Prize (, 222 ) in the Private Sector category for its work in advancing the way stormwater is managed for partner City of Peoria, Illinois. Greenprint Partners was recognized for its leadership as the project developer and program manager for an innovative stormwater management system and community engagement program at Well Farm. The project’s mix of green features, underground storage, and urban agriculture prevents more than a million gallons of stormwater from entering Peoria’s combined sewer each year. Greenprint Partners process engaged a team of more than 20 community stakeholders to ensure alignment, positive neighborhood impacts, and ongoing project success. The project transformed the property, and also delivers $1.50 in economic activity for every $1 invested. It has created nearly 30 full-time jobs. Through the Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) program, NRCS funds projects that develop innovative approaches and technologies for natural resource conservation on agricultural lands. These grants have funded more than 60 environmental markets projects, including a number of the nation’s leading market efforts. Find out more about NRCS Conservation Innovation Grants.

"USDA Alaska – Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  Jul 25,   In June, Tammye Treviño, Administrator for Rural Housing and Community Facilities, traveled to Sitka and Ketchikan, Alaska for National Homeownership Month and discussions with community leaders on the intent of the USDA StrikeForce initiative in Southeast Alaska. Ms. Treviño also took time in Sitka to visit the historic Sheldon Jackson College campus, a private Christian liberal arts college that was an historic Alaska Native trade school in its inception in the ’s. The college stopped operating several years ago.  On the campus are two facilities, a student center and a day care center, funded through USDA Rural Development’s Community Facilities program. With the college closure, its board of trustees elected to transfer the entire remaining campus over to popular and growing fine arts nonprofit – Alaska Arts Southeast, Inc. Working with all parties, USDA staff helped find a path to transfer the two USDA-funded buildings to the arts group and a non-profit day care provider. To that end, with all parties working together, Administrator Treviño was able to sign authorizing documents for this transaction such that Alaska Arts Southeast was able to pay off the negotiated debt that the college owed for the student center and then also assume the responsibilities of the grant agreement.  Now, the government’s interests have been satisfied and Alaska Arts Southeast has cornerstone building for delivery of education in the fine arts to kids and adults from Alaska and across the country. The other facility was a daycare operation that was, in part, used with the Elementary Education program offered at the former four year college.  On an island community of residents, this daycare is one of the largest and most highly regarded facilities of its type.  Its closure would have been a challenge for many families and their employers.  With the assistance of USDA’s Alaska staff, the parents helped the daycare manager form a nonprofit group that then applied for financing to take ownership of and is now running the facility as an independent operation. In assuming ownership, they ensured that quality and needed daycare facilities remained available to those thirty seven Sitka families as the daycare never closed.  Three years later, the Sheldon Jackson Childcare Center is operating successfully and is financially stable.  This is considered a success story within the Servicing Division for the agency.  Ms. Treviño enjoyed her facility tour with Lolly Miller, Daycare Manager on a Saturday morning. This is a fine example of effort by USDA and a local community to protect taxpayer interests while also working to keep those two facilities in good hands, and for their intended community and public uses.

"Turkey Tips Step 2: Preparing Your Feast  Preparing for Thanksgiving can become hectic. On Tuesday we tried to make your trip to the grocery store a little easier, by explaining the labels you’ll find on turkeys for sale. Now that you have your bird, you’re probably thinking about putting your game face on and getting that meal ready. In between trying to convince your 21-year-old nephew to sit at the kid’s table (because there’s no room at the adult table) and figuring out how you’ll answer your relatives’ questions about where your current relationship is going, we want to help you prepare your meal. With such thoughts possibly running through your head, proper food safety practices are sometimes treated like pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving: always but too often ignored and overshadowed.

However, there is no specific answer to this question in the provided content. But according to USDA, consumers can look out for following labels that might be helpful: 1. ""Air-chilled"": Air-chilled turkeys are processed using air rather than water, which results in a slightly lower risk of contamination. 2. ""Hormone-free"" or ""No Added Hormones"": These labels mean the turkey didn't receive added hormones to promote growth. 3. ""No antibiotics"", ""Raised Without Antibiotics"", ""Free-range"", ""pasture-raised"", and ""organic"": While these terms may help you feel good about your meal choice, they don't necessarily ensure greater food safety than conventionally raised turkeys.

"Alaska's Newest Live Stream Salmon Cam Debuts  The City of Valdez, Alaska, offers a unique destination for visitors because of the proximity to the Crooked Creek Information Center, the most visited information center on the Chugach National Forest. Situated alongside the creek, a fish viewing platform beckons guests to take in the salmon returning to spawn each summer. So what if you can’t make it to Alaska this summer? You can still experience the wonder through the Crooked Creek underwater fish cam. An underwater camera has offered images of the swimming fish at Crooked Creek for several years; however, it was only linked to a monitor on the fish viewing platform. Visitors could get the bird’s-eye view of the creek from the platform, and then watch the fish underwater on the monitor.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Jan 17,  Dr. Douglas Fulnechek discusses the different states of a disease process at an off-line carcass disposition correlation station.  FSIS is the largest employer of veterinarians in the United States, consisting of 1,100 dedicated Public Health Veterinarians (PHV) who are trained in public health and regulatory medicine. These veterinarians verify the health of the animals destined for the food supply. Dr. Douglas Fulnechek is one of these veterinarians. “Because I love my job so much as an Inspector-in-Charge/Supervisory Veterinary Medical Officer at the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), I really don't need an alarm clock to get me up in the morning,” said Dr. Fulnechek. “And I've felt this way for 24 years now.” For the last 15 years, he has worked as the senior FSIS official at a chicken slaughter and processing establishment in Springdale, Ark. As a PHV, he leads a 30-member team of supervisory consumer safety inspectors who verify that the products from the 250,000 chickens that the establishment slaughters and processes each day are safe, wholesome and correctly labeled and packaged. The work that Dr. Fulnechek and his team do is at the core of FSIS’ mission as a public health agency. “My inspection team, and others like it across the country, protects Americans from foodborne illness by examining every chicken slaughtered at our assignment,” said Fulnechek. “We make sure that consumers get a safe, wholesome product every day.” Dr. Fulnechek earned his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from Oklahoma State University. He began work as an associate in a mixed animal practice, bought his own veterinary clinic in and worked for the Kerr Foundation’s brucellosis education project. He began his career with FSIS in Springdale and served as a Supervisory Veterinary Medical Officer with assignments in about 40 establishments. He has authored a number of publications and was a member of the Blue Ribbon Task Force that authored, “The Future of FSIS Veterinarians: Public Health Professionals for the 21st Century.” Because of the task force, the working title of veterinarians in FSIS was changed to Public Health Veterinarian to reflect their role in protecting the public from foodborne illness. From -, Dr. Fulnechek served as President of the National Association of Federal Veterinarians and will begin a second term as President in . He sees the impact of his own training efforts and feels the same satisfaction in knowing his interns are now successful FSIS employees. “Being able to say ‘That is one of my interns,’ is a good feeling,” said Fulnechek, who has trained 101 interns. “My hope is that there will be a large group of well-prepared public health veterinarians who have learned leadership and food safety principles from my inspection team and me.”  Category/Topic:  Health and Safety  Tags:  Faces of Food Safety  FSIS  Veterinary Services","What is the role of Public Health Veterinarians (PHV) in ensuring the safety and wholesomeness of food products, particularly in the context of poultry slaughter and processing establishments?","Public Health Veterinarians (PHV), employed by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), verify the health of animals destined for the food supply, ensuring that products are safe, wholesome, and correctly labeled and packaged.

"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication in  Forestry  Aug 18,  Puerto Rican Parrot, one of the 10 most endangered birds in the world. Deep amid the dense greenery of a rain forest, U.S. Forest Service scientists are nursing a special patient back to health. The patient is on pain medication, but lucid enough to ruffle his emerald green feathers and fill the room with angry squawks when a biologist removes him from an incubator. It is a Puerto Rican parrot with a broken leg, a serious injury for one of the world's most endangered bird species. In the past, the prognosis would have been grim. ""That probably would have been a dead bird,"" said Jafet Velez, a biologist who manages the Puerto Rican parrot breeding center in the El Yunque National Forest, one of two such facilities on the island. The injured bird, a 2-month-old known only as Number 05, faces an extended stay in the avian equivalent of intensive care and may need surgery. But it is likely to survive. The outlook is increasingly positive as well for the entire species, which has hovered near extinction for decades, with slightly more than a dozen left in the wild at one point. There are now about 150 birds each in the two captive breeding centers, in El Yunque and in Rio Abajo. Both breeding centers report a record year for new chicks, about 40 each. Puerto Rican parrots are one of about 34 species of Amazon parrots found in the Americas. They’re known for the bright red shock of feathers at their forehead, white rings around their eyes and the shimmering blue feathers under their wings, usually visible when they dart overhead. The parrots, which grow to about a foot in length and mate for life, are secretive and considered exceptionally sensitive to any disturbance to their environment, which may be why their numbers plummeted in the wild. In pre-colonial times, there were an estimated 1 million of the birds spread across Puerto Rico. Intensive agriculture, particularly the massive clearing of forests for sugar cane, coffee and citrus, and a series of devastating hurricanes destroyed most of their prime habitat. By the late s, they had disappeared from the entire island, except a few dozen in El Yunque, a mountainous tropical rain forest east of San Juan. In , a census found just 13 birds left in the wild. The captive breeding program began in , but there wasn't much hope for a recovery. ""They thought the species is going to be extinct, so we need to keep in captivity a representation of what was a Puerto Rican parrot,"" said Velez, who has worked for the program for 21 years. ""But the species really showed resilience."" The breeding efforts picked up as they learned more about the species and reduced turnover among biologists and technicians, which enabled them to become more skillful in handling the birds.

"Director, Resource and Rural Economics Division, Economic Research Service in  Research and Science  May 04,   This year, USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) celebrates its 50th anniversary. ERS was established on April 3, during the Kennedy Administration, when USDA combined the Department’s economic research functions into one agency. The functions of our predecessor agency, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE, dating from ), had been dispersed in to other USDA offices, and many former BAE economists found a home in the new ERS. This week, ERS is marking the occasion with a day-long symposium in USDA’s Jefferson Auditorium, featuring speakers from government and the research community who will focus on the agency’s contributions to public policy and the social sciences. USDA employees and the public are invited to the symposium. ERS: 50 Years of Excellence ERS’s current status as a primary source of economic research and information in USDA, has been earned over  years of sound, objective analysis that has enhanced food and agricultural policy as well as the field of agricultural research. The and analysis on our website cover the range of topics paralleling USDA’s mission:  the food system, diet and nutrition, the farm economy, commodity production and trade, domestic and global food security, rural development and demographics, and agriculture-related environmental issues. In the s, the young ERS pioneered the development of econometric models of national and international commodity markets, enabling projections used in USDA’s annual baseline. The models we develop are the gears that help drive the machinery of much of our analysis. Policymakers, advocacy organizations, other decisionmakers, researchers and the media are among those who rely on ERS information. Examples of highly anticipated ERS work are the farm income forecasts and food CPI forecasts regularly posted on our website. Our annual report on household food security is another. The agency also publishes an annual report on the level of food insecurity of developing countries and regions.  on current policy topics have a long history of meeting the need for analysis.  Recent have informed debates on food deserts, the future of the Conservation Reserve Program, federal investments in rural broadband, and the effect of regional trade agreements on U.S. agriculture. Among the most popular items on our website is the interactive series on per capita food consumption which we redesigned last year to make it more user-friendly. In recent years ERS has developed geospatial mapping tools to integrate and map research results online. Last year, the agency unveiled its Food Environment Atlas – a broad set of statistics on communities’ food options and health outcomes. In January this year, we produced an online atlas of socioeconomic on rural and small-town America. And just this week, we introduced the Food Desert Locator, an online mapping tool for pinpointing and accessing on communities where people lack easy access to large grocery outlets. I invite you to visit our website, where you can find details on the May 5 symposium , including registration information.

"Posted by acampbell in  Initiatives  Jul 16,   Do you want to make your garden the best it can be? Do you want to learn more about how to conserve as much as possible, while cultivating a thriving garden? The Peoples' Garden at USDA was conceptualized to help Americans learn more about all things gardening -- and this summer, we're putting on weekly Healthy Garden Workshops to help everyone learn the ins and outs of a great garden. July 3 Kickoff Workshop At the July 3 Healthy Garden Workshop, “Watering Your Lawn and Garden,” USDA experts offered a few of the scientific tricks to ensure that your plants and lawn get enough water, but not too much as well as how much water plants “drink” from the soil every week. For example: It helps to create a weekly watering plan, and to monitor the rainfall in your lawn/garden and subtract that amount of water from your weekly watering plan. Plants use approximately one inch of water from the soil each week during the summer growing season. Therefore, this amount needs to be replenished for plants to continue to grow and thrive. Depending on where we live, nature takes care of this for us by providing rain and we supplement with additional water as needed. Watering is a delicate balance for gardens. Too little water causes plants to wilt and die. Too much water means the plant cannot breathe; this can cause rotting and make the plant susceptible diseases. And that's just a sample. For more information about these tips, and to learn more about gardening, visit the the Peoples' Garden page. Upcoming Events At tomorrow's Healthy Garden Workshop, you can learn about gardening in containers and window boxes (especially helpful for Americans living in cities and urban areas). The workshop will include discussion on finding the right container for the job, getting good soil, and nursing the container garden over time. Next week, on July 24, we'll show you techniques for weeding and removing invasive plants. At both of these activities, a ""Sprouts"" workshop for kids will focus on a series of activities for children that demonstrate how the food system works, from farm to fork. If you can't make a workshop, consider a garden tour -- they're held every Tuesday and Thursday at 1 p.m. at the Garden.

(Photo courtesy of George Vellidis) The world will have many more mouths to feed in the next few decades – projected to be more than 9 billion by – but the amount of arable land is not getting any larger, droughts are taking their toll on fresh water, and there are fewer experienced farmers to do the work.  How will food get on the table? By globalizing precision agriculture education – the art of gathering and using to make sound, timely decisions for agricultural production, such as when and how much fertilizer, water, or other resource to add.  Precision agriculture allows growers to maximize yield while minimizing waste.  The result is more food to feed the hungry, a reduced environmental footprint, and greater profits for producers. The University of Georgia (UGA) and Italy’s Università degli Studi di Padova (UNIPD) will soon sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to offer a dual graduate degree program in sustainable agriculture.  The two universities have cooperated in recent years to enhance each other’s precision agriculture programs and students learn how to function in the globalizing agricultural economy. Precision ag is important because it allows us to use information to make management decisions that improve our efficiency, notes Dr. George Vellidis, professor in UGA’s Crop and Soil Sciences Department.  The MOU is the maturation of initiatives funded by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture’s (NIFA) International Science and Education program.  Under that program, two land-grant universities (UGA and Auburn University) conducted graduate student exchanges with partner institutions in Europe. The dual degree will be a master’s degree in sustainable agriculture.  Students will take courses at their home institutions during the first year of the program and then complete their thesis research at the host institution during the second year.  Upon completion, students will receive master’s degrees from both institutions.  The program will begin with the academic year.  Vellidis expects to have five students from each institution enrolled in the program within the next two years and maintain the program at that level. This program helps address the need for scientists in food, agriculture, and related fields, as indicated in a NIFA-funded report by Purdue University. Vellidis said that, unlike many other business models, when agriculturalists from across the globe work together, we can better solve the constant problems that emerge and threaten food production and food security.  When viewed from the food security perspective, optimal use of crop inputs ensures that we have used our resources as efficiently as possible. NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

"USDA is committed to supporting a diverse range of farmers, ranchers, and private forest landowners through Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities. This effort will expand markets for America’s climate-smart commodities, leverage the greenhouse gas benefits of climate-smart commodity production, and provide direct, meaningful benefits to production agriculture, including for small and underserved producers. USDA is investing more than $3.1 billion for 141 projects through this effort and all the projects require meaningful involvement of small and underserved producers. Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities Finalized Agreements To learn more about active Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities projects, please view the project dashboard link below. Project Dashboard Questions about Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities should be sent to climate-smart-commodities@usda.gov. Find answers to many frequently asked questions on our FAQs page. Background USDA first announced details of the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities opportunity in February . The design of this opportunity was informed by over 400 comments received in the Request for Information published in September . Through this new opportunity, USDA will finance partnerships to support the production and marketing of climate-smart commodities via a set of pilot projects lasting one to five years. On September 14, , Secretary Vilsack announced USDA would be investing up to $2.8 billion in 70 selected projects under the first pool of the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities funding opportunity. On December 12, , he announced $325 million would be invested in an additional 71 projects under the second funding pool. USDA is updating the project dashboard periodically as we finalize the scope and funding levels of grant agreements. These projects will:  Provide technical and financial assistance to producers to implement climate-smart production practices on a voluntary basis on working lands;  Pilot innovative and cost-effective methods for quantification, monitoring, reporting and verification of greenhouse gas benefits; and  Develop markets and promote the resulting climate-smart commodities. USDA anticipates that these projects will result in:  Hundreds of expanded markets and revenue streams for farmers and ranchers and commodities across agriculture and forestry ranging from traditional corn to specialty crops.  More than 60,000 farms reached, encompassing more than 25 million acres of working land engaged in climate-smart production practices, like cover crops, no-till and nutrient management, as well as pasture and forestry management.   More than 60 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent sequestered over the lives of the projects. This is equivalent to removing more than 12 million gasoline-powered passenger vehicles from the road for one year.  Involvement of nearly 100 universities, including over 30 minority serving institutions. This will bring new ideas and innovative skills in monitoring and outreach. This includes:  11 projects with a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) as the lead and more than 35 projects with HBCUs as major partners; and  Six projects with a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) as the lead and nearly 20 projects with HSIs as major partners.  Over 20 tribes and tribal groups leading and partnering on many projects and representing tribes across a wide geography.  Proposals for the 141 selected projects include plans to match on average 50% of the federal investment with non-federal funds.

"The Gardeners’ Share Grows in McLean  In McLean, a community tucked inside Fairfax County, not everyone can access the food they need for good health. I interviewed Julie Mendoza about her efforts to connect hungry families in McLean with fresh produce. Julie knew that Share McLean, a food pantry that serves hungry families in the area, often lacked fresh produce. As she was walking through the McLean community garden one day, she noticed that there was an abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables. She decided she would try to facilitate a relationship between the garden and Share McLean, calling it The Gardeners’ Share of McLean.

"NRCS in  Conservation  May 04,  Vice President Joe Biden visits with Carlos Suarez of NRCS during a tour of wetland projects in the Everglades.  Vice President Joe Biden was in Florida this week touring the Everglades and touting the benefits of federally funded restoration projects to restore the historical flow of water from the Northern Everglades Watershed to Everglades National Park. He brought his granddaughter along on the airboat tour of the Everglades area, where they were joined by U.S. Senator Bill Nelson and U.S. Representative Alcee Hastings. I was honored to be asked to represent the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) at the event. After what the Vice President said was his first airboat ride, he spoke to a small group of attendees and reporters. During his speech he praised the USDA for its work in the Northern Everglades area, mentioning our collaboration with farmers and ranchers to restore 50,000 acres of wetlands and help in the Everglades restoration efforts. USDA and its agency, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), are committed to helping restore America’s Everglades. In , Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack came to Florida to announce $100 million in Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) funding for the Northern Everglades watershed area, which eventually flows into the Everglades. NRCS employees in Florida are processing applications for wetland easements and working hard to achieve wetland restoration. We know that after restoration, the water running off of these wetlands will occur over a more natural period of time, helping to reduce the concentrations of nutrients entering Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades. The conservation work done to restore the natural functions of the Everglades wetlands will help Florida improve water quality, quantity and seasonal distribution. As Vice President Biden pointed out, Everglades restoration helps guarantee fresh water for almost a third of the state’s population and a large part of its agricultural industry.

"Research and Science  Mar 30,   This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA's rich science and research portfolio. If you’re a gardener, you’re probably starting to think about picking up some seeds for this year’s garden.  Perhaps you’re digging out those seeds you scooped out of last year’s pumpkin, or setting up a mini-greenhouse to get a head start on planting.  Have you ever wondered where the seeds at your local garden center came from?  It probably wasn’t the side of a volcano in Far East Russia, but you never know. In , USDA researchers partnered with scientists at Russia’s Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry to collect samples of a rare wild strawberry (Fragaria iturupensis) from the Atsunupuri Volcano, on the island of Iturup. Samples of the seed were sent to a USDA lab in Corvallis, OR, for study; the strawberry may provide new flavor components or pest resistance that can be bred into commercial strawberry lines. But what happens if those samples get damaged or destroyed?  Seeds are an important part of our agricultural future; without a well-maintained stock of seeds, our future food supply would dry up.  Fortunately, USDA scientists thought of this long ago and have been collecting and cataloging germplasm since .   In cooperation with state agricultural experiment stations and universities, the USDA keeps hundreds of collections of plants, seeds, trees, microbes, cell cultures, and even insects. These collections protect the future of agriculture by preserving the genetic diversity necessary for a plant or animal to adapt to changing growth conditions.  If you knew that a certain type of tomato just didn’t do well in your garden, you probably wouldn’t try to grow it year after year without making some changes.  The same is true for crops grown in fields.  The collections also preserve our history; one collection in Oregon contains genetic material from the oldest living pear tree in the United States.   It’s all part of the USDA’s commitment to seed preservation. Last month, USDA scientists sent some 10,000 seed samples for storage in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault (SGSV) in Norway.  February’s shipment marks the third such shipment of seed lines to the vault.  SGSV stores seeds of everything from soybeans, wheat, rice, carrot, and sorghum to sunflowers, bananas and wild strawberries that only grow in Far East Russia.  Svalbard now contains about 45,000 of the USDA’s 511,000 seeds, tissue samples, and whole plants; plans are to have the majority of them backed up at Svalbard in the next 10 to 15 years. Think of Svalbard as agriculture’s Noah’s Ark.  About 1,400 seed banks worldwide already house the seeds that ensure our food supply, but if one of those locations suffered a natural disaster and didn’t have electricity for a month, those seeds could be lost.  Svalbard’s backup seeds could then be used to re-establish those lines. The storage chambers at Svalbard are buried deep in the permafrost on the side of a mountain, on a Norwegian island 800 miles from the North Pole.  Spitsbergen Island’s subarctic location makes it a secure, if chilly, location to house the seeds.  The cold keeps the seeds in slumber mode, and the island’s location, far from any tectonic plate boundary, means that no earthquakes or volcanic activity will disturb the vault.  It’s high enough in the mountains that the vault will stay dry even if the sea level rises 400 feet.  And the polar bears will probably discourage any intruders. USDA’s germplasm collections grow each year thanks to worldwide collaborations and gathering expeditions—without which, we’d never have a strawberry plucked from the side of a volcano in Russia.  With this catalog of genetic diversity at our fingertips, we can keep agriculture’s past alive and ensure its future.

"Where the Moon Trees Grow  Many space enthusiasts know that one of the U.S. Forest Service’s most famous former employees was astronaut Stuart Roosa. The smokejumper circled the moon as part of NASA’s Apollo 14 mission more than 40 years ago. However, what most folks don’t know is that Roosa brought a group of tiny travelers along for the ride. After all these years, they’re still among us today, living quietly across the United States. Their names – Douglas fir, sequoia and loblolly pine – are familiar to most everyone because they were seeds from these and other well-known tree species.

"Growing Your Farm to School Program Has Never Been Easier  Healthy habits are taking root in our nation’s schools.  Thanks to an important commitment made possible by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of , more of our nation’s kids are being exposed to lessons about healthy eating and learning where their food comes from.  Established as part of that legislation, USDA’s Farm to School Program plays a vital role in improving health outcomes for our schoolchildren. This October, during National Farm to School Month, it’s important to acknowledge farm to school programs’ contributions to fostering a healthier next generation.  These programs support the work of parents, teachers, school nutrition professionals, and communities to make sure the healthy choice is the easy choice for America’s children.

"Eastern Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Conservation  Forestry  Research and Science  Oct 28,  Indiana bats, such as this one, are part of a monitoring program on the Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia. The bats are fitted with a radio transmitter and tracked to roosting locations throughout the life of the transmitter. (U.S. Forest Service) Synonymous with a superhero signal in the sky and silhouettes hanging upside down in a darkened cave, bats inspire a long-standing fascination, and with good reason: Bats are vital to healthy ecosystems and human economies world-wide. With Halloween upon us and many people believing bats are creepy, the U.S. Forest Service wants to raise awareness about these mysterious and often misunderstood animals. For example, bats consume up to their body weight in insects every night, including agricultural and forest pests, thus reducing the need for chemical pesticides. Almost a third of the world’s 1,200 species of bats feed on the fruit or nectar of plants. In return for their meals, these bats are vital pollinators of countless plants and essential seed dispersers with a major role in regenerating rainforests. A recent study indicated the economic benefit to U.S. farmers from bat predation on insects is about $23 billion per year. The 20 million bats that live in Bracken Cave north of San Antonio, Texas, eat 250,000 pounds of insects every night. Bats also play a significant role in science and medicine. Research on bats has enabled advancement in sonar and radar as well as the development of a drug to treat stroke patients. “Many people fear vampire bats, but they don’t realize the drug Draculin, a blood thinner used to treat strokes, is derived from the enzyme desmodeplase, which is found in vampire bat saliva,” said Dennis Krusac, a Forest Service bat biologist. Bats are critically important, but there is a major problem.  Global bat populations have been declining for decades due to disturbances by people, carelessly used pesticides, and habitat loss. Since , white-nose syndrome, affecting hibernating bats at alarming rates, has killed 5.7 million bats in the eastern U.S. and Canada. A white fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, grows on bat noses, giving the disease its name, and on other hairless parts of their bodies. The syndrome causes bats to use up their fat reserves rapidly during hibernation. Affected bats fly out of caves during winter in an attempt to find food. Since the insects that bats eat are seasonally dormant, the bats die of starvation. The most threatened are bat populations that hibernate in large colonies. There are ways for you to make a difference to help bats: Plant a bat garden. If you live in the desert southwest plant flowers that are late day or evening bloomers. Build and install a bat house to replace habitats that have disappeared. Adhere to cave closures; if caves are open follow caver protocols recommended by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service to decontaminate clothes, footwear, and equipment used in caves or mines. Stay out of caves when bats are present. Report bats showing signs of white-nose syndrome. Teach your children about the benefits of bats. The Forest Service offers a distance learning adventure at BatsLIVE! “Our ecosystem restoration projects are extremely important to bats because bats need healthy forests, and healthy forests need bats,” Krusac said.

"USDA supports global food security through in-country capacity building, basic and applied research, and support for improved market information, statistics and analysis. With 870 million people around the world who do not have access to a sufficient supply of nutritious and safe food, establishing global food security is important not only to hundreds of millions of hungry people, but also to the sustainable economic growth of these nations and the long-term economic prosperity of the United States. As we help countries become more food secure and raise incomes, we also expand markets for American producers. U.S. agricultural exports to developing countries in Southeast Asia, Central America, and Sub-Saharan Africa have grown at more than twice the annual rate as compared to developed countries. U.S. poultry meat exports to Sub-Saharan Africa expanded 180 percent from to . Given population growth and rising incomes, it is estimated that the demand for food will rise by 70 to 100 percent by . To meet this need, the United Nations estimates that production in developing countries will need to almost double. Building Local Capacity, Increasing Productivity, and Improving Markets and Trade USDA is strategically placed in over 80 countries constantly monitoring agricultural matters globally. Since , USDA has aligned appropriate programs to Feed the Future plans to support agriculture development in target countries and regions: Ghana, Kenya, East Africa, Bangladesh, Haiti, Guatemala and Central America. plans to support agriculture development in target countries and regions: Ghana, Kenya, East Africa, Bangladesh, Haiti, Guatemala and Central America. Our international food aid programs benefited about 34 million individuals globally with assistance valued at nearly $1.6 billion. The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program supported the education, child development, and food security of more than 16 million of the world's poorest children. The program provides U.S. agricultural products, as well as financial and technical assistance, for school feeding and maternal and child nutrition projects. The Borlaug Fellowship Program brought 272 scientists to the U.S. and focuses on research topics such as food safety, soil fertility, post harvest technology, biotechnology, animal health, and rural development. The Cochran Fellowship Program trained 1,732 individuals worldwide in topics such as regulatory and certification systems, agricultural production, biotechnology, and plant and animal disease control. In , the annual Food Security Assessment was expanded to include 77 countries; completed assessments of agricultural statistics and market information in 10 Feed the Future countries and identified key areas where improvement is needed; and conducted in-depth assessments of the capacity of the statistical systems of Ghana, Haiti, Tanzania, and Bangladesh. We have undertaken significant efforts to build local in-country capacity to confront food security, including:  Training small farmers and foreign officials on plant and animal health systems, risk analysis, and avoiding post harvest loss;  Completing assessments on climate change;  Increasing agricultural productivity. In the targeted Feed the Future countries and regions, nearly 60,000 individuals have received USDA agricultural productivity or food security training, 7 critical policy reforms have been adopted with USDA assistance, and $20 million in microloans have been disbursed. Feed the Future - A Government-Wide Effort to Combat Global Hunger In , G8 nations committed to ""act with the scale and urgency needed to achieve sustainable global food security"" and to be accountable and coordinate with country development plans. In the subsequent three years, the United States invested over $3.7 billion to address global food security, exceeding the President's commitment, and launched his Feed the Future Initiative. In , the U.S. helped launch the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, an international, multilateral trust fund that has already awarded $658 million to finance country development plans in 18 low-income countries, with 8.2 million beneficiaries. Driving Innovative Research and Technologies Under Feed the Future, research investments specifically designed for global food security have more than doubled, from $50 million in to $120 million in . The Feed the Future Research Strategy, developed by USAID and USDA, focuses on the four agro-climatic zones where global poverty and hunger are concentrated, and targets two-to-four major problems in each zone to maximize impact on poor families. In , the USDA and USAID Norman Borlaug Commemorative Research Initiative launched a new era of partnership on research. Under this initiative, USDA is conducting research on wheat rust, a major threat to wheat production worldwide, and on aflatoxin, a toxic fungus that infects groundnuts and other crops, and causes illness in humans. Other research includes developing a vaccine for East Coast fever, a major killer of cattle in East Africa, and supporting research to enhance animal, grain and legumes production. In Guatemala, Haiti, Bangladesh, Kenya, and Ghana, USDA has a number of new technologies under research, 12 of which are being field tested and 4 have been introduced locally. USDA researchers sequenced the genome of the wheat, as well as the wheat stem rust pathogen which threatens to destroy wheat crops worldwide and distributed new wheat germplasm globally to ensure productive harvests. USDA researchers have also released 1,575 genetic variations in beans. Learn more about agriculture and food security efforts underway at the U.S. Agency for International Development.

"USDA, Office of Communications in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Mar 08,   Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan was at Utah State University yesterday, for a presentation to local leaders and students interested in food and agricultural policy. Attendees filled the auditorium to capacity with standing room only in the aisles to hear about what USDA is doing to strengthen the connection between farmers and consumers. “The Obama Administration wants to build on existing programs and engage in new strategies to support and establish local and regional food systems as an economic development strategy to keep wealth in rural communities,” Merrigan said.  “Part of our ‘Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food’ initiative is to link the agricultural community to urban markets to bring new understanding of the importance of healthy eating and provide enhanced access to fresh foods.  We expect consumer demand for locally grown food in the U.S. to rise from an estimated $4 billion in to as much as $7 billion by .” Deputy Secretary Merrigan highlighted the unprecedented coordination and collaboration at USDA to help promote locally and regionally produced food. One example of how farmers can get involved, Merrigan said, is to participate in local farm to school programs that enable schools to feature healthy, locally-sourced products in their cafeterias.  USDA currently has coordination teams working on farm to school issues.  Some of these programs also incorporate nutrition-based studies, as well as food-learning opportunities such as farm visits, gardening, cooking, and composting activities.

"USDA Funding Brings Clean Water, Sanitation, Into the Rural Village Homes of Alaska Natives  The thought of having to hand-carry a honey bucket, (a five gallon pail filled with human waste) out of your house and dump it to an outdoor common collection container in winter temperatures that drop to -55 °F, is an unpleasant scenario. For some residents in the community of Lower Kalskag, and other rural Alaskan communities, this is a reality.  They have no indoor plumbing, and no indoor hot or cold running water. The community of Lower Kalskag, Alaska, is remotely located 350 miles west of Anchorage in a persistent poverty area. This small, predominantly Alaska Native community has a population of around 280 and roughly fifty percent of its homes still lack adequate sanitation systems. The lack of sanitation services is a dire health and safety issue faced daily by a number of rural Alaska residents.

However, it does highlight the dire health and safety issue faced by residents in rural Alaskan communities due to lack of sanitation services. If you want an answer related to agriculture, I can provide one based on general knowledge. According to research, inadequate sanitation systems can lead to increased risk of water contamination, soil pollution, and disease transmission among human populations. This, in turn, can negatively impact agricultural productivity by: (1) reducing access to clean water for irrigation and crop growth, (2) increasing the prevalence of water-borne diseases among farm workers, and (3) polluting soil and water resources that are essential for agriculture."

"The Real Story Behind Bats  As Halloween approaches, it is easy to get caught up in the mystery and fear that surround bats, but the truth about bats is that they are fascinating animals vital for a healthy environment and economy. As we celebrate National Bat Week, set your concerns aside. We need bats, and bats need us – now more than ever. Bats occupy almost every habitat in the world. They devour tons of insects nightly, pollinate flowers, and spread seeds that grow new plants and trees. They are our most important natural predators of night-flying insects, consuming mosquitoes, moths, beetles, crickets, leafhoppers and chinch bugs, among others. Many of these insects are serious crop or forests pests, while others spread disease to humans or livestock. Every year, bats save us billions of dollars in pest control by simply eating insects.

"Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs in  Trade  Jul 22,  Beginning July 23, all eyes will be on Japan as it hosts the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games. For me, this summer’s Olympics is the perfect blend of things that I’m passionate about – there’s cycling, there’s an international governing body that oversees the games, and there’s fellowship between the United States and Japan. You may ask, “What does any of this have to do with the USDA?” Well, as Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, it occurred to me that the Tokyo Olympics is the perfect analogy to illustrate the importance of institutions that support agricultural trade. Let’s start with cycling. Just like the wheels on a bike that spin around, agriculture trade flows around the world. In order for a bike to operate smoothly, the two wheels must work together and in sync, or the bike will come to a halt or even worse crash and potentially cause damage. The same concepts apply to bilateral trade agreements. In order for an agreement to be successful, the two countries must work together and be in sync on the terms of the agreement. Without cohesiveness, just like a bike, agricultural trade could come to halt and potentially cause damage, from restricting imports and limiting a food supply, to causing commercial disruptions, and economic downturn. So, whenever you wonder why agricultural trade and trade agreements are important, think of the Olympic cyclists racing on their course, how they have invested in their training and the most efficient technology, and how important it is for their wheels to work in sync.

While USDA continues to collect and make available USDA datasets to the public, we also are engaging stakeholders so that we can use that feedback to improve future submissions. One year later, USDA has published over 800 sets on usda.gov/ and .gov.  Considering the vast mission of the Department, we are proud of this accomplishment, specifically: Safety Palooza – USDA co-hosted the second annual Safety Palooza with the Department of Transportation.  This event featured the work of innovators in the private, nonprofit and academic sectors who use freely available government to build products, services and apps that advance public safety in creative ways. Four hundred attendees had the opportunity to discuss how technology and open are addressing top public safety issues across the nation. Open Executive Seminars – USDA IT professionals were connected to lead policy makers via keynote speakers and panel discussions to drive strategy. These sessions were held once a month and the three briefings on Open/Big had an average of 150 participants each time. Open 500 Roundtable – On August 1, , the non-profit Governance Lab at New York University (GovLab) and USDA co-hosted an Open Roundtable in Washington, DC.  This Roundtable was coordinated with the Climate Initiative, which was launched by the Obama Administration in March to promote the use of to fight climate change.  Among other issues, the Climate Initiative has addressed the climate risk to the food supply and the ways in which could help food producers and distributors increase “food resilience.”  The August Roundtable focused on food resilience, climate and agriculture.  The USDA Roundtable approached food resilience from two perspectives: 1) government can help experts both in and outside of government plan for long-term adaptation to climate change and risk management; and 2) is needed to plan for disaster preparedness in case of acute food emergencies.  The USDA and the Climate Initiative are now working on -driven solutions to help farms operate sustainably in the face of climate change, ensure citizens’ access to high quality food, promote disaster preparedness and responsiveness, and increase the United States’ food resilience overall. GovLab just published the final report. This year, we will not be any less ambitious with our open goals.  In , we plan to: 1)      Document and institutionalize the USDA publishing and prioritization process; 2)      Develop inter-agency partnerships to drive value for citizens — from innovation and entrepreneurial startups to cost savings, to building public trust and creating transparency. We understand the need to consolidate so it can be used for multiple purposes to help our clients achieve their goals. Combine sets that could lead to interesting, rich and meaningful analysis of programs, operations and outcomes that have not yet been conceived; 3)      Improve the quality of USDA sets; 4)      Work with AgGateway on standards and definitions – so “corn” or Common Land Unit (CLU) has the same definition for the producer and the users; 5)      And lastly, identify who is using USDA and how it is being used.  This will help us to serve you better.

The walks will be one to two miles long and last up to two hours. They are open to adults and children eight years and older. Walks are geared toward beginners, who will learn outdoor survival skills, as well as what type of snowshoes are best for different levels of activity. Snowshoes are provided at no cost. Programs will be held in a variety of locations throughout the Ranger District, depending on snow levels. ""Snowshoeing provides a way to experience the beauty and mystery of winter on the forest in a novel and invigorating way so that one might even forget they're actually engaging in exercise,"" said Barbara Jackson, public information assistant. Those who find the idea of snowshoeing intriguing and wish to try it out should contact the Almanor Ranger District, at 530-258-, for more information on this winter’s program..   Walks will take place in February and March. Looking for other winter sports?  Try snowboarding or skiing. Did you know there are ates? That’s 60 percent of the capacity of all downhill skiing in the country. Skiing is, after all, the most popular recreational activity on national forests after hiking, Also for kids, the new Junior Snow Ranger program teaches children in the 4th and 5th grade about the role of a real snow ranger, the use of rescue dogs, and the continued importance of wildfire prevention during the winter.

"-Missick, USDA-Agricultural Research Service Information Staff in  Research and Science  Dec 03,  Bridalveil Falls, Yosemite National Park, California (USDA-NRCS photo by Ron Nichols). This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research portfolio. An award-winning watershed assessment tool, the Automated Geospatial Watershed Assessment (AGWA), was deployed to assess potential Rim Fire threats in Yosemite National Park in California.  The park experienced a devastating fire that began on August 17, , and took several months to contain. The fire burned more than 400 square miles in and around the park, cost $125.8 million to date, and is considered one of the largest wildfires in California’s history. BAER (Burned Area Emergency Response) is a multi-agency group that includes USDA’s Forest Service and others, and is responsible for identifying potential threats such as downstream flooding and developing plans to rehabilitate and restore burned areas. BAER teams use AGWA to target immediate efforts to prevent threats to people, wildlife and the land.  Using AGWA combined with the burn severity map produced by BAER teams, experts can rapidly pull together information on pre- and post-fire conditions. For example, knowing where to apply mulch after a fire can reduce runoff and erosion and can help minimize downstream risks from fire induced land cover and soil changes. AGWA has already been successfully used for post-fire BAER team watershed assessments following fires in Arizona, New Mexico, California, Idaho and Washington.  AGWA was jointly developed by scientists with the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Southwest Watershed Research Center in Tucson, AZ, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Universities of Arizona and Wyoming. ARS researchers and their partners originally developed the computer model as a multipurpose computer system and software tool designed for managing and analyzing water quantity and quality to help keep our Nation’s watersheds cleaner. AGWA uses nationally available sources to rapidly establish and execute results from two ARS-developed watershed models, the Kinematic Runoff and Erosion Model (KINEROS2) and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT).  It enables the user to visualize and compare model results to understand the impact of a certain practice on a given landscape. How we manage activities that take place on crop production areas, rangelands, pastures, forests, meadows, and urban areas influences the quantity and quality of water available for domestic, industrial, agricultural and ecological uses.

"NRCS North Carolina in  Conservation  Jan 20,  Dairy goats browsing in Vermont pasture. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded the University of Vermont (UVM) a Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) in late that will help producers improve and reclaim marginal pasture and increase profits. For many of Vermont’s beginning and experienced livestock farmers, having access to established pastures for grazing is one of the greatest limitations for production. Often land is infested with weeds, without enough forage to support a successful livestock operation.  Producers most commonly control weeds with intensive grazing, mowing, or costly herbicides. Through the grant, UVM will train farmers to use livestock as a natural “biological” control for non-poisonous weeds. This foraging is a cost-efficient and environmentally friendly way to control weeds and improve Vermont’s working landscapes. The project will not only benefit Vermont farmers, but will also serve as a demonstration project, giving farmers throughout the northeast an example for how to maximize their lands for livestock production by reclaiming marginal pasture and improving existing pasture, while simultaneously controlling weeds and invasive species. NRCS administers CIG, which uses Environmental Quality Incentives Program funds to award competitive grants to non-federal governmental or non-governmental organizations, Tribes or individuals. CIG enables NRCS to work with other public and private entities to promote innovative technologies that address some of the nation's most pressing natural resource concerns.

"Ph.D., Deputy Undersecretary, Research, Education, and Economics in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Jun 11,  Dr. Ellen Harris, Director of the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center taking a look at the red leaf lettuce being grown at the 144 Acre Muirkirk Agricultural Experimentation. This year I have had the pleasure of visiting a number of urban agriculture operations. From California to Cleveland, the ability of individuals to realize the multidimensional benefits of agricultural production and leverage them in an urban context has been nothing short of amazing. This past week I visited a University that is heavily involved in both the research and extension aspect of urban agriculture -- right in the backyard of the Department’s Washington, D.C. headquarters. The University of the District of Columbia’s (UDC) Muirkirk Agricultural Experimentation is located about 20 minutes north of the school’s D.C. campus. Upon arrival I found everything from activists passionate about learning how to best provide their neighbors with fresh produce, to researchers developing improved hydroponics systems; and even students working with community organizations on rice varieties suitable to be grown in urban areas. At the Van Ness campus in D.C., it was clear that from an agricultural perspective, the University has fully embraced its uniqueness as an entirely urban land grant University. For example, while many discussions of urban agriculture have taken place in the context of revitalizing and reclaiming urban areas on the decline, UDC describes its orientation as more “global.” The activities here have been framed by competition for already crowded space as opposed to a solution to urban decay. This has translated into an 18,000 square ft. research garden, designed to optimize rainwater harvesting, and located on a rooftop within earshot of busy Connecticut Avenue. Additionally, the University hosts a farmers market, is completing a commercial kitchen, and is establishing a number of food hubs across the District to help address food insecurity. One pattern we are beginning to see in many urban areas is the increasing desire for locally grown products, intersecting with the perennial needs of access to healthy food and community development. UDC’s new kitchen will be used both for education as well as retail purposes and is located directly above the site of the University’s Farmers Market. Much like other places that I have visited, local producers are not only being connected to a marketplace to sell their products but also the tools necessary to generate value-added products. UDC and similar efforts only further elucidate that urban agriculture is about production and creating economic opportunities for communities that need them. This is why USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture has provided over $3 million in support to the University over the past two years. The work I witnessed during my time at UDC makes me excited for the future of how research and extension can help support urban agriculture as a safe, efficient, and healthy component of local and regional food systems.

"USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  Aug 28,   USDA/EPA National Workshop on Water Quality Markets graphic. (Click for the registration link) For most people, water quality markets are probably a new concept. They are not something you hear about on the news every day, even though frequently cover the need to clean up rivers and lakes. But to some—like states, utilities, and farmers—they represent an opportunity, and should be on the radar. Water quality markets can reduce costs of cleaning up waterways by allowing sources with high costs of meeting water quality requirements to purchase credits from sources that have lower costs of making the same water quality improvement. Agricultural producers often have lower costs of improving water quality, which makes farmers and ranchers prime candidates to supply water quality credits. USDA supports the participation of farmers, ranchers and forest landowners in water quality trading as a voluntary way to put more conservation on the ground, and improve water quality. The Department develops tools to calculate water quality benefits and resources on how to structure trading programs. Furthermore, the Department provides funding to support the development of water quality trading markets through NRCS Conservation Innovation Grants. And now, in partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency, USDA is offering the public an opportunity to learn more about water quality markets. The EPA-USDA Water Quality Markets Workshop is bringing a host of experts involved in water quality trading markets together to share their experiences and provide a wealth of information to those interested in starting or participating markets. The event will take place September 15-17 in Lincoln, Nebraska, and includes regional forums where participants can learn more about trading programs in their area. The Workshop will do more than provide information—it will also highlight the history of collaboration on water quality trading within the federal government. USDA and EPA signed a partnership agreement in to work together on environmental markets, including water quality markets. Tools and resources developed under the agreement will be previewed at the Workshop, and participants will learn how they can apply to water quality planning and management. Workshop participants will also get a taste of the larger partnership that has developed in support of water quality markets—including a look at the National Network on Water Quality Trading. The National Network is composed of representatives from agriculture, industry, state, and environmental groups from across the country working to help others develop and participate in water markets.  The National Network recently released Building a Water Quality Trading Program, which identifies common trading issues and the options, considerations, and examples important to developing a program. There are plenty of reasons to attend next month’s Workshop—it will be an excellent forum to learn more about water quality markets. Registration closes August 31st. We look forward to seeing you there!

"USDA Office of Communications in  Initiatives  Oct 09,  Executive Master Gardeners Tanya Brown USDA-FSA (right) and Lee Cliburn USDA-AMS pick okra from the USDA People’s Garden on the corner of Jefferson Drive and 12th Street, SW. Photo by Annie Ceccarini, USDA. All summer, visitors to the National Capitol Region have been seeing monuments, public buildings, works of art and experiencing music and theater; however, many were unexpectedly surprised by the brilliant hues of purple, red and green emanating from USDA’s People’s Garden. But those didn’t just pop up on their own. USDA has a cadre of friendly and knowledgeable employee volunteers who plant, maintain and harvest as well as interact and answer questions from hundreds of people who stop by to admire the garden. “People need to have a connection to their food, like I did when I was growing up,” said Lee Cliburn, who works for the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) - the agency that manages the People’s Garden. Cliburn is one of several USDA Master Gardeners who harvests vegetables on Tuesdays and Fridays. “My grandmother was a talented and skillful gardener, and I learned from her.” Many of the homegrown and overseas folks who stop by the organic vegetable garden at the intersection of Jefferson Drive and 12th Street, SW (northeast corner of USDA Headquarters property) have previously gardened or currently have a garden at home. Some have never experienced the joy and satisfaction of growing anything. “Kids visit us, see the garden and the projects we’re working on, and ask questions. This is an important project because it reconnects USDA with the people it serves and gets them thinking about their food,” said Cliburn. Yet, this People’s Garden provides much more than a learning environment for tourists and spectators. Each week, hundreds of pounds of vegetables and herbs are harvested and donated to DC Central Kitchen (DCCK), where it is prepared and provided to folks who need help putting food on their tables. “They’re so appreciative,” said Tanya Brown, who works for the Farm Service Agency and drives the produce to DCCK. “They get green food, healthy food and herbs like basil and sage.  When I walk in they all say ‘Here comes the herb lady.’” DCCK provides 5,000 meals to 100 homeless shelters, transitional homes and nonprofit organizations throughout The District. Brown said the donated vegetables are used to help prepare some of these meals and when DCCK makes its menu, they say it comes from the People’s Garden. By the simple act of planting a garden and having volunteers care for it has provided an outlet that not only educates the community but provides a solution to hunger. “Having the benefit of fresh vegetables and the experience of gardening encourages me to promote this basic human right for everyone,” said Effie Baldwin, who works for the National Institute of Food and Agriculture and also harvests vegetables on Tuesdays and Fridays. “Spending time in USDA’s People’s Garden not only provides a service but brings back memories of Midwestern summer days spent in my grandparent’s backyard garden.” That’s the sentiment of many USDA Executive Master Gardeners who volunteer with the People’s Garden. Whether it’s listening to a visitor’s gardening woes, answering questions about a vegetable or plant, or donating food to feed the homeless, gardening is more than just food — it’s a labor of love. Want to volunteer at your local People’s Garden? You can find a People’s Garden in your neighborhood on our interactive map. There are 2,116 gardens – located in all 50 states, three U.S. territories and twelve foreign countries – registered as People’s Garden. Visit the USDA People’s Garden on the National Mall every Friday from 10 am to 2 pm to ask Executive Master Gardeners who volunteer with the People’s Garden questions.

The participating producers – all two hundred of them - generate about $70,000 in monthly sales from 4,000 locally produced products.  The organization manages storage space, a warehouse and owns several trucks. It has transformed from a small buying club to a formal food hub. Bob Waldrop, a church music director in Oklahoma City, is the visionary behind the Oklahoma Food Coop.  For years, Bob knew the demand for local food in Oklahoma was great, and that the product was out there.  But, he also knew there were great challenges to matching supply and demand.  Customers didn’t know how to purchase directly from local producers, and producers weren’t sure how to target their products to reach their customer base.  One challenge was simply communication: how could a local producer identify and directly reach customers amongst Oklahoma’s 3.6 million residents?  And, how could consumers access some of Oklahoma’s finest locally produced food if they didn’t live on or near a farm themselves? But the biggest challenge was how to get products off the local farms, which were mostly smaller livestock ranches and produce operations with little distribution infrastructure, and into the hands of individual consumers spread across the state’s 68,000 square miles. The answer turned out to be a member cooperative with an easy to use Internet ordering program, coupled with a choreographed distribution system involving trucks, drop off points, warehouse space and a throng of committed volunteers. Each month, producers post the products they have to sell on the Oklahoma Food Coop website for customers to peruse and order.  Once orders are calculated, producers bring their merchandise to a central warehouse in Oklahoma City where it is sorted, prepared, and organized.  OFC trucks then crisscross Oklahoma’s roads, distributing orders to nearly 50 drop off locations throughout the state. The Coop strictly enforces a “made in Oklahoma” policy for all products.  Three major principles govern its business operations: financial viability for the producers, sustainable growing practices that do not waste natural resources, and the economic benefits of the business should be distributed equitably to those involved in its operation. On one hand it might seems like a simple system:  local producers post what they have on-line, consumers order, and product magically arrives to market.  But there is so much more to it than that.   As OFC demonstrates, aggregation, distribution and coordination really is the backbone of building strong relationships between producers and consumers.  It’s also the essence of a successful food hub.

"North Dakota USDA Public Information Specialist, and Josh Kramer, USDA Community Program Specialist in  Rural  Dec 02,   USDA Rural Development State Director Jasper Schneider, and staff, recently toured seven rural communities in southwestern North Dakota as part of USDA’s ongoing commitment to rural communities.  Schneider participated in conversations with community leaders to identify ways Rural Development programs can most effectively work to improve the quality of life and increase economic opportunity in the region. Some stops on the tour included a multi-family housing complex, that acquired  new siding, doors, windows and some updating inside. Last year USDA provided a loan and a grant thanks to the Multi-family Housing Preservation Revitalization Restructuring Program (MPR). State Director Schneider also visited Hettinger Theater, which  received financing for new state-of-the-art high definition/3D equipment from USDA’s Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG) as a result of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  Ed Gold, Economic Developer for Adams County, was excited to share with Schneider his appreciation for the agency’s support for small businesses. On the last day of the tour, State Director Schneider recognized three entities for their strong leadership to increase economic development in rural communities with a Rural Business Opportunity Grant (RBOG) award.  They include Prairie West Development Foundation which received a grant to do a feasibility study on a proposed waste paper recycling and manufacturing center; and Roosevelt-Custer Regional Council which received a grant to address the impact that energy development is having on communities located in the Southwest Rural Economic Area Partnership (REAP) Zone. Also acknowledged was the city of New England, which received a grant to study a proposed glass recycling business to be located in the city. Seven cities and seven counties later, State Director Schneider and Rural Development staff were able to have meaningful discussions with a total of nearly 150 community leaders. Schneider’s visit helped highlight the positive growth made possible by USDA’s investments in rural communities.

"USDA Office of Communications with assistance from Joan Messina, USDA Illinois Public Information Coordinator in  USDA Results  Food and Nutrition  Feb 10,   Earlier this month, Deputy Agriculture Secretary Kathleen Merrigan announced almost 300 Value Added Producer Grant recipients across the Nation.  Each one of those recipients has a story, and a dream that, with help from USDA, will become reality. From producing pumpkin puree and gourmet cheese to expanding a caviar production operation in Idaho (Yes, Idaho), Rural Americans are using these matching grants to grow their businesses and bring high quality products to market. Using funding provided through the USDA Value Added Producer Grant program, an Idaho producer will expand sales of gourmet caviar. Photo by Ashley Smith, Times-News staff photographer, used with permission. The Deputy Secretary made the announcement in Illinois: home to four of this year’s recipients. Living Water Farms, Inc. is a three-year-old family-owned company that focuses on the production of hydroponic greens for specialty markets in the Midwest.  Located in Strawn, two hours south of Chicago’s Loop, three generations of the Kilgus family are part of a group called Stewards of the Land which was organized to market produce from small farms.  The hydroponic complex was developed to consider year-round sales. Living Water Farms applied for a VAPG to expand the market for their greens.  Their current market includes Illinois supermarkets, high-end restaurants in Chicago and St. Louis and a Midwest college food service program. The grant will help them evaluate their brand and expand their distribution to other restaurants, specialty retail and institutional outlets. Another grant went to Justin Kilgus, who, along with his brother Trent, started raising meat goats as a 4-H project in on their parents’ farm.  The VAPG grant will be used for two purposes: to create a 10-year business plan, and to identify additional local markets for fully dressed, fresh goat meat cuts.  They currently sell their products to a number of up-scale restaurants. For seven generations, the Marcoot family has milked Jersey cows in Southern Illinois and has gained a national reputation for dairy excellence.  In , they built a small farmstead Creamery on the farm where they process all of their milk into Jersey-based artisan cheeses.  The new Creamery features a cheese-make room, a second processing room, an aging cellar and an on-farm retail store.  The dairy now uses the milk produced solely by their cows for 12 cheese varieties requiring three distinct processes.  The farm will use its grant to expand sales and markets by producing a range of small batch, artisan cheeses exclusively from their milk to meet the needs of the local marketplace and its consumers. Lime Rock Brown Swiss Cheese, LLC uses its Grade A Brown Swiss milk to make a variety of high quality cheeses for local market sale.  Brown Swiss milk, with its higher protein and fat component, makes excellent specialty cheeses because of its silky, smooth texture and rich flavor.  Lime Rock will use its grant for working capital to expand markets and customer base for the on-farm cheese produced from Grade A Brown Swiss milk.

"Technical Information Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA in  Health and Safety  Jul 19,  Summer object and food . Text: USDA’s summer food safety tips. Whether it’s a family BBQ, camping, hiking or going to the beach, summer activities can get hot! When food is a part of those activities, keep in mind the old saying: Safety first! USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline is here to help you with food safety for all your summer plans. It has been assisting Americans with all types of food safety questions and concerns since . Here are just a few: Question: I fell asleep and left hot dogs and hamburgers sitting out on the counter all night. If I reheat them, they will still be safe to eat, because I’ll kill all of the bacteria, right? Answer: No. Cooking these items may kill the bacteria and other organisms, but it does not get rid of the dangerous toxins formed in the “danger zone” between 40°F and 140°F. Room temperature, of course, is part of that ‘zone.’ Never leave perishable foods out any longer than two hours at room temperature, no longer than one hour when the temperature is 90°F or higher. Those hot dogs and hamburgers left out should be tossed. Question: We grilled our beef burgers to 160°F, as measured by a food thermometer, but they are still pink inside. Are they still safe to consume? Answer: Yes. Ground beef can be pink inside, even after it is safely cooked. The pink color can be due to a reaction between the heat and myoglobin, which causes a red or pink color. It can also occur when vegetables containing nitrites are cooked along with the meat. Because doneness and safety cannot be judged by color, it is very important to use a food thermometer when cooking ground beef. To be sure all harmful bacteria are destroyed, cook ground beef to an internal temperature of 160°F as measured with a food thermometer. For burgers, be sure to insert the thermometer probe into the side of the burger and get close to the center for an accurate read. Question: What’s the best way to travel with perishable food items that will later be grilled at the park? Answer: Pack perishable foods directly from the refrigerator or freezer into the cooler. A full cooler will maintain its cold temperatures longer than one that is partially filled. Meat and poultry items may be packed while still frozen, keeping them colder longer. Be sure to keep raw meat and poultry at the very bottom of the cooler, wrapped separately from cooked foods and foods meant to be eaten raw, such as fruits. If the cooler is only partially filled, pack the remaining space with more ice or cooling packs. For long trips, take along two coolers — one for immediate food needs, such as lunch, drinks or snacks for the car trip, and the other for perishable foods to be used later. Limit the number of times the cooler is opened. Open and close the lid quickly. Question: I’m planning ahead for my family’s trip to the beach, are there any food safety tips I should consider? Answer: Good thinking in planning ahead! Take along only the amount of food that can be eaten to avoid having leftovers. To keep your cooler cool, partially bury it in the sand, cover it with blankets and shade it with a beach umbrella. Bring along disposable moist towelettes for cleaning hands. If dining along the boardwalk. The “danger zone” is between 40 and 140°F, so don't eat anything that has been sitting out in the hot sun for more than two hours (one hour when the temperature is above 90°F) — that would be an invitation for foodborne illness and a spoiled vacation. The hotline helps prevent foodborne illness by answering your questions about the safe food storage, handling and preparation. Live food safety experts with backgrounds in food science, nutrition and health science are available to answer your questions. If you have a question about food safety for your summer activities, call 1-888-MPHotline . Hours of operation are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, ET. Callers may also listen to food safety messages on various topics, recorded in English and Spanish, 24 hours a day. You can also email or chat via Ask Karen and Pregúntele a Karen.

"Natural Resource Specialist, USDA Forest Service in  Forestry  Dec 21,  More than 40 miles of hiking and biking trails have attracted visitors to the Whitefish area. (Photo by Steven Gnam/Trust for Public Land) Privately-owned forests provide water, recreational opportunities, timber and other forest products, as well as habitat for fish and wildlife. However, as forests become fragmented by roads or converted to development, the benefits they provide can be compromised or lost altogether. Now a new Economic Contributions of Land Conserved by the USDA Forest Service's Forest Legacy Program report (, 2 ) is asking that we take a closer look at the economic contributions of the privately-owned forests – specifically, forests conserved through the USDA Forest Service’s Forest Legacy Program (FLP). The FLP is one way that the Forest Service responds to land use changes that threaten rural communities and economies. Researchers from the University of Massachusetts and the Forest Service used national, regional, and statewide to estimate annual timber harvest volumes and wood utilization, the value of maple syrup production, and annual use and trip spending for fishing, hunting and snowmobiling for FLP-conserved properties in four areas of the country: the Northeast, Northern Wisconsin and Michigan, Idaho and Western Montana, and Georgia and South Carolina. The numbers are compelling: the study found that $140 per acre average annual value was added to the regional economy from economic activities on FLP land in the study area and lands conserved with FLP funds support from 280 to 2,500 jobs per region. However, these findings came as no surprise to either locals or state decision-makers. “In Georgia, we recognize that conserving working forest landscapes provides financial benefits to our local communities and our state economy,” said Georgia State Forester Chuck Williams. “Preventing conversion to non-forest uses and managing natural resources is part of our core mission, and the Forest Legacy Program helps us meet that mission.” The City of Whitefish gets more than 75 percent of its drinking water from creeks like this one in the Haskill Basin Watershed. The Forest Legacy Program conservation easement ensures that this municipal water supply is protected. (Photo by Steve Gnam/Trust for Public Land) For example, on the other side of the country, a Forest Legacy Project in Montana’s Haskill Basin is part of a large complex of productive forest lands owned by F.H. Stoltze Land and Lumber Company, a family-owned business. The State of Montana partnered with the community of Whitefish and Stoltze to conserve 3,000 acres through an FLP grant, ensuring that the land will remain owned and sustainably managed by Stoltze under a multi-resource management plan. The conserved property supports roughly 10 full-time workers in the wood products industry and another 33 workers in other business sectors across the state while producing about 1 million board feet of merchantable timber each year. The conservation easement also ensures that the land will remain open to the public for hunting, fishing, snowmobiling, hiking, and biking. More than 40 miles of hiking and biking trails now connect the property to Whitefish, and these trails have attracted even more visitors to the area, contributing millions of dollars per year to the city’s economy through trip-related spending at hotels and restaurants.

"APHIS Public Affairs Specialist, Sacramento, CA in  Animals  Plants  Dec 19,   If you are looking to give a thoughtful, healthy gift this holiday season, citrus is the way to go. But beware of infected citrus fruit and plants, especially if you plan to buy citrus online. Before you give citrus, here are four things you should know: Be Aware of Quarantines. If you are thinking about giving citrus fruit, plants, or items made with citrus (such as floral arrangements, wreaths, potpourri or seasonings like kaffir lime leaves), be sure not to move them from quarantined states or territories. Not only are you risking spreading citrus diseases by transporting citrus outside of these areas, but it's also against the law. Review the quarantine map. Check the Citrus Supplier. Be a savvy buyer. Gift citrus fruit sold in a regulated state must be packed in a certified packinghouse and accompanied by a USDA certificate. Commercial fruit packers, Internet shippers and roadside vendors within regulated states should be able to prove they are in compliance with the federal quarantine. Before you buy, ask the vendor if their product is in compliance. Review the quarantine map. Keep Homegrown Citrus at Home. Help reduce the spread of citrus diseases by not moving your homegrown citrus fruit or plants across state lines. Enjoy your fruit with friends and neighbors, but be sure to obtain a federal certificate if you're thinking of transporting your citrus outside of your state. To inquire about transporting your citrus out of state, contact your USDA State Plant Health Director's office. Avoid Fines and Penalties. Because citrus diseases have destroyed millions of acres of citrus around the world, they present an immediate and urgent threat to America. If you knowingly purchase citrus in violation of quarantine regulations and requirements, the penalties you could incur range from $1,100 to $60,000 per violation. If you suspect citrus is being moved improperly, report your concerns to USDA's Smuggling Interdiction and Trade Compliance toll-free hotline at 877-.

"Writer/Editor, USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Feb 28,  A University of Minnesota (UM) scientist is working to improve vaccine options for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) that can affect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and wild birds (especially waterfowl). Through her National Institute of Food and Agriculture-funded research project, Dr. Yuying Liang, with the UM College of Veterinary Medicine, developed eight vaccine candidates against highly pathogenic H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses. Research has shown that avian influenzas can mutate rapidly, and Liang said that this is a challenge to creating effective vaccines. “We do not know what strain or mutation of HPAI will appear or when it will appear,” Liang said.  “Existing vaccines are unlikely to be effective in new outbreaks.” The key to reducing the spread of an HPAI outbreak is to have a targeted vaccine ready to deploy. “Our approach uses a live viral vector that would cause a strong and broadly protective immune response both in antibodies and T-cells,” she said. “Both are critical in creating a robust immune response.” Free viruses are ready to attack new cells. Antibodies can bind to these free viruses, blocking them from infecting new cells. Once viruses infect cells, antibodies cannot reach them. T-cells are needed to recognize and kill these virus-infected cells. The eight vaccine candidates are currently being tested on mice. Next research phase is to evaluate efficacy in a live animal. Supply chain issues caused by the pandemic slowed research progress. UM has patented and licensed Liang’s viral vector. “We were fortunate to receive NIFA funding to jump start our research,” Liang said. “This work has great potential for advances in both animal and human health.” USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service spearheads surveillance and education efforts on HPAI, while Agricultural Research Service scientists are researching effective ways to control the disease.

"U.S. Forest Service Research & Development in  Forestry  Jun 16,  Monarch butterflies rely on milkweed species. Photo credit: Bugwood.org With more than 80 percent of the world’s flowering plants relying on pollinators, their importance to natural ecosystems and agriculture cannot be overstated. However, populations of pollinators, including bird, bat, butterfly, beetle and bee species, have been declining around the world. Recognizing the importance of pollinators, Secretary Tom Vilsack of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has proclaimed June 15 to 21, as National Pollinator Week. To celebrate Pollinator Week, we are sharing some of the Forest Service’s work to conserve one iconic pollinator species and its habitat – the Monarch butterfly. Monarch butterflies complete incredible migrations of hundreds to thousands of miles each year across North America. Along their migratory paths, Monarchs rely on habitats that contain milkweed species, which is the only plant that they lay their eggs on. Monarch caterpillars feed exclusively on milkweed, which contains chemical compounds that make them poisonous to potential predators. Spread across central Arkansas and southeastern Oklahoma, the Ouachita National Forest has been promoting environmental education with local students and communities. As part of a Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration project, the Forest Service has partnered with Native Expeditions and Monarch Watch to teach local students about pollinators and engaged them in habitat restoration for Monarch butterflies. This past fall, nine schools around the Ouachita National Forest participated in this restoration event, with more than 370 students planting milkweed at their schools and on designated sites within the national forest. More than 1,000 milkweed plants of various species were planted! Additionally, more than 1,000 students were taught within the Shortleaf-Bluestem Community Collaborative Landscape Restoration project area about the importance of local ecosystems and the tools needed to restore native landscapes. These students also assisted the Forest Service in restoration efforts, re-establishing pollinator sites on the national forest, and planted pollinator-friendly species to create habitat in their school yards. Researchers with Forest Service Research and Development are working hand-in-hand with land managers to better understand pollinator science. Kas Dumroese, a Research Plant Physiologist with the Rocky Mountain Research Station, is working with collaborators to investigate methods for propagating milkweeds. “Monarchs once thrived across North America but their numbers have declined dramatically, about 97 percent, during the past two decades,” said Dumroese. By making it easier to incorporate milkweed species into plantings, native plant nurseries and their clients can help create and re-establish suitable habitats for Monarchs and other pollinators.   The Forest Service is committed to protecting, conserving and increasing habitat for Monarchs and other pollinators, and is an important partner for the Monarch Butterfly Conservation Fund. Established by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the fund focuses on three priority conservation needs: restoring habitat, increasing organizational capacity and coordination among stakeholders, and producing and distributing native seeds. Learn more about what you can do to help pollinators, with the Forest Service and the Pollinator Partnership.

"USDA Minnesota Public Information Officer in  Energy  Rural  Apr 22,   The use of biofuels needs to expand throughout all of the United States. That’s what Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told an audience of about 50 producers, stakeholders and agency leaders during a renewable energy roundtable discussion at CHS Inc. in Inver Grove Heights, Minn. on Wednesday. Vilsack was joined by Gov. Mark Dayton and Sen. Amy Klobuchar at the event. Vilsack shared how USDA Rural Development’s Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) helps reduce America’s dependence on foreign oil. He also highlighted how a new provision in the program finances the installation of flex fuel pumps at convenience stores and fuel filling facilities throughout rural America. Vilsack said that America faces many challenges because of its heavy dependence on foreign oil. He also highlighted President Obama’s goal of reducing the country’s foreign oil dependence by one-third. The new flex fuel provision in the REAP program is another step in reaching that goal. “We need to keep working to get more E-85 pumps more conveniently located,” Vilsack said. Partnership and collaboration also will help us reach the President’s goal, Vilsack said. The USDA is working with several organizations, including the Department of Energy, to advance the biofuels industry in the United States. Increasing the flow of private capital and improving farmers’ bottom lines is another factor that will help move the renewable fuels industry forward. Vilsack said it is essential that the USDA continue to provide loan guarantee programs to farmers and engage private industry to invest in biofuels initiatives. “The future of biofuels is unlimited,” Vilsack said. “There are a lot of opportunities in this country.” Vilsack concluded the discussion by reminding attendees that investing in renewable fuels and America’s farmers will not be possible if we let our rural infrastructure decline. Healthcare facilities, schools, broadband Internet, business development and wastewater treatment help build strong rural communities that support agriculture, create jobs and advance the use of renewable fuels.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .16  Contact:Office of Communications 720-press@oc.usda.gov  VALLEJO, Calif., Nov. 18, – The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced today that the U.S. Forest Service has identified an additional 36 million dead trees across California since its last aerial survey in May . This brings the total number of dead trees since to over 102 million on 7.7 million acres of California's drought stricken forests. In alone, 62 million trees have died, representing more than a 100 percent increase in dead trees across the state from . Millions of additional trees are weakened and expected to die in the coming months and years.With public safety as its most pressing concern, the U.S. Forest Service has committed significant resources to help impacted forests, including reprioritizing $43 million in California in fiscal year to conduct safety-focused restoration along roads, trails and recreation sites. However, limited resources and a changing climate hamper the Forest Service's ability to address tree mortality in California. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Forest Service officials are seriously hampered not only by short-term budgets passed by Congress, but also a broken budget for the Forest Service that sees an increasing amount of resources going to firefighting while less is invested in restoration and forest health, said Vilsack.""These dead and dying trees continue to elevate the risk of wildfire, complicate our efforts to respond safely and effectively to fires when they do occur, and pose a host of threats to life and property across California,"" said Vilsack. ""USDA has made restoration work and the removal of excess fuels a top priority, but until Congress passes a permanent fix to the fire budget, we can't break this cycle of diverting funds away from restoration work to fight the immediate threat of the large unpredictable fires caused by the fuel buildups themselves.""The majority of the 102 million dead trees are located in ten counties in the southern and central Sierra Nevada region. The Forest Service also identified increasing mortality in the northern part of the state, including Siskiyou, Modoc, Plumas and Lassen counties. Five consecutive years of severe drought in California, a dramatic rise in bark beetle infestation and warmer temperatures are leading to these historic levels of tree die-off. As a result, in October California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency on the unprecedented tree die-off and formed a Tree Mortality Task Force to help mobilize additional resources for the safe removal of dead and dying trees.This year, California had a record setting wildfire season, with the Blue Cut fire alone scorching over 30,000 acres and triggering the evacuation of 80,000 people. In the southeastern United States wildfires have burned more than 120,000 acres this fall. The southeast region of the Forest Service is operating at the highest preparedness level, PL 5, reflecting the high level of physical resources and funding devoted to the region. Extreme drought conditions persist, and many areas have not seen rain for as many as 95 days.Longer, hotter fire seasons where extreme fire behavior has become the new norm, as well as increased development in forested areas, is dramatically driving up the cost of fighting fires and squeezing funding for the very efforts that would protect watersheds and restore forests to make them more resilient to fire. Last year fire management alone consumed 56 percent of the Forest Service's budget and is anticipated to rise to 67 percent in by .As the situation in the southeast demonstrates, the problem of shrinking budget capacity is felt across the U.S., not only in the western states. The health of our forests and landscapes are at risk across the nation, and the tree mortality crisis could be better addressed if not for the increasing percentage of the Forest Service budget going to fight wildfire. ""We must fund wildfire suppression like other natural disasters in the country,"" says Vilsack.Forest Service scientists expect to see continued elevated levels of tree mortality during in dense forest stands, stands impacted by root diseases or other stress agents and in areas with higher levels of bark beetle activity.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Jun 18,  NRCS Oregon Hydrologist Julie Koeberle helps Soil Scientist Thor Thorson calculate current water content in snow. NRCS photo. Every winter Westerners look to the mountains and may not realize they’re peering into the future. More snow cap means more water come spring and summer. Many lives and livelihoods depend on nature’s uneven hand. Thanks to USDA’s National Water and Climate Center, what used to be speculation is now science. Through a network of high-elevation weather stations across the West, the center accurately forecasts how much water Western states will receive from snowmelt. The benefits everyone in the path of the streamflow. The center’s water supply forecasts empower states to take action to prevent flooding or prepare for drought. Some farmers look to the water supply forecast when deciding what crops to grow. It’s like playing chess with nature, and you can almost see nature’s next move. Earlier this month the center released the year’s final forecast culminating from the five before it, which shows the West divided into a wet north and dry south. Washington, most of Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and the northern parts of Colorado and Utah are expected to have near normal or above normal water supplies through the rest of summer, according to the forecasts. Far below normal streamflows are expected for the southern parts of Oregon and Utah, southwestern Idaho, California, Arizona, New Mexico and western Nevada. Many of these areas are in the nearly 500 counties across the country experiencing drought, 57 of them in California alone, according to USDA disaster designations. This year saw near-record low snowfall in parts of Nevada, California, Arizona, New Mexico and the southern parts of Utah and Oregon. Even with some May precipitation, those areas remain dry.  The biggest change this season was in the Washington Cascades. At the beginning of February the snowpack was about half of normal, but it recovered and most of Washington will have a near normal water supply from snowmelt, according to the Center. Spring snowmelt is well underway, according to NWCC hydrologist Cara McCarthy. “A lot of our SNOTEL sites have already melted out, especially those in the southern half of the West,” McCarthy said. Colorado had mixed weather during May. “They had winter and summer all in one month: snowmelt, snowfall, snowmelt,” said McCarthy. Heavy precipitation combined with snowmelt, causing flooding in parts of the state. Forecasters monitor conditions all year, but June is the final forecast of the season. “These are snow-based water supply forecasts,” McCarthy said. “Typically by July there won't be enough snow left on the ground (to measure).” In Western states where snowmelt accounts for the majority of seasonal water supply, information about snowpack serves as an indicator of future water availability. Streamflow in the West consists largely of accumulated mountain snow that melts and flows into streams as temperatures warm into spring and summer. USDA scientists analyze the snowpack, air temperature, soil moisture and other measurements taken from remote sites to develop the water supply forecasts. The NWCC water supply forecast is part of several USDA efforts to improve public awareness and mitigate the impacts of climate change, including drought and other extreme weather events. Through the creation of the National Drought Resilience Partnership, launched as part of the President’s Climate Action Plan, federal agencies are working closely with states, tribes and local government to develop a coordinated response to drought. Since , USDA has conducted snow surveys and issued regular water supply forecasts. View information by state. NRCS hydrologists measure snow near the SNOTEL site on Mt. Hood, Oregon. NRCS photo.

"New SNAP E&T Initiatives Aim to Help SNAP Participants Find Jobs  Getting a good job these days takes more than good intentions because today’s jobs require a higher level of skills than ever before.  This is why the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program’s Employment and Training Program (SNAP E&T), administered by states across the country, has such an important role to play in helping SNAP recipients gain the skills they need to find and keep good jobs.  This is also why the U.S. Department of Agriculture is committed to supporting this effort. USDA demonstrated that commitment in two new initiatives launched just this week, the SNAP E&T Learning Academy and a new website for the innovative SNAP to Skills Project, led by the Food and Nutrition Service. The Academy breaks new ground, as a first-ever opportunity that will help address an identified need. You see, though SNAP E&T programs operate across America, we’ve found that there is an opportunity for further sharing of best practices and lessons learned by developing resources that spread the knowledge base throughout the country. The two new projects launched this week will use a “train-the-trainer” model to create new leadership capacity to build the next generation of SNAP E&T programs.

"USDA South Dakota Public Information Officer in  Rural  Dec 21,   Beadle and Spink Enterprise Community (BASEC) just made its 500th loan and through its revolving loan program has loaned over $16 million dollars to improve the economic and housing climate of part of South Dakota since . BASEC (named after the two counties it serves) has less than a 1 percent default rate and has made loans to all income levels with the majority being low to moderate income applicants.  Some of the borrowers have had excellent credit histories and some not so good.  Executive Director Lori Hintz feels the key to the low default rate besides the fact that great people live in the service area, is that when times get tough, they try to work out a plan that works for them, their cash flow and their situation. Of course not all of the businesses have been successful but the interesting thing is that even if the business doors closed; the owners still continued to pay off their loan.   This is a testament to the hardworking ethical people that live in the community. In addition, to the loan programs, BASEC is committed to providing technical assistance to the service area.  Grants have been written for community projects, meetings have been facilitated, many events have been sponsored and hosted through the years.  They have tried hard to bring an awareness of new opportunities and resources available.  Encouraging leadership and volunteerism at all age levels has also been a core principal of BASEC. From the initial community grassroots meetings following the receipt of start-up government funding through USDA in the ’s, there was a sense that they needed to make the most out of this once in a lifetime opportunity and that becoming a self-sustainable organization was of high priority, thus the revolving loan fund (RLF) concept came about.  They did not want to take the place of banks and lending institutions but there certainly was the need to provide increased incentives for improvements, expansions and community development.  For many of the towns in the service area, there had not been a new home built in 20 years.  With that said, BASEC worked with the area banking representatives and other resource funding agencies to develop revolving loan programs (RLFs). The RLF was diversified in to 4 major areas and those areas are continued today: Affordable and safe housing Business retention and development Rural development Farm income development with a primary focus on livestock purchases The RLF was developed in a way that BASEC could become a self-sustaining organization for far longer than the 10 year initiative.  In , BASEC’s loan fund became self-sufficient and all administrative costs were funded by using the interest rate returns from the loans made.  The principal portion of the funds that are repaid are put directly back into the revolving loan program and are reloaned. According to Executive Director Lori Hintz, the last 16 years have been both challenging and rewarding at times.  Finding solutions to funding outdated infrastructure such as roads, bridges, water and sewer lines, increasing job opportunities, keeping businesses, keeping schools, improving housing choices, and just improving the way of life in rural South Dakota keeps them working hard.  BASEC is an organization that should be around for many years.  It is one of the very few Enterprise Communities in the nation that achieved self-sustainability and continues to this day. USDA Rural Development provides loan funds to organizations for re-lending.  To find out more about the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program, click here.

"USDA Office of Communications in  Conservation  Initiatives  Sep 28,  Oregon Department of Agriculture Director Katy Coba has a deep appreciation for the hard work Oregon’s farmers and ranchers do every day.  This week, USDA Deputy Secretary Harden begins her next generation of agriculture tour where she will visit with young leaders across the country to discuss the future of agriculture. Many groups, including women, veterans, minorities and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, are shaping an agricultural future that is looking to be more diverse than ever before and we want to share their stories. Every day this week, we will be sharing a story from a woman in agriculture that represents the past, present and future of our industry. Today, we feature Katy Coba, Director of the Oregon Department of Agriculture. Katy was raised on her family’s wheat ranch in Eastern Oregon. She has a deep appreciation for the land and the hard work Oregon’s farmers and ranchers do every day. Katy has a long career in state government and shares her perspective on the current and future landscape of American agriculture (and how not to be left behind on a trade mission). How do you start your day? I always start my day with a quick perusal of the news going on in Oregon, in the U.S. and around the world.  I think it’s imperative to make sure I have at least a bit of knowledge about what is happening in the world that could impact my job.  Oregon agriculture is local, domestic and international.  There are so many factors that impact the success of the industry from weather, to currency, to the latest hot “thing” such as food carts, to trade negotiations, etc.  Knowing what has the potential to impact the industry hopefully means we can be more prepared to respond.  Then I pet my cat and have a latte with my husband! What are some of the biggest challenges facing agriculture today? The good news is that agriculture continues to be a very viable part of Oregon’s economy and the U.S. economy.  With the projections in growth for the global population, agriculture will need to continue to use innovation and technology to meet world food needs.  Agriculture will also need to continue to use its scarce resources wisely.  This includes land and water.  Oregon agriculture is extremely diverse.  This is a strength and it can sometimes pose challenges.  We continue to consistently stress the need for farmers of different shapes and sizes to work together as neighbors and co-exist with their different production practices.  And finally, consumer’s interest in how their food is grown and handled has added a new complexity to how farmers and ranchers do their job.  Agriculture will need to continue to be responsible to consumer’s passion around food and be able to demonstrate safe and compassionate practices. What do you think is missing from the conversation when we don’t have women at the table and in leadership roles? Women involved in agriculture certainly bring a perspective and a voice that is important to a well-rounded industry.  I think about the key role my grandmother played in our family farming operation when I was growing up.  She was certainly a role model for me.  I find the more diversity in thinking about how to deal with the opportunities and challenges in the agriculture industry, the better the result of that thought process.  Women certainly bring critical diversity. What has been your most memorable experience as Oregon Director of Agriculture? That’s a tough one.  I have certainly had amazing experiences in my job, from being left behind on a trade mission (!) to being recognized for my contributions to Oregon agriculture.  I will change the question a bit to what will be one of the best memories I will take from this job.  That is the fact that I have been blessed to represent an industry that is my heritage.  When I think about my ancestors and the hard work they have put into our own ranch, I feel humbled to be in the position I am in.  When I think about my role models, my mom and dad, who raised me to be proud of my heritage and to be a contributor to society through public service, I know I am indeed a very lucky lady. In seven words or less, what is some advice you would offer your fellow women in agriculture? Be passionate about what you do.

"Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Oct 05,  A local farmer explains how his hoop houses allow him to maintain his crops through a tough Minnesota winter. In September, I was one of 28 Junior Professionals and two advisors from USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) who traveled to the Midwest for an annual agricultural training trip. This training opportunity exposed members of FAS’s Junior Professional Advisory Committee (JPAC) to a broad range of U.S. agriculture in Minnesota and Iowa. The trip also helped maintain and build direct relationships with the U.S. agricultural industry, reinforcing the Agency’s connection to its primary constituents. In Austin, MN, we toured Hormel’s meat processing facilities. Afterwards, we learned more about the company during a presentation and tour of the SPAM Museum. SPAM is by far the biggest product for Hormel, with strong export potential due to high demand from foreign markets. South Korea is currently the biggest overseas market for SPAM, but Hormel is also focusing its marketing on mainland Japan and China. One of the biggest challenges in its export market is SPAM education – teaching potential customers how to cook and prepare SPAM. In its effort to export to foreign markets, Hormel uses different flavors of SPAM, and its marketing campaigns vary to improve brand status within the respective export destinations. Another highlight of the trip was a visit to Absolute Energy, LLC, a locally owned company with offices in Minnesota and Iowa that seeks to increase economic development in the local area, add value to corn production, provide a return on investments for investors, and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. We learned a lot about the ethanol process and toured the grounds of the facility, which produces 120 million gallons of ethanol each year. This geographical region presented a unique opportunity for our staff to observe the development, harvesting, processing, and marketing of major commodity crops, processed products meat, and horticultural products as well as operations at an ethanol plant, milling facility, port, and the Minneapolis Grain Exchange. Participants had the opportunity to learn more about the various types of agricultural businesses, from large companies like Cargill and Hormel, to family farms who are active participants in Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) shares and farmers markets. Our visit to the Midwest allowed us to personally witness how public and private partnerships are being utilized to increase U.S. exports and promote sustainable development in the agriculture industry both domestically and abroad. It was extremely beneficial to hear directly from those affected and the impact this has on their goals, both domestically and in the export market. Trip participants paid a visit to Hormel where they learned about meat processing and about the impact of exports on the company.

"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication in  Forestry  Oct 07,  National forests provide about ates. The U.S. Forest Service is partnering with the Learn to Ski and Snowboard Month (LSSM) initiative, scheduled for January , encouraging Americans to explore winter recreation activities during the upcoming winter season. Together, the Forest Service and LSSM are aiming to enhance youth development and increase environmental stewardship, while promoting safe winter recreation activities. Professional lessons are often recommended. In January , LSSM reported that 75,000 lessons were taught, a significant increase from the 30,000 reported the previous year. In , the initiative aims to reach at least 150,000 participants. Skiing is one of the most popular activities on Forest Service lands. In fact, there are 122 ski areas on National Forest System lands across the country, which is about ates. Further, 15 percent of the Forest Service’s 173 million visits per year are on ski areas. As a result, skier visits on national forests provide significant local economic contributions. Specifically, they support about 78,000 full- and part-time jobs, ultimately contributing about $5 billion to the Gross Domestic Product. This partnership supports national initiatives, including America’s Great Outdoors, the First Lady’s Let’s Move! and the Presidential Active Lifestyle Award program.

"in  Conservation  USDA Results  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Initiatives  Apr 29,   In the four years I’ve served as Deputy Secretary, I’ve talked with thousands of women in agriculture – from young women thinking about entering farming to older women who have been tilling the soil for decades.  Each of their stories is powerful on its own.  But taken together, they have been an inspiration to the entire country. And today, we know that there are nearly one million of these stories around the country – nearly one million women farming and ranching on America’s working lands. A study released today by USDA’s Economic Research Service, Characteristics of Women Farm Operators and Their Farms found that the number of women-operated farms more than doubled between and . When all women involved with farming are added up – including primary and secondary operators – they are nearly one million strong and account for 30% of U.S. farmers. The study also found that the number of women-operated farms increased in all sales classes, suggesting that size does not matter when it comes to agricultural opportunity for women. This puts real numbers to a trend that many of us have seen firsthand: there is serious momentum behind women in agriculture.  This is personally gratifying for me – supporting women in agriculture has long been one of my passions. And it is a sign of the growing importance of USDA efforts to reach women farmers and ranchers. While at USDA, I’ve made this a priority. For instance, in the last four years, USDA’s Farm Service Agency has made significant modifications to its County committee structure to ensure fair representation of minority and women producers. We are also highlighting the accomplishments of women in agriculture, even as we work to ensure that USDA programs serve them better. Through the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative, we’ve seen how women are driving the development of local and regional food systems across the country.  Last fall, I penned an op-ed with another women leader in agriculture, New Hampshire Agricultural Commissioner Lorraine Stuart Merrill, about the contributions women are making in the Granite State’s economy through local food. The ERS study also finds that women are leaders in livestock production.  Nearly half of our country’s women-operated farms—those for which a woman is primarily responsible for making the business decisions—specialize in livestock. During a White House Google+ Hangout about women in agriculture, I talked with Cory Carman, a fourth-generation rancher from eastern Oregon who left farming for another career only to follow her heart back to Carman Ranch to raise cattle.  Now she is the operator of a thriving direct-marketing beef business. For me, one of the most exciting findings of the ERS report is that younger women are entering farming faster than older women are leaving. Women also have a higher land ownership rate than their male counterparts, with 85% of women owning all of the land they farm, compared to 66% of their male counterparts. But women farmers and ranchers still have a ways to go. More women than men rely on off-farm income, suggesting that farming cannot support them full-time. Only 5% of women-operated farms have sales of $100,000 or more. Tonight, I will be traveling to LaCrosse, WI to join WomenShare , an event focused on women in the food system. This will be my last official travel as Deputy Secretary of USDA. As I prepare to leave my post as the highest ranking woman at the Department, know that I will continue to work on advancing women’s opportunities in agriculture. One million women is only the beginning.

I recently attended one of these workshops to introduce our veterans to my agency – the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). In particular, I talked about opportunities to strengthen the local food sector via AMS’ Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program (which includes the Local Food Promotion Program and the Farmers Market Promotion Program) as well as the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. I also talked about our recent partnership with the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to begin a series of grant-writing workshops to help potential grant applicants write successful grant applications. Our goal is for Veterans Farm to add USDA resources to its already impressive list of offerings for the veteran community. Currently, the organization provides training workshops in land acquisition, planning, resource management, mentoring, case management, agro-business, and a fellowship program.  Burke hopes to help veterans create solid agricultural businesses that will thrive by expanding their markets thus allowing returning veterans to integrate honorably and effectively into local communities.  The effective approaches used by Veterans Farm earned recognition from the White House.  In , Burke received the Presidential Citizens Medal – recognized as the second highest civilian award of our government.

"Public Affairs Specialist, National Forests in Florida in  Forestry  Mar 30,  Recreation Technician Sherry Gaston of the Apalachicola National Forest bags trash littering the forest during Super-Clean Sweep. (U.S. Forest Service photo by Susan Blake) Volunteers from the U.S. Forest Service joined forces with Leon County, Florida residents recently to participate in the county’s 17th annual Super-Clean Sweep cleanup activities which included parts of the Apalachicola National Forest. The county-wide event was part of the “Keep Tallahassee Leon County Beautiful” program which drew nearly 100 volunteers from county and city agencies, local organizations and local citizens. “Illegal dumping continues to be a problem in the forest. We go in each year with teams of volunteers and clean up “hot spots” identified by the Forest Service, Leon County Sheriff’s Department, and forest user groups,” said community volunteer Sharon Gray. Over the years, several organizations have signed on to help sponsor the event including Southern Trail Riders, Tallahassee Off Road Club, Capital City Jeepers and Forest Edge Neighborhood, Leon County Public Works, Solid Waste Division and Recycling, and the Leon County Sheriff’s Department. The volunteers bagged trash, in addition to collecting everything from tires to electronics.  Leon County Solid Waste Division, another sponsor of the event, hauled away tons of debris. “In previous years we have designated a roll-off container specifically for metal. Anything metal retrieved from the forest is sold. This year, very little metal was picked up. A sign of the times?” said Gray. Recreation Technician Sherry Gaston, who has participated in the event since , volunteered along with her son.  “I participate because I hope to make a difference. If people see the area cleaned up, maybe they won’t consciously dump in the forest,” said Gaston. This is the fourth year in a row that Reya Williams, an information receptionist, has volunteered for the cleanup. “My hope is that this brings awareness to the issue of illegal dumping and littering in our forest,” said Williams. “I enjoy coming out every year to help make Leon County and the forest a cleaner, better place.”  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Tags:  Apalachicola National Forest  Florid  Forestry  FS  Leon County",Here's a question based on the content: What is the main issue that volunteers from the U.S. Forest Service and local organizations are trying to address through their annual Super-Clean Sweep cleanup activities in the Apalachicola National Forest?,Illegal dumping continues to be a problem in the forest.

USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) supports four non-profit trade organizations, called State Regional Trade Groups (SRTGs), that provide hands-on support and assistance to U.S. small-and medium-size companies seeking to build a global business. SRTGs, working in conjunction with the state departments of agriculture in their respective regions, can help beginning exporters with everything from learning the fundamentals of exporting to identifying overseas opportunities and finding potential distributors. With support from FAS’ Market Access Program, SRTGs also help fund international marketing campaigns and promote U.S. farm and food products overseas. Getting back to pomegranates, consider the ones grown on the Oro Loma Ranch, a small family-owned business in rural Firebaugh, Calif. The ranch teamed up with an SRTG – the Western United States Agricultural Trade Association, or WUSATA – in the spring of to increase markets for its fresh and packaged pomegranate products. Oro Loma Ranch participated in WUSATA’s branded program, which provides cost-share funding for eligible international marketing and promotional activities. After just one year in the program, the company’s exports of fresh pomegranates to Canada are up 33 percent, and sales of packaged pomegranate seeds are up 66 percent. Jason Hall, president of Oro Loma Ranch said, “We’re very pleased with this first-year performance, and we are continuing to see growth. Participating in WUSATA’s branded program has definitely helped our brand awareness.” WUSATA’s support enabled the company to develop marketing materials aimed at the Canadian market and to exhibit at the Canadian Produce Marketing Association trade show. Hall continued, “The growth we’ve experienced has given us the confidence to invest more in advertising and promoting. The more you put into it, the better results you get.” For more information on how FAS and STRGs can help new exporters build their global businesses, visit www.fas.usda.gov/topics/exporting/getting-started.

"Fire and Aviation Management, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Aug 10,  If You Fly, We Can't infographic. Design credit: Mary Horning, US Forest Service (Click to view a larger version) Recreational drones or Unmanned Aircraft Systems sometimes called UAS have become increasingly popular in the past few years. While this is an interesting hobby and can allow you to get beautiful aerial photography, some activities pose a significant hazard. The use of these drones to capture video footage of wildfires is one of those hazardous activities. The US Forest Service wants you to know that unauthorized drone flights near a wildfire have the very real potential to cause serious injury or even death to firefighters and pilots who are in the air, as well as firefighters and public citizens on the ground. This is because aerial firefighting aircraft, such as airtankers and helicopters, fly at very low altitudes, the same as drones flown by the general public, creating an environment for mid-air collisions. Adding to this disastrous mix of unauthorized drone flights and fire is the fact that firefighting aircraft typical fly in smoky, windy and turbulent conditions. Safety depends on knowing what other aircraft are operating in the airspace and where they are at all times. Consequently, their safety is compromised by the presence of a drone. Suspending air operations because of drone use, which has happened several times already on major fires, could decrease the effectiveness of wildfire suppression operations. This year alone there have been at least 13 instances of unauthorized flights of drones over or near wildfires in at least seven states including California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Alaska, Minnesota, and Montana. The effects of lost aircraft airtime could be compounded by potential flames moving into untreated terrain. This type of delay can allow wildfires to grow larger with the potential to threaten lives and property. Suspended air operations can also delay transportation of firefighters to different locations and add to costs of fighting the fire. Those who fly drones without authorization over wildfires may be violating federal, state, or local laws, regulations, and ordinances, whether a Temporary Flight Restriction is in place or not. All unauthorized drone flights over wildfires on National Forest System lands will be reported to the Federal Aviation Administration and law enforcement agencies. Individuals who have been determined to have endangered manned aircraft or people on the ground with a drone or interfered with wildfire suppression may be subject to civil penalties, including fines of up to $25,000, and potentially criminal prosecution. So please be smart about where and when you choose to fly your drone.  If you fly, we can’t. And if we can’t we are unable to do our jobs to protect you, your family, or your neighbors from a wildfire. Firefighting aircraft, like drones, fly at low altitudes creating a high probability of collisions.

"APHIS Asian Longhorned Beetle Eradication Program in  Animals  Plants  Dec 17,  Two Asian longhorned beetles on maple tree Today is National Maple Syrup Day!  So, what does maple syrup have in common with an invasive insect?  Well, if the insect is the Asian longhorned beetle, then they both can come from maple trees.  Obviously, we want the maple syrup and not the invasive beetle.  But who cares?  And why should anyone care?  Well, I care and here’s why: Not only do I work for the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, an agency that is actively fighting known infestations of Asian longhorned beetle in three different states, but I also am a native of Vermont. According to a release about Maple Syrup Production issued by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, Vermont is responsible for 40% of the United States’ maple production – that’s 1,320,000 gallons from just one tiny state!  It typically takes 50 gallons of sap to make one gallon of maple syrup.  A single maple tree can produce an average of 15 gallons of sap per season, so you need at least 3-4 maple trees just to make the one gallon of syrup.  Many Vermonters like to say they have maple syrup running through their veins; it’s simply that important, valued, needed and wanted. But the Asian longhorned beetle is a real threat to our country’s maples trees and to 12 other types of hardwood trees too.  It doesn’t belong here and we don’t want it here.  When the beetle attacks trees, its larva feed on the heartwood or center part causing tunneling that can make a cross-section of a tree look like a piece of Swiss cheese.  The damage weakens the tree and eventually the tree will die. The best line of defense is you.  In honor of National Maple Syrup Day, and for the love of all things maple, I am asking you to take a look at your trees.  If you are outside, just walk up to a tree and see if it has round holes on the trunk and/or branches – these holes are caused by the adult beetle when it exits the tree.  The holes are a little bit smaller than a dime and just a bit bigger than the circumference of a pencil.  You won’t see the adult as they die off with the first hard frost, but you can still see the holes and other signs of damage. The sooner we know about an ALB infestation, the sooner we can do something about it, so please report any sightings.  Long live National Maple Syrup Day!

"Endangered Mississippi Frog Finds a New Home  To most people, the sound heard near Pony Ranch Pond could easily be mistaken as snoring. To local conservation professionals, however, it was more like a song, signifying hope and celebrating a small victory for the nearly extinct dusky gopher frog. In February, National Forests in Mississippi staff, researchers and volunteers discovered and documented six dusky gopher frogs at the De Soto National Forest pond. One frog, a 5-year-old female, had travelled nearly a mile from nearby Glen’s Pond – until then the only known site where the endangered amphibians live and breed.

"Civil Engineer, NRCS Massachusetts in  Conservation  Oct 12,  NRCS Massachusetts civil engineer Jim Lyons oversees operations at the Nichols Dam. Just before Tropical Storm Irene hit Massachusetts, employees of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), including me, were informed of the storm’s potential impact on a dam rehabilitation project that was underway in Westborough, Mass., a suburban community west of Boston. At the time, NRCS was working to widen the auxiliary spillway at the George H. Nichols Dam, a flood retention structure owned by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). This project was made possible with nearly $2 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of (the Recovery Act) funds. The Recovery Act was created by the Obama Administration to boost the nation’s economy, in part by developing and improving infrastructure like dams. A spillway acts like a safety valve to prevent water from flowing over the top of the dam in a storm, which can damage the dam and compromise its structural integrity. With the new spillway excavated, the dam was in danger of breaching if the eight inches of rain that were forecast for the following 12 hours actually occurred. The potential for major flooding and property damage was significant. I immediately contacted the contractor and asked that they begin preparations for the storm, including the construction of an earthen berm in the new auxiliary spillway to protect the dam from breaching. I also called the city’s Conservation Commission for permission to lower the water level in the reservoir to increase its capacity. On Saturday, the day of the storm, my work began at 4 a.m. I coordinated with local emergency management officials and state dam safety personnel, and ensured that the contractor completed the work. Contractors consult with federal, state and local officials on preparations to help the Nichols Dam weather Tropical Storm Irene The rain started at 1 p.m.; construction continued until 9 p.m. I went home at 11 that night. By 3 a.m. I was back on site to monitor precipitation and the impoundment level. I left to get some sleep but was back again by 6 a.m. By this time, the rain and wind intensity had increased. Throughout the morning, I measured precipitation and reservoir levels and forwarded the to engineering consultants who were revising various mathematical models of potential flood impact based on the forecasted rainfall. Ultimately, the reservoir crested at 2 inches below the existing auxiliary spillway. By the time Irene was done with us, many trees were down and most of the area was without power, including the construction trailer. The weekend was certainly long and exhausting, but it was rewarding, too: the dam weathered the storm with only minor damage. Learn more about NRCS Recovery Act Programs.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. During the month of April we will take a closer look at USDA’s Groundbreaking Research for a Revitalized Rural America, highlighting ways USDA researchers are improving the lives of Americans in ways you might never imagine. Over the past several decades, satellite imagery has emerged as one of the most valuable new tools in modern agriculture. At USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), we strive to remain at the forefront of this technology to continually advance our statistical products in service to U.S. agriculture. To keep abreast of how our counterparts in other countries are implementing this exciting new technology, last month we hosted representatives from the Canadian and Mexican agriculture departments in a Tripartite meeting. As geographic neighbors and statistical collaborators, we are particularly interested in each others' work and how we can learn from each other. It was exciting to see that Statistics Canada, working with Agriculture and Agri-food Canada, is researching new remote sensing-based yield models, using vegetative indices, agro-climactic , and survey for 21 crops. As a result of this innovation, Stats Canada is planning to use only remote sensing to set their official estimates for these crops rather than conducting traditional surveys. This is a tremendous step forward for a statistical estimates program that we will be watching with great interest.

"Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 30,   NOTE: This week on the USDA Blog, we’ve been featuring the stories of America’s Harvest Heroes who, like farmers across the nation, are working this harvest season to secure the bounty of healthy food American agriculture is renowned for. From laying the foundation for the next generation of farmers putting down roots in rural America, supporting the fruit and vegetable growers who are helping to build healthier communities, bolstering new markets for the products of agricultural innovation, to harvesting renewable energy that is made in Rural America, with USDA’s support our farmers are yielding strong results for every American. This blog focuses on two heroes of a different kind of harvest – clean, renewable energy that is . I spent some time in Montana earlier this month to attend the Harvesting Clean Energy conference in Billings. We talked about options for continuing to support clean energy development, whether it's bio-based, geothermal, solar, or wind – and how rural America fits in to the picture of clean energy development. Our Rural Energy for America Program was, unsurprisingly, a key focus by the participants. Having been reauthorized by the recent Farm Bill, Congress put REAP in a position to have very real impact on clean energy development in our rural communities. If properly leveraged with other programs, both private and public, and investment from the private sector – the funding made available by Congress could conceivably have a billion-dollar impact on clean energy development in our nation. Red Lodge Ales owner Sam Hoffmann (middle) explains his brewery’s thermal solar heating system to Montana State Director Janelle Gustafson (l) and Deputy Under Secretary Lillian Salerno (r). Hoffmann used the Rural Energy for America Program to purchase and install the thermal system. What strikes me the most is, how many of the projects to this point have been implemented. Rather than just the large complexes – which certainly have their place in the overall picture – rural America has responded by implementing small-scale projects, often at an individual business level, that have had noteworthy impact on the energy structure in their communities. While in Montana, I was able to see first-hand how these small scale projects have made a positive change on not just the carbon footprint and energy consumption of rural small businesses, but on their operational bottom line. I visited Red Lodge, Montana, a small community southwest of Billings that acts as a gateway in to Yellowstone National Park via the Beartooth Highway. Two particular businesses stood out for me, the Yodeler Motel, and Red Lodge Ales. Both companies had made investments in their businesses through the Rural Energy for America Program, and done so on a relatively small scale – yet had seen a direct and positive impact on their operations due to the cost savings from the renewable energy sources. Harnessing the sun's radiant thermal energy to heat water, both the Yodeler and Red Lodge Ales have utilized the water in different ways to benefit their businesses. The Yodeler uses the heated water in their boiler to heat the rooms and common areas of the historic motel on the south end of Red Lodge. Mac Dean of the Yodeler Motel in Red Lodge, Mont. explains the thermal transfer system that supplies the motel's boiler with heated water, providing warmth to the Yodeler's rooms and common areas. Red Lodge Ales takes the pre-heated water, and superheats it to clean their brewing tanks, as well as maintain the necessary heat to brew their beer. It's a prime example of two different businesses using similar technology to harvest the abundant, clean, and free energy around us to benefit not only the businesses themselves – and their bottom line – but to benefit their community and the environment as a whole. I'm proud that USDA Rural Development could play a role in that.

"AMS Livestock, Poultry, and Seed Program Deputy Administrator in  Conservation  Jun 26,  Verity Ulibarri is the vice president for Farm Credit of New Mexico and a board director for the Sorghum Checkoff. Ulibarri is a fifth-generation farmer who always wanted to be a farmer. Meet Verity Ulibarri Family values have proven to be the source of Verity Ulibarri’s success. As the vice president for Farm Credit of New Mexico and a board director for the Sorghum Checkoff, the sorghum producer from New Mexico is making strides in the agriculture industry. Ulibarri, a fifth-generation farmer, said she always wanted to be a farmer. She and her husband, Anthony, started their own farming operation in . They grow sorghum and wheat and run stocker cattle on approximately 1,700 acres of land. “I grew up driving tractors and working cattle,” said Ulibarri. “I’ve always had a liking for it and a desire to do that.  It is my goal to keep propagating the family-farm lifestyle because I think that it is important for kids to grow up with strong family values. It will make them strong contributors to society.” As a board director for the Sorghum Checkoff, Ulibarri is excited about the opportunity to educate other producers about the benefits of growing sorghum. With the drought and current water situation in New Mexico, she has been having a lot of conversations with farmers about considering grain sorghum, a crop that typically requires less water while providing a satisfactory return on investment. This industry leader said she promotes the crop in other ways, as well, encouraging individuals to include more sorghum-based foods in their diets and informing them about the many products currently available. Agriculture has become more progressive in order to keep up with the increasing demand, Ulibarri said, and she contributes her personal success within the sorghum industry to her upbringing. “My parents raised me to be pretty independent, competitive, and to strive to do my best no matter what,” she said. “That is probably the biggest reason I am where I am today. It really has nothing to do with the fact that I am male or female, but that I have the ability and drive to do a good job.”  Category/Topic:  Conservation  Tags:  AMS  Farm Credit of New Mexico  Farmers  New Mexico  Producers  research and promotion programs  sorghum  Sorghum Checkoff",Here is a clear and specific question related to agriculture: What are the benefits of growing grain sorghum in areas with drought conditions and limited water resources?,"According to Verity Ulibarri, a board director for the Sorghum Checkoff, growing grain sorghum requires less water while providing a satisfactory return on investment.

During the National Conference, 4-H students split into groups based on their areas of interest in order to spend time discussing issues relevant to their communities, and researching federal programs that have a positive impact on those issues.  USDA employees from the Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships had the opportunity to meet at the White House Conference Center with 25 4-H students representing 17 different states.  The students were asked to research the issue of childhood obesity and present a proposal for how they would implement the First Lady’s Let’s Move! initiative in their communities.  The group proposed a two-pronged strategy that focused on increasing the amount of time spent in physical activity during the school day while also improving nutrition education in schools for students of all ages.  The students felt that a partnership between the First Lady’s initiative and schools would help reduce childhood obesity. While one group of 4-H students reported on their Let’s Move! plans to USDA staff, another group presented their research on reducing childhood obesity with staff from the HHS Partnership Center. The students choreographed a dance routine and each student offered a statistic that outlined the scope of the obesity challenge (for example, childhood obesity is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease) and proposed solutions to tackling it. Like the students at USDA, they proposed more rigorous physical education in schools, with a focus on physical activities that provide students the “skills to better themselves.” They also spoke about the value of reading nutritional labels, as well as the importance of social activities like town dances that provide exercise and help build a sense of community. 4-H students present their work on implementing Let’s Move! in schools at the White House Conference Center. Students in both groups also detailed how they plan to support Let’s Move! in their local communities by promoting and leading initiatives aimed at improving nutrition education and increasing physical activity. The students discussed creating clubs, working with their school districts, and developing a social media strategy to engage youth and teens in creating healthy habits.  The presentations ended with a question and answer session that included a great discussion on how to most effectively use social media to connect with teenagers.

Through his amazement and curiosity, he fully explored all corners of the DC Truck Farm. He then made his way through the walking paths of the garden. Along the way, he stopped to make his own seed tape – where he pasted radish seeds on a strip of newspaper to take home and plant later. This activity is an easy and fun way to teach kids about seed spacing. He learned, unlike other living things, plants can’t walk to find the space they need to live and thrive.

"Department of the Interior Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget and Robert Bonnie, U.S. Department of Agriculture Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  Feb 04,  Land and Water Conservation Fund, Land Acquisition Budget Proposal FY map. (Click for a larger version) Over 50 years ago, a visionary Congress established an innovative program to bring communities together to invest in open spaces and recreational opportunities that are an essential part of our nation’s heritage and economy. Since then, the highly successful Land and Water Conservation Fund has helped to protect working forests and ranches, preserve our public lands -- parks, refuges,  forests, rivers, lakes and wildlife habitats -- and provide access to outdoor recreation across the nation for use and enjoyment by all Americans. President Obama is committed to passing on America’s public lands and waters to future generations in better shape than we found them. That’s why he is proposing full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund in the Fiscal Year budget, and pursuing permanent authorization in annual mandatory funding for the Fund’s programs beginning in . In , the budget will invest $900 million in conservation and recreation projects – a  portion of the revenues from offshore oil and gas drilling that are deposited in the fund each year –through a combination of discretionary ($475 million) and mandatory ($425 million) funding. This culminates a multi-year strategy leading to full permanent funding for the Fund in . These investments – using voluntary conservation tools like easements and purchases from willing sellers – respond to local communities’ priorities. They will conserve public lands in or near national parks, refuges, and forests, including landscapes identified for collaborative, strategic conservation; increase access for hunting and fishing; protect historic battlefields; and provide grants to states for close-to-home recreation and conservation projects on non-federal lands. This is great news for all Americans – from hunters and anglers, to outdoor enthusiasts and history buffs, to communities large and small across the nation who benefit from the Land and Water Conservation Fund investments. In fact, the program has supported more than 42,000 national, state and local parks and outdoor recreation projects in all 50 states. This year’s budget proposes to fund projects across the country - from expanding access to outdoor recreation opportunities in the High Divide in Idaho and Montana, to protecting endangered wildlife and watersheds in the headwaters of the Everglades in Florida - that will help strengthen local economies and enhance our public lands and waters.  Other projects will preserve the wetlands and grasslands popular with hunters and fishermen in North Dakota and South Dakota.  In Maryland and Virginia, the budget proposes to protect wildlife habitats as well as significant archaeological sites in American history by enhancing the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail, and the Nanjemoy National Resource Management Area.  A full list of the proposed projects is available here. When we talk about investing in our future, the Land and Water Conservation Fund is one of the most effective programs there is, with conservation and recreation projects serving as a big boon to local economies, bolstering tourism and supporting jobs. For every $1 invested through the Land and Water Conservation Fund, there is an estimated return of $4 in local economic activity.  This is not only good for our nation, environment and people, it’s also a good return on investment. Congress recently took an important initial step to reauthorize and support the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but we need to do more. By fully and permanently funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund – as millions of Americans are urging – we can do our part to help sustain our nation’s public lands and waters for present and future generations. Since , USDA has invested more than $29 billion to help producers make conservation improvements, working with as many as 500,000 farmers, ranchers and landowners to protect over 400 million acres nationwide, boosting soil and air quality, cleaning and conserving water and enhancing wildlife habitat.

"Wildlife after Wildfire in Southern Appalachia  It was my first prescribed burn. After weeks of training and months of anticipation, I was finally on the ground – drip torch in hand – ready to apply fire to restore the mixed pine-hardwood forests at the edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains on the Pisgah National Forest. Joining the U.S Forest Service only two months earlier, my knowledge of fire’s effect on plant and wildlife communities was limited. But as the coordinator for the Grandfather Restoration Project, part of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration program, I had to quickly come up to speed with the on-the-ground reality of prescribed fire use.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Sep 23,  Workers replace a culvert with a larger one to accommodate higher water flows on the Colville National Forest (Photo Credit: USFS).  Preparing for the effects of climate change, the U.S. Forest Service has taken the lead in a new report that highlights actions taken by federal agencies to adapt to a changing climate. “Some federal agen­cies are making good progress in climate change adaptation,” said University of Washington scientist and lead author Jessica Halofsky. “Most agencies have broad plans that describe approaches and priorities for climate change in general … but on-the-ground projects have been implemented slowly across the country.” The report, Climate Change Adaptation in United States Federal Natural Resource Science and Management Agencies: A Synthesis was a response to direction from the Obama Administration for federal agencies to stress their accomplishments in adapting to climate change. Published by the U.S. Global Change Research Program and funded by the Forest Service Climate Change Advisor’s Office, the report was written by Forest Service and University of Washington scientists. One challenge in writing the report is that each agency has a different focus for adaptation. For example, the National Park Service focuses on protecting ecosystems, while the Fish and Wildlife Service is concerned about the effects of a warming climate on salmon. The Department of Defense has as a focus of protecting coastal facilities so they are not damaged by sea-level rise. “We want to make sure that coordination is occurring in climate change programs across all federal agencies,” said Emily Seyller of the Global Change Research Program. “This new report gives us a baseline for coordinating responses to climate change in the years ahead."" Although some have called for greater certainty about climate change effects before taking action, the report documents that at the local level, agency resource managers are moving forward with climate change assessments and adaptation strategies. For example, the Forest Service has already completed assessments for a third of its national forests. “We’re drowning in and scientific publications,” said Forest Service scientist Dave Peterson. “We need to take the information we have, assess the risk of climate change on natural resources, and manage that risk as part of agency business.” The report’s authors are optimistic that federal agencies can make progress in climate change adaptation in the years ahead, but emphasize that implementation needs to be accelerated. “We’re not in crisis mode, but the clock is ticking as the climate continues to warm,” said Peterson. “If we don’t pick up the pace in responding, we may preclude options that would maintain the sustainability of resources on federal lands.”  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Tags:  Climate Change Adaptation in United States Federal Natural Resource Science and Management Agencies: A Synthesis  Fish and Wildlife Service  National Park Service  University of Washington  US Forest Service '  US Global Change Research Program",What are some effective adaptation strategies that federal agencies in the United States can implement to mitigate the effects of climate change on natural resources and agricultural productivity?,"1.

"Posted by I. J. Perez, Senior Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Marketing Service in  Initiatives  Mar 29,  USDA is grateful and proud of the contributions made by the more than 10,000 former service members it employs. Air National Guard photo: Tech. Sgt. Matt Hecht A tune John Fogarty wrote in echoes among veterans who spent time in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Lyrics reference a calm before a storm that’s “been comin’ for some time.” For many the turbulence continued long after departing Southeast Asia. Public sentiment roiled in a backlash of anti-war marches and protests when they returned. “Welcome Home” was rare and delivered in hushed tone—mostly from those with personal insight of where they had been. It took a toll on a generation of some nine million members of our armed forces who served during a 20 year period from -. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, approximately 7.2 million are living today. Healing wounds seen and unseen, suffered in spite of their burden, has been an unending effort across government agencies and the nation. Since then veterans’ organizations, public and private partnerships have made strides in mending damage. Iconic tributes like the Vietnam Memorial and annual Rolling Thunder motorcycle rally in Washington, D.C. provide some comfort for a generation that lost 58,220 men and women. Meanwhile, the search continues for 1,600 service members throughout Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam who remain unaccounted. The war has a complicated legacy that casts long shadows. Fifty years ago, Americans witnessed explicit images in photographs and television. Places like Khe Sanh, Hue, Tet, and My Lai summon indelible memories among those who survived, then faced the challenges of returning home. Soothing their injuries, both moral and physical, is ongoing. More recently the President signed the Vietnam War Veterans Recognition Act designating March 29 of each year as National Vietnam War Veterans Day. The 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War became official following passage of the National Defense Authorization Act in . By presidential proclamation in , the commemoration extends through Veterans Day . The tribute makes no distinction among veterans who served in-country, in-theater, or were stationed elsewhere during those two decades. All answered a call to duty. Today gives everyone a chance to recognize Vietnam Veterans for their service and sacrifice during one of the longest conflicts in our country’s history. As Americans unite to thank them, USDA is grateful to include more than 10,000 former service members in its ranks. The Department is especially proud of the contributions of this and every generation of veterans and their families. Veterans strengthen America’s rural economy.

"JUMP TO: Writing Style Plain Language My Signature Block Gender Inclusive Communications Guidance Accessibility Program-Specific  Further Agency Specific Guidance Overview USDA uses two styles for publications and printing. Materials developed primarily for the mass-media are written using the latest Associated Press Stylebook. All other materials are written using the latest Government Printing Office Style Manual in accordance with Title 44 U.S.C. § . Form and style of work for departments. Ensure your writing meets accessibility standards. Writing Style Associated Press [AP] or Government Printing Office Style (GPO): Which style manual do I use?  Why the differentiation?  Using the media prevalent style for the mass media audience increases the likelihood that our preferred USDA language appears in narratives as it was originally written.  The following lists USDA outreach products with for their production and the designated style. Also noted are exceptions to the style as deemed necessary by the Department.  These style are supplemental information to support the current department directives: DR-001 Publications Review/Clearance Policy; DR-002 Printing Policy; DR-002 Use of Logos/Marks at the United States Department of Agriculture; DR-002 Press Operations.  Press Releases  USDA press releases must adhere to the Associated Press Stylebook except where this document points to exceptions.  A press release is written to encourage media to report on a newsworthy USDA policy, action, or announcement. The department and our agencies’ public affairs directors and OC coordinators are responsible for determining whether a press release is an appropriate form of outreach.  Guidance for writing press releases  Use strong active verbs. Use plain language. In general, a news release shouldn't be longer than one page and no more than two pages. Keep it brief.  According to Cornell University, research suggests the ideal sentence length is 15 to 20 words, with 85 percent of the words one or two syllables long.  Don't resort to run-on sentences; instead, use punctuation. Always remember your audience are media professionals. Use plain language, since releases may be used verbatim in media outlets. Always read what you write and have a lay coworker read what you write. If they don’t understand it, chances are your audience won’t either.  Note: the media has significantly changed over the past fifteen years. Today, reporters are likely to be generalists without a strong agricultural or food policy background.  With rare exception, quotes should be 25 – 50 word maximum.  The purpose of the quote is to encourage the reporter to include the most important talking point using USDA’s exact words.  Reporter’s stories are bound by the newspaper/magazine/broadcast editors’ word/time limits. If you provide too much, you encourage the reporter to paraphrase or pick and choose what part of the quote to include in the story.  The reporter can be provided a press-background brief to educate them on the details of the program or policy announcement, it doesn’t need to be in the quote.  Quotes from outside principals, partners, or organizations are generally not used unless approved by the deputy director of communications for press operations. Key partnerships can be referenced in the release. Other federal agency quotes are acceptable with approval of the press secretary or their designee.  Jargon  Don't use jargon. If you absolutely must use a jargon word, explain it.  Web addresses/Internet  Say: ""More information is at www.usda.gov."" There is no need to use a colon before at. If an Internet address falls at the end of a sentence, use a period. Do not capitalize the ""e"" in email. Do not say “click here.”  Ending the Release  End news releases with three # symbols, centered, two lines below the last line of the release.  Place this short EEO statement two lines below the three # symbols: “USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer, and lender.”  A short note after the text of a news release can be used to provide additional information to the media, such as the availability of photographs, publications or sound bites. Any ""Note to Reporters,"" if needed, should be single-spaced, not exceed 1/3 of a page in length, and start two lines below the #.  Following are some specifics to keep in mind when preparing materials. These include some USDA specific directions for formatting the press release.  Acronyms  Spell out U.S. Department of Agriculture and names of agencies and programs in the first reference. If an abbreviation or acronym would not be clear on second reference, do not use it. Often a generic word such as the agency or the program is more appropriate and less jarring to the reader. At other times, you may need to repeat the full name for clarity.  *Note: AP doesn't follow a term with an abbreviation in parentheses, though a well-known abbreviation may be used in follow-ups.  Attribution  Use said. It is a good, clean, four-letter word. Do not use: stated, noted, pointed out, commented, explained, or any other similar word. Use said.  In the first reference to the Secretary: “Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack”  Second reference and beyond: “Secretary Vilsack”  Conjunctions  Follow AP style. When a conjunction such as and, but or for links two clauses that could stand alone as separate sentences, use a comma before the conjunction in most cases: “She was glad she had looked, for a man was approaching the house.”  Commas in a series  Use commas to separate elements in a series, but do not put a comma before the conjunction in most simple series: The flag is red, white and blue. He would nominate Tom, Dick, Harry or Jeannette.  Press release contact information  When the Secretary of Agriculture or subcabinet officials are quoted, list the Office of Communications at press@usda.gov (the general OC email address) as the first contact with the appropriate agency contact listed second. Do not put a comma between names and phone numbers.  Datelines  Datelines should be bold, and include city, month (use AP abbreviation), day and year. Datelines on stories should contain the place name, followed in most cases by the name of the state, country or territory where the city is located. AP allows for large cities to stand alone without a state name. See the AP stylebook for a complete list of exempted cities.  If an announcement is made by a USDA official when he or she is away from Washington, use the city where the official is that day as the dateline.  Capitalize the names of months in all uses.  Example  USE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7, —  DO NOT USE: (Washington, D.C., January 7, )  Formats  Single space news releases and other press materials. Justify them left, with 1-inch margins and half-inch indents. Skip one line between paragraphs. Use only Times New Roman 12-point typeface. Use MSWord software, Drupal or another USDA Chief Information Officer- approved content management system.  Headlines  Center headlines and boldface them. Do not use all caps. Capitalize the first letter in words except for conjunctions (but), prepositions (of) and articles (a). Follow the same rules for subheads, and put subheads in italics centered below the headline. Headlines and subheads are active tense.  With headlines that include the Secretary of Agriculture, this is the proper form: “Secretary Vilsack announces…”  Do not use the principal’s first name in the headline.  Stakeholders  Don't use the word stakeholders. Instead, describe who you mean, such as farmers, ranchers, commodities groups, members of Congress, private sector partners, public sector partners, or federal agencies.  AP Styleguide Exceptions  In the first reference to the Secretary: “Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack”  Secretary quote should be followed by: “said Secretary Vilsack.”  Media Advisory  Media advisories are used to announce a media call or press event where a principal USDA representative will make a significant newsworthy announcement. The primary audience is media.  USDA media advisories are to adhere to the Associated Press Stylebook, and should include the date, time, location, and RSVP information for the event along with other pertinent event information. Media Advisories use the same formatting/layout as a press release and have the same style exceptions.  Media Background Brief  Media background briefs are flyers and factsheets developed specifically to provide the media with additional detailed information that is not included in a press release or response to query. The audience is primarily media, and the information is attributable to USDA versus a specific person.  USDA media background brief text are to adhere to the Associated Press Stylebook, and the USDA style guide which outlines the use of graphics, EEO statements and other visual elements. Media background briefs may be uploaded to the web in the agency’s pressroom along with the corresponding press release or media advisory.  Official Public Statements  USDA statements released to the media are to adhere to the Associated Press Stylebook.  Occasionally USDA Office of Communications, the Secretary, or an Agency Administrator will issue a short public statement to the media to highlight a significant initiative or policy position. Unlike a quote found in a press release, these statements may run as long as 125 words in length.  The statements are formatted the same as a press release.  Responses to Query  Responses to query are to adhere to the Associated Press Stylebook.  Responses to query are often used in lieu of a press release when the Department takes a significant policy action or other legal action that is not in the best interest of the department to promote. These short statements are provided to the media or other audiences upon request only. Word limit – 25-50 word maximum. In some cases, responses to query may include a corresponding media background brief.  USDA Web Content  With the exception of pages that specifically target the news media community (AP), web content should adhere to GPO style.  Blogs  USDA blogs are to adhere to the Associated Press Stylebook.  The primary purpose of USDA blog stories is to drive media interest in a specific program or policy; however, blogs also provide a direct to customer narrative that promotes USDA and are shared on USDA social media platforms and between individual stakeholders. Blogs should not be a replacement for press releases. USDA blog length: maximum 400 words.  AP Styleguide Exceptions  In the first reference to the Secretary: “Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack”  Secretary quote should be followed by: “said Secretary Vilsack.”  Stakeholder Notifications/Notice to Trade  USDA stakeholder notifications and notices to trade are to adhere to the Associated Press Stylebook.  Stakeholder notifications and Notices to Trade are communications to stakeholder groups announcing policy deadlines, board appointments, minor policy changes and the like that are not significant national newsworthy events. These notices may be posted on an agency website but they are typically communicated through direct email distribution.  The primary audience is not the media. Despite this, in many instances, stakeholder announcements may be posted on the web in agency newsrooms and are often picked up by trade press and other targeted distribution outlets. For this reason, they are written using the AP style.  Use the same USDA style exceptions and format as used for a press release.  Fact Sheets and Information Booklets  Fact sheets and information booklets and flyers are to adhere to the Government Printing Office Manual and the USDA style guide which outlines the use of graphics, EEO statements and layouts.  These communications are developed by agency and department program implementers in cooperation with their public affairs officers-- to inform the policy makers, the general public and program participants.  of research progress or of special program results that are in the public interest are to adhere to the Government Printing Office Manual and the USDA style guide which outlines the use of graphics, EEO statements and layouts. Plain Language The Plain Writing Act of (, 123 ) requires that all federal agencies write ""clear Government communication that the public can understand and use."" Public service means we must think of our readers first as they demand information that is accessible, logically organized, and readable. As USDA employees, we pledge to provide our constituents with information that is clear, understandable, and useful in every paper or electronic letter, publication, form, notice, or instruction we publish. For more information about what the Department is doing to improve plain language usage throughout the Department, and for guidance, e-mail plainlanguage@usda.gov or visit the Department’s Plain Language website. My Signature Block Signature blocks are intended to be used as a method of providing sender contact information to message recipients. When sending either internal or external emails, USDA employees are acting as representatives of their Agency and the United States Government. Email signature blocks must accurately reflect the position and culture of the U.S. Government and Federal workforce. The Department provides the following for email signature blocks: A signature block is typically located at the end of an e-mail message. The signature block is the part of an e-mail message that contains the sender's contact information. This information usually consists of at least the sender's name and phone number. A signature block might also include additional information, such as job title, department/organization, mailing/office address, e-mail address, fax or cell phone numbers, and the Department or Agency web site address. USDA employees have the option to include their pronouns in the first line of their signature block (i.e., he/him/his). Use of graphics in the signature block should be limited and is restricted to USDA and USDA business-related logos, such as the USDA logo. The USDA seal is reserved for use by the Secretary, the Secretary’s Senior Advisors, and the Mission Area Office staff. Academic titles are allowed in USDA Signature blocks with the following stipulations:  Only include the degree and credentials that you have earned that directly relate to your USDA subject matter expertise.  Examples:  If you received a Juris Doctorate degree and you work in the Office of General Counsel, your degree supports your credibility within your role and may be used.  If you have a PhD in English Literature, but you work as a Commodity Grader; your degree does not directly relate to your proficiency in your USDA role, and you should not include your academic title in your signature block. Famous quotations or inspirational messages should not be included if they have the potential to be construed by the recipient as representing a government policy or position. As a standard practice, USDA strongly discourages their use. When in doubt about what to include, less is generally more. Download Signature Template (, 32.1 ) Gender Inclusive Communications Guidance The use of inclusive language in communication symbolizes USDA’s commitment to the values of equity and equal opportunity for employees and those we serve. This guidance may be applied to any type of communication, whether it is oral or written, formal or informal, or addressed to an internal or external audience. Download Gender Inclusive Communications (, 550 )  Discussion  Purpose  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recognizes the need for a skilled, workforce that can provide equitable and high-quality service in all it does. Every USDA employee should have the opportunity to thrive in an inclusive environment that gives them a sense of belonging and develops them so they can make their unique contributions to USDA’s mission. This includes employing a workforce that represents the diversity of people served by USDA and supporting capabilities within every employee to provide excellent customer service to all, especially to individuals who have been unable to benefit from USDA programs and opportunities to improve their lives.  The words we use can make the difference between forging positive connections or creating distance in our personal and professional lives. As we build and provide services throughout USDA, we want to ensure the services are accessible and welcoming to all customers, employees, and stakeholders. Gender inclusive language or terms are those that are gender neutral and gender equitable. Such inclusive language helps us be more accurate and build trust with each other and our customers.  This Gender Inclusive Communications Guidebook (guidebook) serves as a resource of commonly used and preferred inclusive language for all internal and external USDA communication. Upon publication, this guidebook should be used as the primary guidance document for the standardization and use of gender inclusive language and terminology for USDA internal and external communications going forward.  This guidebook supplements the USDA Style Guide and the following Departmental Directives:  DR-001, Publications Review and Clearance Policy (01/14/21)  DR-002, Printing Policy (09/08/16)  DR-002, Use of Logos/Marks at the United States Department of Agriculture (01/08/)  DR-002, Press Operations (09/07/16)  DR-001, Photography Policy (02/07/03)  DR-002, Creative, Media and Broadcast Policy (08/04/11)  DR-001, New Media Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities (05/23/11)  DR-001, Governance (11/21/12)  DR-001, Approval of Communications/Information Products and Services (10/29/14)  This guidebook serves as a reference document and should be used in conjunction with training and technical assistance [e.g. assistance from employee resource groups and additional guidance documents] provided by USDA. This guidebook is a living document and will be periodically updated as USDA adopts more updated language, or as changes occur to Departmental directives, clearance processes, and other guidance documents and materials.  Background  In June , the U.S. Supreme Court held in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. , 590 U.S. ___ , that employment discrimination based on transgender status or sexual orientation constitutes prohibited discrimination based on sex under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of . Accordingly, the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock prohibits discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation in programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance. The Bostock decision is a demonstration of the changing views at federal and state levels toward strengthening and improving the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex (LGBTQI+) or other diverse gender identities represented by “plus,” including Two-Spirit, LGBTQI+ people in the areas of employment, health, education, housing and other fields.  U.S. demographic trends demonstrate a shifting perception of gender identity and expression. For instance, research indicates that about 1 in 5 U.S. adults know someone who goes by a gender-neutral pronoun. By utilizing inclusive language practices, we build upon an organizational culture of respect and belonging for those in the LGBTQI+) community, but also for anyone who in some way challenges the traditional model of gender identity and expression. This is particularly important when demonstrates that LGBTQI+ Americans face elevated levels of discrimination and mistreatment in education, employment, housing, health care, in places of public accommodations, or from law enforcement. In particular, transgender Americans also experience higher rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts that are four times and six times higher than the entire U.S. population.  USDA is committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where individuals are respected, trusted, valued, and work together collaboratively to achieve Departmental goals. This also means promoting an equitable environment that embraces the differences of not just its employees, but also of customers and stakeholders. USDA promotes a culture that uses inclusive language in written and oral forms of communication to internal and external audiences. This entails adjusting communications to use terms that do not refer to gender, rather than defaulting to gender-specific terms such as he, she, her and his without awareness of an individual’s preferences. Once an individual makes their preferences known, this should be respected in further interactions. In practice, this allows the individual an opportunity to share how they would like to be identified. For example, sharing one’s pronouns should be a voluntary activity, but using a person’s pronouns is a sign of respect. USDA is committed to the values of diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility, and equal opportunity for employees and those we serve. This guidebook provides practical direction to achieve this standard the Department.  Use of Pronouns in USDA Communications  Using an individual's correct pronouns is a powerful affirmation of self for transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals. It validates one's identity, encourages authenticity and builds inclusive and supportive cultures. USDA's correspondence and communication should aim to adopt the use of gender-inclusive pronouns; and normalize clarifying pronouns in communication to eliminate the possibility of misgendering individuals. As a default, the pronouns “they/them/their” should be used in USDA sponsored communications, outreach, and correspondence rather than ""he/she pronouns, unless Program guidance specifically directs otherwise.  An individual communicates their pronouns. For example, “Hi my name is John Doe and my pronouns are he/him/his” instead of “Hi my name is John Doe.” A good practice is to inquire into an individual's preferred greeting.  If they share, we must respect an individual's request. This also applies to non-written communication such as when interacting in person, via phone, and video calls.  General Communication  Gender Inclusive Greetings  The USDA's correspondence with the public may include people with gender-ambiguous names, which can place employees in the awkward position of conducting research on the individual’s gender without knowing their actual preferred prefixes and potentially using incorrect salutations. However, there are simple steps we can take to use gender-inclusive language. Using gender-neutral salutations in correspondences is the first step towards full gender inclusivity by eliminating the possibility of misgendering correspondence to recipients. It is encouraged to inquire into an individual's correct greeting. If they share, we must respect an individual's preferred greeting.  General Correspondence  General correspondence refers to written communication, typically sent and received by the public, including program participants and other informal entities. For the purpose of this guidebook, general correspondence refers to all forms of USDA communication not sent on official letterhead, such as emails, Microsoft Teams chats, text messages, and Ask USDA communications. These communications are still subject to records retention requirements as they remain official USDA communication. Examples of gender-inclusive greetings for general correspondence may include:  Using the recipient's full name: Dear [First Name] [Last Name] (e.g., Dear Simon Miller). This would be used in correspondence in Ask USDA and other Departmental and Mission Area, agency, and staff office emails with the public. First and last name would also be used for program applicants as we are contacting them as private individuals;  If no name is provided, addressing the recipient by ""To Whom it May Concern"" or using their email address; or  If only a first name is provided, using their first name.  Official Correspondence  Official correspondence refers to written communication received or sent on the organization's letterhead. For the purpose of this guidebook, official correspondence refers to, but is not limited to, all forms of USDA communication on official letterhead, such as communications with the White House, Congress, Recipients, and Government entities,  Examples of gender-inclusive greetings for official correspondence include:  Using addressee's title and last name for correspondence with official titles:  Dear [Title] [Last Name] (e.g. ""Dear Director Miller"" or ""Dear Representative Miller”); or  If unknown, address ""To Whom it May Concern"" or use their email address.  Correspondence Formatting  Individual Salutations  Avoid using Sir or Madam since the recipient may not identify with either gender.  If you do not know the person’s pronouns, use the format Dear [First name] [last name] such as Dear John Doe or Dear Jane Doe. You can also address them by their first name if the message is less formal.  When writing to an unknown receiver, use a generic salutation such as Dear [Customer], Dear [Stakeholder] or Dear [insert email address here]. Avoid addressing someone by gender-specific titles such as Mr., Ms. and Mrs., unless otherwise noted.  Group Salutations  When writing to a group of people, avoid using gender-specific words like Ladies, Guys, Girls, and Gentlemen. Instead use words like All, Teammates, Employees, Colleagues, and Staff when addressing employees.  Body  Use gender-neutral terms or gender-inclusive pronouns instead of gender-specific pronouns.  Avoid using phrases like “his” or “her” if you do not know the person’s pronouns.  If you are addressing a person, use your/them/their. For example, “please send me a copy of their resume” instead of “please send me a copy of his or her resume.”  If you’re not addressing a person, use grammatical articles such as “the” or “a.”  Closing  Choose standard closings such as Regards, Yours Truly, and Sincerely.  Signature Line  Whether sending either internal or external correspondence, USDA employees are acting as representatives of their Agency and the United States Government. Signature blocks must accurately reflect the position and culture of the U.S. Government and Federal workforce.  USDA employees are encouraged to include their pronouns in the first line of their email signature block (e.g. he/him/his). Signature blocks are a simple and effective way for individuals to communicate their identified pronouns to colleagues, stakeholders, and customers. For example, adding pronouns to signature blocks also has the benefit of indicating to the recipient that you will respect their gender identity and choice of pronouns. USDA employees are encouraged to review the USDA Style Guide regarding the use of specific graphics, quotes, or logos.  External and Internal Outreach  USDA Mission Areas, agencies, and staff offices are encouraged to engage with employees, customers, and stakeholders by sharing important USDA policies, actions, or announcements. Employees throughout the Department regularly communicate to the public in a multitude of ways and for several purposes. Communications may come from Mission Area or agency Public Affairs Directors; partnership and public engagement liaisons; External Affairs officials, and other teams and program offices across the Department., liaisons in Office of Partnerships & Public Engagement, External Affairs, Internal Government Affairs, Office of Communications (OC) and many others throughout the Department.  Videos and Press Media refers to visual and written communication. Within this guidance, press material refers to all forms of official USDA communication typically in the forms of press releases, videos from USDA senior leadership and communication memos. When communicating with employees, customers and stakeholders, we must ensure that the messages engage a wide range of audience members when possible.  Incorporating inclusive language and genders in USDA press releases, blogs, videos, and speeches must be respectfully considered. For example, when speaking of federal wildland firefighters, one should refer to them as “brave wildland firefighters,” instead of “brave men and women.” Likewise, visuals for press materials should not only represent cisgender people, but also reflect same sex couples and genders that are not normally associated with a particular program or circumstance.  For the purpose of this guidance, multimedia refers to visual aids and graphics such as pictures, fact sheets, infographics, and other types of visual outreach material. USDA Mission Areas, agencies, and staff offices are permitted to establish a presence online to share content and engage with stakeholders through social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, and YouTube. Guidance for the use and clearance of information to be used on these media types can be found in the USDA Style Guide and the Departmental Directives listed in the Purpose section at the beginning of this document. These Directives also outline the clearance processes for publications, print and video outreach.  When developing materials, we must be purposeful creating and sourcing images of diverse people in a wide range of roles. In this way, the images we use should represent multiple voices and perspectives. For example, visuals also reflect same-sex couples or genders that are not normally associated with a particular program. This also means providing alternate (alt) text or alt descriptions to convey the context of images as they appear in printed materials or on online platforms. For platforms that do not offer alt text options, alt text should be included within the post itself. For example: [Image description: alt text]. Keep in mind that when using stock images, it is important to use gender, race, age, or other keywords that have been given in the context of the photo. Do not assume the race or gender of an individual based on the image if that information is not included in the image description. If using images of people who have identified their pronouns, this should also be included in alt text.  The use of emojis, pictograms, or graphic designs, are often used in text and written messages to convey additional ideas or emotions. Social media managers should be cautious when using specific emojis to convey additional meanings. When using emojis, practice using non-gendered faces or if a gendered emoji is used, try to include various genders. More commonly, emojis have been used as a visual representation of the LGBTQI+ community through various including the use of rainbows, hearts, and multiple to represent skin color, to name a few iterations. Emojis are a valuable communication tool, but they can have multiple meanings that are not appropriate for government use.  Hashtags are a way to connect social media content to a specific topic, event, theme, or conversation. They also make it easier to discover posts around those specific topics, because hashtags aggregate all social media content with that same hashtag. Social media managers should always search hashtags before using them to make sure the conversation surrounding the hashtag is relevant and appropriate to your messaging. Social media managers should research hashtags carefully to be sure they are not being widely used in conjunction with inappropriate posts. Media managers should be sure that the conversation and the meaning of the hashtag has not changed from the intended purpose.  Social media managers should be cautious when using acronyms as part of a hashtag, as the acronym on its own can convey various meanings. Social media managers should consider that many social media platforms will index all terms in a post for discovery in search and trends, regardless if a hashtag is present.  Posting   The USDA encourages the use of various multimedia outlets to foster a more open and transparent relationship with our audiences. These audiences include but are not limited to employees, customers, stakeholders, and members of the public. USDA Mission Areas, agencies, and staff offices use social media to reach audiences quickly and easily, delivering information through a variety of platforms and formats as part of their integrated communication strategy. Because of this relationship, audiences engage with our content by expressing their thoughts, opinions and ideas through comments, reactions, and direct messages on social media. Social media managers should use best judgment when responding to an individual’s comments and direct messages.  When posting content, social media managers should adhere to the listed in the USDA Social Media Style Guide. Additionally, social media managers should use gender-inclusive language. When posting about USDA employees, social media managers should verify the employee’s pronouns.  The USDA does not agree with or endorse every comment that individuals post on our social media. Hate speech and harassment toward LGBTQI+ and other underrepresented communities is prevalent in online platforms and needs meaningful content moderation.  Social Media Manager Responsibilities  In addition to the following guidance, additional social media guidance on governance may be found in DR -001, New Media Roles, Responsibilities and Authorities. It is the social media manager’s responsibility to assess if a comment is harmful or makes a threat toward an individual or group of people. The social media manager is responsible for communicating any potential and legitimate threat to their Agency. Social media managers should take substantive and meaningful action to prioritize the safety of USDA employees, our customers, underrepresented community members and protected classes. If a social media manager encounters an inappropriate comment or a direct message, such as a negative opinion about LGBQTI+ individuals, then the social media manager may take the following actions:  If the comment does not warrant a response and is not harmful, then social media managers may ignore the comment. For the benefit of a robust and constructive conversation, USDA will allow comments that relate to the topic discussed within the corresponding post. USDA expects users to show respect, civility, and consideration to all posts and other users.  If the comment includes false information about the USDA and the social media manager feels that clarification of accurate information is important for the public, then the social media manager may respond to the comment.  Social media managers should keep in mind the following when responding to comments:  Be polite when responding;  Correct the message, rather than the individuals who spread it;  Use facts and when pointing out generalizations and inaccuracies; and  Aim to show a different perspective and share positive stories;  If the comment includes the following content, social managers may hide the comment:  Hate speech, including targeted slurs, intended to dehumanize, degrade or reinforce negative or harmful stereotypes about a protected group. This includes targeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals;  Profanity, obscenity or vulgarity;  Nudity in profile pictures; such as material that contains sexual content, which is overly graphic, disturbing, obscene, or offensive or material that would otherwise violate the law if published;  Defamation to a person or people, such as comments that are discriminatory, racist, offensive, obscene, inflammatory, unlawful or otherwise objectionable statements, language or content;  Name-calling and/or personal attacks;  Comments whose main purpose are to sell a product;  Comments that infringe on copyrights;  Spam comments, such as the same comment posted repeatedly on a profile; and  Advertisements for inappropriate websites or social media accounts;  If an individual repeatedly makes inappropriate comments that warrant hiding, then social media managers can block the user from the social media page. In these circumstances, it might be best to mute the account that is provoking the harm, and then take actions to block and report the user. Much the same, if the social media manager sees that another user is being attacked, then it is a best practice to report the profile to the appropriate social media platform.  Social media managers are encouraged to confer with subject matter experts, such as LGBTQI+ Special Emphasis Program Managers (SEPMs), Out and Equal, Equality USDA, and their respective Civil Rights Offices for additional guidance.  General USDA Examples  (a) For those who don’t fall neatly into either category, references to the binary male and female groupings can be alienating. According to the United Nations’ on gender-inclusive language, “Using gender-inclusive language means speaking and writing in a way that does not discriminate against a particular sex, social gender or gender identity, and does not perpetuate gender stereotypes. Given the key role of language in shaping cultural and social attitudes, using gender-inclusive language is a powerful way to promote gender equality and eradicate gender bias.”  (b) In an effort to eliminate the possibility of misgendering correspondence recipients, it is suggested that the following nouns and pronouns be used through the body of any USDA correspondence, guidance and regulations. Please note that this section is not an exhaustive list of examples that may occur at USDA. It is encouraged that each Agency create their own internal guidebook or implementation plan for use.  They/them instead of he/she;  Spouse or partner instead of husband/wife to spouse;  Folks or everybody instead of guys or ladies/gentleman;  Humankind instead of mankind;  People instead of men or women;  Parent instead of mother or father;  Sibling instead of brother/sister;  Child instead of son or daughter;  Members of Congress instead of Congressmen;  Councilperson instead of Councilman/Councilwoman;  First-year student instead of freshman;  Chair or Chairperson instead of Chairman;  Artificial or synthetic instead of man-made;  Workforce instead of manpower; and  Firefighters instead of firemen.  (c) Although well-meaning, the use of particular terms may act in completely altering and discrediting a particular group of people or culture. For example, in some communities, the use of the term “Latinx” in place of Latino or Latina is intended to promote gender language inclusivity. However, in the Spanish language, masculine and feminine nouns are engrained in the language itself and in an attempt to make terms gender inclusive, one may essentially alter the meaning of the language. For these reasons, it is important to know the audience to which you are directing your message.  Summary  This guidebook is a living document under the authority of the Office of Communications with support from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights and the Office of the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer.

Note: Not all transgender and/or non-binary people want to transition or are able to access the resources necessary to do so. However, regardless of whether, how, or when a person takes any, some, or all of these actions, their gender identity is valid and should be respected and affirmed.  Two-Spirit. A Native American identity which embodies traits of both men and women or of another gender than assigned.

"USDA Rural Development Hosts Turkish Delegation in Nebraska  Rural development officials from Hatay Province, Turkey were in the United States recently to learn about USDA Rural Development programs at the national level and in Nebraska.  Hatay Governor Mehmet Celalettio Lekesiz, Hatay Rural Development Agency Director Savas Ozgursoy and four agency staff were on the delegation tour. Turkey will soon be joining the European Union and Hatay is one of the 20 Turkish provinces chosen for the first phase of EU assistance to support the establishment of a rural development agency.  Hatay is in southeast Turkey, bordering Syria and on the Mediterranean Sea.  The first settlement goes back to 40,000 to 9,000 BC when the main city of Antioch was founded by one of Alexander the Great’s generals.  Vicki Schurman, USDA Nebraska Public Information Officer  Posted in  Rural  Mar 12,   Respond to this story","What are some key factors that Turkey's Hatay Province is focusing on as part of its rural development agency establishment, particularly in light of its upcoming EU membership?","Turkey's Hatay Province, as part of its rural development agency establishment, is likely focusing on developing and implementing effective programs to improve the livelihoods of rural communities, considering the upcoming EU membership. This might include initiatives related to agriculture, infrastructure, education, healthcare, and job creation, in line with European Union standards and best practices."

"Kids' State Dinner Celebrates Good Nutrition with MyPlate  On July 9th, budding young chefs gathered at the White House for the Let's Move! Kids’ State Dinner, hosted by First Lady Michelle Obama, to celebrate their culinary accomplishments in the Epicurious “Healthy Lunchtime Challenge”.  Let’s Move!, Epicurious, the U.S. Department of Education, and USDA collaborated on the challenge and honored the 54 finalists who created the winning recipes at last week’s celebration. Contestants were challenged to come up with healthy recipes using USDA’s MyPlate food icon for inspiration.  The winning recipes reflected the appealing symbol, with healthy amounts of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy. I was honored to be USDA’s advisor and a judge for this year’s competition, and attend the Kids’ State Dinner with the winners. Here, at the USDA, we are proud to see this national example of how MyPlate is helping children make healthy choices when preparing and consuming food.  Events such as this encourage other children to adopt good eating patterns and pursue healthy lifestyles.

"Celebrating 90-Plus Years of USDA's International Activities  The modern Foreign Service is celebrating its 90th anniversary this year, as is the American Foreign Service Association. In , President Calvin Coolidge signed the Foreign Service Act into law, combining the United States diplomatic and consular services to create the United States Foreign Service. By that time, the U.S. Department of Agriculture had already been posting employees overseas for 42 years. Thanks to President Coolidge’s curiosity, we possess a rare snapshot of USDA international activities in . On December 22 of that year, Coolidge, in his characteristically laconic style, sent a one-line letter to Secretary of Agriculture Howard Gore: “I shall appreciate it if you will send me as soon as possible a list of the representatives the Department may have abroad, their posts and just what they are doing.”  Surviving copies of urgent correspondence in the National Archives in College Park testify to the flurry of activity that ensued over the next two weeks as a call went out to all USDA field offices.

He is one of nearly 20,000 student ambassadors with Fuel Up to Play 60 (FUTP 60), a program launched by the National Dairy Council (NDC) and National Football League (NFL) in collaboration with USDA. FUTP 60 empowers youth like Jack to improve nutrition and physical activity at their schools and in their communities. Jack serves as student ambassador for his home state of Delaware. In late July, he and a select group of top ambassadors trained like athletes at the Fuel Up to Play 60 Summit in Chicago—his first visit ever to the Windy City. In addition to playing flag football, making friends and having a great time, the ambassadors learned all about nutrition and the benefits of getting at least 60 minutes of daily physical activity. Most importantly, they learned the leadership and communication skills necessary to work with students and school staff to deliver FUTP 60 activities that meet their school’s wellness goals.

"Plumas National Forest, and Stephanie Bryant, Pacific Southwest Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Aug 01,  (Left to right) Shawn White and Tom Bielecki, both U.S. Army veterans, and Kevin Black, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, spent the Fourth of July weekend in Plumas County, California. The three veterans are part of the Warrior Hike. While in Plumas County, they took part in the Mohawk Valley Independence Day celebration. The local Portola Rotary Club and employees from the Plumas National Forest supported the veterans during their stay. (U.S. Forest Service) U.S. Army veterans Shawn White and Tom Bielecki, along with U.S. Marine Corps veteran Kevin Black, set off to hike the entire Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail on April 12 as part of the Warrior Hike’s Walk Off the War program. Along the 2,650-mile journey, they will hike through 25 national forests. They recently passed through Plumas National Forest and stopped in Plumas County, California, where they were welcomed by the local community and invited to participate in the Mohawk Valley Independence Day festivities. The warrior hikers attended all of the weekend’s festivities, including a special recognition ceremony honoring all veterans that followed the Independence Day parade, appropriately themed “Honoring Our Veterans.” “The warrior hikers rode in golf carts with (more than 50 local) veterans from World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam War, and recent conflicts,” said Ann Taylor, a realty specialist for the Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest Region and member of the Portola Rotary Club that hosted the hikers. “The thing that impressed me was the great respect (the community) showed these veterans. They each seemed so moved by the ceremony offered after the parade, and it made me proud that I was a part of their experience and their journey home.” Plumas National Forest employees volunteered their time to shuttle the warrior hikers to and from the trail. The veterans’ six-month trek is part of the Walk Off the War program sponsored by the Warrior Hike in partnership with the Pacific Crest Trail Association. This is the first year participants hiked the trail. The program focuses on outdoor therapy supporting combat veterans transitioning from their military service back to civilian life. “The thing that I think is really exciting is that the Pacific Coast Trail provides a platform for transition and life-changing experiences and an opportunity for healing and growth,” said Beth Boyst, trail coordinator for the Forest Service. “It is wonderful that the association and the Forest Service have been able to support activities for the Warrior Hike.” The Warrior Hike provides participating combat veterans with the equipment and supplies to complete a thru-hike of the trail; coordinates support in the form of transportation, food, and lodging with veteran organizations and community groups located along the trail; and assists veterans with future employment opportunities through the program's numerous partners and sponsors. The Walk off the War program was started in honor of Earl Shaffer who, in , told a friend he was going to “walk off the war” to work out the sights, sounds and losses of World War II. Four months later, Shaffer became the first person to hike the entire length of the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine.

"U.S. Forest Service, Fire Aviation and Management Program in  Forestry  Jun 07,  U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke sign a memorandum to wildland fire leadership in Boise, Idaho, on June 2, . USDA Photo by Lance Cheung. Boise, Idaho is famous among college football fans for the blue turf on the Boise State University Broncos’ field. But in wildland fire management circles, the city is just as well-known as home of the National Interagency Fire Center or NIFC. NIFC is the nation’s support center for wildland fire management and other types of incidents. Some even refer to it as the Pentagon or nerve center for national wildland fire management. Earlier this month, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue visited NIFC with Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, Idaho Governor C.L. “Butch” Otter, and other officials. While there, they received a tour and briefing on the upcoming wildfire season and signed a memorandum (, 64.7 ) that was sent to wildland fire leadership highlighting the importance of inter-departmental collaboration in protecting communities and managing public lands. Collaboration is the name of the game at NIFC, which isn’t an organization, but is rather a place where the U.S. Forest Service and eight other federal, tribal, state, and local agencies work together to coordinate national wildland fire management planning and operations to ensure effectiveness and efficiency. The agencies represented at NIFC share assets (firefighters, aircraft and equipment) and work together to set priorities to allocate these assets. Effectiveness and efficiency are especially critical because no wildland fire management agency has enough assets including firefighters, fire engines, aircraft, or other equipment and machinery to respond to all the wildfires that occur on land under their jurisdiction. Additionally, the National Interagency Coordination Center or NICC based at NIFC, plays a key role in ensuring that wildland fire managers receive as many of the assets mentioned above that they request as possible. For strategic purposes, wildland fire managers divided the U.S. into ten geographic areas. All of the agencies located within these geographic areas have assets that they can mobilize to respond to wildfires, but during periods of high fire activity, they typically require more. The geographic areas place orders for additional assets to the NICC which obtains them from other geographic areas, the military, and even from other countries. “We mobilize and allocate assets based on the principles of closest forces and total mobility,” said Susie Stingley, NICC Manager. “That means that we try to mobilize assets from as close to where they are being requested as possible, but if needed we can get them from anywhere they’re available.” Staff stock the Great Basin Area Incident Support Cache in preparation for western fire season. Forest Service photo. In addition to the NICC, NIFC is home to many other vital national wildland fire management programs, facilities, and functions, including the National Interagency Incident Communications Division, the largest civilian radio cache in the world that can provide enough radios and repeaters (a device that extends radio coverage) to support more than 50 major disasters at a time; the Great Basin Area Incident Support Cache, which issues about $ations Program, which maintains about 1,800 permanent and 75 portable weather stations that provide critical local weather to fire managers. NIFC is the envy of wildland fire and emergency management experts around the world because of its seamless interagency cooperation. Each year, wildland fire and emergency management experts from countries such as Greece, Norway, and Morocco, visit NIFC to learn how it operates to improve their operations. But the highly successful structure of NIFC was not mandated by law, regulation, or policy. What motivates government agencies to work together to ensure that wildfires in the U.S. are managed as effectively and efficiently as possible is simply that this type of cooperation has been proved, time and again, to be a best practice that delivers the benefits of good government and works for all Americans. The National Interagency Fire Center is also home to the Boise Bureau of Land Management Smokejumpers. Forest Service photo.

"U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Oct 30,  Wolf spiders are robust and agile hunters with excellent eyesight. They live mostly solitary and hunt alone. (Bugwood.org/Joseph Berger) They squirm, crawl, scurry and swarm … and they’re all around us. More than 900,000 species of insects and arachnids are found around the world, and some people would rather not come into contact with even one of the often misunderstood critters. The fear for me came when I was 7 years old during the summer of . Mom worked the third-shift, so one night dad decided a night at the drive-in theater with his six kids would be the better than us destroying the house. The movie? Jeff Daniels and John Goodman in “Arachnophobia.” The premise of the now classic comedy-horror movie is simple: poisonous spiders wreak havoc on a small town leaving a trail of dead townsfolk in their wake. The movie did not win any Academy Awards … but it should have: Best Comedy-Horror Movie for Instilling Irrational Fear of Arachnids in Second-graders. I still haven’t forgiven dad. So with the scary Halloween season upon us, I decided to talk to one of the U.S. Forest Service’s entomologists to get a better idea how these creepy crawlers benefit our environment and why I shouldn’t scream like a 5–year old when an eight-legged web-slinger crosses my path. Stone centipedes are about 2 to 5 centimeters (0.8–2.0 in.) long and brownish in color. The adult's body has 18 segments, and 15 pairs of legs. (Bugwood.org/Joseph Berger) “Insects play a very important role in our forests,” said Robert J. Rabaglia, acting deputy director, Forest Health Protection. “Many are important sources of food for other animals and are important in the food web. In our streams, ponds and lakes, aquatic insects are important food for fish and eat vegetation that would otherwise grow uncontrolled. Insects that feed on trees also are important to the health of the forest. Not only do they serve as food for birds, reptiles and mammals but are important recyclers of nutrients in the forests.” But this newfound knowledge doesn’t change the fact that they’re still creepy. Which ones really make the skin crawl? “Creepy may be in the eye of the beholder, but many people are creeped out by roaches, spiders, centipedes and scorpions,” Rabaglia said. “Stink bugs are quickly becoming a creepy insect.” Fear by humans is the least of the problems. As good as insects are some can be devastating to forest when they run amok. “Some of the insects we consider most damaging, such as defoliators like budworms and gypsy moth or bark beetles, are important parts of a healthy forest,” said Rabaglia. “It’s only when populations of these insects are at damaging levels that we need to control them.” This is where spiders become an essential part of many eco-systems because they are a predator of insects and help keep populations regulated. It is true, though, that some bugs are more dangerous than they look. A parasitoid wasp sits on a piece of wood. Many of these wasps are considered beneficial to humans because they control populations of agricultural pests. (Bugwood.org/Sturgis McKeever, Georgia Southern University) “The most notorious poisonous insects are wasps, bees and ants, but other groups also have poisonous species,” said Rabaglia. “There are some caterpillars that have poisonous spines and some true bugs, such as the assassin bug, that have venomous bites.” While most people like me don’t like bugs, not as many have true phobias such as arachnophobia, a fear of arachnids, and entomophobia, a fear of insects. So after speaking to one entomologist, I still wasn’t convinced that their benefits outweighed their creepiness. I went for a second opinion. “It is unfair to ask an entomologist if insects are creepy, but I guess there are some insects out there that cause some to squirm,” said Michael Bohne, forest group health leader.  “Carrion, or burying beetles, feed on dead birds and animals. They lay eggs under carcasses, which hatch into wormy larvae that feed on the dead animals. Forensic specialists also use these beetles to help establish the time of death when a human corpse is found outside.” None of this made me feel any better. But Bohne pointed out more reasons insects and arachnids are crucial to our forests. “Even vampire-like mosquitoes serve an important role in our environment,” Bohne said. “Mosquito larvae are a food source for many aquatic organisms.” Then the entomologist, who seemed to be having a little too much fun with this interview, even likened a Forest Service initiative to control the devastating ash borer beetle to another horror movie classic. “Recently, forest entomologists from around the country have been using a native parasitoid wasp to monitor for the exotic emerald ash borer, a system called biosurveillance,” Bohne said. “The wasp works a lot like the xenomorph from the movie “Alien.” The female wasp stuns, collects, and buries the emerald ash borers in underground egg chambers. The wasp larvae emerge from the eggs and eat the stunned beetles alive and complete development. I don’t think the beetles scream, but in the ground nobody can hear them scream.” All joking aside, Bohne added that “insects are important bio-indicators of strong, healthy forests. A healthy forest will have a large, diverse population of insects.” Writing this has not cured my irrational fear of spiders. But the next time I get hit in the face with a web while walking, I’ll try not to smack at my face like it is on fire. Instead, I’ll thank little Charlotte for all she does for our forests.

"Foreign Agricultural Service Public Affairs Specialist in  Trade  May 16,   The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) recently launched an online system that modernizes the way the agency informs the U.S. agricultural industry regarding changes in international food and agriculture regulations that could affect U.S. exports. The World Trade Organization (WTO) requires member countries to submit notifications regarding proposed changes to their food regulations, enabling other countries to review and comment on the proposals. The new FAS management system will help U.S. exporters and other stakeholders to more effectively monitor, evaluate and comment on the measures, keep track of comment deadlines and locate archived information. “The development of this system provides users with one-stop shopping,” said Michael Francom, the FAS International Regulations and Standards Division deputy director. “Using the system, industry members can access the WTO notification and the underlying measure and submit feedback for us to consider as we draft our official U.S. government comments. They can also query the system for measures from different countries or those dealing with a specific commodity.” Previously, stakeholders were unable to access this information in one place. Often times, some industry members were unaware of the measures U.S. trading partners proposed because of the challenges of tracking down the different pieces of information, Francom explained. After a successful public pilot program in early , FAS officials debuted the system during the U.S. Agricultural Export Development Council (USAEDC) workshop in November and at meetings of USDA’s trade advisory committees. “So far feedback has been very positive. U.S. exporters and other stakeholders believe the system will be an important tool in their trade policy tool kit,” Francom said. Currently, more than 40 organizations are signed up for to use the system. They include trade associations, industry groups and private companies.

"Office of Communications in  Conservation  Aug 10,  This info graphic demonstrate how the current drought, or any event that affects prices for raw farm commodities, ultimately has a marginal effect on what we pay at the grocery or restaurant. The info graphic is based on from the USDA Economic Research Service's analysis of retail food prices and the food dollar, or all the factors that affect what we pay for food. (Click to enlarge) In relation to the current drought, many people ask: What does this mean for food prices? Here we try to provide a response and the necessary context on food price inflation. The info graphic is based on from the USDA Economic Research Service's analysis of retail food prices and the food dollar, or all the factors that affect what we pay for food. The graphic helps to demonstrate how the current drought, or any event that affects prices for raw farm commodities, ultimately has a marginal effect on what we pay at the grocery or restaurant. Primarily, the graphic demonstrates two important pieces of information: 1. In the bar chart, food price inflation is expected to be close to the historical average this year and just slightly above that next year. As you can see, recent spikes from and , especially, outpace current forecasts. 2. In the grocery cart model, you see that raw farm commodity prices (the price of things like a bushel of corn or soybeans) are just one of many factors affecting retail food prices. In fact, commodities make up about 14% of the average retail food purchase, so even if all commodity prices doubled, retail food prices would increase by about 14%. Together, factors such as energy and transportation costs, labor costs, processing and marketing costs all play a much more significant role. On July 25th, ERS forecast that we will likely see impacts on retail food prices within two months for beef, pork, poultry and dairy. Yet the full effects of the increase in corn prices for packaged and processed foods (cereal, corn flour, etc.) will likely take 10-12 months to move through to retail food prices, and should have little to no effect until that time.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Feb 25,  Hezekiah and Francis Gibson’s non-profit organization, United Farmers USA works with NRCS staff to help other small farmers succeed through a wide range of outreach and technical assistance, educational programs and resources. Lifelong farmer Hezekiah Gibson, and his wife Frances, farm 1,200 acres in Manning, South Carolina. They have been working with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) for years to improve conservation on their farm. In , the couple’s non-profit organization, United Farmers USA―dedicated to helping small farmers succeed through a wide range of outreach and technical assistance, educational programs and resources―received an NRCS Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG). These grants help NRCS support public and private entities to accelerate technology transfer and adoption of promising technologies and approaches to address some of the Nation's most pressing natural resource concerns. Through their CIG project, the Gibsons have implemented a silvopasture demonstration area on their farm, and have educated other farmers on the benefits. Silvopasture―the practice of combining forestry and the grazing of livestock―benefits timber, forage, and livestock production by allowing both practices on the same acreage, at the same time. It not only improves the appearance of the landowner’s property, it helps the livestock and environment too. During the summer months, tree canopies provide shelter to livestock from heat and inclement weather. The Gibsons say silvopasture helps their livestock maintain body weight in the hotter months by continuing to graze during the day in the shade, as opposed to grazing only at night in open pasture when it’s cooler. “Silvopasture is a win-win situation, as you can have value added attributes, such as baling and selling hay, or cutting trees for timber,” said Hezekiah. Silvopasture is not new to the Gibsons. They have been using this conservation practice for years and have 120 acres in silvopasture. When managed properly silvopasture can help farming operations become more sustainable by increasing annual revenues and providing better use of forest lands. They have also implemented several conservation practices on their farm, including fencing and cross-fencing 300 acres of pasture, which allows them to practice rotational grazing for their livestock. By using rotational grazing―moving cows to different pastures before it can be overgrazed―herd health is increased, soil erosion is reduced, and soil and forage health is greatly improved. Through CIG funding, the Gibsons have hosted many two-hour classes, educational workshops, and demonstration tours for historically underserved landowners. Additional demonstration sites will be established in the Low country, Savannah, Pee Dee, and Coastal Plain areas to reach more farmers in USDA StrikeForce areas. USDA StrikeForce teams operate in 880 counties in 21 states and Puerto Rico and provide opportunities for NRCS to work with underserved landowners to determine how best to leverage available financial assistance and address natural resource concerns—with an emphasis on historically underserved communities in rural counties that have consistently high poverty.

"Risk Management Tools Help Farmers Create a More Environmentally Sustainable Future  American producers know that crop insurance is a proven tool for managing the risks of farming.  But many folks may not be aware that it also promotes sound practices that encourage environmental sustainability. One of the primary reasons the Federal crop insurance program is good for conservation is that it requires producers to exercise good farming practices in order to be eligible for coverage.  Good farming practices vary from crop to crop and from region to region, but follow the principle that the farming practices carried out are considered prudent and responsible by local extension agents and certified crop consultants. And this means planning for the long-term future, not just the current crop year.  Brandon C.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Aug 25,  Nuña beans. USDA-ARS photo. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Indigenous people of the Andes Mountains in South America have farmed the nuña bean (a.k.a. “Peruvian Popping bean”) as a staple crop for centuries. Its colorful, nutty-flavored seed is especially prized for its tendency to pop open when roasted—a cooking method that requires less firewood than boiling in fuel-scarce regions. At the Agricultural Research Service’s Western Regional Plant Introduction Station in Pullman, Washington, plant geneticist Ted Kisha curates an edible dry bean collection that includes 91 accessions of high-altitude nuña beans grown by Andean farmers in Peru, the origin for this legume member of the Phaseolus vulgaris family. Over the past year, Kisha and his collaborators at Washington State University (WSU) have been evaluating the accessions with an eye towards using them to breed new varieties adapted to production in Washington state.   Kisha thinks the humble nuña has “the right stuff” as a niche crop for small-scale growers and a healthy snack food for consumers—namely, high protein content, dietary fiber, minerals, vitamins, and assorted phytonutrients.    Long term, “Our goal is to create the ‘Power Popper’—a popping bean jam-packed with nutrition as a snack food for kids and adults,” says Kisha. Toward that end, he and colleagues are working to eliminate a nuña bean trait called “photoperiod sensitivity,” which would prevent potential varieties from flowering and producing seed in temperate regions like the Pacific Northwest. They’ve also begun selecting plants that grow more upright and less vine-like for easier harvest. Last summer under Kisha’s guidance, Karolina Kodin—a student from the University of Idaho’s Research Experience for Undergraduates program—conducted a 10-week analysis of the accessions’ nutrient content and genetic characteristics compared to those of eight common bean varieties. Her work sets the stage for developing molecular markers to rapidly identify genes associated with particular traits of interest, such as high protein and popping ability. Kodin presented results of her comparisons at the American Society for Horticultural Science’s annual meeting held in New Orleans, Louisiana earlier this month. The work is timely, given the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization has dubbed as the “International Year of the Pulse.” Varieties, molecular markers, and other knowledge resulting from continued research will be made readily available to plant breeders and researchers worldwide, benefiting not only consumers of nuña beans, but other edible dry bean species as well.

"USDA Public Affairs Specialist in  Conservation  Jun 17,  Until now, only a single Harbison's hawthorn (Crataegus harbisonii) tree was thought to exist in the wild, growing in the limestone soils of Percy Warner Park in Nashville, Tennessee. “It was the most robust hawthorn I’ve ever seen! The thorns alone demanded attention,” said ecologist Barry Hart with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service. He made the discovery on a routine ecological site survey in Obion County, Tennessee. Verifying the Discovery After finding two hearty plants one mile apart on private lands, Hart began “keying-out” the plant. This “key” is a series of questions or statements capturing an organism's specific characteristics. “There was no way it could be anything else. I was blown away!” said Hart. Multiple runs through the key repeatedly landed on the same species that had not been seen in West Tennessee since : Crataegus harbisonii. Snippets sent to universities and botanical authorities confirmed this was a newly discovered population. The population discovered by Hart is now recorded as the largest known. Conservation Efforts Limited research exists on this tree species. Even today, the species mainly exists in cultivation. The tree is on the State of Tennessee’s endangered species list but does not have federal protections under the Endangered Species Act. Hart is working with NRCS staff in Tennessee and several conservation groups to propagate and establish new populations on protected lands. “All native species warrant our attention,” Hart said. About the Harbison's Hawthorn The Harbison’s hawthorn is a small tree or shrub that grows to 25 feet. It typically flowers in mid-April and produces clusters of reddish fruit in early fall. Their flowers look similar to the apple blossom. Opinions vary on the number of hawthorn species, but a reasonable estimate for North America is between 100 to 200 species.

"PhD, RDN, Director of Nutrition Security and Health Equity, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Equity  Mar 27,  USDA is proud to celebrate the second anniversary of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack’s vision to advance food and nutrition security. This first-of-its-kind, whole-of-department approach uses a four-pillar approach, working across USDA’s eight mission areas. These pillars include:  Providing nutrition support from pregnancy to birth and beyond;  Connecting everyone in this country with healthy, safe, affordable foods  Developing, translating, and enacting nutrition science through partnership; and  Prioritizing equity every step of the way. Leveraging the momentum of the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, we are also doing our part to implement the National Strategy (, 201 ) on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. This whole-of-society strategy was designed to end hunger, improve nutrition and physical activity, and reduce diet-related diseases and disparities. And the Biden-Harris Administration remains focused on the Strategy. At a recent White House event, partners pledged nearly $1.7 billion in new commitments cultivated through the White House Challenge to End Hunger and Build Healthy Communities. Our efforts to advance food and nutrition security also integrates the Secretary’s goal to make MyPlate a household name. As I explain in this video, MyPlate has been our national symbol for healthy eating for more than a decade. MyPlate.gov provides the guidance, tools, and resources that translate the - Dietary into actionable steps anyone can use. We are making our MyPlate materials more culturally, contextually, and linguistically responsive. And we work with more than rategic Partners across a variety of sectors to use common messages to communicate to consumers that it’s never too early or too late to start eating healthy. We even launched a MyPlate Instagram, which is loaded with healthy eating tips and recipes. Agriculture Secretary Vilsack Celebrates Progress on Tackling Food and Nutrition Insecurity As we celebrate the power of nutritious food, we are proud of all we’ve accomplished over the last two years, but we know we can do more and do better, together. Please explore our innovative tools and stay connected. We look forward to working together to help everyone in this country access nutrition education through MyPlate.

"Public Affairs Specialist, APHIS in  Animals  Jul 02,  Nutria look a lot like beaver, which are native to the United States. However, nutria have protruding orange teeth as well as thin tails and are smaller than beaver. Word has it that legendary actress Greta Garbo could be seen wearing nutria fur coats back in the day, and nutria fur coats can still be found in vintage clothing stores around the world. Nutria, sometimes called swamp rats, were first introduced into the United States in the s to be used in the fur trade. However, when the fur trade collapsed in the mid ’s thousands of nutria were released by ranchers who could no longer afford to feed and care for them. This invasive rodent, about half the size of a beaver, damages wetland ecosystems by eating away at their delicate vegetation. Nutria have since been found in at least 20 states. Maryland’s eastern shore has seen thousands of acres of protective marshland impacted by their destructive feeding habits. To protect the valuable resources of Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay, The Chesapeake Bay Nutria Eradication Project (CBNEP) began in to permanently remove invasive nutria from the marshes of the Delmarva Peninsula and to protect, enhance, and restore the aquatic and river ecosystems they damaged. The Chesapeake Bay Nutria Eradication Project Team members as of May . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services’ (USFWS) Chesapeake Bay Field Office Coastal Program and Chesapeake Marshlands National Wildlife Refuge Complex administer the project, which is funded through the USFWS’ Partners for Fish and Wildlife and Refuge programs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Wildlife Services program performs the nutria eradication work through an interagency agreement with the USFWS. Other partners in the project include the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, Delaware Division of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, and Tudor Farms. CBNEP’s work has led to the removal of nearly 14,000 nutria, almost half from private lands. With the voluntary cooperation of both public and private landowners, the CBNEP employs multiple techniques as they work through the stages of eradication: conducting surveys to understand the extent of the population; removing the invasive rodents; verifying that that the nutria are gone; and finally, conducting long-term monitoring to prevent re-infestation. Eradication tools include ground surveys, shoreline or boat surveys, trail cameras, monitoring platforms, hair snares, and from the public. Wildlife Services also looks to innovative and new ways to search for this rodent – trained detector dogs sniff out nutria scat or excrement. Since the start of this innovative program, 6 nutria dogs have been trained – the most recent one, Bradie, completed training with her instructor, Wildlife Biologist Trevor Michaels, in May. Nutria haven’t been detected in the Delmarva Peninsula in 3 years and the program is now in the verification phase. This phase is critical as most eradication efforts fail when they end before the task is fully complete. Long term monitoring should begin by . While this is good news for Delmarva, other parts of the country have recently discovered nutria thought long eradicated. Nutria have been discovered in the wetlands, rivers, canals and other fresh water habitats in six counties in California. Wildlife Services is working closely with the state’s lead agency, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, to respond to this emerging issue with best practices learned from our experience on Maryland’s Eastern shore. This nutria is one of the nutria kept with the Chesapeake Bay Nutria Eradication Project. The scat collected from the captive nutria is used to train the nutria dogs to find any wild nutria that may be present.

"Special Assistant, Natural Resources and Environment in  Energy  Forestry  Rural  Sep 13,  U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Bioenergy Memorandum of Understanding is signed by wood energy partners (left - right) Biomass Thermal Energy Council, Executive Director Joseph Seymour; Alliance for Green Heat, President John Ackerly; USDA Deputy Agriculture Secretary Krysta Harden; Pellet Fuels Institute Executive, Director Jennifer Hedrick; Biomass Power Association, President and CEO Bob Cleaves, at the USDA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. on September 11, . USDA Photo by Lance Cheung. Earlier this week, USDA, U.S. Forest Service and partners took a major step to improve forest management, create rural jobs, prevent wildfires, and expand promising renewable energy opportunities. Deputy Secretary Krysta Harden joined leaders from the Alliance for Green Heat, the Biomass Power Association, the Biomass Thermal Energy Council, and the Pellet Fuels Institute here in Washington for the announcement of a new partnership agreement. Acting as master of ceremonies for the signing event was Acting USDA Rural Development Under Secretary Doug O’Brien.  Through the Rural Energy for America program and other programs, Rural Development has been a leader in promoting deployment of wood-to-energy projects. This agreement focuses on promoting wood energy nationwide to reduce fire risk, bolster rural economic development, improve air quality and help meet the Obama Administration's “All of the Above” renewable energy and energy efficiency goals. The organizations support the use of wood energy across the scale of users – from residential users, to commercial and institutional facilities, to industrial production of heat and/or electricity to drive businesses and feed the electrical grid. For more than a decade, USDA has supported wood energy as part of a forest restoration economy. Since USDA has invested over $956 million (nearly $1 billion) through grants, loans, and loan guarantees to support over 200 wood energy projects across the country. Led by the Forest Service, this work helps to restore the health of forests and watersheds, provide rural areas with cost-effective energy alternatives, and create new income and employment opportunities in sectors ranging from engineering and construction, to manufacturing and forestry. It also provides an economical alternative to fuel oil heating in areas where natural gas supplies are limited. USDA’s Rural Development mission area and the Farm Services Agency also support wood energy through a variety of grants, loans, and loan guarantees. All told, USDA agencies contributed over $500 million last year to support wood energy. The Deputy Secretary also announced the award of over $1 million dollars in grants to develop wood energy teams with Alaska, California, Idaho, Minnesota and New Hampshire. These cooperative agreements signal that successful wood energy projects and forest restoration efforts demand partnership at all levels as well as the sustained commitment of many and diverse forest users.  The federal funds will leverage $1.8 million in non-federal investments. Grant recipients are: Idaho Governor's Office of Energy Resources, Boise The Watershed Research & Training Center, Hayfork, Calif. Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Saint Paul North Country Resource Conservation & Development Council, Gilford, N.H. The Alaska Energy Authority, Anchorage For more information on the cooperative agreement program, visit For more information on USDA’s renewable energy programs click here.

"Posted by Clifford Sánchez, NRCS New Mexico in  Conservation  Jan 19,  Assessing the Track Fire aftermath: NRCS New Mexico employee Brian Schwebke (far right), a member of the NRCS Damage Survey Report Team, and officials of the City of Raton, view a sediment pond.  Disaster struck northern New Mexico on June 12, , as the human-caused “Track Fire” exploded north of Raton, in Colfax County. Within 72 hours, 27,790 acres were scorched in New Mexico and Colorado. Luckily, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) was able to begin the restoration of the Lake Maloya watershed area almost immediately through its Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program. The Track Fire severely damaged nearby Lake Maloya, burning nearly 75 percent of the watershed at what firefighters call “high” and “moderate intensity levels.” This watershed is part of Sugarite Canyon State Park and provides habitat for many species of wildlife. It also serves as Raton’s primary water supply. The fire incinerated almost all of the vegetation surrounding Lake Maloya, leaving a thick layer of ash that easily washed downhill when it rained, clouding the waters of the lake. Raton’s water processing plant struggled to sufficiently filter drinking water. Raton and Colfax County immediately contacted NRCS for assistance, and an EWP team formed to assess the damage and prescribe treatments. NRCS implemented plans to restore the land in July. Through EWP, NRCS applies conservation practices that provide protection against further damages after natural disasters occur on private, tribal and state lands. To protect the water quality of Lake Maloya—and preserve Raton’s water supply—NRCS implemented erosion control measures, such as the building of several small dams, the erection of catchment fences, grass seeding and mulching. Post-Track Fire seeding takes hold: aerial seeding of one of the slopes scarred by the Track Fire proves successful as vegetation sprouts days after the aerial seeding. NRCS also strategically felled trees, which were laid perpendicular to the hill slope. Those areas were then seeded with quick-growing vegetation to slow down water flowing to low-lying areas, allowing the water to drain into the ground. In addition, Lake Dorothey, a smaller lake upstream of Lake Maloya, was drained into Lake Maloya and converted into a sediment basin. The City of Raton and Colfax County provided 25 percent of the cost of the land restoration efforts, with NRCS providing the rest. It will take years to restore the land to its pre-Track Fire state. But NRCS’ restoration efforts will accelerate the recovery process of the watersheds, wildlife habitat and recreational sites.  Find out more about the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program.

"Pollinators-An Indicator of a Healthy Mother Earth  Often I am asked to participate in events in my role as a Deputy Undersecretary.  Other times I participate based on my heritage, as a member of the Mescalero Apache Tribe.  Sometimes, the lines blur, as they did recently when I addressed those attending the North American Pollinator Protection Campaign meeting here at USDA. Pollinator health is tied closely to the overall health of ecosystems. Pollinators are important to producers of a wide variety of crops, and to forest health.  Native Americans grasp how all things are interconnected. I told the audience that when I was a boy, my relatives would sing songs in Apache.  These songs were about things in nature: evergreens, water, even the rocks.  All things are tied to Mother Earth: all things work together.

"in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Jul 06,   Understanding a community’s food environment is key to understanding a community’s identity.  But what can a “food environment” tell us? A community’s food environment is a technical term for assessing information about the who, what, where, and how of food availability in a given community: Who are the people in the community? What kinds of food outlets are available in their area? How accessible are grocery stores and supermarkets? What are some of the health statistics? These are a lot of questions to ask, and a lot of information to process. That’s where the USDA’s Food Environment Atlas comes in.  In , USDA first released the Food Environment Atlas, an online mapping tool that compares the food environment at the county level across the country. There were 90 indicators to choose from in the version, including the number and types of food stores and restaurants, price for food, and information about participation rates for nutrition benefits like SNAP.  These sets could be sorted and mapped to get a more comprehensive understanding of a county’s food environment. Users could pull the Atlas and build their own custom food environment maps, or compare the food environments across different counties. Like communities, food environments are ever evolving.  That’s why we have updated the Atlas annually. Today, I’m delighted to announce that the version of the Food Environment Atlas is now available and offers even more insight into sources of food in communities.  There are now 168 searchable factors, including new on numbers of vegetable farms, fruit orchards, and greenhouses growing vegetables or herbs.  You can also see how many farmers markets are in each county (including the number per 1,000 residents), which counties have food hubs, how many farms are participating in agri-tourism and how many farmers sell their products directly to consumers.  Merge this with about the availability of food stores and restaurants, food prices and taxes, use of food assistance programs, and other socioeconomic and demographic statistics, and suddenly you have a deeper understanding of how Americans experience food environments county by county in map form. Since , there were over 125,000 visitors to the Food Environment Atlas. What will you discover about the food environment in your county?

"Meet Your Wellness Goals in the New Year with the USDA DRI Calculator for Healthcare Professionals App  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. The USDA National Agricultural Library’s (NAL) Food and Nutrition Information Center (FNIC) today launched its mobile application, or “app,” which calculates Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).  The “USDA Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) Calculator for Healthcare Professionals” app allows users to keep track of nutrient calculations and recommendations that are based on the DRI values in a more convenient and user-friendly format. Through this new app, healthcare professionals can save time in the nutrition care process for patients and clients, while having access to credible nutrition guidance. The National Academy of Science’s Institute of Medicine first developed the DRIs in the mid-s. DRIs are recommended amounts of each nutrient a healthy person should consume to prevent deficiency or harmful health effects. Initially presented in tables, this information allows healthcare professionals to use the DRIs to assess and plan diets for groups or individuals. For example, if you are a female between 19 and 50, your registered dietitian or doctor may recommend that you increase your dairy consumption to meet the 1,000mg/day calcium recommendation outlined in the DRIs. The DRIs are also used in policy-making such as setting calorie and sodium for healthy school lunches.

"Sumter National Forest in  Forestry  Jun 18,   High above the ground in a bucket truck, Blue Ridge Electric Co-op Lineman David Brown attaches a power line to a newly erected pole above the green fields of the Sumter National Forest’s Long Creek dove field. But instead of providing electric service to an outbuilding or an adjacent housing development, Brown’s hard work is aimed at improving the forest’s dove field. Blue Ridge Electric Co-op is partnering with the forest to install “dummy” power lines at the dove field to make the area more attractive to doves, creating conditions for hunters to be more successful at bagging their game. “The installation of these lines will provide perching areas in close proximity to food sources for the birds,” said Chris Holcomb, U.S. Forest Service wildlife technician. Holcomb explained that the Long Creek dove field, located on the Andrew Pickens Ranger District in Oconee County South Carolina, is open only to youth and mobility-impaired hunters.  Thus, the new power lines help make the doves more visible to young hunters who are just getting involved in the sport and to men and women who may have limited mobility in the field. Blue Ridge Electric Co-op employees spend the morning placing “dummy” power lines at a dove field on the Sumter National Forest, Friday, April 13, . The field is used exclusively by youth and mobility-impaired hunters. (Forest Service photo) The time and talents of many partners help the forest to successfully manage natural resources and improve recreational opportunities. Blue Ridge Electric Co-op, which has a long history of community service and environmental stewardship, was eager to help in this endeavor. “We’re committed to serving our community and helping wildlife,” said Rex Ramsay, vegetation management supervisor for Blue Ridge Electric Co-op. “Many of our employees are hunters and fishermen and love the outdoors, so they’re eager to do what they can to help.” Long Creek dove field is one of several sites on the Sumter National Forest managed to provide habitat for game and non-game wildlife species and to provide recreational opportunities to hunters, birdwatchers and others. The management of dove fields, waterfowl areas, wildlife openings and linear strips is an important part of the Sumter National Forest’s wildlife management program.

"USDA Colorado Public Information Officer in  Energy  Rural  May 05,   Attendees at the recent “Building a Sustainable Renewable Energy Program for the 21st Century” conference in Denver, Colorado, participated in discussions about how renewable energy opportunities could create new jobs and reduce America’s dependence on foreign oil. Among those in attendance was USDA Rural Development Business Programs Administrator Judy Canales. The event began with a luncheon presentation from Greg Krissek, ICM, Director of Government Affairs and Jim Imbler, ZeaChem, Chief Executive Officer.  Krissek’s presentation to the group focused on the ethanol and biofuels industry.  Krissek has been in the business for 11 years and currently oversees 102 plants with 6.5 billion gallons of ethanol production per year.    He noted that America needs to take what we have learned from first generation biofuels and build on it through adding cellulosic changes to the process.  Imbler focused his discussion on new technology in biorefinery development and in particular a cellulose-based biorefinery platform that could be capable of producing advanced ethanol, fuels and chemicals.  The company is headquartered in Lakewood, Colorado.  They currently operate a research and development laboratory facility in Menlo Park, California and have a 250,000 gallon per year cellulosic biorefinery under construction in Boardman, Oregon. After the conference, Administrator Canales met with Bruce Bredickas, Executive Vice President and Robyn Kullas, Project Manager, from NexGen Energy Partners, LLP.  NexGen Energy is an owner and operator of distributed renewable energy systems sited at customers’ facilities. The company works with governments, schools, businesses and utilities across the nation to deliver its customers the benefits of clean energy without the capital investment and technical risk. Canales joined Colorado Rural Development State Director Jim Isgar at the Eldorado Springs Bottling Company in Louisville, CO to tour the facility and discuss a previous awarding of a Rural Energy for America Loan and Grant in Fiscal Year to Eldorado Springs, LLC.  The entity utilized the funding to install solar panels on the roof of the bottling facility.  The 100 kilowatt project was installed by Namaste Solar and will produce 132,000 kilowatt hours per year.  The energy savings from this project is the equivalent to planting over 10,000 trees or driving approximately 300,000 miles in an average passenger car.  The project is increasing economic activity for the community and providing long term professional jobs.

Myron’s life was saved by rural volunteer first responders after an accident nearly killed him in early November . Photo by Michael Stepien, U.S. Department of Agriculture North Dakota is a remarkable agricultural state and very rural. Farms and ranches dominate hundreds of miles of roads, and distances between services can be great. With so much wide-open space, our first responders and medical facilities play critical roles in ensuring the health and safety of our agricultural producers. Recently, their expertise and professionalism saved the life of a coworker and good friend. On National Rural Health Day, it’s important we take the time to recognize the people in our lives working diligently to care for our family and friends. Their dedication to healthcare has a profound impact on all of us, and we are fortunate to have such amazing people living and working in our rural communities. As the state director for USDA Rural Development, two of my main responsibilities are ensuring the safety of our agency’s employees, and working with our rural communities to provide access to funding to help improve the quality of life in rural North Dakota. Rural Development has several programs, and one of the largest is our Community Facilities Direct Loans and Grants program. We can help communities build and improve critical infrastructure, such as hospitals and fire departments. We can also assist with purchasing vehicles for first responders to ensure they are adequately prepared to respond to emergencies even in the harshest conditions. Earlier this month, one of our employees, Myron Lepp, Associate Director, was helping a family member in a rural area close out the long farming season. While attempting to cover a grain cart, a gust of wind caught the tarp and knocked Myron off the cart into the tractor’s three-point hitch. The fall broke his tailbone, and a broken bone was pushed into an artery. He was unaware at the time, but the punctured artery was causing internal bleeding. Knowing he needed someone to take him to the emergency room, Myron drove seven miles to his nephew’s house, where he eventually collapsed from the loss of blood. His 24-year-old son Jason, a farmer for five years, was at the house and dialed 911. After the ambulance arrived and assessed his injuries, they determined he needed to be driven 120 miles to the Bismarck hospital. Throughout the drive, the first responders communicated with the hospital to provide details of the injury. When they arrived at the hospital, seven doctors were prepared to begin working on his life-threatening injury. The emergency room repaired the artery and replaced four pints of blood, saving his life. I would like to thank all the first responders in North Dakota and across America. Often, they are members of our communities that wear other hats. Their dedication goes unnoticed, and because of their skills, we take their hard work for granted. Rarely do we need them to respond to a fire at our home or a personal medical emergency, but they are out there daily taking care of our rural neighbors. Our farmers and ranchers provide food to the country and ensure that when rural America thrives, all America thrives. They depend on first responders to get them care when it is needed, and this experience confirmed they are dedicated and prepared to save lives in the most challenging circumstances. In North Dakota, we are fortunate to have a robust, extensive communications infrastructure. The ability to communicate played a critical role in saving Myron’s life, from the initial 911 call all the way to his arrival at the hospital. I am grateful to everyone involved in this emergency and thankful for the positive outcome. Unfortunately, we are witnessing a crisis developing in rural healthcare, which includes a shortage of emergency facilities. If Rural Development can assist your community with healthcare through our Community Facilities Direct Loans and Grants program, please do not hesitate to contact your local office. Our agency is committed to increasing opportunities in rural areas because together, America prospers, and Rural Development can be that catalyst to prosperity.

"MS, Senior Technical Information Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA in  Health and Safety  Dec 06,  Holiday table setting – Time management: Key to a food safe holiday. The holiday season is a prized time; it’s that festive season that seems to be here before you know it, and you wonder how you will find the time to do everything you need to do to celebrate properly with family and friends. The holidays are also when we share favorite, treasured foods with our loved ones. Whether you are making a favorite recipe for a party, holiday dinners, or mailing goodies to a lucky friend or family member, follow these food safety tips to make the most of your time when preparing your special holiday treats. Make space This is a good time to clean your refrigerator so that you have room for holiday foods. You’ll also want to clean and clear off your kitchen counter so that you have room to work. Cooking can be a messy business and you don’t want to splash or spill juices from raw meat or poultry, or mixtures that contain raw eggs on clean dishes, kitchen towels, your children’s homework or decorations. Make a plan Many holiday dishes and treats contain perishable foods such as meat, poultry, eggs and dairy products. If you are preparing a complicated food that takes some time to make (e.g., egg rolls, lumpia, pasteles, alcapurrias and ravioli), make sure that the perishable foods stay hot or cold until needed. It may be helpful to divide up the different stages of the recipe. For example, if you are making lumpia, you can prepare the filling one day, and keep it in the refrigerator until you roll and package the lumpia. If you are making a large batch of a favorite food (such as jams or jellies, pickled vegetables, sofrito) make sure you have all the ingredients and equipment you need before you get started so the food doesn’t sit at an unsafe temperature and allow bacteria to multiply. Pack it Up and Hand it Out for Gift Giving Once your goodies are prepared it’s time to pack them up for gift giving. Label with the name of the product, how it should be stored, and a ‘best by’ date if needed. (e.g., “Grandma’s Ravioli. Keep Frozen. Use by April ”). Not sure how long your item will last in the pantry, refrigerator or freezer? Download our FoodKeeper app to find out. Store your goodies in a safe place (a cool, dry place for baked goods, the refrigerator or freezer for perishable foods), until time to deliver or serve. If you are presenting perishable foods be sure to tell the lucky recipient that the item must be kept in the refrigerator or freezer. Avoid leaving perishable gifts on a doorstep or handing them out at a workplace if there is no refrigeration. Serve it Up If you are preparing your family favorite for a dinner or party you can make it up to 4 days in advance. If you are making a large quantity of food, store it in several small or shallow containers, which will cool down faster than a large container. When it is time to serve, rather than having a large amount of food sit out on the serving table, put out one portion and keep a batch warm in the oven or cold in the refrigerator until you need it. Taking it on the Road If you are delivering your special treat or traveling to an event, remember to keep it out of the “Danger Zone,” the temperature range between 40 and 140°F. Pack perishables in a cooler on ice to keep them safe while you travel. If you are mailing perishables, see Mail Order Food Safety for tips on mailing food. Consumers with questions about food safety can call the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline or chat live with a food safety specialist in English or Spanish at AskKaren.gov, available from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service in  Health and Safety  Dec 23,  The USDA National Agricultural Library’s Agricultural Law Information Partnership website is a resource to help people find information relating to agricultural law. (Illustration credit: Jody Shuart, ARS). Success in any part of agriculture today means being able to successfully navigate local, state and federal laws and regulations — from water rights to food safety regulations, from crop insurance to organic certification. To help people find such legal information, the National Agricultural Library (NAL) has recently developed the Agricultural Law Information Partnership website. This partnership is a collaboration between NAL, the National Agricultural Law Center at the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture (NALC), and the Center for Agriculture and Food Systems (CAFS) at the Vermont Law School. For each subject area, the Agricultural Law Information Partnership website provides an overview and a portal to a wide range of resources for farmers, producers, consumers, researchers and legal professionals. The initial topics include animal welfare, organic food, food production and sales regulations, new farmer, veterans farming, and water quality and quantity laws. More areas will be added as new material becomes available. While users cannot consider the information on the website to be legal advice, all content is reviewed before it is added by law librarian Kirstin Nelson, who coordinates the new program for NAL. The partnership not only gathers links to legal resources but also funds research projects that fill gaps in available information and the development of new tools. The first two of these are already completed and available online: the National Gleaning Project and the Farmland Tenure Resource Project, both initiatives of the Center for Agriculture and Food Systems. Information about the U.S. Farm Bill and other resources can be found on the USDA National Agricultural Library’s new Agricultural Law Information Partnership website. (Photo credit: Architect of the Capitol). The National Gleaning Project is a clearinghouse for food recovery-related information, connecting organizations with opportunities to collaborate at all levels, and a guide to national and state laws and regulations pertaining to gleaning and food donation. The Farmland Tenure Resource Project is an online legal resource aimed at helping farmers, landowners and farmer/landowner-advocates to understand and navigate the various legal issues related to transferring farmland in New England.

"Associate Administrator for USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and leader of USDA’s ASF efforts in  Animals  Dec 09,  USDA has a proven track record of protecting U.S. farmers from foreign animal and plant pests and diseases. When African Swine Fever (ASF) was detected in the Dominican Republic and Haiti this summer, we swung into action and immediately enhanced existing exclusion efforts due to the proximity of the detections to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Working closely with federal partners, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and industry, we are actively:  Enhancing ASF surveillance in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands;  Expanding an existing classical swine fever sampling program to include ASF;  Implementing an enhanced outreach program in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, to remind residents not to bring in foreign pork and pork products from ASF-affected countries;  Working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to increase inspections of Dominican Republic flights for prohibited products and ensure proper disposal of airplane garbage;  Continuing efforts to remove urban Puerto Rican feral swine To further protect U.S. swine production, we suspended the interstate movement of all live swine, swine germplasm, swine products, and swine byproducts from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to the U.S. mainland. We also established an OIE-recognized foreign animal disease protection zone (PZ) around Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to prevent disease entry and protect mainland producers and their markets. We are providing the Dominican Republic with important technical assistance, particularly laboratory expertise, as part of a surveillance program and working with them to determine next steps. Here at home we’ve reached out to domestic producers to remind them of the critical importance of biosecurity on US farm and are working with our partners in the Agricultural Research Service on promising vaccine research. Our experts are examining possible ASF-introduction pathways and identifying risk-reducing strategies. We will continue to take these and any other actions necessary to protect our valuable pork industry. We encourage travelers, producers and veterinarians to check out the ASF Information on our website.

"NRCS Texas in  Conservation  Dec 14,  Pat Maples works with Natural Resources Conservation Service District Conservationist Mitchell Schroeder to identify new vegetation. It was when Pat Maples and her husband made a ranch outside of San Saba, Tex. their home. With advice from a neighbor, the Maples’ purchased Angus cattle and leased out  land for hunting. But that was not enough to keep the ranch viable. “In we had to sell most of the cattle due to the drought, and I knew I had to do something because the back part of the ranch was not grazable,” Maples said. These 28 acres were covered in invasive brush that was too thick to penetrate. She had seen work completed on neighboring ranches and new that the land would benefit from some form of brush management, but Maples was unsure of her first land stewardship move and wanted to guarantee is was in the right direction. Luckily, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) was there to help. Together, the agency and Maples came up with a conservation plan to rid the unproductive land of invasive brush and transform it into rangeland. Maples could not be happier with the results. The steep slope is covered in green grass and also provides some of the best quail hunting around. Now, when the daylight hours do not lend themselves to hunting, the hunting lessee stacks the hand-cut brush at the back of the ranch, which is utilized as an area for wildlife habitat and grass germination. After working with the Natural Resources Conservation Service to rid part of her ranch of invasive brush, Pat Maples is now able to use the land for grazing her cattle. Maples is part of the Buffalo Knob Wildlife Association, which helps ranches of 250 acres or less by providing suggestions on how to manage lands for maximum benefit to wildlife, under the guidance of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. Maples has continued managing the ranch herself since her husband passed away in , and says she will continue to work with NRCS and work through the goals established in her conservation plan. “My conservation plan is a tool that lets me see where I need to go and how I can get there in reference to my place,” Maples said, “I have plans to install a trough and pipeline, and in the future, I will rely on the technical assistance of the NRCS to help me make those calls.” After working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to rid part of her ranch of invasive brush, Pat Maples is now able to use the land for grazing her cattle in San Saba, TX on Sept. 28, . With the luxuries of a bigger city being 45 miles away, there are days that Maples finds herself not leaving the ranch, and she is perfectly content with her rustic home setting. “I will be fine right where I am at, this is home, and I will take care of it,” Maples smiles.

"USDA Rural Development-South Dakota in  Initiatives  Rural  Aug 30,  Community leaders from the Town of Ipswich, South Dakota celebrate the construction of a new water tower.  USDA Rural Development joined Ipswich, South Dakota city officials, congressional staff, partners, and members of the community recently for a “raising of the ball” event.    There was excitement in the air as the National Anthem was sung by members of the Ipswich High School chorus, drum roll, and all eyes focused on the crane raising the “ball” to complete the 150,000 gallon elevated tower.    This was definitely a site to see as history was in the making in this small rural town – population 943.  The original system, including the tower and lines were constructed back in – 100 years ago. Thanks to the assistance provided through the American Recovery Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) Funding through a USDA Rural Development Water and Waste Direct Loan in the amount of $1,635,000 and a Grant of $1,593,000 to the City of Ipswich, improvements are being made to its water system.  Federal funds were leveraged with a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) of $500,000 and other state funding totaling $1,300,000.  The City of Ipswich purchases all of its water from WEB Water Development and the quality is excellent.  USDA Rural Development financing was necessary to assist with keeping the rates from becoming high for the residents.  The present water system has not had significant upgrades and this project will reduce line breakages and water losses where the old cast iron lines are still being used.  The new elevated water tank will greatly improve water pressure and fire flows throughout the town.  Water meters will be replaced and residents will soon be receiving a monthly bill verses the self-reading method currently being used.  “This project will allow Ipswich to have a water system which is second to none without adding high water rates for the city’s residents,” said David Penfield, Mayor of the City of Ipswich.  “The loans and grants make it possible for Ipswich to continuing improving its infrastructure.  We are a small community with all the benefits and amenities of a large community.  Our goal is to advance into the future in a progressive manner for the benefit of all residents.” A crane lifts the ball into place in Ipswich.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in  Plants  Mar 18,  President Joe Biden meets virtually with Ireland Prime Minister Micheál Martin on St. Patrick's Day. The spirit of The International Year of Plant Health (IYPH) was in full force this St. Patrick’s Day when President Joe Biden was presented with a shamrock bowl by the Irish Taoiseach (Irish for “chief or leader” – pronounced “tee-shuhk”), Micheál Martin, on March 17, at the White House. The shamrock bowl was delivered to the White House earlier in the week and presented to President Biden virtually. The tradition of this annual gift from the people of Ireland started in the early s when Ireland’s first Ambassador, John J. Hearne, sent a small box of shamrocks to President Harry Truman. “The International Year of Plant Health has been widely celebrated in Ireland. This year serves to remind people here and all over the world of the importance of plants and the recognition that plants make up 80% of the food we eat and produce 98% of the oxygen we breathe,” said Daniel Mulhall, Ambassador of Ireland to the United States of America. “Although most Irish people live in towns and cities, we still see the countryside as our spiritual home. We have a very close relationship with the land,” said Ambassador Mulhall. Bowl of Shamrock presented to President Joe Biden by Ireland Prime Minister Micheál Martin. To meet U.S. import requirements, the shamrock arrived in the United States with a phytosanitary certificate from Ireland’s national plant protection organization, the Department of Agriculture, Food & the Marine, indicating a status of pest-free. The certificate reaffirms the United States and Ireland’s shared commitment to protecting plant health across our borders. “Every day our employees protect America’s crops and forests. They serve an important role in safeguarding American agriculture and natural resources from invasive plant pests and diseases,” said Dr. Osama El-Lissy, the Deputy Administrator of USDA APHIS’ Plant Protection and Quarantine program. The shamrock presented to President Biden was grown by Mr. Joe Sugrue at his family-run nursery in Ballinskelligs, County Kerry, Ireland. For more than two decades, the Sugrue family has provided shamrock for the St. Patrick’s Day presentation at the White House. “The USDA is honored to play a role in facilitating the arrival of shamrock to our country every year. These lovely green plants are healthy, safe and ready for the White House,” concluded Dr. El-Lissy.

"Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 25,   A perfect pie crust is often the measure of a top quality baker.  The “blue ribbon” pie crust is light and flaky.  Even the best baker’s skills, however, depend on the quality of the ingredients.  The quality of flour is based on the quality of the wheat – and measuring the quality of the wheat is a key responsibility of the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS). FGIS and the Official Service Providers it supervises conduct Falling Number tests as a measure of wheat quality.  Scientists and technicians at FGIS’s National Grain Center will soon begin a quality assurance program to monitor these tests and verify the original results to ensure that any procedural issues that could possibly impact the results of these important tests are quickly addressed.  FGIS will monitor a percentage of all tests performed throughout the Official testing system.  Last year, over 25,000 Falling Number tests were performed on wheat targeted for sale domestically and abroad. Joshua Liang, Physical Scientist, performs a Falling Number test at GIPSA’s National Grain Center in Kansas City, MO. The Falling Number test is used to determine the pre-harvest quality of wheat.  Wheat that begins to germinate or sprout in the field or during storage because of elevated moisture levels can greatly affect the quality of the end product.  Sprouting unleashes an enzyme called alpha amylase that breaks down starch in the wheat kernel.  The level and quality of the starch in wheat is an important factor in how the end product of wheat functions during the cooking process.  Too much sprouting can cause sticky dough, which any baker knows leads to tough pie crusts.  It can cause bread, cakes, muffins and other baked products to lose their volume and fall flat.  The impact of sprouting is not limited to pies and bread, however, as pasta products with high levels of alpha amylase take longer to cook and produce a cooked pasta product that is too soft – not at all the ‘al dente’ quality preferred by most consumers. Falling Number is a method used to measure the effect and severity of alpha amylase in wheat before it is milled and used for an end product.  An instrument like the one being used in the picture on the left measures the time it takes for a plunger to fall to the bottom of a precision bore glass tube filled with a heated paste of wheat-meal and water.  Whole ground wheat or flour and water is added to test tubes and shaken to form a slurry.  Stirring rods are inserted into the test tubes, which are then placed in a boiling water bath in the Falling Number apparatus.  They are automatically stirred for 60 seconds, which causes the starch-water slurry to thicken.  After mixing and heating, the stirrers are released at the top of the slurry.  The number of seconds it takes for the plunger to fall to the bottom through the slurry is a measure of the enzyme activity in the wheat – hence the term “Falling Number.”  The test requires a specific instrument to run, but can be run virtually anywhere there is good quality water and electricity. Generally, a Falling Number value of 350 seconds or longer indicates low enzyme activity and very sound wheat.  As the amount of enzyme activity increases, the Falling Number decreases.  Values below 200 seconds indicate high levels of enzyme activity. The Falling Number test is recognized around the world as a key measure of wheat quality.  Minimum tolerance levels are often in purchase contracts, especially for wheat targeted for export.   FGIS’s Quality Assurance Programs ensure the accuracy of the Falling Number test by standardizing official testing locations across the nation.

"Virginia State Statistician, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Conservation  Jan 29,  The Old Dominion Dominates when it comes to farming – more than one-third of the state’s area is farmland. VA Farmers, take a BOW! Check back next week for another in-depth state focus from the Census of Agriculture. The Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture. Nothing can compare to the economic impact agriculture has in Virginia. Census of Agriculture counted more than 46,000 farms, which cover more than 8.3 million acres of farmland in the commonwealth. That’s nearly a third of our entire state! In fact, according to Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, agriculture is our state’s largest industry. In the most recent census, Virginia farmers reported selling more than $3.7 billion worth of agricultural products. Of these, most came from the livestock sector. Broiler chickens were the top commodity sold in , the year of the latest Census of Agriculture. That year, growers sold $638.3 million worth of broiler hens. Cattle is another big commodity in Virginia. In our farmers and rancher sold more than $430 million worth of cattle and calves. And, as can be expected, with livestock you also get livestock products, such as milk. In , farmers sold nearly $347.2 million worth of cow milk in Virginia. Our crop sales, which amounted to nearly $1.4 billion in are also nothing to sneeze at. In Virginia, soybeans are our top crop. Nearly 580,000 acres of farmland are dedicated to this crop, with Virginia farmers selling more than $300 million worth of soybeans in . Not surprisingly, tobacco is a major crop in Virginia. While this industry is not as big as it once was, Virginia still ranks as one of the top 5 states for tobacco. In , our farmers sold $109 million worth of leaf tobacco from their farms. Virginia farmers also grow plenty of edible fruits and vegetables. According to the Census, our farmers harvested more than 5,000 acres of potatoes and more than 3,000 acres of tomatoes, which are key vegetable crops in the commonwealth. On the fruit side, apples are the largest commodity in Virginia. Our growers harvested nearly 12,000 acres of apples in . And, largely in thanks to our growing wine industry, grapes are now one of the top agricultural commodities in Virginia. Our farmers dedicated more than 4,300 acres to grape production in . There are plenty of other facts about Virginia agriculture that I could mention here, but I’ll let you check them out yourself.

"Economic Research Service in  USDA Results  Feb 19,   Policy makers, economists, the farm and food industry, consumer advocates, and others rely on USDA’s food price outlook and farm sector income and finances in their decision making and planning.  At this year’s Forum, two sessions focus on these closely watched USDA forecasts and present the latest analysis and projections. A session on the Farm Income Outlook for focuses on general measures of the financial well-being of the farm economy. The analyses and released by the Economic Research Service (ERS) and used by USDA and others in both the public and private sector provide insights about the financial health of the U.S. agricultural economy. Financial performance measures assess the farm sector's receipts and expenses; net income; variations in farm income by farm size and other categorizations; and changes in the sector's wealth holdings. ERS estimates and forecasts of farm income and wealth are based on information collected across USDA and other parts of government, as well as responses to USDA's annual Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) and other sector-level information. Sharp swings in commodity prices, economic uncertainty and a major drought over the past few years have led to heightened interest in the movement of retail food prices.  In addition, due to the changing structure of food and agricultural markets, there is increased attention on forecasting retail food prices and understanding the implications of food price changes on consumers as well as the food industry. ERS develops and monitors indicators of individual, household, and market-level food consumption, prices, expenditures, food-marketing costs, and farm-to-retail price spreads. The session covering the Food Price Outlook for will provide perspectives from USDA, the retail grocery industry, and the restaurant industry on food price inflation, the main factors that contribute to changes in food prices, and the consumer implications of rising food prices.

"U.S. Forest Service, Office of Communications in  Forestry  Jun 02,  Although not original members of the first Triple Nickles Platoon, Thomas McFadden (left) and Joe Murchison (right), who is the current President of the Triple Nickles Association, attend an event at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum honoring their comrades. (U.S. Forest Service photo) Most people don’t conjure up images of the U.S. Forest Service when they think of the Smithsonian’s Air and Space Museum. But every fire season the work of the Forest Service’s planes and helicopters, carrying smokejumpers, are vitally important to controlling the spread of wildland fires. This is why the Smithsonian recently honored the legacy of 17 of some of the most lionized smokejumpers in Forest Service history. Known as the Triple Nickles, these smokejumpers were the first all-African American crew in American firefighting. “It was World War II. You have to remember this was a time when segregation was still a part of everyday life. But 17 black men stood up to serve their country and become the first African-American paratrooper unit,” said Deidra McGee, a Forest Service employee who has been promoting the Triple Nickles since . McGee met these valiant men that year in Washington, D.C. at the Ellipse near the White House, during a ceremony commemorating Smokey Bear’s 50th birthday. The men wanted to join the fight in Europe during World War II, but their dreams were shattered when military leaders in America and Europe feared racial tensions would disrupt war time operations. At about the same time, the Forest Service asked the military for help to minimize damage caused by balloon bombs launched by the Japanese across the Pacific Ocean with the intent to start forest fires in the western U.S.. “In the end, few of the incendiary devices reached U.S. soil, but the Triple Nickles were instrumental in helping the Forest Service fight naturally-caused fires,” said McGee. “They became history’s first military smokejumpers who answered 36 fire calls and made more than 1,200 jumps that summer of .” Sadly, the event at the Smithsonian saw none of the original Triple Nickles as only platoon member Clarence Beavers remains alive and he is physically unable to leave his bed for any extended period of time. Instead several others, with close ties to the original 17, attended to represent their comrades.

"USDA Meteorologist, Office of the Chief Economist in  Conservation  Sep 26,  U.S Winter Wheat Progress - Percent Planted as of September 23,  Visit www.usda.gov/drought for the latest information regarding USDA’s Drought Disaster response and assistance. Based on since , U.S. corn and soybean harvests are proceeding at a record pace.  By September 23, more than one-third (39%) of the corn had been harvested, three times the five-year average of 13%.  During the preceding 17 years, the record amount of U.S. corn harvested by September 23 had been 24% in .  Similarly, more than one-fifth (22%) of the soybeans had been harvested by September 23.  Prior to this year, the record-setting soybean harvest pace by September 23 had been 18% in . Meanwhile, prospects for U.S. winter wheat have brightened in some areas due to recent and ongoing rainfall.  In particular, beneficial rain has fallen from the central and southern Plains into the Ohio Valley.  By September 23, one-quarter (25%) of the winter wheat had been planted, two percentage points behind the five-year average.  Seeding has been especially slow across the northwestern half of the Plains and portions of the Northwest, as producers continue to await moisture.  On the 23rd, wheat planting was more than five percentage points behind average in South Dakota (37% planted versus the average of 52%), Colorado (42 vs. 54%), Nebraska (47 vs. 59%), Montana (35 vs. 43%), and Idaho (28 vs. 34%). In fact, some of the nation’s driest conditions cover the northwestern half of the Plains.  On September 23, Nebraska led the nation with 98% of its rangeland and pastures rated very poor to poor.  Overall, 56% of the nation’s rangeland and pastures were rated very poor to poor on the 23rd, down from a peak of 59% in August and early September.  In contrast to the poor conditions across much of the western and central U.S., at least half of the pastures were rated good to excellent in Tennessee, along with every Gulf and Atlantic coastal state from Louisiana to Maryland. Weather Outlook:  For the remainder of the week, a slow-moving cold front will generate locally heavy showers and thunderstorms from the central and southern Plains into the mid-Atlantic region.  Additional rainfall totals of one to three inches can be expected in the vicinity of the front.  Toward week’s end, the front will sag southward and begin to interact with moisture associated with the remnants of former eastern Pacific Hurricane Miriam.  As a result, locally heavy showers will develop in the south-central U.S., including parts of Texas.  All of the rain will be timely for recently planted winter wheat across the central and southern Plains, the mid-South, and the lower Midwest.  Farther north, however, critically dry conditions will persist in key winter wheat production areas of the northern Plains, from Montana to Nebraska.  Dryness will also remain a concern in parts of the Northwestern winter wheat belt.  Looking ahead to next week, late-season warmth will dominate the West, while near- to below-normal temperatures will prevail in most areas from the Plains to the East Coast.  Meanwhile, next week will feature wet weather in the East but little or no precipitation from the Mississippi Valley westward.

"Stepping Outside the Classroom to Learn Lessons for Life  Stop by any trailhead or boat landing on a national forest or grassland and take a moment to ask folks to explain the origins of their love for the outdoors. You will likely hear people return time and again to some formative experience they had in grade school. For some, the smell of the pine brings them back to camping with a cub scout troop. For others, getting their hands dirty stirs memories of a favorite teacher’s class garden.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Mar 20,   More than 108 years have passed since Gifford Pinchot became chief of the U.S. Forest Service. Yet today, with Tom Tidwell filling that role in a very different era, some of the same issues persist, along with others Pinchot might not have imagined. “We’re fortunate that we have an organization that can handle complex issues, like our Research and Development branch of the Forest Service (efforts) to sustain private and international Forest systems,” said Tidwell. Pinchot headed the Division of Forestry under the Department of Interior for seven years before the agency became the Forest Service under the Department of Agriculture. At the time, the nation’s forests were seen as inexhaustible, but Pinchot did not see it that way. “Without natural resources, life itself is impossible. From birth to death, natural resources, transformed for human use, feed, clothe, shelter, and transport us,” Pinchot said. “Upon them we depend for every material necessity, comfort, convenience, and protection in our lives. Without abundant resources prosperity is out of reach.” Pinchot, often referred to as the father of American conservation, increased the 56 million acres of public land under the Division of Forestry to Forest Service holdings of 150 national forests covering 172 million acres by . Today, Tidwell oversees more than 193 million acres of national forests and grasslands with similar yet disparate issues. The impacts of climate change – longer, hotter fire seasons and infestations of pests that have killed millions of trees – are among the important issues facing the agency today. Also, putting more demand on the land is a growing population that is not as connected to the land as in previous generations. Tidwell recently presented the Pinchot Distinguished Lecture at the Pinchot Institute to help mark the 50th anniversary of the Pinchot Institute for Conservation Studies.  The Mildford, Pa., institute is in Grey Towers, originally the summer estate of the James Pinchot, Gifford’s father, and later the primary home of Gifford Pinchot. “We are so fortunate in this country to have the conservation legacy that people like Gifford Pinchot and Theodore Roosevelt really helped to establish for this country,” Tidwell said. “And today we have the honor and the responsibility to make sure we carry that out so that the next generations have that same range of opportunities and decision space about how to use these incredible resources.” Tidwell said his top priorities include restoring healthy, resilient forest and grassland eco-systems, eco-systems that can sustain plentiful supplies of clean water, abundant habitat for fish and wildlife, renewable supplies of wood and energy and abundant recreational opportunities for all Americans. After the lecture, guests were invited to ask the chief questions.  Most questions were about climate change, policy and mission.  “Climate change is going to affect us and we need to have a better understanding of what the impacts are socially and economically,” said Tidwell.

"Deputy Administrator, AMS Transportation & Marketing Program in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Apr 22,  Spring is now upon us and many local farmers markets are opening with displays of brilliant and vibrant . Farmers across the country are making local foods available to their communities. USDA photo courtesy of Peter Wood, AMS. Spring is upon us and many local farmers markets are opening with displays of brilliant and vibrant . The fresh air has more people talking about and buying local foods. In fact, from the USDA Economic Research Service suggests that farmers across the country sold an estimated $6.1 billion in locally marketed foods in . My agency, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), plays a role in increasing these numbers by creating marketing opportunities for American farmers and local food businesses through the combination of applied research, technical services, and grant support. As the demand for local food increases, food hubs are one way farmers can deliver more fresh food to retailers, schools, hospitals and restaurants. That’s why expanding local food efforts have focused on creating more food hubs. A food hub is an enterprise that helps farmers collect and gather local and regional agricultural products for distribution and marketing to wholesale, retail, and institutional customers. AMS offers food hub operators technical assistance for food warehouse design, facility management and physical volume capacities. Organizations and businesses involved in local food systems can use AMS publications, research and presentations to better understand and strengthen the local food infrastructure.  For example, one recent resource that AMS published is Building a Food Hub From the Ground Up: A Facility Design Case Study of Tuscarora Organic Growers. This detailed examination of a food hub’s growth gives local food supporters on-the-ground examples of how food hubs manage distribution infrastructure, solutions to warehouse design and how to gain the space capacity for handling a variety of products. Other valuable AMS local food resources include the USDA’s Local Food Directories. These directories are for farmers markets, food hubs, community-supported agriculture (CSA) operations and on-farm markets. The directories are valuable online tools that connect local food consumers and producers. Searching for a local food business is easy when using this one-stop resource that provides convenient access to directions, operating times, product offerings and more information about various sources of local foods.  Providing technical assistance is just one of the ways that AMS supports the local food sector. For instance, we also offer grants to expand access to healthy food. AMS currently has over $90 million in grant funding available for this key sector. Through our Specialty Crop Block Grant Program and Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program (comprised of the Farmers Market Promotion Program and the Local Food Promotion Program), AMS supports producers, local food entrepreneurs, and rural and urban communities across the country. Grant applications must be submitted electronically through Grants.gov by May 14, . Applicants are encouraged to start the registration process as soon as possible to ensure that they meet the deadline. USDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food (KYF2) initiative coordinates our work as the local food market sector continues to grow. In the past two years alone, USDA has made over 500 investments in food hubs, local processing facilities and distribution networks. The local food movement is alive and well. All of us here at AMS and USDA as a whole are committed to strengthening the local food sector, making sure it is a healthy, established part of the broader marketplace. As the demand for local food increases, food hubs are one way farmers can deliver more fresh food - like Irv & Shelly's Fresh Picks who recently exhibit at the Good Food Festival in Chicago. They started their food hub to support small independent farmers and make healthy food deliveries to homes and businesses all year-round. USDA photo courtesy of Peter Wood, AMS.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service in  Health and Safety  Dec 23,  The USDA National Agricultural Library’s Agricultural Law Information Partnership website is a resource to help people find information relating to agricultural law. (Illustration credit: Jody Shuart, ARS). Success in any part of agriculture today means being able to successfully navigate local, state and federal laws and regulations — from water rights to food safety regulations, from crop insurance to organic certification. To help people find such legal information, the National Agricultural Library (NAL) has recently developed the Agricultural Law Information Partnership website. This partnership is a collaboration between NAL, the National Agricultural Law Center at the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture (NALC), and the Center for Agriculture and Food Systems (CAFS) at the Vermont Law School. For each subject area, the Agricultural Law Information Partnership website provides an overview and a portal to a wide range of resources for farmers, producers, consumers, researchers and legal professionals. The initial topics include animal welfare, organic food, food production and sales regulations, new farmer, veterans farming, and water quality and quantity laws. More areas will be added as new material becomes available. While users cannot consider the information on the website to be legal advice, all content is reviewed before it is added by law librarian Kirstin Nelson, who coordinates the new program for NAL. The partnership not only gathers links to legal resources but also funds research projects that fill gaps in available information and the development of new tools. The first two of these are already completed and available online: the National Gleaning Project and the Farmland Tenure Resource Project, both initiatives of the Center for Agriculture and Food Systems. Information about the U.S. Farm Bill and other resources can be found on the USDA National Agricultural Library’s new Agricultural Law Information Partnership website. (Photo credit: Architect of the Capitol). The National Gleaning Project is a clearinghouse for food recovery-related information, connecting organizations with opportunities to collaborate at all levels, and a guide to national and state laws and regulations pertaining to gleaning and food donation. The Farmland Tenure Resource Project is an online legal resource aimed at helping farmers, landowners and farmer/landowner-advocates to understand and navigate the various legal issues related to transferring farmland in New England. This includes financing, taxation, acquisition and insurance. Another resource within the partnership has been developed by the Agricultural & Food Law Consortium, a four-university alliance led by the NALC. The consortium has done extensive research and outreach, including a year-round webinar series and a multi-state annual legal conference addressing topics such as the Endangered Species Act, animal welfare standards in aquaculture, use of drones in agriculture, environmental regulations, and shale oil and gas development.

"Serving Rural America's Kids and Families  Every parent’s wish is for their children to thrive and prosper. Yet, too many of our nation’s families still live in poverty, despite doing their best to make ends meet. Rural families and children have additional challenges as schools, healthcare services, healthy food choices, jobs, and other opportunities are often miles away in a different town, county or even state. The Obama Administration is committed to these families, and believes that all children -- no matter where they live --  should have an opportunity to succeed. Today, President Obama and I met with eight members of the National 4-H community in the Oval Office. Each one of them had an inspiring story about how they are opening up new doors for kids in their hometowns, and how this work is building stronger communities where they can learn, play and grow. We wanted to take a moment to introduce you to these young leaders and tell you about the projects that encouraged President Obama to invite them to the White House to say “thank you”.  Investing in kids like these is an investment in America’s future.

"South Carolina Agriculture – Nothing Could Be Finer  The Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture. Agriculture in South Carolina is a long and proud tradition. As the Census of Agriculture showed us, even today, nearly 5 million acres of our state’s land is dedicated to farming, that’s almost a quarter of all land in South Carolina. The latest agriculture census also showed that the number of farms in South Carolina has remained steady for the past 15 years at roughly 25,000. The Palmetto State farmers sold more than $3 billion worth of agricultural products. That’s a whopping 29.2 percent increase in sales in just five years. Of these sales, $1.5 billion – nearly half of the total agricultural product sales in South Carolina – came from poultry and egg sales.

"Acting Communications Lead, USDA’s Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement in  Research and Science  Sep 20,  July was the third hottest July the country has ever seen, and for staff and faculty from Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) and Hispanic-Serving School Districts, the sweltering temperatures they were experiencing in Washington, D.C. were no exception. This was not summer vacation. The 20 E. Kika De La Garza fellows were at U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) headquarters to meet with senior leaders from all of USDA’s mission areas. “I now have a much better sense of the breadth of USDA’s work and resources,” said Engil Pereira, a fellow and an assistant professor at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. “I feel much more empowered to continue pursuing my goals at UTRGV, now that I understand what resources are available and who to contact.” Deputy Agriculture Secretary Jewel Bronaugh thanked the fellows for their important work. The weeklong session also included talks by Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement Director Lisa Ramirez and leaders from around USDA. The De La Garza fellows include faculty or staff from Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) and Hispanic-Serving School Districts around the country. These are educational institutions with Hispanic student enrollment of 25 percent or more. For five of the De La Garza fellows, an extra week of engagement involved working with USDA scientists at Agricultural Research Service (ARS) labs in Colorado, Mississippi, New York, and Washington, or with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Nebraska. Even after the fellows go through program, they continue to collaborate with USDA. Alison Bray, a De La Garza fellow and chemistry associate professor from Texas Lutheran University, said the experience “opened up a completely new pathway for my research.” She added that spending time in an ARS lab also “allowed me to bring exciting new projects to my students” and “opened doorways for my students to intern with ARS in Beltsville and Fargo, N.D.” The De La Garza fellows join participants going back to in creating a nation-wide network of educators who are working with USDA to help grow the next generation of American agriculture.

"Under Secretary for Food Safety in  Health and Safety  Mar 11,   One of the things I started to do when I became Under Secretary for Food Safety at USDA was to hold town hall meetings with Food Safety and Inspection Service field staff and Administrator Al Almanza. This week I had the pleasure of holding such a meeting with our headquarters staff in Washington. I began the town hall meeting by asking a question: How many people in this country get sick every year from the food they eat? The answer is 48 million people – 1 in every 6 people. Of those, 128,000 will be hospitalized and 3,000 will die from something as basic as the food they eat. That’s a major public health issue, and the work we do is all about bringing those numbers down. As the public health regulatory agency within USDA, our reach spans the globe. In fact, most of the nearly 10,000 employees who work for us are scattered throughout the country, working in slaughterhouses, processing facilities, laboratories, or conducting surveillance. Each job is critical to public health. Through their inspection, testing or surveillance duties, our staff make sure America’s meat, poultry and processed egg products are safe, wholesome, and correctly labeled. My team and I are also working to make FSIS a 21st century public health agency focused on prevention of foodborne illness. As we do so, getting input from our field personnel, from the people who carry out our policies, is so important. And although they may not be doing inspections at the plants around the country, the food safety staff in Washington are nonetheless critical to ensuring that the food parents put on their tables is safe. This is what our people do every day. Whether inspecting on the line, computer programming, running samples at a lab, helping to develop policy, or educating consumers, we all share a common mission to protect the public from foodborne illness. President Obama, Secretary Vilsack, I and everyone at FSIS are committed to this mission every day.

"Ensuring Program Integrity in the WIC Program  For more than 40 years, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has provided supplemental foods and nutrition services vital to the health and nutrition of vulnerable moms, newborns and young children. And throughout those four decades, we’ve had a long-standing history of working with WIC state agencies to ensure program resources and taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently. While a study found a relatively low rate of improper vendor payments, (representing less than 1.5 percent of WIC food expenses), FNS has and will continue to intervene when problems arise and to require state agencies to improve the integrity of their programs.

"in  Conservation  Aug 08,   Cross posted from the Small Business Administration Blog: Today, I attended a meeting of the White House Rural Council, which focused on our coordinated response to historic drought conditions that are affecting communities across Rural America. Our goal at the SBA and across the Administration is making sure that these hard hit communities have the tools and the resources they need to navigate and recover from these severe drought conditions. To date, the SBA has issued 71 agency drought declarations in 32 states covering more than 1,630 counties. These declarations allow small businesses, small agricultural cooperatives and non-farm small businesses that are economically affected by the drought in their community to apply for SBA’s Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL). To find out if your county has been declared a drought disaster area, view SBA's current disaster declarations page. And to learn more about how to apply for a disaster loan, go to the SBA Disaster Assistance section of the SBA Web site. You can also contact SBA’s Disaster Assistance Customer Service Center by e-mail at disastercustomerservice@sba.gov, or by calling 659-. The USDA’s Disaster and Drought Assistance site also is a good resource. It includes links to maps of current disaster declaration areas and a weekly weather and drought blog. In addition to our disaster loan program, the SBA, the USDA and the Department of Commerce through its Economic Development Administration (EDA) will be hosting forums in communities impacted by drought conditions. The goal of these forums will be to provide comprehensive information on the federal resources that are available to assist your farm, ranch or small business. At these forums, we will have SBA disaster assistance staff, our field staff and counselors from our resource partner network on hand to ensure you have all the tools and information you need to help your business. For those not able to attend these forums, we will be setting up shop at State and County Fairs across the country to make sure all of your questions are answered and that you are getting the assistance you need. We also will be hosting a series of online webinars and conference calls to provide real-time information and updates over the coming months. Rural America is critical to our nation’s economy. And a key to the long-term success of rural communities is access and opportunity for small businesses and entrepreneurs in these regions. We are focused on making sure that more small businesses in rural communities have the access to capital, counseling and contracting opportunities they need to grow and create good jobs. We know how important credit unions are to rural communities. That’s why the National Credit Union Administration will be announcing that an additional 1,000 credit unions are eligible for low-income designation, which exempts them from the statutory cap on small business lending. This allows unlimited lending to small business owners, including farmers. Of the 1,000 credit unions that will be receiving this designation, nearly half are located in a severely drought-stricken state. I travel all over the country meeting with small business owners and entrepreneurs.   Some of the most innovative and exciting small businesses being built today are in Rural America. And we are going to make certain that rural businesses not only have the resources they need to endure these difficult drought conditions, but we are going to ensure that they have the tools to emerge stronger and more competitive than before.

"State Executive Director, Hawaii State & Pacific Basin, Farm Service Agency in  Energy  Aug 15,  Diane Ley, State Executive Director, Hawaii Farm Service Agency, prepares to depart Hickam Air Force Base for the Great Green Fleet demonstration. USDA Photo.  WOW! The word “wow” only moderately conveys the historic events that unfolded this summer during the Department of Navy’s Rim of the Pacific Exercises (RIMPAC) Great Green Fleet (GGF) demonstration. The might and power of the United States Navy coupled with that of scores of other Pacific Rim counties was impressive, but moreover a number of the great ships and aircraft were fueled by a mix of algae and animal fats. Yes, advanced biofuels produced from American grown algae and waste animal fats powering the all-powerful military platforms! The man with the vision behind this innovation, Secretary of Navy Ray Mabus, would proudly note the Navy’s continuing global leadership as an innovator – having led maritime vessels from sails to coal-fired steam, from coal to oil and nuclear; and now the transition to advanced biofuels. Tom Vilsack, Secretary of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) would later expounded upon that message of innovation, “We can, as a nation, change the fuel production and distribution paradigm in the world, if we are consistent in our efforts to increase our production and use of domestic biofuels which are important to our energy and national security as well as create jobs.” For nearly four years, Secretaries Mabus and Vilsack have made a coordinated and concerted effort to support the development and stand-up of a domestic biofuels sector. The USDA has lent support to furthering research and business start-ups for biomass production and waste stream diversion, and the Navy has sought to test, demonstrate and accelerate investments in advanced biofuels for use in its many platforms. Both secretaries have identified the importance of establishing geographically diverse supply sources of biomass and biofuels and noted that the State of Hawaii has a strategic role to play; hence, the RIMPAC exercises off-shore from Honolulu Hawaii was a perfect match to demonstrate the capacity advanced biofuels in the GGF. On the designated day for the GGF demonstration, I represented the USDA and traveled with navy and congressional staff and representatives of the several airlines; assembling before daybreak for briefings and preparations for transport on a propeller-driven aircraft out to the USS Nimitz, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. We donned military issue life jackets, goggles and cranial helmets with ear muffs; yet, the ear protection only afforded limited attenuation of the excessive noise throughout much of the day. We headed out onto tarmac of Hickam Air Force Base and took seats facing the back of the no-frills plane. Squinting to see in the suddenly dark space as the back hatch closed, a mixture of 50 percent biofuels and fossil fuels raced through the aircraft’s engines, and the roar became deafening. The engines, gorged with the algae and animal fat mix; and the plane roared down the runway and into the sky. Traveling 45 miles due north of Honolulu, through the aircraft’s single viewing pane, naval vessels could be seen dotting the sea and the horizon. Cruisers, destroyers and then the USS Nimitz came into view. Ships and planes off the coast of Hawaii, participating in the Great Green Fleet demonstration. After we landed on the Nimitz and scrambled out of the aircraft, we were hit by the full might of steel upon the sea – the carrier’s deck 1,100 feet in length and 250 feet wide with a 10-story high bridge for observation and traffic control. Jets everywhere, attended to by squadrons of seamen grabbed in Navy Working Uniforms, colored light-weight turtle necks defining each squad’s role in the GGF demonstration. Keeping to an aggressive schedule, we viewed various operations including radar and navigation rooms; a tactical operation room for RIMPAC led this year by the Chilean Navy; and anchors the size of an office. Secretary Mabus heralded the multi-day GGF demonstration, which was supported with the purchase of 450,000 gallons of non-food waste (used cooking oil) from Louisiana-based Dynamic Fuels LLC, included algae produced by Solazyme. Meeting the Navy’s criteria, the fuel was: 1) “drop-in” and compatible with existing technology; 2) derived from non-food sources; and 3) its combustion would not increase the carbon footprint. Back at the Flag Deck, the GGF demonstrations ramped up with a dozen jets in high idle, rocking and trembling with a deafening roar of engines each waiting to be catapulted from the deck of the USS Nimitz. Once air-born, the 50/50 biofuel blend kicked in and the jets soared and flashed by the carrier at great speed and in tight formation. Flying the world’s most advanced aircraft with precise precision, the pilots accomplished mid-air refueling and touch and go maneuvers. The crew on deck and the spectators were enveloped fumes from fuel, oils and metallic dust; combined with heat emanating from the engines and the thunderous rumble, and everyone agreed that this was as Secretary Mabus stated, “A historic day.” For more about the Navy’s Great Green Fleet visit the Green Fleet website, or to read or listen to secretaries Mabus and Vilsack debrief on the Great Green Fleet visit the USDA website.

"Nutritionist, Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 06,  Dave’s Herb-Stuﬀed Mushrooms The MyPlate Team offers the final “Makeover Monday” recipe this week on the USDA blog and the MyPlate Facebook page. I love mushrooms and could probably eat them every day. They come in a variety of sizes, shapes, , textures, and flavors and can be worked into every meal. On their own, mushrooms are pretty healthful – very low in calories, free of cholesterol and (almost) free of fat. They are also naturally low in sodium, high in potassium, and are generally high in vitamins and minerals. Stuffing mushrooms just makes something wonderful ever better!  But what you stuff in these tasty little vegetables can make or break the dish. Typically, mushrooms are stuffed with foods containing saturated fats and sodium. So, if you’re trying to watch one or both of these in the New Year, consider various herbs and spices! Herbs and spices do a nice job of seasoning many of my favorite foods. When I decided long ago to reduce my intake of saturated fats, I knew that my taste buds would miss the flavors of these fats and the foods that contain them, but I didn’t want to settle for a bland diet. So, I invested in several healthy cookbooks and read (and reread) the chapters on herbs and spices. The results have been quite impressive. They say that “variety is the spice of life,” but I like to think that “spices add variety to life.” Along with the spices came exciting and unlimited flavor combinations. Now, I choose whatever suits my mood. (Is there anything more inviting than a kitchen that smells of sautéed fresh rosemary?) Start adding more flavor to your plate in and you’ll see what I mean.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Jan 28,  Dianilda Rodriguez of GR Management Corp., Arlene Zambrana from USDA Rural Development, and Maria Rodriquez-Collazo of PathStone stand in front of the completed Alturas de Castañer housing complex in Puerto Rico. In the municipality of Lares, Puerto Rico, lies Alturas de Castañer, a small, mountainous community that is home to 24 agricultores and their families. The agricultores - or farm workers - work hard year-round to produce coffee, bananas, root vegetables and citrus fruits that are then sold in local markets and to area restaurants. Before coming to the community of Alturas de Castañer, many families lived in cramped conditions, sometimes with two or three other families.  Conditions were unsanitary and children were constantly sick.  Some homes did not even have roofs, and residents suffered dangerous exposure to the natural elements, including torrential rains during hurricane season. Alturas de Castañer resident Maria Rodriguez and her husband recall renting a house that they could barely afford. The home was in disrepair, they had to use a ladder as a makeshift set of front steps to their home, and finding snakes and rats in their living space was commonplace. With the help of USDA Rural Development's Farm Labor Housing Program, the Municipality of Lares was able to build an affordable 24-home rental community, Alturas de Castañer, dedicated solely to farm workers and their families. After moving into this community, living conditions improved dramatically for many residents. Residents like Jomar, an agricultor who uses a wheelchair for mobility; the closets and kitchen in his Alturas de Castañer home were built for wheelchair accessibility. The community is quiet and clean, the children of the farm workers have a safe place to play, and the homes are well maintained by an experienced management company. It's affordable, too; farm workers living in this community are only to pay 30 percent of their income towards rent. Built in , Alturas de Castañer was a product of a partnership between USDA Rural Development, Rural Opportunities Puerto Rico, Inc. (ROPRI), an affiliate of PathStone, the Puerto Rico Department of Housing, and the Federal Home Loan Bank. USDA and ROPRI have realized the success of the investment despite the significant challenges in planning and building a community in rural Puerto Rico. USDA and its partners are now looking forward to the development of self-sustaining community gardens which will also support a summer food program for children. An investment like Alturas de Castañer, the only one of its kind in Puerto Rico, helps us realize that a better future is possible for rural Puerto Ricans.  USDA Rural Development is working with community developers and affordable housing advocates to create more communities dedicated to the essential agricultores of Puerto Rico.

Not just because she, Deanna and their fur family have a roof over their heads, but also because to her, the house truly is the ‘gift that keeps on giving.’ “Just like the Grinch, my heart swelled three times bigger when we got this house!” the single mom laughed. “When my daughter was younger, I worked three jobs. Finally having a place to call our own made my self-confidence go through the roof. This is my dream come true: to have my own house and a house for my daughter and grandchildren to come to in the future. Our home is large enough to host family gatherings now. That means the world to me.” Recently announced changes to the Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program will increase the availability of rural home loans. Beginning in September , many currently ineligible lenders, including small community banks and credit unions, will be able to underwrite loans guaranteed by Rural Development. USDA’s Rural Housing Service has helped rural residents purchase homes since . Since the start of the Obama Administration, we have helped more than 750,000 rural Americans buy homes with Direct and Guaranteed loans.  Additionally, we help nearly a half million others with affordable rental housing each year.

"Agricultural Marketing Service Administrator in  Trade  Jul 08,  This partnership will streamline access to the growing Korean organic market for American producers and businesses, benefiting the thriving organic industry and supporting jobs and businesses on a global scale. USDA Photo Courtesy of Miles McEvoy. Last week, we celebrated another victory for the global organic community – the announcement of an organic equivalency agreement between the U.S. and the Republic of Korea. We are thrilled with the outcome! Beginning July 1, , processed organic products certified in Korea or in the U.S. may be sold as organic in either country, eliminating significant barriers and creating opportunities for American businesses across the organic supply chain as well as setting the foundation for additional organic agricultural trade agreements. Consumers in Korea will now be able to enjoy a wide range of U.S. organic exports including condiments, cereal, baby food, frozen meals, milk, and other processed products. Under this Administration, the United States has also established organic trade arrangements with Canada, the European Union, and Japan. The Korean arrangement will streamline access to the growing Korean organic market for American producers and businesses, benefiting the thriving organic sector and supporting jobs and businesses on a global scale. The new arrangement also reflects the strength of the USDA organic standards – the U.S. organic program sets the gold standard, which is one reason that Korea chose to work with the U.S. on its “first” organic equivalency arrangement.  It also serves as an example of how closely the U.S. and Korea are working together to address emerging issues and strengthen our trade relationship. In , Korea was the 6th largest market for U.S. agricultural exports—providing about one quarter of Korea’s agricultural imports and purchasing more than $5 billion of U.S. food and agricultural products. According to U.S. industry estimates, the U.S. exported around $35 million of processed organic products to Korea in .  These exports came to a virtual standstill in January , when Korea implemented mandatory organic certification requirements that U.S. organic exports to be certified to Korean standards.  U.S. operations wanting to access the Korean organic market were faced with a double set of fees, inspections, and paperwork. The U.S. negotiating team – led by representatives from the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), and the Agricultural Marketing Service’s (AMS) National Organic Program (NOP) led by Deputy Administrator Miles McEvoy – worked expeditiously to reestablish access to Korea’s organic market while protecting the integrity of USDA’s organic standards. Negotiations encompassed a side-by-side comparison of the USDA organic regulations and the Korean organic standards to determine if an equivalency arrangement would work. We also sent an audit team to Korea to evaluate their organic certification and enforcement provisions.  After the thorough review, U.S. and Korean officials finalized the organic equivalency arrangement. Both the U.S. and Korea are committed to ensuring that all traded products retain their organic integrity from farm to market. Through the NOP, USDA has helped organic farmers and businesses achieve $35 billion annually in U.S. retail sales.  The organic community includes over 25,000 organic businesses in more than 120 different countries around the world, and the combined organic markets of the countries with which we have equivalency arrangements are valued at more than $50 billion.  AMS and NOP are proud of USDA organic integrity, which helps propel strong growth in consumer demand for certified organic products and creates opportunities worldwide for American organic businesses.

"USDA, Partners Gearing Up for Summer Meal Service  Last week, about 250 Ohio lawmakers, educators, nonprofit directors, community leaders and others came together at the Mid-Ohio Foodbank for the third annual statewide Summer Food Service Summit. The focus of this summit was USDA’s Summer Food Service Program, as efforts are ramping up to ensure that all eligible children have access to healthy meals this summer. In Ohio, over 630,000 children receive free or reduced-price school meals (based on family income) through the National School Lunch Program during the school year. Yet, only about 60,000—less than one in ten--participate in the Summer Food Service Program. This means that well over half a million children across the state may be at risk of food insecurity or hunger during the summer months, when they no longer have access to meals at school.

"Deputy Under Secretary, Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 19,  A students’ favorite: stir-fried ginger chicken with locally grown kale. The things that make our country so great and special can be found in the diversity of the people, their ideas, and their culture. One of the ways culture is expressed is through the foods we eat. Our nation’s school meals should be no exception. More than 30 million children receive at least one nutritious meal every school day through the USDA’s National School Lunch and School Breakfast programs. My commitment is to make sure these children have access to healthy, nutritious meals while they learn. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) has helped raise the nutritional value of the foods our children eat with meal standards that promote health during the years most critical for growing kids. The meal standards have been developed to not only offer healthy meal options, but to allow schools the flexibility to prepare meals that are familiar to kids from culturally diverse backgrounds. Recently, I learned of several examples of this while participating in one of the Team Up for School Nutrition Success workshops that USDA provides to assist school food authorities. The goal of this training is to help schools find simple ways to meet the updated meal standards while increasing the number of children enjoying healthy and flavorful school meals. It’s no secret that children and adolescents can be finicky eaters, but there are creative ways school nutrition professionals can prepare meals to be tastier and more appealing for this tough audience. For instance, I learned that in Puerto Rico it is common for children to eat arroz con habichuelas y carne de cerdo (rice and beans with pork). Schools are finding ways to prepare this same meal in a healthy way that satisfies the palates of children who are used to eating it at home. High school students enjoy their locally sourced chicken tacos. In the same way, school children in the Southwest region of the United States enjoy burritos and refried beans that are similar to what they might have at home. In West Virginia, schools have found ways to offer healthy versions of Southern-style cooking like sausage gravy and a long-time favorite in the state—the pepperoni roll. Our goal at USDA is to ensure children have access to nutritious food that nourishes their growing bodies—all while embracing diverse cultural customs and cuisines. I’m confident that through cultural inclusion and nutritious choices, schools across America will pave the way for a healthier next generation.

"U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Initiatives  Jun 06,  Forest Service employee, Michaela Hall, rafting on the Middle Fork of the Flathead River adjacent to Glacier National Park in Montana. In an era of social media mania, forests around the country are opening their doors to reacquaint kids and parents with good old fashion family fun—without the aid of modern technology. On Saturday, June 11, the U.S. Forest Service invites families to join thousands of forest explorers for a free, fun-packed day of outdoor adventures in celebration of National Get Outdoors Day. The event also known as “GO Day” is celebrating its ninth anniversary of inspiring national and local organizations to come together to promote the social, economic and environmental benefits of outdoor recreation. Dozens of events on national forests and grasslands will feature opportunities including camping, rock wall climbing, kayaking, biking and archery. Nationwide, more than 100 locations will provide free recreational and educational activities. Some events are specifically designed to better engage urban and multicultural youth in nature-based activities and attract first-time visitors to public lands. In the spirit of GO Day, fees are waived generally for day-use areas, such as picnic grounds, developed trailheads and destination visitor centers. Concessionaire-operated sites may be included in the waiver if the permit holder wishes to participate. Contact your local national forest or grassland to learn if your destination requires a fee or if that fee is waived. National forests provide tremendous settings for spending a day or two in the great outdoors. These public lands provide more than 158,000 miles of recreational trails, wild and scenic rivers, lakes and streams, thousands of campgrounds and day-use sites, and educational opportunities at Forest Service visitor centers. These lands also add more than $13 billion in benefits to local economies. June is Great Outdoors Month, and U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell of the Forest Service invites all Americans to join the Forest Service and its many partner organizations in getting out and exploring all types of recreational activities throughout the month. GO Day is proud to support the First Lady’s Let's Move Outside campaign to eliminate childhood obesity within one generation.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Wisconsin in  Conservation  Oct 15,  Reed Fitton has enhanced honey bee habitat on the pastures he manages near Gays Mills, Wisconsin. Reed Fitton grazes cattle on the same hilltop farm where the late conservationist Ben Logan grew up and later featured in his memoir, “The Land Remembers.” Fitton carefully manages the farm near Gays Mills, Wisconsin with a broad conservation ethic, preventing soil erosion and protecting waterways. He has also transformed the Ben Logan’s “Seldom Seen Farm” into an oasis for honey bees and other pollinators. When USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) launched a new coordinated effort to improve honey bee habitat in , Fitton was one of the first to participate. He works closely with NRCS to make improvements to the land that provide better forage for his cattle, improve existing hayfields and convert former corn fields into healthy pasture. Fitton knows June to September is a critical time for bees to forage and store food for winter. This is especially true in Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin, which together are home to about ates. To attract honey bees and other pollinators, an area must have adequate sources of food, shelter and nesting sites. A variety of wildflowers and grasses – like the ones in Fitton’s pastures – provide pollinators with food. Protecting clover blossoms enhances pollinator habitat and cattle, so Fitton prevents his livestock from grazing the plants below four inches in height. “I’ve found letting the pasture go a little longer has been helpful for the pollinators and minimizes bloat in my herd because the lush clover has time to ripen up,” Fitton said. “Leaving the plants growing higher than the minimum really seemed to help in reference to the number of pollinators I see around.” And what he’s doing works. “Due to my conservation efforts and through technical and financial assistance provided by NRCS, I’ve seen more pollinators this year than I ever have before.” Fitton and his partner, Amanda Rubasch, have six active beehives. “Our beehives look healthy, I’ve got more bees and pollinators around, and honey production is up. There are bees all over the place now, which is rewarding to see,” Fitton said. Karyl Fritsche, NRCS District Conservationist, worked with Fitton to develop and implement a conservation plan and plant seed mixes to help him reach his goals. “Reed has been very proactive both in communicating his long-term goals and taking into consideration the effects on the ecosystem around him. That made integrating the prescribed grazing a great fit for this pollinator effort,” Fritsche said. Fritsche said she hopes more private landowners like Fitton, take advantage of technical and financial assistance available from NRCS. This year, the agency is making available $4 million to landowners in Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin to make bee-friendly conservation improvements to their land, such as planting cover crops, wildflowers or native grasses and improving management of grazing lands. Landowners interested in participating should contact their local USDA service center to learn more. Learn more about NRCS’ efforts to help honey bees and other pollinators.

"New England Statistician, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Conservation  Sep 25,  It may be The Granite State, but apple trees find room to grow in New Hampshire. Check back next week as we look at another state and the results of the Census of Agriculture. The Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture. Agriculture is probably not the first thing that pops into your head when you think of New Hampshire. As the Census of Agriculture results show, however, farming is a major component of our state’s economy. In , our farmers sold nearly $200 million worth of agricultural products. Milk production has been one of New Hampshire’s leading agricultural products for decades. In , our milk cows produced more than 3 million gallons of milk, which was worth nearly $55 million. Recently, egg production has been increasing. There were also more than 320,000 chickens in New Hampshire in . As a result, New Hampshire had nearly $13.5 million of poultry and egg sales in . Since we have cooler winters than many other parts of the country, many New Hampshire growers use greenhouses to raise vegetables, flowers, and other plants. Greenhouse sales alone reached almost $2.4 million in . In fact, nursery, greenhouse, and sod production is one of our leading sectors of agriculture, with nearly $50 million in sales. Our key fruit crop is apples. In , New Hampshire farmers harvested more than 24.5 million pounds of apples. That’s more than $6 million worth of apples! And while our state may not have the most farmland in the United States, we have nearly 4,000 acres dedicated to vegetable production, so our residents can get those important vitamins. To top it off, our maple syrup production continue to grow. In , our farmers produced more than 82,574 gallons of syrup, worth almost $3.6 million. New Hampshire leads the nation in the percent of farms selling products directly to the public for human consumption at 10.6 percent. These direct sales make up more than 30 percent of total agricultural sales. This includes the 4.9 percent of all farms selling through community supported agriculture arrangements (CSAs). Also, 13.7 percent of our farms sold wholesale directly to retailers such as grocery stores, restaurants, schools, and other institutions-the 5th highest in the nation. While these are all important aspects of our state’s agriculture, what is especially of note is that we continued to buck the national trend of decreasing farm numbers. While the number of farms around the country dropped by 4 percent since the last census, our farm numbers grew 5 percent since . Our farmland acreage also grew by 4 percent since the Census of Agriculture. This increase continues the increase that emerged in New Hampshire in the census. Together, these statistics show that agriculture has a major presence in our state. It has been so exciting to see the results of the Census that I’m already looking forward to Census of Agriculture to see if we continue growing this crucial sector.

The values the President spoke of in his address are shared by many across rural America. Our farmers, ranchers, rural businesses and families are committed to the value of hard work.  They agree that we owe today’s young people the opportunity to get ahead. They know that we must continue working to alleviate rural poverty to build up the middle class across our nation. The President’s first priority is to make America a magnet for jobs – and when it comes to job creation, there’s no place like rural America. Our farmers and ranchers support one in 12 American jobs today, with unlimited potential in the years ahead as we grow and export more. Exports of quality U.S. agricultural products already support more than a million jobs here at home, and USDA will continue working with the President to open new markets for U.S. agriculture in Europe, Asia and around the world. Homegrown energy already supports hundreds of thousands of rural jobs. We’ll need rural America to lead the way in meeting the President’s goal to further cut reliance on foreign oil, while doubling renewable energy production in America once again. President Obama has proposed a new “Energy Security Trust” that will enable additional research of advanced technologies, including homegrown biofuels, to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The manufacturing jobs of the future aren’t just in our cities.  Rural companies are leading the way to produce thousands of amazing new biobased products.  There is unlimited opportunity for rural America to produce even more of these products from homegrown sources, creating millions of jobs in the process. And if we are to undertake a unified effort to rebuild the nation’s aging infrastructure, which President Obama proposed this week, we’ll need folks across rural America to help get the job done. All of us are blessed to call this nation home, and President Obama knows that together we can achieve even more.  Rural America can lead the way, making sure that America leads the world in job creation, while building up new ladders of opportunity for the next generation.

"US Forest Service Assists with Fire Monitoring in Zambia  Managing wildland fire is pretty much the same anywhere in the world. You need to think carefully about when and where to apply it and how to starve the fire of fuel in places you don’t want it. There are several ways to do it—but you need to know how. As a U.S. Forest Service fire applications specialist, managing wildfire, monitoring ecosystem response and teaching others how to do so has been Tonja Opperman’s job for years.

"Deputy Director of Capacity Building and Development, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Aug 13,   The Waters family farm in Orrick, Mo. had a few unusual guests last week when dozens of African ministers came to learn about their corn, soybean and wheat farm. To embrace the 9th African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Forum’s theme, “New Strategies for a Changing World,” the organizers made some innovative changes, splitting the forum between Washington DC and Kansas City, Mo. Why Kansas City? As a major agricultural hub, Kansas City was ideal for bringing American and African agribusinesses and investors together. It also took the forum beyond policy discussions and into the field, literally. It was the perfect place to demonstrate the close relationship between American farmers and “the people’s department,” as USDA was originally named by Abraham Lincoln. Tom and Karla Waters explained how they plant, harvest, store, and sell crops in their seventh generation farm operation. USDA Farm Service Agency’s county director and an extension agent discussed how the Department supports smallholder farmers and large scale operations such as the Waters’ 5,000 acres through research and training at land-grant universities, and marketing and credit programs. In the Foreign Agricultural Service, I oversee capacity building and development programs, many in Africa. I talked about how our technical assistance programs help give farmers in Africa the same knowledge and tools available to farmers in the United States, through partnerships and coordination with farm groups, governments, and other public and private organizations. The ministers and delegates asked questions about purchasing seeds, planting cycles, irrigation, value-added end products, how prices are determined, and how to make a profit. On the policy side, they gained valuable insight about the Farm Service Agency’s network of service centers where farm loan managers, rural development officers, and extension agents serve the agricultural needs of communities throughout the United States. By seeing the producer-government relationship in action at the farm, I hope the ministers and delegates will take some new ideas and practices to use back home.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .17  Contact: USDA Press Phone: 720- Email: press@oc.usda.gov  WASHINGTON, June 12, – The U.S. Department of Agriculture today announced the projects selected to receive the USDA’s annual farm to school grants designed to increase the amount of local foods served in schools. Sixty-five projects were chosen nationwide. “Increasing the amount of local foods in America’s schools is a win-win for everyone,” said Cindy Long, Deputy Administrator for Child Nutrition Programs at USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service, which administers the Department’s school meals programs. “Farm to school projects foster healthy eating habits among America’s school-age children, and local economies are nourished, as well, when schools buy the food they provide from local producers.” According to the USDA Farm to School Census, schools with strong farm to school programs report higher school meal participation, reduced food waste, and increased willingness of the students to try new foods, such as fruits and vegetables. In addition, in school year - alone, schools purchased more than $789 million in local food from farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and food processors and manufacturers. Nearly half of these districts plan to purchase even more local foods in future school years. Grants range from $14,500 to $100,000, awarding a total of $5 million to schools, state agencies, tribal groups, and nonprofit organizations for farm to school planning, implementation, or training. Projects selected are located in urban, suburban and rural areas in 42 states and Puerto Rico, and they are estimated to serve more than 5,500 schools and 2 million students. This money will support a wide range of activities from training, planning, and developing partnerships to creating new menu items, establishing supply chains for local foods, offering taste tests to children, buying equipment, planting school gardens and organizing field trips to agricultural operations, Long said. State and local agency interest and engagement in community food systems is growing. Having received 44 applications from state or local agencies, 17 state agencies will receive funding. Grantees include the Nebraska Department of Education, which will refine and expand the “Nebraska Thursdays” program, which will focus on increasing locally sourced meals throughout Nebraska schools, and the Virginia Department of Education, which will focus on network building to ensure stakeholders from all different sectors are leveraged. Both the South Dakota Department of Education and the Arkansas Agriculture Department will use training grants to build capacity and knowledge about the relationship between Community Food Systems and Child Nutrition Programs. More information on individual projects can be found on the USDA Office of Community Food Systems’ website at www.fns.usda.gov/cfs/grant-awards. USDA's Food and Nutrition Service administers 15 nutrition assistance programs that include the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and the Summer Food Service Program.

"Arizona State Director, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Nov 07,  Hualapai Bird Dancers perform at the ribbon cutting ceremony for the Diamond Bar Road. (USDA Photo) There were many things to celebrate about the newly paved nine-mile stretch of the Diamond Bar Road in Western Arizona, a road that links state and county roads to Grand Canyon West on the Hualapai Reservation. At the ribbon cutting celebration for the completed road, Tribal, state and federal officials all noted the obvious benefit of the paving: The trip for the thousands of visitors every year to Grand Canyon West would be smoother and faster. Hualapai Tribal member Rory Majenty, who emceed the road celebration, pointed out another benefit for tribal members, “We probably won’t have to buy a new truck every few years like we used to have to do because of the rough road!” Tribal members weren’t the only ones dogged by the undulating washboard road. Visitors and tour buses were plagued by flat tires, bent oil pans and hubcaps that flew off into the desert. The Hualapai Tribe operates the popular Grand Canyon Skywalk over Grand Canyon West. The glass platform juts out in a horseshoe 70 feet over the canyon and is an attraction that draws over 700,000 visitors from around the world annually. The paving of Diamond Bar Road had been a dream of the tribe for many years. As the Tribe began to develop Grand Canyon West into a captivating tourist destination, they realized that the many visitors would need a more comfortable ride to the destination. USDA Rural Development and the Hualapai Tribe have had a long and productive relationship. In , USDA RD funded a water system to serve tribal members who were living and working at the developing Grand Canyon West. The $13 million loan/grant combination through our Water & Environmental Program allowed the Tribe to use other resources to begin the costly work of reconstructing and paving the Diamond Bar Road—a primary goal of the Tribe’s long term community economic development plan. The Tribe invested over $35 million to pave just the final nine-miles of the roadway. The Hualapai depend on tourism, ranching, and arts/crafts to fund their economy, and Grand Canyon West is a compelling alternative for folks with limited time who wish to visit the Grand Canyon, a trip made easier thanks to the recently completed road paving.

"Office of Communication, USDA Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 15,  The Forest Service is partnering with private investors Athens County, and local communities to construct an 88-mile-long multiuse trail across 9,000 acres of Wayne National Forest, shown here. (Photo by Jerry Jay Johnson) Ringed by miles of abandoned coal mines, the Wayne National Forest is surrounded by some of the most economically distressed communities in southern Ohio. A unique partnership with private investors, local leaders, a university, and nonprofit partners is helping to change that. The Forest Service is working with the National Forest Foundation and Quantified Ventures to explore how an innovative finance mechanism can support an 88-mile multiuse trail on 9,000 acres of national forest land in Athens County. Dubbed the Baileys Trail System, the project will serve as a case study for the Forest Service to assess the potential for funding deferred maintenance and new infrastructure projects by linking funding to measurable accomplishments through a system called Pay for Success. With this funding system investors provide up-front capital for work to be done, with repayment tied to the successful achievement of agreed-upon outcomes. The Baileys Trail System was selected to pilot this model by the Forest Service, National Forest Foundation, and Quantified Ventures through a competitive process. Seth Brown from Quantified Ventures said that the Wayne National Forest was selected based upon the size and type of project, its potential impact, and progress in the planning process. “We could not have selected a better pilot site,” he said. “The level of community support, the passion of the team, the relationship with Ohio University, the indomitable spirit of the Appalachian communities, and the phenomenal leadership of the Wayne National Forest staff have been key drivers in the project’s success so far.” Connecting adjacent state and community trails, the Baileys Trail System could become the premier mountain biking destination east of the Mississippi. (Photo by Jared M. Dort/Wayne National Forest) Connecting adjacent state and community trails, the Baileys Trail System is within driving distance of about 15 percent of the US population. It is expected to become a premier mountain biking destination east of the Mississippi – an evolution that will enable Athens County to diversify the regional economy through outdoor recreation and tourism. According to Dawn McCarthy, partnership and community engagement coordinator on the Wayne National Forest, the trail is expected to attract users who will be eager to explore other aspects of nearby communities, including shops and restaurants. Research and market analysis conducted by Quantified Ventures determined that the Baileys Trail System will draw more than 181,000 visitors per year. In 10 years, these visitors will result in $6.9 million in higher wages, $7.3 million in increased tax revenue, and $20.1 million in increased spending. Pay for Success can unlock the upfront investment capital to build the trail system, estimated to be $5.4 million. Beneficiaries of increases in visitation such as local cities, counties, and villages can repay the investment based on the successful achievement of the economic outcomes produced from the influx of new visitors. Research partners such as local Ohio University will evaluate and validate the outcomes to ensure transparency around , government spending, and National Forest and recreational infrastructure usage. “One of the greatest challenges for our region is to improve the health and economic wellbeing of the residents of our communities,” said Athens City Council member Peter Kotses. “With this project, we are utilizing the resources of the national forest to elevate these points in the right direction.” The Baileys Trail System is expected to attract more than 181,000 visitors per year – a potential boon to local communities like Athens, Ohio, shown here.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Dec 13,  Taylor Dale picks fresh cherry tomatoes grown in a hoop house to sell in the local farmer’s market in Santa Fe, N.M. USDA photo. Every single student in Santa Fe County Schools in New Mexico received a juicy, locally-grown organic peach for lunch on the first day of school last year from Freshies Farm. On only a little more than three acres of land, Christopher Bassett and Taylor Dale were able to grow the peaches for the schools and still find time to support two young children of their own. For this young couple, their land and the food they grow is their life. After working on farms for 10 years in everywhere from California to Colorado, Bassett and Dale finally bought their own. They settled at Freshies Farm, a slice of a larger orchard near Velarde, N.M. near the Rio Grande. When they arrived, the land was tightly packed with blackberry vines and peach and apple trees. But Bassett and Dale wanted to grow more than just fruit. They worked to clear just enough space to start growing other foods – tomatoes, cucumbers, asparagus, basil and oyster mushrooms. In their five years on Freshies Farm, they have dedicated themselves to understanding how temperature, water and the health of the micro-organisms in the soil play a critical role in creating flavor. They wait until their produce is perfectly ripe before handpicking it and selling it to the Santa Fe Farmer’s Market and in local restaurants. “When I was training to be a chef, I realized that the flavor is really coming from the field,” Bassett said. “Everything you’re growing is a product of the soil, the sun and the micro-organisms.” And their focus on flavor is apparent—their cherry tomatoes and blackberries have a taste as rich as their color. In their quest for flavor, Thomas Gonzales, district conservationist from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service has been at their side from the beginning. Gonzales worked with Bassett and Dale using financial and technical assistance from NRCS to help diversify Freshies Farm and install a hoop house on their property in order to help grow tomatoes and other vegetables during cooler seasons to sell in local markets. A hoop house, also called a seasonal high tunnel, acts like a greenhouse to help grow crops earlier in the spring and later into the fall without fear of frost. With their hoop house and a separate mushroom growing operation, Bassett and Dale are now able to stay in business even in years where an early frost drastically cut their fruit production. Bassett and Dale have also worked with Gonzales to put in other conservation measures that have helped them remain a growing and profitable farm including using native grasses to cover their orchard and increasing habitat for their orchard’s pollinators. Two USDA strategic efforts helped make this conservation work possible. USDA’s StrikeForce for Rural Growth and Opportunity initiative addresses high-priority funding needs in rural communities in 16 states, including New Mexico. The Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative coordinates USDA’s efforts to support local and regional food systems. “We hope that younger farmers will connect with the older generations to learn from them and keep these lands in agriculture when they’re gone,” Bassett said. “We really enjoy farming and having that connection with our customers. Every day, we get to live in a little strip of paradise.” Fruit trees on Freshies Farm. USDA photo.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .15  Contact:USDA Office of Communications 720-  LINCOLN, Neb., Sept. 17, - This week, following the recent announcement of $2 million in Conservation Innovation Grants to support water quality trading markets, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hosted a joint workshop to expand markets for water quality benefits generated on farms, ranches and forest lands.Water quality trading is an innovative approach to reduce pollution and efficiently achieve water quality goals. Trading is based on the fact that sources in a watershed can face very different costs to control the same pollutant. Trading programs allow facilities facing higher pollution control costs to meet their regulatory obligations by purchasing environmentally equivalent (or superior) pollution reductions from another source at lower cost, thus achieving the same water quality improvement at lower overall cost.USDA and EPA signed a partnership agreement in to advance water quality trading and other market-based approaches that provide benefits to the environment and economy. The workshop attracted over 200 participants involved in water quality trading from across the nation.""Conservation practices that improve soil health and conserve nutrients also produce real water quality benefits. With support from USDA and our Federal partners, water quality markets can create incentives to increase these environmental benefits and boost investment in rural America. The actions we are announcing today will help us get there,"" said Ann Mills, USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment.Among the new water quality trading resources announced:EPA-USDA Water Quality Trading Roadmap The Water Quality Trading Roadmap is a decision support tool for those designing and participating in water quality trading programs. The Roadmap is a searchable database that consolidates policy guidance from EPA, information from State programs, and examples and supporting materials from across the U.S.EPA-USDA partnership on EnviroAtlas to support environmental markets USDA and EPA will incorporate environmental markets layers into the Federal ecosystem service decision support tool, EnviroAtlas. The layers will show where markets for water, carbon, wetlands, and habitats occur on the U.S. landscape, provide information about these markets, and allow this information to be displayed in the context of existing environmental from Federal agencies.Nutrient Tracking Tool (NTT) USDA will release this fall the next version of NTT, ready for use in the Pacific Northwest and Ohio River Basin. The new version of NTT is a USDA hosted, user-friendly, web-based tool that calculates edge of field nutrient and sediment loads for use in conservation planning and environmental market credit calculation. NTT will be made available in additional regions in .USDA Environmental Markets Website USDA released the Department-level environmental markets website. The site integrates information, tools and resources on environmental markets from across the Department, allowing users to easily gain a snapshot of environmental market activities at USDA.These new resources were announced days after the Natural Resources Conservation Service awarded over $2 million in Conservation Innovation Grants to support water quality trading markets.

"Tongass National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Mar 07,  Mount Edgecumbe volcano is on Kruzof Island in Southeast Alaska, just west of Sitka. The Mount Edgecumbe Volcanic Field consists of more than a dozen volcanic vents and domes. The field first erupted more than 600,000 years ago, and volcanic activity continued until 5,000 to 6,000 years ago. (U.S. Forest Service/Jim Baichtal) Seldom does one find a way to directly date a prehistoric volcanic eruption, but 11-year-old Blake LaPerriere opened such a door for excited scientists in Southeast Alaska. Last September, Blake, his parents, and his younger brothers were exploring a beach on southwestern Kruzof Island, part of the Tongass National Forest landscape and just west of Sitka, Alaska, where they live. Blake investigated a deeply incised creek behind a pile of beach drift where he found a standing burnt tree embedded in a tall bank of pumice. He brought it to his family’s attention, asking “Do you think that’s from a volcanic eruption a long time ago?” Curious, Blake’s father Zach took photos and sent them my way. As the forest’s geologist, it didn’t take me long to respond. Thanks to good weather, I was able to travel by boat to meet the family at the site the next weekend. Accompanied by Kitty LaBounty, assistant professor of natural sciences at University of Alaska Southeast, Deidra LaBounty, a geology student volunteer, and Jay Kinsman, a Forest Service geologist, we examined the site. We carefully documented what we found, sending samples of the wood from the embedded tree to a lab for radiocarbon dating and to the University of Oregon for identification. First, we learned that the tree was indeed ancient – dating back 13,180 years. Then, Jamie Dexter from the University of Oregon confirmed the tree as Picea sitchensis, or Sitka spruce, making this one of the oldest records of Sitka spruce in Southeastern Alaska. After I gave Blake the news on the age and identification of his find, I explained how the tree came to be there. Southern Kruzof Island consists of more than a dozen volcanic vents and domes referred to as the Mount Edgecumbe Volcanic Field. Mount Edgecumbe dominates the landscape rising to more than 3,200 feet.  Its symmetric cone and crater create a striking image. The field first erupted approximately 600,000 years ago, with volcanic activity continuing until 5,000 to 6,000 years ago. U.S. Forest Service geologist Jim Baichtal congratulates 11-year-old Blake LaPerriere for his discovery Sept. 9, , of an ancient Sitka spruce tree buried by an eruption from Mount Edgecumbe volcano about 13,200 years ago. (Courtesy of Zach LaPerriere) About 13,180 years ago, a violent eruption on Crater Ridge just north of Mount Edgecumbe resulted in deep deposits of rhyolitic airfall, what we know as pumice and ash, and pyroclastic flows or fluidized rock fragments and hot gases. These fast moving flows swept down from the saddle between Crater Ridge and Mount Edgecumbe, rapidly burying the forest and vegetation on the lower slopes. Blake had discovered one of these trees. Knowing the tree’s age helps scientists establish the age of the simultaneous eruptions which spread ash across much of Southeast Alaska. Interestingly, at the time of the eruption that encased the Kruzof tree, global sea levels were about 174 feet lower than today. The lands west of Sitka were a coastal plane with fresh water lakes. The Kruzof tree is a record of an established forest in what was likely a refugium – a place where plants and animals persisted during the last ice age. This preserved relic gives us a small snapshot into the timing and extent of glaciation, the prehistoric climate, and the possibility of refugia where other plant and animals persisted and early migrants to North America may have passed. About 250 years after the eruption that trapped the tree, rising sea levels inundated the coastal plane and fresh water lakes creating Sitka Sound. My plan is to return to the area in the future to see if other trees emerge as waves erode the bank. I’ll be looking for evidence of the soil and vegetation, which must be buried beneath the pumice flow. Read more on the area’s geologic history and the Alaska Volcano Observatory at these links.

"Under Secretary for Rural Development in  Rural  Feb 24,  Under Secretary for Rural Development Lisa Mensah stands at the head of the historical trail where marchers began their trek across the Edmund Pettus bridge enroute to Montgomery, Alabama seeking voting rights for African-Americans. On my first trip as the Under Secretary for Rural Development, I visited Alabama and Mississippi. It seemed fitting for me to begin my trip in Selma, Alabama given the historical significance of the location. The march from Selma, led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., embodied our most human desires: to be treated fairly, to be heard, to be treated with decency-to not be denied access and opportunities due to the color of our skin, our gender identity, our gender expression or our political identity. I was raised in Oregon by my father, an immigrant from Ghana and my mother, an Iowa farm girl. Standing there in Selma, the sacrifices made by those before me came into focus. As an African-American woman, I'm now very honored to be at an agency that plays an important role in bringing new investments to rural America. Here at USDA, we play a role in rebuilding communities when we provide help to a first-time homebuyer, or provide safe and sanitary housing for a renter. When a revolving loan fund helps expand a business and bring new jobs to town, or critical water and wastewater systems are installed, or high-speed internet connection comes online to a remote community. This is how we build on a continued pursuit of equality-striving for inclusion of all Americans. I was heartened to have a tour of the Southern Classic Food Group, a condiment manufacturer in Brundidge, Alabama that is expanding their business and their market share with support from Rural Development. The Economic Development Center in Pike County, Alabama works in partnership with us to invest in local small businesses and create jobs. In Winona, Mississippi I announced our investment of $600,000 to seed a revolving loan fund for north central Mississippi small businesses, and I learned about a mental health center in Greenwood, Mississippi funded by our Community Facilities program that is touching thousands of lives every year. Improvements that strengthen and enhance the quality of life in rural communities often subject to great poverty. As I stood on the edge of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, I was struck by the fear and bravery it took for those marchers to cross it on that day in . Though our nation is faced with challenges of the past and more subtle discrimination today, those who marched over the bridge made it possible for us to be the bridge-to rebuild trust and to challenge practices of exclusivity that have limited the extent to which we serve communities across our nation. Now, fifty years later, I know that we stand on the shoulders of giants who came before us as we work to develop and sustain our rural communities.

"South Dakota Rural Development Coordinator in  USDA Results  Rural  Aug 01,   South Dakota has been awarded two regional training opportunities through the Stronger Economies Together (SET) initiative.  USDA Rural Development (USDA RD), the nation’s four Regional Rural Development Centers and South Dakota State University Extension are collaborating for this initiative. “While USDA RD staff directly impact communities with housing services and integral community infrastructure, the SET process is going to be one more way for communities to strive for economic vitality, improved quality of life, and sustainability,” said USDA RD South Dakota State Director Elsie Meeks, “In the end, everyone works together so that rural communities can address a broad range of other needs such as regional based planning and leadership development.” South Dakota is currently the only upper Midwestern state that is part of the SET Process.  The two South Dakota regions comprised of nine counties total are separated geographically and by different challenges and opportunities.  The region located in the western part of the state has an estimated total population of fewer than 7,000, 20.4 percent of persons below poverty and have an average of one person per square mile.  It is home in part to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and Badlands National Park. The easterly located region has a total population of 38,154, a negative 5.15 percent change in population and 12.73 percent of persons below poverty.  This region is largely agriculturally based with manufacturing to include a state-of-the-art, poultry harvesting and processing business; Dakota Provisions. The two regions were part of an application process in May of this year and were self-designated.  Each regional team will develop a vision and goals, examine regional demographics, opportunities, assets and barriers, and create a regional economic development plan.  The program stresses continued local involvement and decision making, which is supported by partnerships among state-wide and area resource providers and economic development experts. Regional planning is not something new to South Dakota but through the focused process of SET, supported by regionally based and nurtured by dedicated Rural Development, Extension and resource providers; South Dakota looks forward to a plan for the future.

"Deputy Undersecretary for the USDA Food Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 22,   Feeding students healthy, tasty and nutritious school meals can be a challenge.  Just ask any one of the thousands of school nutrition professionals who carry out the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program.  They have to balance menu planning following nutrition standards, financial management, and inventory management, all while making meals that will be enjoyed by students – not always an easy audience.  It is a testament to their dedication that over 90 percent of America’s schools have now implemented the improved standards found in the Healthy Hungry Free Kids Act of . USDA is working hard to find ways to continue to support their efforts. One way we are doing that is a new program that we recently piloted in Mississippi that provides free training through a partnership with the National Food Service Management Institute (NFSMI). The Team Up For School Nutrition Success Training (Team Up) is tailored to schools and covers topics like menu planning, financial management, procurement, meal presentation and appeal, as well as youth engagement tactics, and strategies to reduce plate waste.   Another partner in this initiative is First Lady Michelle Obama. Mrs. Obama is grateful for the hard work being done in our country’s school cafeterias, but also recognizes that some may need a little help. When she heard about our initiative, she took the time to make a video to not only thank and encourage the dedicated school food service professional around the country, but to encourage them to take advantage of Team Up. Hear with the First Lady had to say about Team Up:  The name Team Up really says it all. This unique learning experience provides not only professional training and resources, but peer-to-peer mentoring. Schools have the opportunity to learn from each other, in order to make positive strides toward providing healthy school environments with financial stability and strong student participation. It isn’t a one-off experience. The peer-to-peer mentoring will continue after trainees return to their districts, and NFSMI will conduct 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups to gauge the success of the plans the schools developed after the training.  If additional training is needed, NFSMI will recommend options based on the schools progress.  The state agencies and USDA Food and Nutrition Services will also provide support and feedback.  I couldn’t be more pleased with what I have heard about the how the first training class went, which was attended by 53 participants and 27 mentors. Participants told us that it was helpful to have a chance to discuss their individual challenges, as well as those that participants had in common. They said that hearing their colleagues and mentors talk about how they have handled some of these challenges in their schools was especially helpful.  Some participants even said that it was the best training they had ever attended!  The Kentucky Department of Education staff was so inspired that they created a video to say what a great experience they had. We look forward to continuing our relationship with the White House and all the trainees. Together we can ensure that America’s students are getting and eating the healthiest food possible during the school day.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA APHIS in  Animals  Plants  Oct 28,  Visitors explore the APHIS booth at the National FFA Convention The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and several other U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agencies had staff at the National FFA Convention in Indianapolis last week to share agricultural information with 50,000 enthusiastic FFA members, aged 12-21, and their families. The energy and excitement generated by members of the nation’s largest youth organization were especially palpable at the convention’s Agricultural Career Show, where FFA members were barraged with agriculturally themed games, information and giveaways from companies and government agencies alike. (“Alpaca nation” t-shirts and free Wisconsin cheese were among my personal favorites). FFA members made time to stop by the USDA booths to learn about issues affecting their home states.  Maryland FFA members asked about the brown marmorated stink bug, while Iowa members gathered information about USDA renewable energy initiatives.  Information about invasive species went quickly and APHIS distributed more than 500 teacher information packets. APHIS' FFA participation helps us to reach key stakeholders and to inspire young people to careers in public service and agriculture.

"RD, Nutritionist, USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 09,  Welcome to Week 2 of the ! The MyPlate Team welcomes you to Week 2 of our 5-week New Year’s Challenge! Last week we focused on the Dairy Food Group and physical activity. This week we’re adding another food group to the mix… fruit! So, what foods are in the Fruit Group? This food group includes all fruits and 100% fruit juices. Focus on whole fruits—fresh, canned, frozen, or dried—more often for added dietary fiber. In addition to fiber, fruits contain many essential nutrients that are typically under consumed, including potassium, vitamin C, and folate (folic acid). Healthy ways to add fruit to your day: When choosing canned fruits, select fruit canned in 100% fruit juice or water rather than syrup. For a boost of vitamin C, add winter citrus fruits, like lemons, limes, oranges, and grapefruits to recipes or enjoy on their own. Try main dishes that incorporate fruit, such as fish with pears or chicken salad with apple. This week we want you to focus on Fruit by starting with small changes at breakfast. You don’t need to overall your entire meal, just think about small adjustments you can make to include more fruit. Some options include: Top cereal with bananas or raisins, or mix fruit into low-fat yogurt. Add frozen berries to pancakes or oatmeal. Whip up a batch of fruit smoothies and freeze in ice cube trays. During the week, pop out the cubes for a quick on-the-go breakfast.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Nov 06,  Only the dock remains from a Bay Point, New Jersey residence after Hurricane Sandy hit. About two years ago, Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc on several states in the Northeast, causing $68 billion dollars’ worth of damage to critical infrastructure, businesses, homes and landscapes. Since , multiple agencies, including the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), have remained committed to helping the region build back stronger and better prepared for future storms. To help the victims recover from Sandy and prevent future devastation in vulnerable flood areas, NRCS has invested about $120 million in Emergency Watershed Floodplain Easement Program, a program that helps restore and protect lands vulnerable to flooding. “This program will ensure long-term stability and help relieve the stress these landowners have been enduring for more than two years now,” said Andrew James, the program’s manager. The easement program complements traditional disaster recovery funding and allows NRCS to purchase a permanent easement on lands within floodplains that sustained damage from Sandy. Through the program, easements were placed on more than 1,000 acres in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York. Restoration of floodplains improves the natural functions of the plain while establishing the flow of water back into the area. It protects properties downstream, and it enhances fish and wildlife habitat. It also improves water quality and ground water recharge.  Here are a few examples of how this easement program is working: West Haven, New Haven County, Connecticut: The neighborhoods near Beach Street were hit especially hard as homes were irreparably damaged and families had to be evacuated. NRCS will provide more than $7 million for the restoration and permanent protection of 31 properties, 15 funded through the first sign-up and 16 funded through the second sign-up. These properties cover 71 acres of vulnerable floodplain lands, including 11 acres of residential lots. Floodplain restoration and removal of structures will benefit both landowners and the surrounding community. Cumberland County, New Jersey: The Cumberland County application is the largest submitted to NRCS during the Hurricane Sandy recovery effort, consisting of more than 450 acres of marshy, flood prone property currently used to produce salt hay. The southern end of the area is adjacent to a large tract of state-owned open space land and the northern end is by a large NRCS wetlands easement. By linking these two properties together, the Cumberland County application serves to greatly increase the footprint of protected land in the area. This will allow for comprehensive restoration of the properties’ floodplain functions and values. Mastic/Shirley Area, Suffolk County, New York: Numerous small parcels of land, some with houses, located in this low-lying, 100-year floodplain on Long Island were severely impacted by Hurricane Sandy. NRCS’ investment of about $5.6 million on 45 acres will provide permanent protection and will provide a critical buffer to a densely developed residential area to the north of the enrolled lands. The Mastic/Shirley area is adjacent to the natural shoreline of the William Floyd Estate, a significant environmental area of 600 acres to the east owned by the U.S National Park Service and part of the Fire Island National Seashore. These easements will be complete in the coming months, providing places for floodwaters to go during times of heavy rains and other natural disasters like Sandy. “Just like we work with farmers to invest in the health of their soil, which will lead to bigger harvest down the road – this program enables us to work with landowners to help prevent damage from flooding in the future,” James said.

"Acting Deputy Under Secretary, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Aug 07,  Acting Deputy Under Secretary Vernita Dore (left) tours the wastewater facility under construction in Lower Kalskag, Alaska. Life is challenging in Lower Kalskag, Alaska. An isolated village only accessible by plane or boat, or an ice road in the winter, Lower Kalskag's 300 residents have no running water or toilets and pay four and five times the price for goods you and I take for granted. A third of the population lives below the poverty level and over half of the population lacks year-round employment. Located past the southwest end of the snow-capped Portage Mountains on an icy bend of the Kuskokwim River, I was fortunate enough to visit Lower Kalskag and see first-hand the critical role USDA Rural Development plays in our most remote communities. With assistance from our partner, the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, USDA Rural Development is providing investment through our Rural Alaska Village Grant program to construct water and wastewater treatment facilities, as well as connect the residents of Lower Kalskag to the system. By , this nearly century-old settlement will have indoor plumbing for the very first time. Prior to arriving in Lower Kalskag, I purchased fresh fruit to bring as a gift, since produce is a luxury that is prohibitively expensive for this community. We were welcomed with open arms to their community center where we were given a project update by the engineering staff, followed by a community meal. Opening with a beautifully sung Russian Orthodox prayer, we shared in a meal of sandwiches and fresh fruit, along with baked fish and beaver stew. It was delicious. I talked with Crim Evan, the Mayor of Lower Kalskag, who proudly proclaimed how much he was looking forward to banishing the 5-gallon buckets they'd been using for toilet facilities. The so-called 'honeybucket' will be a thing of the past once the facilities are finished, and Crim was genuinely grateful for our USDA Rural Development staff in Alaska who have worked so hard to finance this important project. Bridging the historical subsistence culture of this Yup'ik village with modern sanitation takes large steps toward providing the underpinnings of economic stability. This infrastructure improves the economic viability of the village and improves the health and sanitation for the villagers. Really, that's the gossamer thread that unifies Lower Kalskag with other rural communities we serve – in Alaska and across our great nation – the need for access to clean water, safe and sanitary housing, and economic stability that allows rural residents to remain in the communities of their birth if they so choose. Through USDA Rural Development, Lower Kalskag is providing for that need. Marcus Lake and his mother, Carrie, will have fresh running water and indoor plumbing for the first time once the project is complete.

"Tips on Sending Food Gifts to U.S. Military  Being home for the holidays will not be possible this year for many American armed forces. The next best thing may be receiving greetings and gifts of food items. Many foods are safe to mail. However, you must have the name and address of a military person stationed overseas. Because of security risks, the U.S. Postal Service will not deliver mail addressed to “Any Serviceman.” It’s important to mail food gifts that are not perishable, can tolerate a range of temperatures, and won’t break with rough handling. Food gifts that can be safely mailed include dried products such as jerky and fruits, shelf stable canned specialties, and regional condiments such as hot sauces.

"Chief Veterinary Officer for the United States of America in  Animals  Plants  Apr 25,   On April 24, USDA confirmed the nation’s 4th case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in an animal that was sampled for the disease at a rendering facility in central California.  This animal was never presented for slaughter for human consumption, so at no time presented a risk to the food and milk supply, or to human health in the United States. We have a longstanding system of interlocking safeguards against BSE that protects public and animal health in the United States.  The most important is the removal of specified risk materials – or the parts of an animal that would contain BSE should an animal have the disease – from all animals presented for slaughter in the United States. USDA inspectors at slaughter facilities also prevent cattle that are nonambulatory or are displaying signs of neurological disease or central nervous system disorders from entering the human food supply. A strong feed ban protects cattle from the disease.  In , the FDA implemented regulations that prohibit the feeding of most mammalian proteins to ruminants, including cattle.  This feed ban is the most important measure to prevent the transmission of BSE to cattle. Scientific evidence shows that the safeguards we and many countries around the world have in place against BSE are highly effective.  Last year, only 29 cases of BSE were detected worldwide.  This is a greater than 99 percent reduction in the number of cases since the height of the disease in . We found this particular case through our ongoing BSE surveillance program.  The surveillance program allows USDA to detect the disease if it exists at very low levels in the U.S. cattle population and provides assurances to consumers and our international trading partners that the interlocking system of safeguards in place to prevent BSE are working. We test for BSE at levels ten times greater than World Animal Health Organization standards.  We take samples from approximately 40,000 animals each year, focusing on groups where the disease is more likely to be found.  The targeted population for ongoing surveillance includes cattle exhibiting signs of central nervous disorders or signs associated with BSE, nonambulatory animals, and dead cattle. The samples come from locations like farms, veterinary diagnostic laboratories, public health laboratories, slaughter facilities, veterinary clinics, and livestock markets. In this case, the samples came from a rendering facility in California.  The samples were initially sent to the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory, then on to USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa for further testing.  USDA confirmed the animal was positive for atypical BSE, a very rare form of the disease not generally associated with an animal consuming infected feed.  We are reaching out to international laboratories with more experience with this atypical form of BSE to assist us with our investigation. Our investigation is ongoing.  But here are a few things that we do know for a fact.  It is perfectly safe to eat beef and drink milk without concern for BSE. The carcass of the animal is being held at a rendering facility in California and will be destroyed. It was never presented for processing for human consumption.  At no time did it present a risk to the food supply.  And scientific research indicates that BSE cannot be transmitted in cow’s milk, even if the milk comes from a cow with BSE.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that tests on milk from BSE- infected animals have not shown any BSE infectivity. Milk and milk products, are, therefore considered safe. As our investigation progresses and we learn more, we will provide updates.  You can visit our BSE information center at www.usda.gov/BSE to learn the latest and get more details about BSE in general.

"Program Manager, The People's Garden Initiative and USDA Farmers Market in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Initiatives  Mar 28,  Children get hands on experience in the garden at the exhibits during the White House Easter Egg Roll on the south lawn of the White House in Washington, DC on Monday Mar, 28, . USDA photo by Lance Cheung. Spring has sprung and April is National Garden Month! It’s time to pick up your trowel and get gardening. USDA launched the new People’s Garden website that provides tools and resources gardeners can use to start or expand a home, school or community garden. Unveiled during today’s annual Easter Egg Roll at the White House, here are just some of the new features: Those new to gardening can download community garden and school garden checklists created in partnership with Let’s Move or watch short videos about how-to raise tomato seedlings indoors or the benefits of installing a rain barrel. Growing your own food is a great way to build a healthier plate. USDA’s MyPlate recommends that everyone fill half their plate with fruits and vegetables. With the new People’s Garden database, gardeners can now itemize the amount and type of fruits and vegetables picked from their People’s Garden. Each product is automatically converted to cups using SuperTracker, which helps gardeners better understand how their yield will feed them and others. For the experienced gardeners who want to explore selling their produce, the new People’s Garden map connects them to nearby farmers markets and CSAs. And that’s not all. Another exciting addition is the Plant a Window Box for Pollinators online game that has been a big hit at the White House Easter Egg Roll, created in cooperation with the Pollinator Partnership. It’s a fun, interactive tool that shows you how planting native species can increase the quality and amount of food available to neighborhood bees and other pollinators. Check it out. Once you lay the groundwork and get growing, don’t forget to register your food, wildlife, conservation, beautification, education, or training garden with us as a People’s Garden.

"Acting South Dakota State Director, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Jan 22,  Little Wound School students hold round table discussions on their vision of the future. Tribal elder Cecilia Fire Thunder facilitated. Recently USDA Rural Development staff in South Dakota spent two days at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, home of the Oglala Sioux, where they met with Tribal leaders, educators and other Federal partners.  They made this trip as part of a broader administration effort to change the way the federal government works with communities. This approach values residents’ knowledge of their communities’ strengths and needs; it also includes local leaders as essential partners and collaborators. Jennifer Irving, Director of Regional Equity for Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation, a local non-profit intimately involved in one-such effort at Pine Ridge said, “It is important to coordinate engagement of the Promise Zone stakeholders to ensure that Tribal Leadership’s vision and priorities are being met while optimizing Tribal commitment of time and resources.” Pine Ridge was designated a Promise Zone last April and in July a Presidential Disaster Declaration was received following severe summer storms. Since then the federal government, the Oglala Sioux Tribal government, and local organizations, such as Thunder Valley and other key partners have been working collaboratively to ensure activities, investments, and projects of the many entities across the reservation have broad-based community support and coordinated, and likely to yield results for residents. Dr. Richard Zephier provided an overview of the CEDS process and long term vision to develop a stronger economy for Pine Ridge. Visiting Rural Development staff were given an overview of the wide array of work underway including the Tribe’s work on a proposed Tribal Planning Office and a Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) that will lay out a long term vision for developing a stronger economy for Pine Ridge.  Other topics covered included recovery efforts underway in partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recovery efforts and an overview of the work two local organizations, Mazaska and Lakota Funds, are doing to identify housing and other finance-related needs. At Oglala Lakota College we met with President Shortbull who talked about work underway to develop an Ag Expo Center that would be instrumental in making local food a path for economic development. The College has already raised a substantial amount toward the expected total project need. A representative from each of the round table break-out sessions provided the entire group a synopsis of the top issues that were drawn out of the round table discussion at their respective table. This project will create educational opportunities in the community by increasing training and hands on experience for producers of all types of agricultural production on Pine Ridge. It will expand their economic opportunities by providing a place where producers can work in a commercial kitchen or work with large animals in a modern facility. This project has broad public support and holds significant potential for the Tribe and people living at Pine Ridge. While at Pine Ridge we also heard directly from Oglala Sioux youth at a roundtable with high school students at Little Wound School.  Of all of the meetings over the course of the two days, this opportunity to connect with the students at Little Wound that really hit home. The stories of hope, struggle and the students’ passion inspired us even more with the work ahead. Persistent poverty and lack of infrastructure investment have taken their toll at Pine Ridge. Now, these placed–based efforts aims to leverage investments, increase economic activity, improve educational opportunities and improve the quality of life in the area through focused work on the six goals the community has identified as instrumental to improve the economic health of the area, increase the quality of life and accelerate the work to create comprehensive community revitalization. First, accelerate job creation by building the foundation for new businesses including implementation of workforce development programs to ensure people are trained with the skills to fill new positions. Second, increase economic activity by addressing economic issues at the systemic level—like expanding increasing banking options and affordable housing for the workforce on the Reservation. Third, improve educational opportunities on the Reservation from primary school through the post-secondary level by offering Lakota immersion education, charter school options and opportunities at the Oglala Lakota College. Fourth, improve public safety Reservation by addressing substance abuse issues and strengthening the justice system. Fifth, provide affordable, low maintenance, energy efficient housing for residents of the Reservation, focusing on key issues like affordable rent, homeownership and middle income housing by developing the real estate market and increasing access to capital. Sixth, systematically develop infrastructure by providing the Tribal government with the ability to operate, maintain, and replace current infrastructure and facilitate future development. A representative from each of the round table break-out sessions provided the entire group a synopsis of the top issues that were drawn out of the round table discussion at their respective table. The Promise Zone Initiative is part of the President’s plan to partner with local communities, businesses and Tribes to create jobs, increase economic security, expand educational opportunities, increase access to quality, affordable housing and improve public safety.  To date, thirteen Promise Zones have been designated across the country; Pine Ridge is one of only two Tribal Promise Zones.  Seven more Promise Zones will be designated in and applications are currently being accepted. We know that increasingly, the community where a child grows up in impacts her odds of graduating high school, her health outcomes, and her lifetime economic opportunities. The Administration has been steadily embarking on a different approach to working with communities to ensure where a child is born never determines her destiny. The Promise Zone Initiative is one of the Administration’s community-based initiatives in action across the country.  In these places federal experts are working side by side with residents and local leaders to create customized solutions; bolstering coordination across agencies and improving how we interact with communities as a ‘one Government’ partner; and relying on valuable to help inform solutions and evaluate what’s working and what’s not. The Promise Zone designation enables USDA to work more collaboratively with other federal agencies in partnership with the Oglala Sioux and others across the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation on efforts to increase economic mobility and create opportunities across the entire region.  To view all active community-based initiatives in your community, visit www.whitehouse.gov/omb/place.

"USDA Agricultural Marketing Service & Alan Shannon, USDA Food and Nutrition Service Midwest Region in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Farming  Nov 03,  Savory chicken, sweet and spicy baked beans, and glazed carrots were part of the new recipe served to students in Chicago schools. One of USDA’s most important missions is providing healthy meals to school lunch programs across the country.  In a unique partnership, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) agencies teamed up with Rachael Ray’s Yum-o! non-profit organization, the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) system and Chartwells-Thompson Hospitality to create and serve a new healthy, tasty and exciting school lunch recipe. To do this, Bob Bloomer of Chartwells-Thompson, the provider of meals in most of Chicago’s schools, worked with the Agricultural Marketing Service to acquire fresh, unprocessed chicken. After issuing a solicitation and competitive bids from domestic suppliers, the Agricultural Marketing Service awarded the first contract for two truckloads—that’s 80,000 pounds —of raw chicken leg quarters for shipment to Chicago’s schools. Next the Midwest Food and Nutrition Staff worked with Rachael Ray ’s Yum-o! non-profit to create a healthy, tasty meal. “I had so much fun creating this recipe with Chicago Public Schools,” said Ray. “I tried to create a recipe that would capture the cultural diversity of Chicago and most importantly, that the kids would love to eat.” The result: Windy City Chicken -- a savory meal of chicken, sweet and spicy baked beans, brown rice and orange-glazed carrots. Prepared by food service staff, the new menu itesm were served to thrilled Second City students in more than 450 schools as part of National School Lunch Week on October 13th.  NBC-Chicago, which covered the event, captured the reaction of a number of children who raved about the meal. “It tastes like heaven,” said one student. Students enjoyed the new lunch menu items made possible by a unique collaboration USDA agencies, a celebrity chef, and the Chicago Schools system. October was National Farm to School Month, which promotes locally-sourced foods in school meal programs, so the menu also featured locally grown food. Chicago Public Schools, through its primary food provider, Chartwells-Thompson, has the largest farm to school program in the Midwest, with more than $2.5 million in fruits and vegetables purchased from regional growers and producers. The carrots used for the special menu are one of the items in CPS’s well-known frozen local program. They were grown within 250 miles of the city, picked at their peak ripeness and flash frozen to preserve their fresh-tasting flavor—and nutrients. The special menu entrée will be served again in the future. In fact, the Agricultural Marketing Service has already awarded additional contracts for more of the chicken.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Sep 18,  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that USDA will commit $45 million for on-the-ground conservation activities to protect and improve soil and water quality in the Lake Champlain Basin in Vermont over the next five years. Senator Patrick Leahy (right) and Rep. Peter Welch look on. Lake Champlain has been plagued by blue-green algae blooms caused by a large amount of phosphorous and other nutrients in the New England lake. Recently, USDA launched a special initiative in the Lake Champlain basin, which is composed of New York and Vermont, to invest $45 million in protecting and improving soil and water quality over the next five years. “Our work helps farmers prevent phosphorus laden runoff which leads to the blue green algae blooms,” said Vicky Drew, the state conservationist for USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service in Vermont. “NRCS conservationists work with farmers to ensure that manure is properly stored, and we provide assistance in the application of manure to their fields according to a nutrient management plan.”  Funding for this program comes from the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, one of the conservation programs offered by the Farm Bill. This program will help Vermont farmers put into place conservation practices that help farmers keep water clean and soil in place, such as cover cropping, tillage systems, vegetative buffers and others. The funding is targeted to areas where blue-green algae blooms are frequent, including Missisquoi Bay, St. Albans Bay and the South Lake — areas of Lake Champlain where blue-green algae blooms are frequent. Phosphorus can affect water quality by enabling excessive aquatic plant and algae growth, which contributes to fish die offs and other environmental impacts. The algae blooms are the result of degraded water quality caused partially by runoff of phosphorous. Agriculture is one contributor of phosphorous, but municipalities and industries also contribute to the problem. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack recently visited Vermont to announce this funding and meet with local farmers and leaders. “This is the sixth largest freshwater body in the country. And there’s no question it needs help,” Vilsack said “We are dedicated to protecting and improving this beautiful and unique natural resource.” Added Rep. Peter Welch at the announcement: “The future of our lake will depend on effective conservation measures, which these funds will support.” Lake Champlain was formed about 200 million years ago when the continents stretched, causing massive bedrock to fall between two faults. This incredible natural resource contains 435 square miles of surface water and is 120 miles long, and is nestled between the Green Mountains of Vermont and the Adirondack Mountains of New York. At its widest point, the lake spans 12 miles with an average depth of 64 feet, and it is adorned with 600 miles of shoreline and over 70 islands. The lake holds 6.8 trillion gallons of water and provides drinking water for over 200,000 people, habitat for over 300 bird species, and brims with 81 fish species. This September, USDA is celebrating the many opportunities and benefits provided by conservation by highlighting stories like this one.

"NFS Forest Management, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Trade  Aug 13,  Participants of the International Seminar on Forest Landscape Restoration on a field trip. Photo credit: US Forest Service This blog post was co-authored with Aaron Reuben (International Union for Conservation of Nature) and Kathleen Buckingham (World Resources Institute). Four billion acres of degraded and deforested land world-wide—an area the size of South America—could benefit from restoration. Restoration addresses our most pressing global challenges—from protecting biodiversity to providing food, energy and water, to offering security and economic opportunity for millions of people. In the United States, a multitude of partners from all sectors, from the local to national level, initiated restoration on millions of acres of degraded land, but the United States cannot do it alone. Degradation is a global issue that requires a global response. This summer, landscape restoration professionals from 16 countries, representing government ministries, non-governmental organizations and private companies, gathered in Oregon to learn from the United States’ experience. The U.S. Forest Service’s International Programs’ International Seminar on Forest Landscape Restoration brought together practitioners from Armenia, Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia, Israel, Malawi, Rwanda, Turkey and Zambia, among many other countries, for a three-week shared learning event. Through technical presentations, exercises and field visits to restoration sites across the state of Oregon (including in the Mt. Hood National Forest, the Deschutes National Forest, and the Malheur National Forest) participants learned the full variety of techniques for restoration employed in the western United States. The seminar covered topics such as restoration planning and opportunity assessment, technical implementation and stewardship. Restoration activities in the field included thinning and burning to restore natural forest structures, use of native seeds and plants and river and meadow restoration. Additionally, the history of conflict, collaboration and scientific achievement that marks the advancement of forest management and restoration in the United States was shared as important context with participants. The seminar also allowed participants to share their own experience in forest landscape restoration and identify common opportunities and constraints. Many seminar sessions focused on developing leadership skills to help the practitioners move restoration forward in their home countries. Some participants committed to join with members of their cohort working in nearby countries to build expertise in their region. All were heartened to join the growing global network of restoration professionals. “I hope this spirit of teamwork will continue to hold us together,” said Samuel Kofi Nyame, a Project Coordinator for the International Union for Conservation of Nature in Ghana. “We can continue to learn from one another and be an inspiration to those to yet come.” Some key lessons emerged from the seminar: Restoration comes in many forms. Understanding the limiting factors for restoration is a key element that is relevant to all landscapes globally. In Oregon, a history of fire suppression has led to overstocking in many of the state’s forests, increasing the threat of a catastrophic wildfire in a landscape that has historically been adapted to frequent, less-severe fires. In order to protect water resources and promote more fire-resilient landscapes, experts conduct restoration interventions—such as thinning and prescribed fire. This approach seemed counterintuitive at first to participants who come from landscapes with different limiting factors and restoration needs—primarily bringing back trees and vegetation to degraded areas. To go fast, go alone. To go far, go together. Effective forest landscape restoration integrates different uses and needs from the land for multiple long-term objectives. While participatory approaches allow for effective prioritizing, planning, implementing and monitoring successes, balancing different needs can be challenging—especially in areas with a history of contention. After years of gridlock over differing priorities, diverse forest users in Oregon, like the members of the Southern Blues Restoration Coalition, are now working towards common goals together. Through conversations with collaborative members, seminar participants learned that building community relationships is possible and critical. Hanqian (Sophie) Zhang, Water Resources Protection Manager for Danone Waters in China, was particularly impressed with the history of collaboration in forest management in the United States. “I have taken to heart that one should always keep the spirit of collaboration going in order to achieve something greater,” Zhang shared. It’s all connected. Another key takeaway of the seminar centered on the connections between ecological, social and economic contexts and objectives. Sandeep Kandicuppa with the Foundation for Ecological Security in India observed that, as forest landscape restoration professionals, “we must work with others to find the interconnections” between different land uses and across land ownership boundaries. For his home landscape and many others, local communities rely on forest products for food and fiber. To Kandicuppa, restoration that does not consider economic development and alternative livelihoods will not be successful. The seminar concluded on a rainy day in Portland, with presentations of forest landscape restoration action plans developed by each participant for use in their home landscape. Mary Wagner, Associate Chief of the U.S. Forest Service, was on hand for the final presentations. Given the urgency of the task facing land managers around the world, who need restored and resilient landscapes to meet the demands of the next generation, “it can be easy to get overwhelmed,” she told her international audience. Addressing the gathered professionals, members of a new community of practice spanning 16 countries, she smiled, “Isn’t it nice to know that we don’t have to do this alone?” The International Seminar on Forest Landscape Restoration was co-hosted by the U.S. Forest Service, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and the World Resources Institute.

"Montana State Statistician, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Conservation  Feb 19,  Big Sky Montana could be Big Sweet Montana. Check back next Thursday for another fascinating look at another state and the Census of Agriculture! The Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture. When you think of Montana agriculture, wheat and cattle come to mind. And why shouldn’t they? After all, our state ranks third in wheat production and tenth in cattle and calves inventory, according to the Census of Agriculture. That year, the combined market value of ag products sold for grains, oilseeds, dry beans, and dry peas was $1,787,162,000 and cattle and calves was $1,783,908,000. Montana’s total market value of agricultural products sold per farm was $151,031; which was up 59 percent from the previous Census of Agriculture in , while the U.S. average was up 39 percent. We have 28,008 farms and ranches in our state with an average size of 2,134 acres, which is down 5 percent from .  Female principal operators of farms and ranches account for 15 percent of the total principal operators in the state while American Indians account for just 5 percent. Like most other states, the average age of our producers continues to increase to 58.9 years, climbing 1.1 years from . Montana ranked second in barley production according the census. Our farmers produce both malt and feed barley. Most of the larger brewers have a presence in Montana, contracting many acres of the finest malt barley available. Irrigation is important in the western states and Montana is no different with 9,451 operations irrigating 1.9 million acres in down 10 percent from 5 years ago. Our growers produce many irrigated crops. Among irrigated crops, our growers harvested 45,807 acres of sugar beets in , ranking sixth in the nation. Organic producers also take advantage of Montana’s growing climate and seasons. The 148 organic operations reporting organic production recorded $16.5 million in total value of sales during . Pulse crop production in Montana continues to grow in importance as Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acreage comes back into production and producers switch to continuous cropping programs. And last, but definitely not least, Montana also produces honey. The value of Montana’s honey production in was $13.4 million.

"USDA Economic Research Service in  Research and Science  Jun 10,  Book cover: ""Rural Wealth Creation"" edited by John Pender, Bruce A. Weber, Thomas G. Johnson, J. Matthew Fannin  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Economic Research Service (ERS) economists may not wear trench coats and fedoras, but we are investigating significant developments affecting rural America.  In a new book, Rural Wealth Creation, which I co-edited with Bruce Weber, Tom Johnson, and Matt Fannin, we examined the role of wealth, which includes physical, financial, human, natural, social and other forms of assets, in achieving sustainable rural prosperity. Strong communities depend upon strong local and regional economies, and prosperous local and regional economies depend on the creation, retention, and distribution of wealth, broadly defined. Wealth contributes to people’s well-being in many ways beyond increasing income. For example, many forms of wealth can provide resilience in tough economic times or enhance the ability of rural people to pursue innovative new opportunities. Rural communities across the United States lose wealth due to a variety of factors. For example, when people leave their communities to pursue opportunities in metropolitan regions, they take with them knowledge, skills, and labor resources that might have otherwise been reinvested in the rural setting. Research shows that creating and retaining wealth in rural areas is essential for achieving sustainable and broadly shared rural prosperity; one of USDA’s strategic goals. So how do communities retain and grow their wealth? We don’t have all the answers yet, but we are working towards solutions. Creating and maintaining a broad portfolio of wealth may be central to sustainable rural prosperity. Physical infrastructure, natural amenities, and human and social capital can attract people and businesses to rural areas. As reported in Amber Waves, communities are developing wealth creation plans to match their own needs and resource requirements. USDA administers wealth creation strategies such as providing small business loans and housing assistance and managing rural conservation programs to promote rural prosperity. Since wealth is an important gauge of rural economic well-being, understanding how wealth is changing and is distributed helps community leaders and federal policymakers manage and evaluate these programs and their alternatives. We still don’t fully understand how to achieve wealth creation or how to measure it in all rural contexts, but ERS researchers and their university-based colleagues are working to fill the information gaps. No wealth creation strategy will work in every situation. Rural regions and communities benefit from being able to identify strategies best suited to their own means and priorities. Rural Wealth Creation proposes a new framework for measuring wealth and for understanding and classifying different rural wealth creation strategies, the factors affecting them, and their implications. Rural Wealth Creation is an outgrowth of the National Conference on Rural Wealth Creation and Livelihoods, co-convened by ERS and the Ford Foundation, and supported financially by a grant from the National Institute for Food and Agriculture and by the Ford Foundation. The related ERS report, Rural Wealth Creation: Concepts, Strategies, and Measures, was released in March on the ERS website.

"Timothy Conner, Parag Chitnis, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Feb 25,  Secretary Sonny Perdue launches the USDA Agriculture Innovation Agenda to align research and programs between the public and private sectors. National Innovation Day was February 16th this year. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) directly contributes to America’s agriculture research and innovation, ultimately benefiting our farmers, ranchers, and foresters. Through an integrated approach of research, education, and Cooperative Extension (extension) – and strong collaboration with our grantees, partners, stakeholders, other Federal agencies, and Congress – NIFA ensures that groundbreaking discoveries in agriculture-related sciences and technologies reach the people who can put them into practice. Most of NIFA’s programs contribute to America’s agricultural research and innovation, including NIFA’s flagship competitive grants program, the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI), and the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant program. AFRI was created by the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of , and subsequently funded by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. NIFA provides AFRI grants to support research, education, and extension activities in six priority areas, originally established by the Farm Bill: 1.) Plant Health and Production and Plant Products; 2.) Animal Health and Production and Animal Products; 3.) Food Safety, Nutrition, and Health; 4.) Bioenergy, Natural resources, and Environment; 5.) Agriculture Systems and Technology; and 6.) Agriculture Economics and Rural Communities. AFRI-funded science is vital to meeting food, fiber, and fuel demands as the world’s population races to nearly 10 billion people by in the face of diminishing natural resources and increasingly variable climatic conditions. A few AFRI-funded projects to highlight are the International Wheat Yield Partnership coordinated agricultural projects (CAP) and its predecessor Triticeae CAP (T-CAP) that focused on improving wheat and barley for climate adaptation. Like many of NIFA’s CAPs, the wheat CAPs bridge the gap across the academic research, industry, and the farming communities to produce higher yielding crops and support sustainable farming. More than 100 commercial varieties developed through the wheat CAPs have a $1.8 billion production value. This work resulted in the TCAP team, led by the University of California, Davis, which utilized markers to identify the gene variants that control the most desirable of the plant’s traits, and which subsequently created the Triticeae Toolbox that provides this information to plant breeders so they can develop improved wheat and barley lines. Learn more on this NIFA Funding Accelerates Wheat & Barley Plant Breeding infographic. Another AFRI funded innovation project led Iowa State University researchers to develop a sensor using nanotechnology that can detect organophosphates at levels 40 times smaller than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommendations. Organophosphates are certain classes of insecticides used on crops throughout the world to control insects. NIFA supports this research through a pair of AFRI grants totaling $573,000. More on this AFRI funded project explained by this New Nanosensor Detects Microscopic Contaminants in Water blog. The SBIR program, established by the Small Business Innovation Research Act of , offers competitively awarded grants to qualified small businesses to support high quality research related to important scientific problems and opportunities in agriculture that could lead to significant public benefits. Administered by NIFA for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the program stimulates technological innovations in the private sector and strengthens the role of federal research, development, and translation of research and development in support of small businesses. The program has awarded over 2,000 research and development projects since . Through SBIR funding, NECi Superior Enzymes (previously ""The Nitrate Elimination Company, Inc.) developed kits that allow farm managers to determine nitrate accumulation levels on their farms, which helps them manage nitrate concentration, reduce costly nitrogen fertilizer use, and reduce pollutants. This product is approved by the EPA as an alternative test method for nitrate testing under the Safe Water Drinking Act and the Clean Water Act, and is used as the standard test method within all U.S. Geological Survey soil labs. NECi Superior Enzymes is a woman-owned small business located in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

"and Sandra Thompson, Florida A&M University Cooperative Extension in  Research and Science  Mar 07,  Young farmers in Florida participate in the New and Beginning Farmers Training Program to learn skills that will help them start successful farming operations. The African-American farmer is a rare breed in the United States, and their numbers have declined dramatically over the past few decades.  This trend, particularly, is due to the fact that young people are not entering the field to replace an increasingly aging population.  In Florida, the average farmer’s age is 58.4, and approximately 45 percent of the farms in Florida are operated by farmers between 25 and 54 years of age. For north Florida’s agriculture sector to continue to be a major contributor to the Florida economy, it will be necessary to transition to a younger generation of farmers. Farming is no longer the hard, manual labor venture of the past, but it’s a technical and managerial occupation. We started the New and Beginning Farmers Training Program at Florida A&M University Cooperative Extension Program (FAMU) to bring awareness to the fact that farming can be a viable, profitable business venture for new and beginning African-American entrants. In , we received a grant from USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) through the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program (BFRDP).  BFRDP was established by the Farm Bill to offer education, outreach, mentoring and internships for beginning farmers and ranchers with 10 years of farming experience or less.  NIFA expects to begin accepting applications for the BFRDP in summer , with proposals due in the fall of . The goal of our project is to use the basic business development model and apply it to agriculture operations; thus, tying business and marketing skills to agriculture, making it a seamless endeavor and increase the likelihood of economic profitability. Project emphasis is placed on new and beginning farmers who are less than 25 years of age and/or are African-American. The project takes three approaches to providing educational support and assistance for this vulnerable audience: A web-based training program, which is soon to be launched, provides self-directed training and assistance specifically for new and beginning farmers to help them access the resources based on their goals, skills and progress in beginning a farm operation. The Young Farmer Entrepreneur Incubator targets new and beginning farmers under the age of 25, and is an intensive, hands-on approach working with small groups of young agricultural entrepreneurs to establish core business plans and practices that will enable them to start successful agricultural business ventures.  The Beginning Farmer Demonstration Training Site provides hands-on training activities to demonstrate the viability of alternative market opportunities including institutions, retail, and direct-to-consumer outlets. We saw much success in our first year with more than 40 training sessions conducted with new and beginning farmers in north Florida. These efforts enable participants to obtain real-world, hands-on experiences that will help them begin their own farming operations and contribute to the agricultural economy in north Florida.

"Rooting Up History: Feral Swine Damage to Archaeological Sites  Feral swine are an invasive species well known for their ability to degrade native habitats, damage agricultural interests, and spread disease. However, until now, little was known about their impacts to archaeological sites. USDA-APHIS scientists at the National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) and colleagues from the Avon Park Air Force Range (Avon Park) recently measured the potential for feral swine to disturb and destroy archaeological sites in south-central Florida. The study was conducted at Avon Park, a base comprising more than 98,000 acres and containing hundreds of archaeological sites.

"APHIS Aquaculture Program Manager, Riverdale, MD in  Animals  Plants  Jun 06,   If someone told you there were simple things you could do to keep fish from dying and protect our waters, you’d want to know more, right? Well, if you’re a boater or angler in the Great Lakes region, there’s a lot you can do to stop the spread of a fish disease called viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS). VHS kills freshwater and marine fish, including some species of bass, trout and perch. The good news is you can help fight the disease by remembering to clean boats and fishing equipment. It’s also important not to transfer bait, water and mud from one waterway to another. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) created a Focus On Fish Health campaign to let boaters and anglers know that they’re on the front lines of slowing the spread of VHS. Find out more at www.FocusOnFishHealth.org. The Focus On Fish website has some great information on the disease--such as how to recognize signs of VHS--and advice on how to dispose of dead fish and unused bait. If you belong to a boating or angling group, the APHIS website tells you how to get free materials, including palm cards and Power Point tools, so you can get the word out to others. And while you are out on the water having fun, be sure to bring your camera!  Enter our photo contest, where you can submit pictures of the biggest fish you ever caught or share memories of good times on the water. There are two categories: Your Best Catch and Family Fun on the Water. Winning photos get posted on the Focus On Fish Health website. If you win, you get a free tee-shirt, duffle bag and hat. You can submit up to three photos each month and winners will be announced at the end of June, July and August. For more information on contest rules and , visit www.FocusOnFishHealth.org. Joining the effort to fight VHS is one way to make sure that future generations will have the same great photos to pass down to their children--and more wonderful stories to share.

"AMS Fruit and Vegetable Program Deputy Administrator and Dave Tuckwiller, AMS Commodity Procurement Program Director in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 11,  “We create opportunities for American ag businesses,” said Casey Wong-Buehler, AMS Commodity Procurement Program Specialist. “Trips like this help us ensure that our procurement requirements provide a realistic framework for our vendors to successfully supply quality food.” Across the country, schools are back in session. Here at the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), our inspectors and procurement specialists work hard to make sure that quality, domestically-produced foods are delivered to students and other recipients for our federal food purchasing programs. As students are getting used to their new schedules, we would like to highlight how our own little field trip shed some light on a typical day for some of our employees. A team of AMS employees recently traveled to Knouse Foods, a grower-owned cooperative that supplies apple and cranberry products for federal food purchasing programs. The employees saw first-hand how USDA inspectors help Knouse and other companies verify the quality of their products. As the apple sauce traveled through the facility, USDA inspectors pulled random samples to make sure that they met product quality and condition requirements. All USDA Foods are to be inspected, and in this case, inspectors pulled samples of apple sauce to evaluate traits like its color, flavor, and consistency. As an independent third-party, the inspections help suppliers meet USDA Foods requirements but they also can help them meet requirements from other buyers. The tour also covered another important part of the procurement process – the delivery. In addition to the food inspection requirement, all contracts for federal food purchasing programs require delivery trucks to be inspected. The team got a chance to see this process, called check-loading. USDA inspectors checked the condition of the trailers, making sure that the trailer is clean, doesn’t contain any holes, and has updated inspection codes.  For the Commodity Procurement Program specialists, the trip gave them a chance to see how some of the contract provisions are carried out by both the suppliers and USDA inspectors. Whether it’s telling them about the procurement process or product specifications and requirements, the procurement specialists are always in constant contact with their vendors. The recent trip helped the specialists see how the vendors incorporate inspections and check-loading into their business plans. They saw how long it takes for trucks to be inspected and the impact it has on their deliveries. All of us here at AMS are proud to play a role in supporting American ag businesses by ensuring that they can provide quality, wholesome foods to our students and other federal food purchase program recipients. We wish all of our students a successful school year. We encourage businesses to learn more about how our Specialty Crops Inspection Division and our Commodity Procurement Program can support their business. “Ensuring the product quality of our USDA Foods is extremely important,” said USDA Specialty Crops Inspection (SCI) Division employee Michael Harutinian. “Our employees pull random samples, helping our suppliers increase their confidence in the quality of their products,” said Harutinian.

"Open Can Help Feed a Hungry World  Today with over 7 billion people on Earth, nearly 800 million people struggle with debilitating hunger and malnutrition in every corner of the globe. That’s one in every nine people, with the majority being women and children. Experts tell us we currently produce enough food to feed everyone, so why do so many people go to bed hungry every day? We believe that by making agriculture and nutrition available, accessible, and usable for unrestricted use worldwide, we will enable the creation of innovative solutions to eliminate hunger. Poor connections between production and distribution, limited knowledge sharing about what crops grow best where, and incomplete access to information about agricultural markets all contribute to global food insecurity.

"in  Initiatives  Rural  Nov 09,   Americans will soon come together on Veterans Day to honor our nation’s returned service members, including more than 22 million living American veterans. For generations, American service members across every branch of our military have made tremendous sacrifices to defend our freedom and liberty.   This weekend, it’s important that all of us take time to remember their service. In particular, earlier this year, President Obama honored our Vietnam-era veterans when he proclaimed a 13-year period – May 28, , through Nov. 11, – as the “Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War.”  This gives all of us a special opportunity to recognize these veterans, who too often were not properly thanked when they came home. Today, more than 6 million veterans live in our small towns and rural communities, a higher concentration than any other part of the country. That is not a surprise to me. Our veterans embody the values that stand at the heart of rural America: hard work, a love of their country, and a sense of duty to give back to a nation that has done so much for us all. I share the President’s belief that when our veterans return home, we don’t just owe them a debt of gratitude. We owe them a good job, secure housing, a quality education, and dependable health care. That’s why USDA has worked hard to ensure our veterans have tools to succeed. We’ve stepped up hiring of veterans at USDA, and helped offer new work experiences to prepare veterans for the job market.  USDA has participated in a wide variety of veterans’ hiring efforts coordinated by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense.  And through the USDA Veterans Employment Program office, any veteran who contacts us has access to counseling, career help, and consideration for employment. We’ve helped veterans learn more about opportunities in farming and ranching – providing support for organizations to train more than 40,000 new producers, including veterans. We’ve invested in projects that bring more opportunity to rural veterans. Since USDA has supported more than 1,000 rural health clinics. We’ve supported more than 5,700 distance learning and telemedicine projects. We have made record loans and grants that help veterans start a farm, buy a home, or run a small business. And in February, USDA signed an historic memorandum of understanding with the American Legion. Working with the Legion at posts across the country, our aim is to help more rural veterans connect with employers, get a good job, and access useful information about USDA programs. Our efforts are just one piece in America’s shared responsibility to support our veterans. Together, we can be sure that after a veteran fights for America, they don’t have to fight for good opportunity when they come home. I encourage all Americans to join me in thanking our veterans, along with our active duty service members, as we recognize their service to our nation this Veterans Day.

"Rural Development Program Provides Quality Housing for Central Oregon’s Farm Workers  While on a recent visit to Oregon, USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development Victor Vasquez visited the Canyon East farm worker housing complex currently under construction in Madras. The USDA-supported facility is scheduled for completion in August, with families moving in shortly thereafter. Vasquez was joined by Oregon Rural Development State Director  Vicki Walker. The community of Madras in Central Oregon is surrounded by numerous farming and ranching operations that provide fresh foods and products for regional markets. Many of these operations, including irrigated seed crops, potatoes and mint as well as the numerous hay and livestock operations, can be labor intensive, and rely on an infusion of farm workers. Yet, housing options in the Madras area have been limited for farm workers and their families, despite the integral and valued role they play in local agriculture as well as the overall community.

"Seeing is Believing: Soil Health Practices and No-Till Farming Transform Landscapes and Produce Nutritious Food  This month, we’re highlighting 12 important gifts given to us when we conserve natural resources: soil, food, plants, wildlife, people, health, protection, recreation, air, water, technology and the future. NRCS’ mission is to conserve the full range of natural resources, but soil health is our foundation. And it’s the first conservation gift that we’re going to highlight. And without soil, we couldn’t celebrate with food. We encourage you to give the gift of conservation this season! Curbing Soil Erosion Soil is the foundation for a healthy environment. If you need proof that no-till farming works, look no further than the rolling hills of north-central Oregon. For decades, this region was dominated by winter wheat farms that used extensive tillage to control weeds during fallow years. It was the conventional way of farming in the area, from the early ’s through the ’s.

"in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Sep 11,  US Kevin Concannon and Miami-Dade County School Superintendent Alberto Carvalho talk with students from North Beach Elementary School, Miami, FL, on August 23, , during lunch. (USDA photo by Debbie Smoot). I recently had the pleasure of visiting North Beach Elementary School in Miami to recognize 177 schools in the Miami-Dade County Public Schools District for their efforts to promote good nutrition and physical activity to their students. All 177 schools achieved Bronze Awards in the HealthierUS School Challenge (HUSSC). Miami-Dade now has the honor of having the second largest number of HUSSC awards in any one school district in the entire nation. HUSSC is a key part of the First Lady’s Let’s Move! initiative to end childhood obesity in a generation. The Challenge is a voluntary commitment to meet USDA’s rigorous standards for physical activity, nutritious meals and nutrition education. Schools such as the ones in Miami-Dade that meet the requirements should be very proud of their achievement. While at North Beach Elementary, I had the honor of serving lunch to the students, alongside Alberto Carvalho, Miami-Dade County Public School District Superintendent. It’s very rewarding to me to see the children enthusiastically select an abundance of fruits and vegetables. Several told me that they liked eating healthy foods. Their enthusiasm was pretty infectious.  I was also impressed with the students who formed a student wellness council to support their peers in making healthier choices. US Kevin Concannon and Miami-Dade County School Superintendent Alberto Carvalho serve lunch to students from North Beach Elementary School, Miami, FL, on August 23, . (USDA photo by Debbie Smoot). These kinds of activities should help schools in the county quickly adjust to the new meal standards that go into effect this fall. USDA has made major improvements to school meals and those changes are already showing up in school cafeterias.  The improvements were made possible by provisions in the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act which gave us the ability to bring school meals in line with the Dietary for Americans. This is an exciting time because schools play such a critical role in the lives of our children and can be instrumental in helping kids develop healthy habits. Many students eat two meals a day at school, making the quality of these meals all the more important.  It’s vital that we provide our youngsters with healthy food choices that enable them to learn, grow, and thrive. Improvements to school meals add up to a substantial investment in the future of our children—and our nation.  That’s why I’m proud of the role USDA has in making the school day healthier. And I’m also proud of Miami-Dade County Public Schools for going the extra mile for the sake of their students. For more information on how USDA is supporting schools in implementing the new standards—and how you can pitch in—please visit our Healthier School Day web site.

This program, started at the Oregon City Farmers Market, invites children to learn more about some of their favorite foods. Participating in events like planting sunflower seeds or making jam gives the youngsters a chance to better understand where their food comes from. By receiving $2 to spend on fresh produce every time they visit the market to keeping a log of what they buy, the children become immersed in a world of healthy eating.  Last year, 1,781 children aged 5 to 12 years old joined, resulting in 5,180 shopping trips.

"Risk Management Tools Help Farmers Create a More Environmentally Sustainable Future  American producers know that crop insurance is a proven tool for managing the risks of farming.  But many folks may not be aware that it also promotes sound practices that encourage environmental sustainability. One of the primary reasons the Federal crop insurance program is good for conservation is that it requires producers to exercise good farming practices in order to be eligible for coverage.  Good farming practices vary from crop to crop and from region to region, but follow the principle that the farming practices carried out are considered prudent and responsible by local extension agents and certified crop consultants. And this means planning for the long-term future, not just the current crop year.  Brandon C.

Tiffany Holloway, Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Jan 16,   3 Responses",What are some potential implications for agricultural land use and management in areas designated as wilderness preserves?,"There is no direct answer to the question based on the provided content. However, I can provide an answer by searching: The U.S. Forest Service's designation of wilderness areas does not directly impact agricultural land use and management, as these areas are typically protected from human development and resource extraction. In fact, the Wilderness Act prohibits the use of motorized equipment, road construction, and other forms of human disturbance in designated wilderness areas. However, it is worth noting that some surrounding lands may be affected by the designation of adjacent wilderness areas. For example, lands near a wilderness area may be subject to increased environmental regulations or restrictions on land use due to their proximity to a protected area. Therefore, potential implications for agricultural land use and management in areas designated as wilderness preserves are likely to be minimal or indirect, such as: * Increased scrutiny of land use practices to ensure they do not harm the surrounding wilderness area * Restrictions on resource extraction or development projects that may impact the wilderness area * Potential changes to zoning regulations or land-use policies near the wilderness boundary It is essential to consult with local authorities and experts for more specific information regarding agricultural land use and management in areas designated as wilderness preserves."

"La Línea de Carnes y Aves del USDA in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Jan 29,   Por la mayoría del año, mi olla de cocción lenta se queda guardada en un anaquel en mi cocina. Pero, cuando se acerca el día del Super Bowl, la saco y empiezo a cocinar chili con carne, albóndigas u otras comidas calientes de fiesta. Lo que me más gusta de mi olla es que puede cocinar los alimentos inocuamente y a la misma vez me permite ahorrar tiempo cuando me ocupo preparándome para el gran juego. Durante esta época del año, La Línea de Carnes y Aves del USDA recibe muchas preguntas acerca de las ollas de cocción lenta. A veces escuchamos historias de errores espantosos que cometen personas cuando están preparando alimentos por cocción lenta. Para asegurar que usted y sus invitados estén fuera del riesgo de intoxicación de alimentos, aquí tienen algunas preguntas comunes con las respuestas correspondientes. Puse la carne dentro de mi olla de cocción lenta pero se me olvidó prenderla. Estuvo apagada por seis horas antes de que lo noté. ¿Si cocino la carne, matará la bacteria y va a esto hacer que sea inocua? Desafortunadamente, la carne no es inocua aun si usted lo cocina. Alimentos perecederos almacenados en la zona de peligro (las temperaturas entre 40 °F y 140 °F) por más de dos horas se deben tirar a la basura aunque no tenga indicaciones por olor o vista de que se echaron a perder. Después de que cociné chili con carne en mi olla, lo almacené en un tazón grande y lo puse en el refrigerador para enfriarlo durante la noche. Cuando lo comprobé esta mañana, noté que todavía estaba tibio en el centro. ¿Es ello inocuo? Esta persona quien llamó estuvo muy decepcionada en cuanto vio que el chili con carne ya no era inocuo. Si usted hace una olla grande de sopa, chili o guisado, almacénalo en contenedores playos que permiten al alimento enfriarse rápidamente en la nevera. Siempre refrigere el alimento cocinado dentro de dos horas después de que la cocción sea terminada. No deje que se enfríe en el contador. ¿Es inocuo recalentar alimentos como el cerdo a la barbacoa en la olla de cocción lenta? No se recomienda recalentar los sobres en una olla de cocción lenta. En cambio, aconsejamos a personas que nos llamen a que recalienten alimentos hasta cocer al vapor en la cumbre de estufa o en un horno de microondas. Entonces, puede ponerlo en una olla de cocción lenta precalentada para guardarlo y servirlo caliente. Use un termómetro de alimento para asegurar que la comida permanezca a temperaturas más altas que 140 ° F. Por lo general, yo pongo las albóndigas congeladas directamente en mi olla de cocción lenta para empezar cocinándolas  pero mi mejor amigo dice que mi método no es inocuo. ¿Quién tiene la razón? Estas de suerte tener un amigo tan listo quien sabe cómo manejar los alimentos inocuamente. Su amigo tiene la razón. Todos los ingredientes los cuales se ponen en la olla de cocción lenta deben ser descongelados primero. Almacene comidas descongeladas y otros alimentos perecederos en la nevera hasta que esté listo para empezar a cocinar.

Many people know that salmon can decrease the risk of coronary heart disease and certain cancers, and that salmon is a good source of many beneficial vitamins and healthy oils, such as Vitamin E, Vitamin C and Omega 3s (fatty acids essential for health). But not many people know that salmon can be used as a benchmark to measure a watershed’s health. If salmon are thriving in a river or stream, the surrounding land is typically considered by scientists to be productive and healthy. That’s why the nonprofit Salmon-Safe was established in Oregon in . Salmon-Safe works with landowners, farmers and local conservation organizations in Washington, Oregon, California and British Columbia to promote conservation practices and habitat restoration. Over 65,000 acres of farmland have been deemed “salmon safe.” “Salmon safe” farm operations adopt conservation practices that protect water quality and help restore wildlife habitat in salmon watersheds. These practices include efficient water use, integrated pest management (IPM) and soil conservation. Salmon-Safe is a third-party certification program that utilizes professional inspectors with experience in both habitat conservation and sustainable agriculture. The Salmon-Safe label provides credibility, visibility and marketing opportunities for participating farms In , the Washington Water Project of Trout Unlimited (TU-WWP) received a Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) from NRCS to expand Salmon-Safe certification into eastern Washington. CIG-funded projects use innovative technologies and approaches to address natural resources issues. Michael Simon, of Applecart Fruit, inspects his crop for quality and potential pests in Tonasket, WA. With the grant, 15 farms transitioned over 6,000 acres to Salmon-Safe management practices.  On these farms, Salmon-Safe has worked to eliminate or reduce the use of pesticides and implement other water quality practices, such as fencing, to keep pollutants out of the river. In exchange, these farms have earned the use of the Salmon-Safe label and are able to tap into the existing comprehensive marketing campaign in western Washington. Due to the huge success of the first year of Salmon-Safe implementation in eastern Washington, In , TU-WWP received another CIG. This will allow the program to continue its momentum and multiply certification throughout a broader region—helping to ensure that salmon will continue to thrive in northwest watersheds and beyond.

"Director, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Feb 03,  Agricultural research means real results helping real people every day. Agronomist Edgar E. Hartwig has devoted half a century to soybeans research, developing productive plants with built-in resistance to insects, nematodes, and diseases. He is best known for commercial varieties that include Bragg, Lee, Forrest, Lamar, Sharkey, and most recently, Vernal. (USDA ARS photo by Keith Weller.) Seeing President Obama’s fiscal year budget proposal and the strong commitment it makes to agricultural research reminds me of Dr. Consuelo De Moraes. As a university researcher and panel manager of the National Research Initiative (NRI) competitive grants program, I called Dr. De Moraes in to inform her that USDA was going to fund her research proposal on determining how plants defend themselves against insects, so farmers could exploit the same as a means to control pests. She screamed with happiness. Later I learned that people heard the scream throughout the building at Pennsylvania State University. After that, Dr. De Moraes went on to great acclaim as one of the leading insect researchers. In , only 24 percent of the proposals submitted to the NRI program were funded. Today, the funding rate for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI), which replaced the NRI program, that number has dipped to barely 10 percent. Indeed, during , NIFA received 3,875 proposals for funding by the AFRI program, of which 1,640 were recommended for funding, and, unfortunately, NIFA could only fund 390 proposals with the resources available. In this highly competitive environment, many talented scientists and researchers are unable to get funding and, as a result, are leaving agricultural sciences at a time when the need for their innovation is greatest or taking their expertise to other countries that are more supportive of public sector research. A growing population, climate change, diminishing land and water resources, and the need to ensure food security are becoming ever more urgent. Funding shortfalls become even more daunting when one considers the urgency of new and invasive species of pests, antimicrobial resistance, pollinator health, sustainability, poor public health and nutritional outcomes, and the need for innovations for advanced manufacturing and economic enterprises. Funding research to respond to these challenges should be considered as an investment in our Nation’s future, an investment that will pay big dividends in the years to come. USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, or NIFA, and its flagship competitive grants program, AFRI, were created as part of the Farm Bill. At that time, AFRI was authorized by Congress to be funded at $700 million per year. Since its authorization, Congressional appropriations for AFRI have gone as high as $350 million for this fiscal year. While every increase during the last few years has been helpful and has catalyzed many more Dr. De Moraeses to make transformative discoveries, there is so much more untapped potential waiting to be discovered and used. Here are a few recent examples of outcomes resulting from research investments in the AFRI program: new ways to deal with the influenza virus in pigs; increased milk production with fewer resources; innovative and effective ways to manage pests; innovations in irrigation technologies resulting in water savings and improved  nitrogen use efficiency; significant boosts in wheat, corn, and beef cattle productivity despite droughts and increasing temperatures; increased profitability of farmers and livestock producers; conversion of biomass into fuel for commercial and military jets; stronger biomaterials from woody and other biomass; development of new sensors to detect and to deal with pathogens of food safety importance without relying on antibiotics; protection of pollinators; significant improvement in children’s nutritional health; and last, but not least, new economic enterprises and jobs. Imagine the many, many more discoveries, innovations, and solutions that could be catalyzed if AFRI is funded at its full authorized level? Many, recognizing that our nation’s food security is tied directly to our national security, have called with urgency to increase this funding: the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, members of Congress, the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, farm groups, commodity organizations, Nobel Laureates and other scientists, universities, and young people engaged in 4-H and FFA. That is why I applaud the President’s request for $700 million for AFRI in his Budget. The AFRI budget proposal includes $375 million provided in the discretionary request, and a legislative action to make available $325 million in mandatory funding as part of a government-wide investment in research and development. My colleagues and I look forward to working with Congress so that our best and brightest scientists can find solutions to our most pressing societal and global challenges.

"NRCS Alabama in  Conservation  Jul 27,  Gopher tortoise laying eggs on freshly cultivated field. Gopher tortoises are fairly elusive creatures. Usually the only sign you see of them is their burrows or ravaged foliage. But recently a Mobile, Ala., tortoise allowed Marshall Colburn, a Soil Conservation Technician with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), a rare, up-close-and-personal moment as she laid her eggs in a freshly cultivated field. “I was on a landowner’s property doing a site assessment for the Working Lands for Wildlife program, when I observed a gopher tortoise laying eggs,” Colburn says. “She had dug a nest about 20 yards away from her burrow in soft soil where the landowner had planted chufas [a type of nut-grass typically planted for wildlife] the day before. I was able to stand and take photos about two feet from the apron of the nest…It was pretty cool!” The gopher tortoise is known as a keystone species in the longleaf pine ecosystem of the Southeast because it digs burrows that provide shelter and habitat for many other animal species.  It is also considered an indicator of longleaf pine ecosystem health. Gopher tortoises contribute to biological diversity by dispersing seeds found in the fruits and berries they eat. Unfortunately, as the once–vast longleaf forests disappear, so does the gopher tortoise’s habitat. The population has been reduced to the extent that the tortoise is listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act throughout the western part of its range. Working Lands for Wildlife is a partnership between NRCS and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that offers landowners voluntary, incentive-based conservation assistance to restore habitat for seven targeted wildlife species in decline in 36 states, including the gopher tortoise in Alabama. It is hoped that through the success of the Working Lands for Wildlife program, gopher tortoise habitat will improve to allow many tortoises to lay their eggs—whether a conservationist is watching or not.

"in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Jul 17,  Screen shot of the newest version of the KYF2 Compass map.  Today, I am proud to announce the release of a new version of the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass. But before I tell you what makes it new, I want to invite you to join us live at 3pm EDT to hear about it directly from me, from the White House, and from some of the many people whose stories are featured in the Compass guide and map. At 3pm EDT, join us on a Google + Hangout broadcast at whitehouse.gov/live and on the White House Google + page. When you join, you’ll hear from women around the country who are working to build strong regional food systems. Theirs are just some of the many stories that we profile in the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass. Today’s updates include new case studies on the Compass website and, perhaps most exciting, an improved map. The original version of the map showed USDA-supported projects related to local and regional food systems around the country. To that , we have added additional projects. We’ve also added our databases of farmers markets, food hubs, meat processing facilities inspected by USDA, GreenSchools! school garden projects supported by the Forest Service, and state-level numbers on the use of nutrition program benefits like SNAP (food stamps) at farmers markets. As before, all of the is downloadable. You can now search the map by keyword or zip code radius to focus in on the issues that are most interesting to you. Are you working to develop a farm to school initiative? Click on the search tab, select “KYF projects,” and enter “farm to school” in the search box. You will see a list of projects that have received USDA support over the last few years. Clicking on a project will take you to their spot on the map, where you can read more about what they’re doing, which USDA program they applied to for funding, and how to find their contact information. As I’ve explored the many stories in the Compass and on the map, I have noticed that women are playing a prominent role in many aspects of regional food systems. The number of women running farms in the U.S. has gone up by 30 percent since ; a full third of farm operators today are women, and many of them are engaged in regional sales. Women are also creating small food businesses, solving the challenge of getting local food into schools, buying local food for their children, and working with their communities to increase local, healthy food in people’s diets. With that backdrop, today’s event highlights women leaders who are making a difference in local and regional foods. This issue is also an important component of the Obama Administration’s jobs agenda; regional food systems are helping drive job creation in many communities around the country. The White House is partnering with us on this event. The women you will meet through the Google+ Hangout are innovative local food leaders in their communities. They include Cory Carman, a 4th-generation farmer in eastern Oregon; Chris Kirby, director of Oklahoma’s Farm to School initiative; Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Mayor of Baltimore City and co-chair of the U.S. Conference of Mayors Food Policy Council; Valerie Segrest of the Muckleshoot Tribe and the Muckleshoot Food Sovereignty Project in Washington State; Pam Roy of Farm to Table and the New Mexico Food and Agriculture Policy Council; and Sue Noble of the Vernon Economic Development Association in Wisconsin.  These women will inspire you to use the Compass, dive into the map and use local food to make your community stronger.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Feb 03,  Douglas Poole is an evangelist who saved his own soil. Now he wants to help others save theirs. Photo: Jennifer Cole. “Nothing motivates me quite like being told I can’t do something. They told me no-till doesn’t work here, and you’re not supposed to be able to grow any type of canola. Well, look around. Here we are.” When Douglas Poole speaks, you can hear the passion in his voice for healthy soil and how it has helped his farm. Poole wasn’t always a soil health proponent; he used to be an accountant. Poole is a dryland farmer of winter wheat in Mansfield, one of the driest parts of Washington State. The area receives seven to nine inches of rain per year, and with so little water, Poole needed to find a system more efficient than conventional farming for his crops to flourish.  He decided no-till was the way to go. “In the beginning, it was more of an opportunity to see if I could save labor, overhead and everything else. The more I researched it, the more I saw that it wasn’t so much no-till as it was soil. That was really the driver,” said Poole. But support for no-till in Poole’s community was lacking. In the future, Poole’s vision is for his land to be completely covered at all times. Currently his land is roughly two-thirds of that. He plans to have no fallow land within ten years. Photo: Jennifer Cole. To get started with no-till and other soil health practices, Poole went to USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). In , he was awarded one of the first Energy Initiative contracts through NRCS’ Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). This contract allowed him to partially convert his operation to no-till, implement cover crops and crop rotations. He was able to convert the remainder of his farm to no-till practices through the EQIP Air Quality Initiative in . Poole has implemented no-till practices, and now has crop rotations including canola, sunflowers and spring crops. “To me it’s all related – no-till needs cover crops and cover crops need no-till.” However, it’s still a conservation practice combination that many conventional growers are hesitant to try, especially in 10-inch precipitation zones. Poole’s soil health approach isn’t faith-based. He’s constantly researching soil health practices that improve his soil, and he has participated in several cover crop studies with his local conservation district, as well as some of his own. Poole recently decided to let his last cover crop grow throughout the year, rather than terminating it. “We found that if we could have that diversity of root growth in soil, we could actually gain moisture. Almost like we are farming moisture. And obviously, that enhances the soil.” In the future, Poole’s vision is for his land to be completely covered at all times. Currently his land is roughly two-thirds of that. He plans to have no fallow land within ten years. “I can’t even imagine being a conventional farmer and looking to the future. I feel like those of us that have made the conversion have a future.” He’s an evangelist who saved his own soil. Now he wants to help others save others’.

"USDA Office of Communications and Charlie Anderson, Senior Adviser to the Director of the National Economic Council in  USDA Results  Dec 14,   Cross-posted from the White House blog: Today, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is taking some major steps forward to protect farmers – including swine, beef cattle, and especially poultry growers – from unfair treatment by the often much larger processors who purchase their fully grown hogs, cattle, and chickens. These three rules are another step forward in response to the President’s Competition Initiative announced in April, which has the goal of enhancing competition to help consumers, workers, and small businesses get a fair shake in the economy. What’s the problem being addressed? The poultry, pork, and beef industries include growers who raise chickens, turkeys, hogs, and cattle, and processors who buy the full-grown animals from the growers, package up the meat, and ship it to your local butcher, supermarket, or restaurant. In recent years, similar to what has been occurring across a number of other industries, processing has become increasingly concentrated, with fewer companies controlling a larger share of the market. This has inhibited farmers’ ability to get a fair deal from the processors. For example, the four largest poultry processors control 51 percent of the broiler market and 57 percent of the turkey market.  In part due to this concentration, poultry growers often have limited options for processors available in their local communities: 52 percent of growers have only one or two processors in their state or region to whom they can sell.  That means processors can often wield market power over the growers, treating them unfairly, suppressing how much they are paid, or pitting them against each other. For example, if a chicken grower attempts to organize other chicken growers to bargain for better pay or publicly expresses unhappiness with the way they are treated by a processor, they can suffer retaliation. Processors can require growers to make investments that are not economically justifiable for the grower or can terminate contracts with little notice. In contract growing (which has governed an increasing share of the market in recent years), the processors own the birds and provide inputs like feed, so they can choose to provide poultry growers with bad feed or sickly birds that have a higher mortality rate, which cuts deeply into a grower’s opportunity to earn income on those birds. Without much of a choice for where to sell their birds, poultry growers often have to either put up with the unfair behavior, take a pay cut, or take their case to court. What do the rules do? USDA is releasing three rules – collectively known as the Farmer Fair Practices Rules – to empower farmers so they get fair treatment by the processors or get their day in court:  Rule – the “scope” rule – means that poultry growers will no longer have to meet an impossibly high standard to get compensated when they are treated unfairly. The interim final “scope” rule makes clear to the courts – as has long been USDA’s interpretation – that farmers don’t have to demonstrate that an unfair practice by processors harms the entire industry in order to prove a violation of the Packers and Stockyards Act. This impossibly high standard had previously put small farmers at a disadvantage for decades when pursuing their rights under the law. With this new rule in place, if a farmer is being treated unfairly, they’ll now have their day in court and be able to win.  Rule enumerates some of the specific unfair practices that violate the law. To make the rules more clear for processors and growers alike – and to help courts understand where to draw the line – the second rule being proposed today clearly outlines unfair practices for which growers can receive compensation. These practices include inaccurate or false weighing of birds, the abuse of arbitration procedures, the abrupt suspension of delivery of birds to a grower or termination of a contract without an opportunity for the farmer to get back into compliance. All of these types of activities would qualify as an unfair practice that would be compensated through a court proceeding. Processors can only treat growers differently if they have a legitimate business justification, not for arbitrary reasons. This protection is especially important to poultry growers who today often find it difficult to win in court even when they are treated unfairly.  Rule reforms the poultry growing tournament system to make it more of a level playing field and avoid processors aiding and disadvantaging certain growers relative to others. Many poultry growers through the contract system are paid out based on a tournament how they perform against their peers; the bigger and better their birds turn out relative to other growers, the more money they make. However, because the processors own the birds, the feed, and other inputs, they can unfairly disadvantage or preference one grower over another as a way of forcing the growers to do things against their will or shut down dissent. The third rule, also proposed, will establish criteria to judge whether the processor is operating the ranking system in a manner that is fair to all growers. It will push back against the unequal bargaining power between poultry purchasers and poultry growers. These rules respond to the directive USDA was given in the farm bill but were only allowed to move forward with implementing this year, once an unnecessary and harmful rider that had been in place for years was defeated in this year’s appropriations bill. By continuing to move forward with finalizing these rules, USDA will make important progress in ensuring that farmers get a fair shake and can push back on inappropriate and unfair treatment by the processors. These are a meaningful step forward to make sure that rural Americans are getting paid what they deserve for supplying the high-quality chickens, turkeys, hogs, and beef that Americans enjoy around their dinner tables and at their local restaurants every single day.

"NASS Demographer and Michelle Radice, NASS Outreach and Diversity Director in  Rural  Sep 30,   The whole nation is celebrating the Hispanic Heritage Month, honoring numerous achievements and contributions made by the Hispanic-Americans in many industries, including agriculture. Farm operators of Hispanic, Latino and Spanish origin now comprise 2.ates, according to the most recent Census of Agriculture, conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). According to these , there are 66,671 farms with Hispanic operators, covering more than 24.6 million acres of U.S. farmland. The states with the highest percentages of Hispanic-operated farms are New Mexico, California and Texas.  Hispanic farmers and ranchers are also becoming more diverse as a group. The latest census showed that 12 percent of all Hispanic operators are women. Hispanic Farms Map Hispanic farmers and ranchers are active participants in all facets of U.S. agriculture today. In , they sold more than $12.7 billion worth of agricultural products from their farms and ranches. The most common type of operation among Hispanic famers and ranchers is cattle production, accounting for nearly a third of all farms with Hispanic or Latino operators. While less than one-quarter of Hispanic farms produce specialty crops, which include fruits, vegetables, and nursery and greenhouse products, these operations account for almost half the value of sales from Hispanic operations.  NASS conducts the Census of Agriculture every five years, with the next census scheduled for .

"Administrator, Rural Housing Service in  Rural  Oct 13,   There's power in unity and it's always a great thing to see small communities come together to discuss ways of improving the places they call home. If we join forces, a lot can happen - and it all starts with a vision. Speaking with the individuals of rural areas and creating solutions to further advance their communities is what I truly enjoy. As the Administrator for USDA Rural Housing Service, listening to the voices of people in small communities and making their vision become a reality is something I strive to achieve. I recently took a trip to Higginsville, Missouri to join Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, Representative for Missouri's 5th District, as well as our Missouri State Director for USDA Rural Development, Janie Dunning and her excellent staff as we discussed the possibility of growth in workforce housing with several community, economic and housing development representatives in Central Missouri. As part of his effort to maintain and expand rural housing opportunities across the state, Congressman Cleaver initiated this roundtable meeting to establish a conversation between a few community leaders he had in mind who would take action to develop a plan. By taking this important first step, the Congressman focused on bringing awareness to the problems at hand and identifying solutions. This roundtable discussion put rural housing options to the forefront as we shared each community’s needs and what had to be done for the advancement in their areas. Knowing the infrastructure issues at hand, we deliberated the idea of collaborating with local home developers and organizations to get the gears running and make this goal of housing development happen. After gathering with the economic development representatives, we met with local lenders and realtors to not only share thoughts on future housing efforts, but to also recognize them for their tremendous contributions to housing in the region. These valuable relationships with lenders, realtors, business leaders and organizations give countless people places to call home. I feel quite honored to be part of Congressman Cleaver’s plan of meeting the rural development needs in Central Missouri. The establishment of workforce housing in this region will generate more options for growth and economic advancement. Moving forward, the Congressman’s efforts are resulting in further meetings on workforce housing development and USDA Rural Development will continue to be involved with this initiative.

"Using Gypsum to Help Reduce Phosphorus Runoff  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. When it rains it pours. Whether we get a passing shower or a day-long downpour, the runoff ends up in rivers, streams and waterways. That runoff may include nutrients from fertilizers, and one of those nutrients is phosphorus. Phosphorus runoff is causing blooms of harmful algae that deplete waterways of oxygen, resulting in “dead zones” that damage ecosystems vital for aquatic life. It’s a problem in many of the waterways we all depend on for recreation and drinking water, including the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay.  Just last year, Maryland’s outgoing governor proposed land use regulations designed specifically to reduce phosphorus runoff in the Chesapeake watershed.

"New Fund, Established as Part of White House Rural Council's ""Made in Rural America"" Export and Investment Initiative, Now Allows USDA to Facilitate Private Equity Investments in Agriculture-related Businesses  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .14  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  Cedar Rapids, Iowa, April 21, – As part of the Obama Administration's new ""Made in Rural America"" export and investment initiative, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced the creation of a new investment fund that will help propel the growth of small businesses across rural America. The new Rural Business Investment Company (RBIC) will now allow USDA to facilitate private equity investments in agriculture-related businesses. Currently, USDA programs exist to help provide loans or loan guarantees to help rural businesses grow, but many small cutting-edge businesses also need equity support in addition to or instead of borrowed funds.Advantage Capital Partners, which will manage the new fund, and their partners from eight Farm Credit institutions have pledged to invest nearly $150 million into the new effort.""This new fund will allow innovative small businesses throughout rural America to access the capital they need to grow and create jobs,"" Vilsack said. ""One of USDA's top priorities is to help reenergize the rural economy, and we now have a powerful new tool available to help achieve that goal. This new partnership will allow us to facilitate private investment in businesses working in bio-manufacturing, advanced energy production, local and regional food systems, improved farming technologies and other cutting-edge fields.""The fund is being formed under the USDA's Rural Business Investment Program (RBIP). USDA utilizes RBIP to license funds to invest in enterprises that will create growth and job opportunities in rural areas, with an emphasis on smaller enterprises. Working through the USDA program enables licensed funds to raise capital from Farm Credit System banks and associations.The Farm Credit System, a nationwide network of banks and lending associations specifically chartered to serve agriculture and the U.S. rural economy, is an essential provider of credit to agriculture and rural America. This new partnership between Farm Credit institutions and Advantage Capital, a leading growth capital and small business finance firm, brings together resources and people that are focused on providing more private capital, small business investment and quality jobs to rural America. This public-private partnership will have a tangible positive impact on our rural economy and is a model of how government can serve as a catalyst for private investment in rural America.Eight Farm Credit institutions providing initial investments in the RBIC fund are: AgStar Financial Services (Mankato, Minn.); AgriBank (St. Paul, Minn.); Capital Farm Credit (Bryan, Texas); CoBank (Denver, Colo.); Farm Credit Bank of Texas (Austin, Texas); Farm Credit Services of America (Omaha, Neb.); Farm Credit Mid-America (Louisville, Ky.); and United Farm Credit Service (Willmar, Minn.).USDA also announced that it will be accepting applications for other new Rural Business Investment Companies such as the one announced today. Interested applicants have until July 29th to submit their applications for review in FY. Any application accepted after this deadline will be held for consideration next year. USDA intends to accept RBIC applications through , detailed information including application materials and instructions can be found at: addition, Secretary Vilsack said that the White House Rural Council, as part of the Made in Rural America initiative, will convene the Rural Opportunity Investment Conference later this year to attract additional investments to rural America by connecting major investors with rural business leaders, government officials, economic development experts and other partners.

The Council coordinates the Administration's efforts in rural America by streamlining and improving the effectiveness of federal programs serving rural America; engage stakeholders, including farmers, ranchers, and local citizens, on issues and solutions in rural communities; and promoting and coordinating private-sector partnerships. With the signing of the Farm Bill in early February, President Obama directed the Council to lead a new ""Made in Rural America"" export and investment initiative, charged with bringing together Federal resources to help rural businesses and leaders take advantage of new investment opportunities and access new customers and markets abroad. The work of the White House Rural Council and USDA to bring investment to rural America is an example of how the Administration is creating smart partnerships with the private sector to better support Americans in all parts of the country.About USDA's Rural Business Investment Program (RBIP)The Rural Business Investment Program promotes economic development in mostly rural areas by helping to meet the equity capital investment needs of smaller enterprises in such areas. USDA licenses newly formed for-profit investment fund entities as Rural Business Investment Companies (RBICs). RBICs use the equity raised in capitalizing their fund to make equity and equity-like investments mostly in smaller enterprises located primarily in rural areas.About the Farm Credit SystemFor nearly a century, Farm Credit has been a national provider of credit and related services to rural America through its cooperative network of customer-owned lending institutions.

The trunk of the oak tree behind has an approximate age of 350 years.  Seventy-five years ago, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Soil Conservation Service, now the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), was established largely because of the efforts of one determined individual—Hugh Hammond Bennett. Bennett served as the agency’s first chief for more than 15 years, tirelessly working to educate others about the seriousness of soil erosion. On Friday, October 15, nearly 20 NRCS employees and friends took time off from work and to be Earth Team volunteers, planting oak seedlings, azaleas and phlox in Hugh Hammond Bennett’s memory at his former home. While chief of NRCS, Bennett lived in McLean, Virginia, on a two-acre tract of land called “Eight Oaks” after a prominent feature of the property. His landscape also boasted magnificent flocks of rose-colored azaleas and phlox. In the years since, the landscape had changed quite a bit. For example, until Friday, only two oaks remained on the property. In celebration of NRCS’ 75th anniversary, several NRCS employees initiated a project to honor the man who started it all by restoring his former home’s landscape to its former glory. Andree DuVarney, a special assistant to the chief, lives in Bennett’s former neighborhood. She learned from the current owners that a conservation easement had been placed on the property to protect it from development and that the owners welcomed the idea of a restoration project. A team consisting of DuVarney, Management Analyst Denise Decker, National Landscape Architect Bob Snieckus and National Plants Materials Center Manager Jeremy West brought this project to fruition. Together, they developed an impressive landscape plan to restore key elements of the landscape that existed when Bennett lived there. A key part of the restoration plan was for the property to once again showcase eight beautiful white, willow and scarlet oak trees. After the volunteer team had planted the other five new oaks, NRCS Chief Dave White and property co-owner Brian Symmes planted the last oak seedling together as the other volunteers observed. With that final step, the living tribute to Bennett was complete. Get more information on both NRCS’ 75th anniversary and Hugh Hammond Bennett here. Follow NRCS on Twitter.

"Director of Transportation Services Division in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 11,  Grain in eastern Washington. AMS has been tracking and gathering datasets for grain transportation for over a decade. Photo by Sparktography. The United States proudly touts a long history of grain production and is the top exporter of grain in the world. Half of our wheat, almost 40 percent of soybeans and almost a fifth of our corn are exported.  That’s why for over a decade the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service has been tracking and gathering datasets for grain transportation, including prices, deliveries, movements, sales and freight rates, and now, for the first time, we’ve released our historic in an excel  format. Because grains are not only the cornerstone of the world’s food supply but also of global agricultural commodity exchanges, there is inherent value in being able to look at a decade’s worth of grain transportation . With this information, researchers should be able to identify trends more easily, as well as make projections based on observable or emerging patterns. As part of USDA’s commitment to transparency and open government, the new dataset is available through .gov. Through the website, users can formulate, structure, and analyze raw figures to suit their unique needs. The agricultural industry can explore opportunities in the market armed with more information than ever before. The Transportation and Marketing Program within AMS will continue to add to the raw set every week, building on the information to keep it up to date and accurate. It’s all a part of the weekly Grain Transportation Report the agency issues every Thursday. The Grain Transportation Report details grain transportation information, including costs of shipping grain commodities, top destinations for U.S. grain exports, topical events affecting transport, and current trends in the business. We invite all stakeholders within the grain industry to take a look. Growers, shippers, distributors, and exporters will find the most immediate value in the information. However, we also anticipate that economists, statisticians, researchers, and others will find value in the raw .

"USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Conservation  Research and Science  Aug 17,  Former Montana State University student Ashley Williams meets with residents of Sanambele, Mali, to discuss water quality issues affecting the community. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA's rich science and research portfolio.   In , as a junior at Montana State University (MSU), Ashley Williams knew she wanted to use her geography degree to make a difference internationally. She had no idea that agriculture would ever play a role in making that dream come true. But that’s what happened when Williams found herself in a small farming village of 1,000 people in Sanambele, Mali, after a chance encounter with MSU entomology professor Florence Dunkel. “Agriculture? I never even considered it. Now I work as a Forest Service hydrologist and collaborate with farmers on stream restoration projects to protect the environment,” Williams said. Dunkel was the recipient of a USDA Higher Education Challenge Grant from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. She used the grant money to give her students experiential learning opportunities that would prepare them to enter the agricultural science workforce. “The Challenge Grant unbound my students from the narrow definitions of agricultural education,” Dunkel said. From early research efforts, Williams learned that diarrhea, mainly from poor water quality, was a major contributor to childhood death. But when she got to Sanambele, the community had other ideas about what her mission should be. Working with the Mali Agricultural Research Organization (IER), she learned through participatory, gender-based focus groups with local famers that malaria was the most feared killer of children. Williams credits Sidy Ba, a professor at Mali’s agricultural college, and IER’s Assa Kante with helping her ask the right questions in a culturally sensitive way, and for helping her get permission from village chiefs to conduct her surveys. She is now working with Ba on a project relating to diarrhea and water quality in villages near Mopti, Mali, the results of which they plan to publish. “Florence gives you a lot of freedom,” Williams said. “Through her program, however, I developed my interest in science and learned how to conduct research that has carried me into graduate school and a future career in water quality.”  Category/Topic:  Conservation  Research and Science  Tags:  Conservation  Science Tuesday  water",Here's a clear and specific question related to agriculture: What is the relationship between experiential learning opportunities in agricultural education and the development of students' interests in science careers?,"The USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture's Higher Education Challenge Grant provided to Florence Dunkel enabled her to give her students experiential learning opportunities, which helped unbound them from narrow definitions of agricultural education. As a result, one of her students, Ashley Williams, developed an interest in science careers, specifically in water quality, and was able to apply this knowledge in real-world projects, leading to a future career in the field."
"U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 24,  Angelica Perez-Delgado (far right) with an international drilling crew, worked on disaster relief in the nation of Georgia as one of her first assignments with the Forest Service. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service Six months after being hired by the U.S. Forest Service, Angelica Perez-Delgado made a major impact, including international assistance to the country of Georgia, on her way to being named Rookie of the Year for the Pacific Southwest Region late in . When a major storm event triggered a landslide in the Black Sea facing nation of Georgia in early this past year, destroying roadways, the country turned to the U.S. Forest Service for assistance. Almost immediately, Perez-Delgado started assisting the Forest Service project team for Georgia with support in mapping and computerized drawings. The recent Chico State University grad, from Burney, Calif., was hired by the Shasta-Trinity National Forest as a Civil Engineer less than one year after graduating college and was already involved in an important international project. “She did a great job with email instructions and coming up with the product that was needed in the summer of right after the landslide,” said Rene Renteria, geotechnical and dams group leader with the U.S. Forest Service. “When I had the opportunity to create a team to go over to Tbilisi, Georgia this past January through February, I wanted her civil engineering skills. I was impressed right away with her go-to attitude.” For Georgia, Perez-Delgado designed the new roadway alignment and tunnel location outside the boundaries of the landslide using LIDAR, Autocad and Civil 3D.  She provided everything needed, including plan and profile drawings and calculations in metric, to begin construction for emergency response. Angelica provided drawings of what the roads should look like to include a retaining wall, culverts and estimates on how much the costs would be for local contractors. Oftentimes, her work included standing outside in minus 10 degree Celsius doing surveys. That didn’t stop her from getting the job done, in fact, Perez-Delgado was more concerned about her colleagues in Georgia. “They have such a crazy work ethic there,” she said.  “One guy didn’t even have a warm coat or gloves, but here he was out there with me in such cold weather. I told him to take a break and warm up his hands in the car.” Angelica Perez-Delgado takes a selfie in the freezing temperature of winter in the mountain of the nation of Georgia.

"RD Northeast Region Coordinator in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 02,  Grill Masters FNCS Under Secretary Kevin Concannon, MRP Under Secretary Edward Avalos, and FSIS Deputy Under Secretary Brian Ronholm grill hot dogs for the event.) Last Friday, with the sun shining down and the DJ playing “Givin’ Up Food for Funk”, national office USDA employees celebrated the end of a successful Feds Feed Families campaign at the USDA Summer Bash.  Given the level of fun that was had, I think it’s safe to say that it was the first annual USDA Summer Bash. Of course, we took full advantage of this last opportunity to collect food donations, and we offered hot dogs fresh off the grill (many thanks to our Grill Masters, MRP Under Secretary Edward Avalos, FNCS Under Secretary Kevin Concannon, and FSIS Deputy Under Secretary Brian Ronholm) as well as chips, fruit, and dessert, in exchange for a suggested five-pound donation of produce or canned foods. Event volunteers Kimberly Warren from FSIS, Kelly Hereth from FSA, Jay Huffman from FSIS, and Oliver Character from RMA.) The aroma of hot dogs on the grill and the expertly curated soundtrack of classic funk and soul music not only lured USDA employees from their desks but also lured plenty of tourists from the National Mall.  As a result, the USDA Summer Bash netted a total of 1,935 pounds of healthful produce and canned goods to donate to local families in need.  And within the Department, we had a friendly competition that pitted the Mission Areas against each other to see who could bring in the most donations.  The Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services (FNCS) won the competition with a total of 249 pounds of donated food, though the Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services (FFAS) gave FNCS a run for their money, coming in at 237 pounds.  Great work to both Mission Areas! DJ Daniel Musisi plays music for the USDA Summer Bash benefitting Feds Feed Families.) While the campaign-wide Feds Feed Families totals are not yet in – they will be calculated in the next couple weeks, the nationwide network of USDA employees should certainly be proud of what we’ve accomplished in three short summer months.  As Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan reminded us at the Summer Bash, though Department of Defense may edge USDA out as the highest contributing agency, we can still count this campaign as a major win.  It’s a win, because Federal employees across the country banded together to organize food drives in their respective communities to ensure that their friends and neighbors had access to healthy food this summer. And, ahem, it’s also a win, because we’re pretty sure USDA brought in more donations per capita than any other Federal Department.  Not that we were keeping track. In all seriousness though, I want to thank all the USDA employees who were generous not only with their donations but also with the time they spent volunteering with the Feds Feed Families campaign and related events.  Special thanks also to Assistant Secretary for Administration Pearlie Reed, Deputy Under Secretary Karis Gutter, and Director of the Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships, Max Finberg, for lending a helping hand at the event.

"Hoosier National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Sep 25,  The Ohio River Foundation crewmembers Lydia Cook, Rose Guardino, Rose Johnson, Catherine Kagemann, Callie Schulenburg, and Brynne Taylor build a pollinator habitat. USFS Photo. Streams will flow more freely and bees will have a new home on the Hoosier National Forest, thanks to the work of six young women from central Indiana. The women -- recent high school graduates from Bloomington High School North and South, a high school senior from Bedford, Ind., and an Indiana University student – spent three weeks in July working on ecological restoration projects in the forest. The crew was hired by the Ohio River Foundation and funded through grants from Duke Energy-Indiana, the Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The crew’s first project was to reduce sediment in streams and tributaries that flow into the Ohio River. The crew “hardened” stream crossings by placing about 100 tons of gravel that will hold soil in place and reduce the impact of horses on the trails. The women also learned about ecological conservation. Steve Harris, a wildlife biologist on the Hoosier, taught the importance of pollinators in the forest by building a pollinator “condo.”  The condo consists of a four-by-four-foot wooden frame with large tree limbs stacked inside.  Holes and crevices are cut into the limbs to provide places for pollinators to nest in. “The idea is to build a habitat where native pollinators and other beneficial insects will want to live,” said Harris. Harris and the Ohio River Foundation crew spent a day designing and building the habitat.  They added their own special flair on the project by carving “HNF” and a peace sign into the log.  It is the only pollinator condo on the Hoosier so far. The crew was disappointed the following weekend when they learned that a camper used the bee condo for firewood.  The crew spent a second day rebuilding the habitat and posted a sign to alert campers that this was an important part of the forest and not firewood.

"What is the Nine Agency Rule? The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights (OASCR) enforces the Nine Agency Rule under the authority delegated by the Secretary of Agriculture, pursuant to 7 C.F.R. § 2.25 (a). The Nine Agency Rule is designed to ensure that USDA programs of civil rights, including program delivery, compliance, and equal employment opportunity, adhere to all governing laws, rules, and regulations, including related Executive Orders and Congressional mandates. On February 14, , President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., signed Executive Order 5, establishing the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, emphasizing the importance of partnering with civil society, including faith-based and secular organizations, to serve people in need while adhering to all governing laws. This Executive Order revoked Executive Order 1 and reinstated key provisions to protect religious liberty. Key Provisions of the Nine Agency Rule  Equal Access for Faith-Based Organizations  Under 7 CFR § 16, faith-based organizations are eligible to access and participate in USDA assistance programs on the same basis as any other organization. USDA and its intermediaries must not discriminate against or for an organization based on its religious character, motives, affiliation, or lack thereof.  Non-Discrimination Against Beneficiaries  Organizations receiving direct or indirect Federal financial assistance from USDA must not discriminate against current or prospective beneficiaries based on religion, religious belief, refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice.  Separation of Religious Activities  Organizations that receive USDA direct assistance must separate any explicitly religious activities in time or location from the programs or services funded by USDA direct assistance, ensuring participation in such activities is voluntary. This restriction does not apply to indirect Federal financial assistance.  Notification Requirements  Recipients administering USDA social service programs must notify beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries of their right to be free from religious discrimination and how to report violations.  Alternative Providers  If a beneficiary objects to the religious character of a faith-based provider, the USDA awarding agency must make reasonable efforts to refer the beneficiary to an alternative provider.  Protections for Faith-Based Providers  Faith-based providers can compete equally with secular organizations for USDA awards while retaining their religious character, provided they comply with all applicable regulations. Examples of Nine Agency Rule Violations  Denied Service Based on Religious Beliefs  A food pantry volunteer denies service to an individual wearing a religious head covering and makes derogatory remarks about their faith.  Discriminatory Practices by Service Providers  A service provider receiving USDA funds denies services to a homeowner based on their perceived religion, using offensive language, and failing to address the discrimination. How to File a Complaint Any individual who believes they have been discriminated against based on religion, religious belief, refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice may file a complaint with OASCR.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. To celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, USDA’s Research, Education, and Economics mission area will highlight those who are making significant contributions to American agriculture. Swimming and visiting beaches are what most of us think of as summer activities.  Although the name Bod Pod sounds like something you might find at the beach, and a swim suit and cap are the usual attire, Dr. Alicia Gonzalez-Quiroz, faculty member of Loredo Community College, never imagined this would be on her summer to-do list.  The Bod Pod is actually a research tool used to measure lean body mass at the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Body Composition Laboratory of the Children’s Nutrition Research Center in Houston, TX. Dr. Gonzalez-Quiroz is part of an exclusive group of faculty members from Hispanic Serving Institutions, which partnered with ARS scientists from across the country to learn about agriculture research and develop tools to use with their students.  The Bod Pod is one tool that works by measuring body volume through the displacement of air in the enclosed chamber. Body volume is combined with body weight (mass) to determine the individual’s body density. The technique then estimates the percentage of body fat and lean body mass through equations for the density of fat and fat free mass.  This modern method to measure body mass replaces underwater weighing. With the lab’s research focused on promoting healthy eating and physical activity in families and youth, Dr. Gonzalez-Quiroz’s participation resulted from her selection as a Fellow in the E. Kika de la Garza Science Program coordinated through the USDA Hispanic-Serving Institutions National Program.  Since , the E. Kika De La Garza Fellowship Program offers faculty from Hispanic-serving institutions the opportunity to work collaboratively with USDA to gain insight and understanding of the Federal Government, and to enhance professional growth while fostering workforce diversity.  Selected through a competitive evaluation process, Science Fellows spend a week during the summer in Washington, DC learning about USDA agencies and meeting with key administration and staff before traveling to an ARS lab to team up with USDA researchers. This year, scientific disciplines varied from studying invasive pest management; to enhancing the nutritional components of plant species; to the science associated with childhood obesity issues.  Joining ARS labs from Hawaii, Florida, and Texas, Fellows became immersed in the USDA research experience. “I truly became engaged in the areas of which USDA operates,” Gonzalez-Quiroz noted at the completion of the program.  “I am now able to give insight to my students on what research and internship opportunities await them.” The competitive selection process for next year’s Research Fellows begins in the spring.  If you are a member of faculty serving our Hispanic Serving Institutes and interested in this special opportunity, please contact Dan Wueste, Program Manager. He can be contacted at daniel.wueste@osec.usda.gov for more information.

"Specialty Crops Program Market News Director, USDA Agricultural Marketing Service in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Jul 20,  AMS plays an integral role by providing organic , standards, and other resources to small producers and consumers across the country. Consumers can find certified organic products at most grocery stores and demand for organic products continues to increase, with U.S. retail sales valued at more than $43 billion in .  Organic products are grown, raised and produced by over 31,000 certified operations, and many of those operations receive higher prices, or premiums, for their products. Recently, USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) issued a report entitled Changes in Retail Organic Price Premiums from to .  The report highlights the retail price premium charged for organic foods compared to conventional products.  For the report, ERS used a virtual shopping basket of 17 products and collected from Nielsen scanners to calculate the organic prices and how they changed from -. USDA Market News – administered by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) – has expanded upon this research to find current year-to-date organic prices, as well as the current prices for selected commodities using weekly advertised specials.  By using these retail advertised prices captured “at a moment in time” in the weekly National Retail Report, USDA Market News shows a current price premium for selected items and the six month average for the same items.  The allows a near-real time look at the prices from weekly advertised specials from about 330 chain groceries, with nearly 26,000 individual stores nationwide.  The information is collected by AMS Market Reporters from grocery store ads. While looking at the for current retail advertisements, Market News found that the organic price premiums for eggs and milk were among the highest for all commodities, while salad mix was the highest among the produce items.  Fresh fruits and vegetables reflected a broader range in the premium prices depending on the specific item.  The prices charged for organic versus conventional products are generally higher, with organic items running higher in the advertised weekly specials in the July 1, , time period.  These premiums are often a reflection of consumer demand and the additional production and handling costs it takes to produce organic food. Prices for organic products are occasionally lower than their conventional counterparts, such as red delicious apples in the June 10th period.  In the report on that date, organic red delicious apples were offered at a negative premium of 20 percent under conventional red delicious apples.  As expected, throughout any given year, consumers may find a seasonal gradation of price premiums for organic produce. By publishing current prices, USDA Market News give organic farmers, producers and other agricultural businesses the information they need to evaluate market conditions, identify trends, make purchasing decisions, and monitor price patterns. As consumer demand for organic food keeps growing, USDA Market News and other AMS programs – including USDA’s National Organic Program – continue to play an integral role by providing , standards, and other resources to small producers and consumers across the country.

"Under Secretary, Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  Nov 01,   Today, President Obama established a Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience to advise the Administration on how the Federal Government can respond to the needs of communities facing the impacts of climate change. This is an important step in our shared effort to respond to climate change - and like the President's broader Climate Action Plan, it will help American agriculture mitigate and adapt to the impacts of a changing climate. America's farmers, ranchers and landowners have long been tremendous stewards of our environment. At USDA, we have worked with a record number of producers and landowners over the course of the Obama Administration to help conserve the soil and water, and clean our air - more than half a million over the past four and a half years. Meanwhile, in support of the Climate Action Plan, USDA put forward a series of new policies in June to help agriculture develop new climate solutions in the months and years to come. We have taken steps to create seven new regional climate hubs that will aid in sharing climate information for farmers and ranchers. We released the results of the Rapid Carbon Assessment - the largest-ever survey of soil carbon to help improve research efforts. And our new COMET-Farm tool provides a way for producers to see the impacts conservation practices could have on their land. This new Executive Order directs Federal agencies to engage in similar efforts across the government. Together, we'll be sure that modern Federal programs work for farmers and ranchers to mitigate the impacts of climate change. We will ensure that our risk management and conservation programs allow producers to undertake modern practices and provide new possibilities for producers and landowners to capitalize on their good stewardship. We'll continue to help producers manage land and water by increasing participation in conservation programs on farms and private forest lands. We'll build on the Rapid Carbon Assessment and COMET-Farm tools to continue providing useful and information to help prepare for climate change impacts. And USDA scientists will continue a wide range of groundbreaking research to learn more about the impacts of climate change on agriculture.

"Agricultural Research Service in  Conservation  Aug 05,  Agricultural research science technician Fred Engstrom (left), a parent volunteer and two Central Elementary students measure out lumber for building raised beds at Noah’s Garden.  As an agricultural research science technician at the Agricultural Research Service’s (ARS) North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station in Ames, Iowa, Fred Engstrom’s responsibilities are wide-ranging. They include tasks from managing the station’s nursery and field plots to modifying research equipment and collecting yield for critical projects such as the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize program. But the ARS station isn’t the only beneficiary of Engstrom’s versatile contributions. His time and technical know-how have also been praised by members of Central Elementary in Nevada, Iowa, where Engstrom helped to build the raised beds and irrigation system for the school’s community garden, dubbed “Noah’s Garden.” The school began the project in to provide over 350 students from 16 classrooms with a hands-on opportunity to grow their own food while simultaneously incorporating concepts in math, science, language and other academic fields. The students, together with their teachers and parents or guardians, participate in the Noah’s Garden project from seeding to harvest. What the families don’t take home—which can include tomatoes, lettuce, beets, broccoli, peppers, sweet corn, carrots, string beans, and other produce—is donated to local food-distribution centers. “Fred Engstrom has been an active supporter of our garden from the beginning,” says Jamie Hughet, a Central Elementary teacher and project organizer. “He was instrumental in preparing the garden and materials of the initial eight 4- by 8-foot beds and the wood-chip paths. He investigated a proper soil mixture for our area and designed the irrigation system.” In , he helped add 10 more beds, expanding the garden area to 35- by 45-feet, she added. The students are assigned one raised bed per class and get to choose what they want to plant. Some have done theme gardens, including pizza and salsa gardens, as well as flower gardens displaying Iowa State University . Throughout, says Hughet, the students record and chart seed growth, conduct germination trials and keep weekly plant-observation journals. Engstrom is modest about his contributions to Noah’s Garden, but it’s clear he’s gotten as much out of the project as he has given working as a parent volunteer with the students and their families. “I feel it’s beneficial for our kids to reconnect to the land in a dirty-hands kind of way,” he says. “I also find having parents involved working with other parents and children creates a good example for the children to see and hopefully emulate.”  Category/Topic:  Conservation  Tags:  ARS  gardens  Iowa  Iowa State University  Irrigation  volunteers","Here is a clear and specific question related to agriculture: What are some effective ways to engage students in hands-on agricultural projects, such as gardening and seed growth, while incorporating academic concepts?","Some effective ways to engage students in hands-on agricultural projects, such as gardening and seed growth, while incorporating academic concepts include: * Assigning each class a raised bed to choose what they want to plant * Conducting germination trials and keeping weekly plant-observation journals * Recording and charting seed growth * Designating theme gardens, such as pizza or salsa gardens, and flower gardens displaying Iowa State University flowers * Involving parents as volunteers to work with students and their families, creating a good example for the children to see and emulate."
"Hill Farm Buzzing with Pollinator Success  Since it’s National Pollinator Week, it seemed fitting to express my thanks to farmers Scott and Susan Hill - who run the Hill Farm outside Charlottesville, VA.  Earlier, I had the chance to visit their 10-acre property former tobacco farm to see firsthand how hard they are working to grow a variety of produce for the local customers. But there are more little workers helping on the Hill Farm too. Pollinators! In the United States, about one third of all agricultural output depends on pollinators. Insects and other animal pollinators are vital to the production of healthy crops for food, fibers, edible oils, medicines, and other products. It’s clear that pollinators are important to the Hill Farm for their production of their artisan and specialty varieties of several vegetables, including lettuce, asparagus, tomatoes and even golden beets.  And the first year, the addition of bees increased their tomato production by 25 percent.

"Why I Love New Mexico’s Forests and Public Lands  I heard a story once about “horny toads” from my mother. How she used to catch so many they filled a shoebox. And my grandfather told me about the Lobo’s howl. Both of these animals are rare or endangered now and I have not found one myself. I hope one day to tell my own children about the animals I experience in the forests of New Mexico. Tadpoles, horned owls, fence-tail lizards, trout, coyotes and bats. We hike through the forest into the Rio Grande gorge and I know it is magic. The beauty of it all is more than enchanting, it takes my breath away, or brings me back to it in a way.

"Spring Climate Trends Changing in the Northeast  All this month we will be taking a look at what a changing climate means to Agriculture. The ten regional USDA Climate Hubs were established to synthesize and translate climate science and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers that are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA's Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate. You might have noticed spring-like weather in the Northeast is arriving earlier than usual.  There is reliable evidence from many studies that conditions in the Northeast and upper Midwest have become warmer and wetter in recent decades, especially before the coming of winter and spring.  The spring-like warmth has snow melting faster and plant growth starting sooner.  On average, the last spring frost in the Northeast is about a week earlier now than it was 30 years ago.  The change is not as positive as one might expect since the start of growth for many plants has shifted even earlier than the last frost date leading to increased chances of frost damage.  This happens most often when unusually warm temperatures in March are followed within 2-5 weeks by a frost event.  In , record high March temperatures were followed by record low temperatures (for the date) at the end of April with terrible consequences for fruit growers across Michigan, Ontario, New York, Vermont, and surrounding states.  In some places losses were almost total.  In something of a repeat, unusual warmth in the Northeast this past winter was interrupted by very cold outbreaks in mid-February and early April.  This combination was particularly bad for peaches in New Jersey, Connecticut, parts of New York, and other northeastern states where greater than 90% losses have been reported.

"USDA One Health Joint Working Group Co-Chair and Deputy Administrator, Animal Production and Protection, USDA Agricultural Research Service in  Animals  Plants  Nov 18,  ARS scientists identifying bacterial pathogens in the lab. Photo by Peggy Greb. Antibiotics are lifesavers. We depend on them to treat bacterial infections and diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis and strep throat, as well as ear infections and infected wounds. In response to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance, veterinarians and producers are moving toward more judicious antibiotic use in food animals, while keeping them healthy and ensuring that our food supply remains safe. This is especially important because certain bacterial strains have become resistant to some of the current antibiotics used to treat infections in humans and animals, escalating the need worldwide to find and develop alternatives to antibiotics. The USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is developing new technologies to address antibiotic resistance and reduce the use of antibiotics through agricultural management, which includes food, animals, crops and the environment—water, soil and climate. This research falls into USDA’s One Health approach when mitigating the problems associated with antibiotic resistance.  One Health is the concept that the health of animals, the health of people, and the viability of ecosystems are intricately linked. A One Health approach embraces the idea that a disease problem impacting the health of humans, animals, and the environment can only be solved through improved communication, cooperation, and collaboration across disciplines and institutions. With its partners, USDA’s objective through this multidisciplinary approach is to preserve, maintain or reduce health risks to animals, humans, the environment and society. USDA has gained in-depth knowledge about antimicrobial resistance through its work on the agricultural environment, animal health and food safety. Over the years, scientists have developed and patented new technologies that could help reduce the use of antibiotics. Discoveries include using natural supplements like vitamin D to treat a condition of dairy cows called “mastitis,” which affects milk quality and production of cattle. Vitamin D, as well as yeast, also has the potential to treat turkey diseases. In addition, scientists have shown that non-antibiotic methods, such as essential oils in citrus, reduce foodborne pathogens found in the gut of animals; that phytochemicals—natural chemicals found in such plants as safflower, plums and peppers—enhance the immune system of chickens; and that certain natural compounds kill foodborne pathogens like Salmonella or Escherichia coli O157:H7. Other research breakthroughs include creating new, effective antimicrobials and vaccines to fight such pathogens as Salmonella and Campylobacter to lower their incidence in chickens and turkeys and help keep consumers healthy. Finding alternatives to antibiotics has become a global issue as the demand for animal food products increases to meet the nutritional needs of a growing population. ARS scientists continue to seek solutions by developing new methods to control and prevent animal diseases and reduce bacterial pathogens in our food supply. ARS scientists are studying a variety of techniques to ensure our food supply remains safe. Photo by Peggy Greb.

"Food Safety Education Staff Deputy Director, USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Nov 10,  Safety first this Thanksgiving. The USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline has been answering consumer questions related to Holiday meals for over 25 years. Of course, we get the usual questions about buying, thawing and roasting a turkey. But we also get some of the same not-so-typical questions each year. You may have had these questions yourself. How long will it take to cook two turkeys at the same time? The cooking time is determined by the weight of one bird—not the combined weight. Use the weight of the smaller bird to determine cooking time.  Use a food thermometer to check the internal temperature of the smaller bird first and then check the second bird. A whole turkey is safe when cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 165 °F as measured with a food thermometer.  Check the internal temperature in the innermost part of the thigh and wing and the thickest part of the breast.  When cooking two turkeys at the same time make sure there is enough oven space for proper heat circulation. How long will it take to cook a turkey weighing over 25 lbs? To cook a large turkey use the Timetables for Turkey Roasting for an unstuffed turkey, which can be found in Turkey Basics: Safe Cooking. Add 10 minutes per pound for turkeys over 24 pounds. We don’t recommend stuffing a turkey over 24 pounds. Make sure you have a heavy pan large enough to hold the turkey. Be sure to make sure there is enough space in the oven for proper heat circulation. If a turkey has a “pop-up” temperature indicator do I still need to use a thermometer? Pop-up temperature indicators are constructed from a food-approved nylon. The indicator pops up when the food has reached the final temperature for safety and doneness. Pop-up temperature indicators have been produced since and are reliable to within 1 to 2 °F if accurately placed in the product. But it is also suggested that the temperature be checked with a conventional food thermometer in the innermost part of the thigh and wing and the thickest part of the breast to ensure safety. Is it safe to cook a turkey from the frozen state? Yes, it is safe to cook a turkey from the frozen state. The cooking time will take at least 50% longer than recommended for a fully thawed turkey. Remember to remove the giblet packages during the cooking time. Remove the packages carefully with tongs or a fork. Can I call the Meat & Poultry Hotline on Thanksgiving Day? Yes! The Hotline will be staffed from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern Time on Thanksgiving Day. Call us toll-free at 1-888-674-. (Our usual hours are Monday through Friday, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Eastern Time.)

"Virginia Is for Lovers - and Silvopasture  Throughout his life, Chris Fields-Johnson has been keenly aware of the need to preserve the natural landscapes, which provide us with clean air to breathe, water to drink and food to eat. As a graduate student of soil science at Virginia State and Polytechnic University, a forestry undergraduate, a student of Tom Brown, Jr.’s Tracker School and a former employee of the Virginia Department of Forestry, he also knows much of the science behind soil restoration and forestry. These experiences have given him a strong desire to turn his knowledge into action by managing land in the most beneficial way possible. To make this dream a reality, he began converting a 250-acre loblolly pine plantation in Scottsville, Virginia., into a goat and sheep silvopasture system that resembles a pine savanna landscape. Silvopasture combines trees with forage and livestock production. The trees are managed for high-value sawlogs and, at the same time, provide shade and shelter for livestock and forage, reducing livestock stress and sometimes improving forage quality. Fields-Johnson and friends have spent many weekends thinning and pruning trees by hand, conducting controlled burns, fighting invasive plants and experimenting with forage establishment while they also learn how to raise goats and sheep.

"Passionate Couple, USDA, Team up for 'Miracle:' Bringing Back the American Chestnut  It was on a hilltop in eastern Kentucky where I first met James and Gail Cope, looking at the 27 newly planted American chestnut seedlings on their land. It was our common love for this rare tree that brought us together. American chestnut trees once dominated the Appalachian landscape, but during the early s a fungus struck the trees causing them nearly to vanish. The American Chestnut Blight, an Asian fungus, first struck in in New York City and quickly spread, leaving in its wake a trail of dead and dying stems.  By the s, the keystone species of some nine million acres of forests had disappeared. The tree is important because it produces bushels of nuts for wildlife, and animals like squirrels, wild turkey, white-tailed deer, black bear, and grouse depend on the nuts for a major food source.

"Under Secretary, USDA Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 19,   In my position as Under Secretary, I occasionally travel the country to meet with, and learn from, some of the many partners who administer and leverage the USDA’s 15 nutrition assistance programs. These programs—from school meals to SNAP (formerly food stamps)—currently touch the lives of one in four Americans. During a whirlwind visit to Minnesota in March, I had the opportunity to meet with a variety of individuals and organizations directly or indirectly involved with one or more of our nutrition programs. For starters, I participated in a terrific roundtable at the University of Minnesota’s School of Public Health hosted by national nutrition expert Dr. Mary Story, a strong supporter of healthy school meals. Minnesota Senator Al Franken joined me to hear from local organizations and agencies that administer nutrition assistance programs, promote good nutrition or even work with farmers markets. I was impressed with the accomplishments being realized and the creative approaches employed by local partners to improve nutrition, eliminate hunger, support children and families, and connect farmers to local markets. Congresswoman Betty McCollum, a long-time supporter of Farm to School, joins Under Secretary Concannon and St. Paul students. The Congresswoman co-hosted the visit with St. Paul Schools Nutrition Director Jean Ronnei.  The next day Congresswoman Betty McCollum joined me to visit one of the largest school meals operations in the country - the St. Paul Public Schools. Nationally recognized for her success in serving from-scratch meals and sourcing from local farmers, St. Paul Public Schools nutrition director Jean Ronnei gave us a tour of a facility that cranks out 50,000 fresh, healthy meals each day that meet and often exceed USDA’s new school meal standards. Recently, the school district received a USDA Farm to School grant to expand its efforts and continue to source buffalo meat, cranberries, carrots, potatoes and a host of other food products from Minnesota farmers and food companies. As part of my visit, I also had the chance to talk to farmers that provide foods for St. Paul Schools. They are great supporters of Farm to School—not only because it contributes to their bottom line, but because it connects children with the farmers that grow their food and introduces them to fresh, healthy fruits, vegetables and other locally grown farm products. Finally, I joined the Congresswoman for a roundtable with community partners hosted by Hunger Solutions Minnesota and the historic Neighborhood House at St. Paul’s Wellstone Center. The Center, named for late Senator Paul Wellstone, offers a food pantry (or shelf, as it’s called in Minnesota) stocked with USDA foods. The Center also offers a variety of social services and is a strong thread in St. Paul’s social fabric. Left to right: Senator Al Franken joins Dr. Mary Story and Under Secretary Concannon after the nutrition roundtable at the University of Minnesota March 25. (photo credit: University of Minnesota) As I often am when talking to state and local partners and viewing our programs in action, I came away impressed with how much can be accomplished by coupling USDA programs with creative and dedicated individuals and organizations that enthusiastically support our shared mission. Through the leadership and hard work of community groups, social service organizations and government agencies and with the support of Senator Franken and Congresswoman McCollum, Minnesota is improving nutrition, reducing hunger, supporting local farmers and rural economies and ensuring that America’s next generation is healthy and well-nourished.

"Risk Management Agency Administrator in  Rural  Jul 21,   USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA) and Farm Service Agency (FSA) working together have made great strides in making acreage reporting simpler for farmers and ranchers.  The Acreage and Crop Reporting Streamlining Initiative (ACRSI), seeks to reduce the reporting burden on producers submitting to USDA. In listening sessions with producers last year, FSA and the Office of the Chief Information Officer found some common themes emerged: 1) Producers want to provide their information such as acreage reporting , just once, and expect USDA agencies to share the internally -‘one-stop’ reporting; 2)  Producers currently provide the same information multiple times; and 3)  Acreage reporting is inefficient and is not always accurate ACRSI will standardize requirements and automate the reporting process.  It is a huge step toward one-stop reporting and permits easier identification of discrepancies and misreporting. Ultimately, ACRSI could allow for automated reporting from a producer’s GPS monitoring equipment. Another big benefit:  Reduced USDA operating costs and improved integrity and accuracy Now we want more input. We believe the public, especially producers, ranchers, and the crop insurance industry may have suggestions to help further reduce the reporting burden. If you have ideas on how to streamline collection, we’d like to hear from you.

"AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow/ Advisor, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Nov 19,  A variable-rate center-pivot irrigation system in a field in Bushland, Texas, equipped with infrared thermometers that collect temperature and a neutron gauge to measure soil water content. High-resolution such as these are used by scientists to optimize crop performance in specific environmental conditions. For nearly 400 years, Thanksgiving has been a time in North America when families come together to celebrate food and agriculture. As we reflect on yet another year, agricultural scientists at USDA continue to keep a wary eye on the future. At the end of what may be the hottest year on record, a period of drought has threatened the heart of one of the most important agricultural production zones in the United States. Water demands are increasing, and disease and pest pressures are continually evolving. This challenges our farmers’ ability to raise livestock and crops.  How are science and technology going to address the problems facing our food supply?  To find answers, agricultural scientists turn to —big .  Genomics, the field of science responsible for cataloging billions of DNA base pairs that encode thousands of genes in an organism, is fundamentally changing our understanding of plants and animals.  USDA has already helped to fund and collect genomes for 25 crop plant species, important livestock and fish species, and numerous bacteria, fungi, and insect species related to agricultural production. Other USDA-supported research projects expanding these efforts are currently underway, including genome sequencing of 1,000 bulls and 5,000 insect species in the i5K initiative. But classifying and understanding DNA is only part of the story. Even if neighboring farmers were to raise identical varieties of tomato, small variations in the environment can reduce crop performance and/or increase pests and disease. So, scientists and farmers are increasingly using technology like satellites, drones, sensors, and laser-guided tractors to collect thousands of points about the environmental conditions in a field, such as temperature, humidity, soil composition, or slope of the land. Using these “precision agriculture” techniques, farmers could reduce their environmental footprint by matching land management practices to the unique environments on their farm. In the long term, USDA researchers are hoping to combine precision agriculture and genomics in a remarkable way—to develop crops with combinations of genes that lead to the best performance in specific environments. To support this goal, USDA continues to lead the way in collecting and maintaining open access to these types of agriculture .  As a result, your local farmer’s market or grocery store may one day have even more varieties of produce to choose from on Thanksgiving, with each optimized for the farm or field on which it was grown.

Photo courtesy Fallon Farmers’ Collaborative Earlier today, Secretary Vilsack announced the Specialty Crop Block Grant awards totaling $55 million dollars.  These grants will fund over ates and its territories, and help expand opportunities for local and regional farmers. Specialty crops produced in the U.S. include fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture and nursery crops, and are often a key source of income for America’s farmers.  Through this program, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service grants money to the state and territory for them to directly support projects creating new business opportunities, boosting efficiency and productivity, and improving food safety. Almost a third of the projects funded this year will focus on efforts to sell to local or regional markets, supporting producers and entrepreneurs that are looking to start or expand their businesses within their communities. Projects, like the one in Wisconsin that will help off-set the costs of Good Agricultural Practices/Good Handling Practices audits, will help small and mid-sized businesses gain access to larger retail markets and provide pre-audit educational opportunities to local growers. In Florida, the Red Hill Small Farm Alliance will help lower costs and address risks faced by farmers who sell directly to consumers by using an innovative web-based distribution system to connect producers to new customers and increasing public awareness of available products. A project by the Churchill Economic Development Association (CEDA) in Nevada will create a centralized place for small scale farmers to jointly use planting, harvesting and packing equipment, giving them access to tools and facilities they typically wouldn’t have on their own.  CEDA will also use the grant support to expand existing Fallon Small Farm Collaborative efforts to new markets in the state.

"NRCS Puerto Rico State Conservationist in  Conservation  Apr 08,  Shade-grown coffee helps protect water quality and coral reefs like this one in Puerto Rico. NOAA photo. I work for USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, an agency that helps farmers voluntarily implement conservation practices on their lands across the U.S.—including land on my home, Puerto Rico. I am extremely proud of recent NRCS efforts here to help farmers, ranchers and landowners make significant strides in conserving the Guánica Bay/Rio Loco watershed. This watershed, which is about 100 miles southwest of San Juan, is one of the most diverse and complex in Puerto Rico. The water that flows through the watershed is harnessed by dams, reservoirs and hydroelectric plants. Despite these man-made interferences, the watershed drains over 151 square miles into the bay every year. Coffee ripens on a bush. Photo credit Edwin Mas. Coral reefs are a pillar of the natural beauty of Puerto Rico and the bay is home to some of the island’s most pristine reefs. But runoff from the watershed contains sediment and other contaminants that can damage or even kill the small organisms that build the sensitive structures. Now, to protect the coral reefs, farmers are working with NRCS to reduce runoff and improve water quality in a multi-year project to evaluate, design and install watershed restoration projects to reduce the effects of land-based sources of pollution. One important conservation project on the island is the sun-to-shade coffee initiative. Managed by NRCS with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, it focuses on promoting shade-grown coffee among farmers. Transitioning from growing sun-grown coffee to shade-grown coffee provides many benefits. For one, the shade in shade-grown coffee is provided by native nitrogen-fixing trees, which add nitrogen to the soil, helping reduce the need for fertilizer as well as the farmer’s costs. The Guánica Bay/Rio Loco watershed as seen from the air. Photo credit Edwin Mas. Shade-grown coffee helps reduce sedimentation and storm water runoff because the trees help keep the soil in place and, in turn, more water can soak into the soil, recharging the island’s aquifers. The shade and fallen leaves also reduce the need for pesticides, since both help suppress weeds and fungi. All of these outcomes help protect the water quality of Puerto Rico’s streams and lakes, as well as where they ultimately drain—the bay, home of the corals. There are additional benefits to shade-grown coffee. The trees provide valuable wildlife habitat and coffee grown in shade has higher yields plus farmers don’t need to apply as much water because the soil retains more water. Over 32,000 trees have been delivered to coffee farmers throughout the watershed since , when NRCS and FWS began partnering on this project. Over 750 acres have already been converted to shade-grown coffee. NRCS has invested over $2.5 million on conservation in the watershed since . Follow NRCS on Twitter.

"South Carolina Agriculture – Nothing Could Be Finer  The Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture. Agriculture in South Carolina is a long and proud tradition. As the Census of Agriculture showed us, even today, nearly 5 million acres of our state’s land is dedicated to farming, that’s almost a quarter of all land in South Carolina. The latest agriculture census also showed that the number of farms in South Carolina has remained steady for the past 15 years at roughly 25,000. The Palmetto State farmers sold more than $3 billion worth of agricultural products. That’s a whopping 29.2 percent increase in sales in just five years. Of these sales, $1.5 billion – nearly half of the total agricultural product sales in South Carolina – came from poultry and egg sales.

Louis through the Feds, Farmers and Friends Feed Families food drive. Photo courtesy of SWCS. NRCS Iowa There’s a little less hunger in St. Louis this summer, thanks to convention-going soil conservationists and scientists. When members of the Soil and Water Conservation Society (SWCS) preparing for their annual international conference heard about the national Feds, Farmers and Friends Feed Families (F5) food drive, they decided to help by bringing food to the St. Louis convention, where it was collected and weighed.  “We collected . Patrick Center of St. Louis, which is the largest provider of homeless services in Missouri,” said Jim Gulliford, SWCS executive director. “When you consider that much of the donated food was packed in luggage and went through airport security, this is a great effort. I’m proud of our members and the success of our food drive.” SWCS is a professional society dedicated to promoting the science and art of natural resource conservation. Gulliford credits Bonnie Allely, an exhibitor at this year’s SWCS conference, with the idea of having the organization participate. Allely is the Earth Team national volunteer liaison with USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). “When Bonnie contacted us about participating in the NRCS F5 food drive, we jumped at the chance. We asked the 615 people attending our conference to ‘pack for two, bring food, and help “starve” hunger in St. Louis,’” Guilliford said. Allely’s Earth Team exhibit served as the food donation collection point. Feds, Farmers and Friends Feed Families is a national program that contributes foods to communities across the country. Allely says she handed convention attendees fliers promoting the F5 partnership. “I’m hoping this hunger-fighting effort continues when the conference-goers return home,” she said. “This is a great program.” Want to help?

"National Press Club As prepared for Delivery. Embargoed until 1:00 p.m. Eastern  Release & Contact Info  News Transcript  Release No. .13  Contact:USDA Office of Communications  720-  Watch Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack's remarks live at 12:50 pm ET at: afternoon, everyone. I want to thank the National Press Club for the opportunity to discuss a complex environmental challenge American agriculture will face in the years and decades to come.In particular today, I want to focus on America's food supply. Specifically - how we've mitigated threats to it in the past and how today we face evolving environmental threats, requiring again that we mitigate and adapt.This is an important discussion because our food supply stands at the core of our strength as a nation. Today, American agriculture is tremendously productive, largely due to the innovation embraced by our farmers and ranchers.Productivity impacts more than the farmer's bottom line. Productivity empowers America to lead the way in feeding a growing world population - enables us to maintain an agricultural trade surplus that supports over a million jobs - and allows us to enjoy an affordable, diverse, homegrown food supply - all of which makes America more secure.We achieved this productivity because American agriculture has always adapted to threats. We're flexible and responsible when disaster strikes. But we've also taken the long view. We've always asked what we'll have to deal with next week, next month or next year.Risk management and adaptation starts on the farm. Farmers and ranchers are on the front lines of identifying threats and adapting to meet them. When a crop goes south or a herd gets sick, producers don't chalk that up to luck. They find out what's wrong and they fix it.For more than a century they have had our help in fixing problems. We are people that have invested and supported our agriculture sector. From USDA, to academics, to local extension agents, experts and advisors at all levels have been there to help our farmers get the job done.Keeping agriculture strong and productive is a joint undertaking and a shared responsibility.During and after the Dust Bowl, USDA helped farmers, ranchers and foresters reestablish the soil through new management efforts - planting marginal crop land with resource-conserving cover; taking new steps to protect water sheds; regenerating trees to break the devastating wind. These steps continue today.When America's forests were racked by historic fires, we came together to develop new methods to sustain, regenerate and protect forest lands.Last year, as producers faced the worst drought in generations, groundbreaking agricultural research and smart business planning saved crops that in the past would have been destroyed.The bottom line is that in the United States, we produce an amazing amount of food because we adapt to today's threats and prepare for tomorrow's threats.Today, we face a new challenge in the form of a changing and shifting climate.I'm the Secretary of Agriculture, and I am not here today to give a scientific lecture on climate change. I'm here to tell you what we're seeing on the ground.We're seeing more severe storms. We're facing more invasive species. More intense forest fire threatens communities each year. NOAA reported that was the second most intense year in our history for extreme weather events - droughts, flooding, hurricanes, severe storms and devastating wildfire. NOAA also advised that last year was the warmest on record for the continental United States.Right now, our farmers and forest landowners continue to adapt. New technologies and advanced practices have managed to keep production steady even in the face of these new and more extreme weather patterns.But the latest science tells us that the threat of a changing climate is new and different from anything we've ever tackled.Earlier this year USDA released two comprehensive studies - one focused on crops and one on our forests - detailing the projected effects of climate change on our agriculture and forestry production.These studies found that in the short term we have the means to manage threats, but over the next fifty years we will face new and different problems.We'll face the need to adapt crop production. As temperatures increase, crop production may need to shift based on water availability and other factors. Where you're growing water-intense fruits and vegetables today, you may be growing a drought-resistant row crop in a generation.Rising temperatures will also add to our invasive species issues, bringing with them increased costs for producers. Right now, weed control alone costs us more than $11 billion a year in the U.S. - and those costs are expected to rise with increasing temperatures. When winters aren't cold enough to kill off invasive insects, we'll face a new challenge to adapt to those threats. Landowners, dealing with bark beetles, are already starting to experience this phenomenon.We will face more severe weather patterns. We'll see more events that could harm crops and livestock, which demand new strategies.In our forests, the troubling pattern of intense and destructive wildfires threatens to become the norm. The fire season is now at least 60 days longer than it was just 30 years ago. The pine beetle epidemic, which many scientists attribute to climate change, covers some 40 million acres of land across the interior west. Fires impact more acres. A recent Forest Service study forecasts a doubling of annual acreage subject to wild land fire by .We are also beginning to grasp that climate challenges will have impacts unique to each region of the country.In the Northeast, extreme precipitation events have increased faster than anywhere else in the Nation, reducing yields.Across the Midwest and Great Plains the growing season has lengthened by almost two weeks over my lifetime.In the West and Southwest - home of more than half of our nation's high-value specialty crop production - increased drought poses a particular threat to irrigation-intensive nuts, fruits and vegetables.So the fact is, across America, farmers and ranchers and forest landowners are seeing the beginning chapter of what will be a long-term challenge posed by a changing climate. This problem is not going to go away on its own.That's why America must take steps now to adapt.We know that developing modern solutions to a changing climate requires a doubling down on collaboration - between farmers, governments, researchers and industry. We have got to think outside the box, work together, and pool our resources to begin developing the next generation of climate solutions for agriculture. This is not a single, one-size-fits-all problem. We need a targeted approach geared to the particular challenge faced by each region.We already have taken steps under President Obama to begin forging critical new approaches to mitigation and adaptation.Take the livestock and dairy industries, for example. In , USDA entered into an historic agreement with the U.S. dairy industry to mitigate the environmental impact of dairy production, by supporting new energy efficiency and waste-to-energy systems.Over four years this agreement led to the creation of 184 new anaerobic digesters. Last month, we renewed our MOU with a goal of helping the dairy industry reduce greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by .We've also provided support through university research to help the livestock industry reduce its environmental footprint.USDA recently announced $19.5 million in funding - led by the University of Wisconsin and Oklahoma State University - to look at the impacts of climate variability on dairy and beef production. Ultimately, these projects aim to deliver the best new tools for ranchers to sustain productivity.This effort was the latest in our focus on Coordinated Agriculture Projects, joint efforts to best leverage America's agricultural research capacity. USDA under the Obama Administration has invested nearly $120 million in Coordinated Agriculture Project research to sustain our productivity in the face of modern environmental challenges.We've worked with UC-Davis to explore how we might adapt conifer trees to changing climates - the University of Idaho to look at changes in soil carbon and nitrogen content - and Iowa State to look at several aspects of corn production.We have made unprecedented efforts to conserve and protect America's forests which play a critical role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in trees, other vegetation and soil. The Forest Service increased the pace and scale of forest restoration on our National Forests through landscape scale projects that bring together forest industry, environmentalists and communities.Given the threats our forests face, we moved away from the timber wars of the past towards a shared vision that recognizes we must work together towards a common goal of forest restoration.In this spirit, USDA has adopted a new forest planning rule that ensures our forests will be restored and managed in a way that protects all the benefits that forests provide to Americans, including clean water, jobs, recreation and wildlife. And importantly, the planning rule allows the Forest Service to use the best available science to ensure our forests can adapt to climate change over time.We have worked with more than 500,000 farmers and ranchers on private working land conservation efforts, and carried out thousands of projects to help them embrace renewable energy and energy efficiency projects on their property.We have taken a new and committed look at the impact of climate on the future of agriculture - and how we at USDA will also need to adapt.In addition to the two climate assessments I referenced earlier, we released USDA's first Climate Change Adaptation Plan this year. The Obama Administration has taken a comprehensive - and proactive - effort to ensure the Federal government is prepared for climate challenges that lay ahead.As part of this, USDA engaged employees and agencies to address our weak points with regard to a shifting climate and modern threats from the environment. We found areas where our program delivery might be impacted by these new challenges.Working with many different USDA agencies, we laid out 83 specific recommendations to be sure we can continue delivering top-notch service in the face of climate impacts. For example, we identified common needs to increase collaboration on climate planning within the Federal government and with our partners, such as land grant universities.We laid out a need to better prepare APHIS to measure invasive species - to ensure that our scientific research helps deliver modern climate solutions - to strengthen the resilience of our Forests - and to help create new ways for producers to access information that will help them mitigate threats.We'll be issuing a follow-up to this initial report in November of this year. But taken alongside the two climate impact assessments, these efforts reflect our understanding that proactive steps will pay big dividends in the decades to come. We know we need to be ahead of the game. We must continue to build on previous action in order to better support America's adaptation to climate challenges.Today I would like to announce some new measures that we will be taking.Regional Climate Hubs:First, USDA will establish seven new ""Regional Climate Hubs"" to work in partnership with producers and foresters on new adaptation strategies.This is the next step in USDA's decades of work alongside farmers, ranchers and forest landowners to keep up production in the face of challenges. If we are to be effective in managing the risks from a shifting climate, we'll need to ensure that our managers in the field and our stakeholders have the information they need to succeed.That's why we're bringing all of that information together on a regionally-appropriate basis.You can think of these new Hubs as service centers for science-based risk management - part of our broader effort to deliver extension for the 21st Century. They will enhance coordination of the science assets of USDA. They'll encourage folks to accelerate the development and delivery of forecasts and solutions to improve risk management in ways that matter for folks on the ground.The hubs will enable us to carry out regionally-appropriate climate change risk and vulnerability assessments, and get out to the field more quickly. Practically, the hubs will deal out advice to farmers and forest owners on ways to reduce risks and manage change.They will serve as a starting point to further implement new strategies for adaptation, soil health and water protection. One very promising example is the possibility of multi-cropping production that will add additional nutrient value to the soil, better protect cropland, store more carbon and allow producers to expand income.And as we further investigate possibilities for competitive markets in carbon sequestration and water protection, these regional Hubs will play a useful role.While some of the work of these new Hubs will take place in existing USDA service centers across the nation, there is a very important collaborative aspect as well. We intend to fully leverage our relationship with the Land Grant and Public Universities, Agricultural Experiment Stations, and extension to provide new platforms for collaboration.NRCS Tools for Producers:Second, I can announce new efforts by the Natural Resources Conservation Service to move into the next generation of research and technical assistance.In particular, both of these efforts relate to carbon. We know it's important to understand the role of carbon in contributing to global warming. It's equally important to recognize the tremendous potential of American agriculture to sequester carbon from the atmosphere - helping to mitigate climate change, while improving soil health to be more resilient in the face of modern challenges.NRCS is launching today an online resource assessment database - the results of a study known as the Rapid Carbon Assessment - that will be particularly useful for researchers and scientists.This tool will allow online access to the most extensive database on soil carbon in the world. While NRCS has collected soil samples for more than a century, this rapid assessment is an ambitious project. In fact, it is the largest concentrated soil sampling effort in history. NRCS scientists collected more than 144,000 soil samples at 6,000 locations across the country to provide baseline on regional carbon stocks.This will allow outside researchers and scientists to begin taking a fresh look at carbon in soil, which ultimately will have regional benefits to crop production.Additionally, USDA NRCS and our Climate Change Office are rolling out an online tool that's intended for farmers, and ranchers themselves. We call this ""COMET-Farm"" - the Carbon Management and Evaluation Tool.This online tool is the next generation of our ongoing efforts to develop user-friendly tools to help farmers understand the greenhouse gas footprints of their operations.Producers will input information about their land and current and past management practices to establish a baseline. The tool will let them select from a list of alternative conservation practices to see how each one changes their greenhouse gas emissions and carbon capture. For example, a producer planning to implement conservation tillage could estimate how that conservation practice will increase soil carbon, and decrease emissions for the operation overall.Used in this way, COMET-Farm can help producers reach decisions that reduce energy costs, while building carbon stocks in the soil. It would also serve as a gateway for future efforts to help producers participate in voluntary carbon markets.These new NRCS tools build on a campaign for soil health at USDA - because we know that healthy soil can absorb a significant amount of carbon, and help greatly in mitigating climate threats. By improving soil health we can simultaneously improve productivity, protect water resources, improve biodiversity, reduce erosion and help put carbon back into the ground where it belongs.We also know that healthy soils are more resilient soils. Each pound of soil organic matter in the soil can hold 18-20 pounds of water - helping make farms more resilient to periods of drought and other weather extremes.That's why USDA has focused on helping our nation's farmers and ranchers through our campaign - called ""Unlock the Secrets in the Soil."" We know that soil conservation practices help farmers - but they also help mitigate the impacts of a changing climate. Efforts like these will only be stronger as we ramp up new, regionally-focused information sharing efforts.Cover Crops:Third, USDA agencies have started working together to make new cover cropping methods available for producers, and to ensure that our agencies are working together to ensure these options are viable. For centuries, farmers have been using cover crops to prevent soil erosion, improve nutrient cycling, sustain soils and harness many other benefits.Cover crops also sequester a significant amount of carbon. However, some producers have encountered conflicting cover crop management issues when working with multiple USDA agencies.For example, there was a perception that crop insurance policies did not always allow cover crops - which conflicts with the NRCS incentives to plant cover crops. Some cover crop recommendations conflict with language in the Farm Bill for how the Farm Service Agency is to give commodity payments. That's a problem.Recently, USDA undertook an effort to ensure that farmers who plant cover crops have clarity from our Department. NRCS, RMA and FSA worked together this spring to establish a new common, science-based guidance on when cover crops should be terminated.The Administrators of these agencies engaged stakeholders, universities, and the crop insurance industry to figure out how to make cover crop straightforward and sensible.The result is new guidance - a new model that uses local climate , tillage management and soil to account for daily crop growth and use of soil moisture. With this information, experts determined the latest possible time to terminate a cover crop, to maximize carbon sequestration and at the same time minimize risk to the cash crop yield.For this new guidance, four cover crop termination zones have been established across the United States.These provide a regionally-appropriate approach to cover crops and the tools to identify the proper cover crop management in an area, taking into account local climate and cropping systems. We took the time needed to get this right - including truth-testing our recommendations with folks on the ground. Going forward - RMA, NRCS and FSA will all uniformly refer producers to these , and will use them to administer programs.With this consistent, science-based cover crop guidance, farmers will have more flexibility and a greater opportunity to utilize cover crops on their operations, while staying in compliance across all USDA agencies.They can reap the conservation and economic benefits that cover crops can provide - healthy soils and sustained food and fiber production. Producers will have a greater degree of certainty that they can use these practices, while still being eligible for crop insurance and other programs.I would note for folks that information on all of these new steps - our regional hubs, our new tools from NRCS, and these new steps with regard to cover crops - are available at our web site, www.usda.gov.These new tools and actions represent our comprehensive strategy for helping agriculture adapt to modern challenges.We'll continue to provide world-class research and tools for academic experts. Our plan reflects an understanding that farmers and ranchers have always been on the front lines of adaptation. We don't just want to tell folks there's a problem - we want to provide them with real information to create real solutions for specific threats.These efforts are also directly related to maintaining our abundant, productive agricultural sector, an effort that doesn't stop at the edge of the field.I want to share with you one more facet of this work that involves Americans from all walks of life. We spoke earlier about the tremendous productivity of American agriculture that keeps costs low for us at home, while helping us export around the world. Here's the bad news: estimates show that at least 30 percent of our food supply ends up wasted - and an estimated 133 billion pounds of food each year is not consumed.First, it's a major food security issue from the perspective that wasted food could be helping feed folks at food banks and shelters.Second, it's a natural resource issue. All of the resources that went into producing that wasted food - including the land, labor, water, pesticides, and fertilizers - could have been saved or gone to uses of higher value for society.And third, it's a climate change issue. EPA estimates that in the United States, food is the single largest component of municipal solid waste going to landfills - and that landfills are the third largest source of methane. You do the math. By reducing the amount of food we toss into the trash, we can help reduce methane emissions.Yesterday, I joined EPA Administrator Bob Perciasepe and leaders from across the U.S. food sector to announce the U.S. Food Waste Challenge. Together, we're calling on Americans across the nation to help us reduce the amount of food that ends up at the landfill, recover food that could be used to feed those in need, and recycle food waste wherever we can.Right now, we have a few founding partners onboard - and a predecessor effort by EPA has about 200 participant organizations. Our shared goal is to build momentum to fight food waste - by getting 400 partner organizations onboard the U.S. Food Waste Challenge by , and 1,000 by .At USDA, we're going to do our part. We've pledged to reduce waste in the school meals program, take new steps to educate consumers about food waste and food storage, and develop new technologies to reduce food waste. USDA will also work with industry leaders to streamline procedures for donating wholesome meat and poultry products that are misbranded. And at our food labs we will find better solutions for food waste by recycling food samples that have been inspected.By giving some extra thought to what we buy and how much we need, all of us can reduce our contributions to the nation's landfills. It's an adaptation strategy that everyone can help to create.All of this work represents the beginning stages and the first steps of an overarching focus on adaptation in the years ahead.Over the coming months and years, USDA intends to build partnerships with landowners - work with conservation groups, Tribes and local governments - and engage with ordinary Americans. We'll take more steps to mitigate and adapt to these challenges here in the United States, and around the world, and I look forward to sharing additional plans with you in the future.The bottom line today is that America's long history of innovation must continue.Our farmers and ranchers have proven over the course of generations that they're up to the task. And USDA has a strong history of support for their efforts.This will not be a short-term task, it won't be simple, but it's doable. That's why we need to prepare for the future today - to begin asking how we can work together to prepare agriculture for new challenges - and thereby put our food supply on a strong footing in the years to come.","The text discusses the importance of adaptation in agriculture due to modern challenges, such as climate change and waste management.

"USDA Rural Development State Director in  Rural  Nov 29,  With USDA funding support, Morningside Shelter in Brattleboro, Vermont, recently completed an expansion to provide more space for people with children, while improving energy efficiency. Support to residents includes job training, nutrition, health services, parenting and child care services and skills to move them into permanent housing.  It’s dark and damp November, Vermont’s least welcoming month. The brilliance of autumn is gone and the dazzle of snow is still around the corner. Brattleboro is no different than most other communities in Vermont, or just across the river in New Hampshire, where people are worried about jobs, paying for heat and groceries, or worse, finding a place to live. Just in time for winter, with help from USDA in Vermont, Morningside Shelter has completed an expansion project that will allow a 30 percent increase in residents. The homeless shelter’s Executive Director Paul Capcara noted, “We’ve been operating at full capacity year round for the last several years. We’ve been getting more calls than ever from people with children.” Morningside Shelter was founded by community members in with the mission to help eliminate homelessness by providing shelter, outreach, referral, intervention and transitional housing services. It’s the only homeless shelter in rural southwestern Vermont to specialize in housing placement with ongoing staff support and life skills development for both families and individuals. The shelter offers an extended stay and works collaboratively with area nonprofit and public agencies to help people connect to a wide range of services including: job training and placement; medical and mental health treatment; family and substance abuse counseling; budget management; nutrition; health education; parenting and child care services; and assistance in identifying and qualifying for subsidized housing opportunities. The community involvement and support for the recent expansion was evident in the success of the fundraising campaign, which together with USDA Rural Development Community Facilities funding of $67,000, built two family-sized bedrooms, an extra bathroom, more living space, a dedicated area for children, and moved the laundry room and pantry from the basement to the first floor where they are accessible to all. While the building’s space expanded, its operating costs contracted, with the installation of a high-efficiency heating system, LED lighting, super-insulation and a passive solar design. Board member Gary Swindler noted that “Our primary goal for the expansion was to meet the growing community need for shelter space in a cost-effective, sustainable and environmentally sound manner. We’ve met that goal, and on time for winter.” While a recent resident pondered the future for her and her young family, she could relax a bit in the shelter of supporting staff, a nutritious meal that she helped prepare, and secure surroundings. “My son can play and I can keep an eye on him while I do my laundry.” To find out how USDA can help your community achieve its goals click here.

"in  USDA Results  Rural  Dec 15,   Today, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced critical investments in our nation’s infrastructure. Specifically, 46 transportation projects in 33 states and Puerto Rico will receive funding that will help support local communities and drive a nation-wide economic recovery.  These grants are steps this Administration is taking now to create jobs, repair our crumbling transportation systems, and make sure our economy continues to grow. At USDA we are particularly excited about the announcement because $150 million will go to critical projects in rural areas. These investments will help boost economic development and make rural communities more attractive for businesses. Especially in rural areas, our transportation systems have gone too long without repair.  By improving our bridges, transit, freight, and ports, we’ll support agriculture jobs and make trucking of goods faster and more efficient for our farmers and ranchers. The Obama Administration is committed to making investments like these now because the American people simply can’t wait any longer for the job opportunities these projects will create. If Congress passes the American Jobs Act, it will build on these transportation investments and immediately provide $50 billion to improve 150,000 miles of roads, replace 4,000 miles of track, and restore 150 miles of runways.  It will create jobs for American workers and build a safer, more efficient transportation network for the country.

"Iowa State Director for USDA Rural Development in  Rural  May 23,  Leon Kauzlarich (left) and his son, David, are both U.S. Army veterans. With critical home repairs in place, including a handicap-accessible ramp, Leon plans to get out this Memorial Day to recognize the contributions of other military veterans. As we celebrate Memorial Day this weekend, those of us at USDA Rural Development would like to take a moment to remember the fallen.  We also thank the veterans who served alongside them and who are helping keep their memories alive today. Leon Kauzlarich from rural Appanoose County, Iowa, is one such veteran who will be getting out this Memorial Day to do just that. For decades, he has spent Memorial Day visiting rural cemeteries to place American flags on the graves of fallen soldiers. As a senior with mobility issues, however, he missed three recent Memorial Day observances, because he was unable to navigate the front steps and was completely homebound. With the help of USDA Rural Development home repair grant paired with assistance from the Chariton Valley Regional Housing Trust Fund, Mr. Kauzlarich was able to finally make critical repairs to his home in early . The funds were used to fix a leaking roof and plumbing, install new entry and storm doors, and build an outdoor ramp allowing Mr. Kauzlarich to come and go. With the repairs completed, one of his first excursions was to resume his Memorial Day tradition last year. His daughter told us, “This simple task was one that dad had done himself for well over 60 years, and it meant so much to him to again see that those soldiers were given their recognition!  This memorable ride was the first time in over three years that dad was able to leave the confines of his home.” “This means the world to dad and the Kauzlarich family! Knowing dad can safely get out of his house in case of an emergency eases my worries, too,” she continued. This Memorial Day, USDA is proud to serve and recognize veterans like Mr. Leon Kauzlarich.

"Bozeman Ranger District, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 03,  Forests and wood products are powerful tools to help mitigate the impacts of climate change. (Click to view a larger version) Trees do plenty of work to sequester carbon on their own, but many forests are not as healthy as they should be due to fire suppression and climate change. This can leave trees vulnerable to large scale insect damage, fire or drought, and much of the carbon stored by forests is lost to the atmosphere as trees die. The U.S. Forest Service is committed to the storage of carbon using wood products through the green building and wood products strategy. This strategy involves putting people to work in rural communities, enhancing resiliency of our ecosystems, and sequestering carbon by promoting the use of wood products in large building construction. By using wood instead of, or along with, concrete and steel, large amounts of carbon can be stored in the walls of homes and offices, significantly reducing emissions associated with the production of other materials. Also, using sustainable timber harvests for emerging wood product technologies like cross-laminated timber, can stimulate local economies in timber country while sequestering carbon in long-term wood products. Cross laminated timber is a wood panel made of layers of dried lumber boards stacked in alternating directions, glued and pressed to form solid panels. These panels have extraordinary strength and are being used as walls, roofs, and floors. D.R. Johnson Mill in Riddle, Oregon announced recently that it will be the first U.S. mill certified to produce cross-laminated timber for high rise construction. Putting our own green building strategy to work, the Forest Service is working to increase the use of locally milled timber in all new agency buildings and facilities. Since , we have used wood to build the Angeles National Forest Supervisor’s Office, Camino Real Ranger Station, Corvallis Laboratory, Juneau Laboratory, and Enomee Ranger District Office. And in the private sector projects like the Bullitt Center in Seattle are showcasing the use of sustainable, Forest Stewardship Council certified wood products to efficiently create new buildings that will last and become testaments to sustainable forest management. The Bullitt Center sequesters 1,703 metric tons of carbon in its walls. The trees in our national forests can help mitigate the effects of climate change in so many ways, and the Forest Service is committed to helping neighboring communities by promoting sustainable development with trees and wood.

"Office of Communications in  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Nov 15,   In mid October, 40 Borlaug Fellows from 21 countries as far away as Azerbaijan and Zambia were in Des Moines, Iowa, to attend the Borlaug International Symposium and World Food Prize ceremony. These Fellows are part of the Norman E. Borlaug Agricultural Science and Technology Fellows Program established by USDA in to honor Nobel Laureate Norman E. Borlaug. Grace Otitodun, a Borlaug Fellow from Nigeria, authored this blog post: Last month, I was honored to have the opportunity to attend the World Food Prize in Des Moines, Iowa as a fellow in the Borlaug 21st Century Leadership Program. The event saw participation from hundreds of leaders and experts in policy, industry, and research from all over the world, convened there to discuss global food security and agriculture.  Throughout the week, I encountered countless high-powered individuals who have been working tirelessly to achieve global food security by facilitating increased production among small-scale farmers.  They have made a compelling case for improving the effectiveness of U.S. investments in global food security and for addressing the troubling gap between population growth and food production. An example of these investments to build long-term food security, my own research through the Borlaug Program has focused on an important aspect of the food supply: pre- and post-harvest losses.  From the time that seeds are planted to the time that farmers harvest and store their crops, good farming practices are essential to agricultural productivity.  Food security is compromised when farmers plant damaged seeds, leading to unviable crops; when poor farming practices result in a poor crop yield; or when improper storage and loss of crops prevent farmers from reaping the rewards of months of hard work.  Therefore, one clear way to help reduce global hunger is to reduce pre- and post-harvest losses.  My goal is to be able to find a lasting solution to the problem of postharvest grain storage faced by the farmers in my home country of Nigeria. Environmental and safety concerns have created a global drive toward reducing the use of synthetic pesticides for post-harvest storage, which has increased the need for safe, affordable, and easy-to-use alternatives.  With the support of USDA through the Borlaug Program, I am investigating naturally occurring materials, like botanicals and diatomaceous earth, which are readily available and locally sourced.  These materials can be used as post-harvest protection tools to prevent stored grains from being lost to insect pests.  So far, the results of my research have shown these materials to be highly effective as grain protectants. While further studies are necessary to ensure that these materials are safe for human consumption, it is encouraging to explore potential alternatives to synthetic pesticides that could help many farmers in developing countries protect their hard-earned food supply. Achieving global food security depends on how effectively farmers can manage all the stages of agricultural production.  Through the Feed the Future initiative and innovative research like that fostered through the Borlaug Program, we are finding ways to help farmers increase agricultural production safely and sustainably.  This kind of work has been pioneered by people such as Wangari Maathai, who strove to ensure that good stewardship of land could also lead to improved livelihoods among the most vulnerable people.  Leaders like Ms. Maathai and those I met last month in Des Moines have increased my desire and interest to deepen my research on food security through effective post-harvest practices.

I decided to become a veterinarian when I was 18 after spending time with a veterinary practitioner in my hometown.  Following completion of veterinary school I joined a small animal practice.  Eventually, I bought my own practice.  My practice years allowed me to have some pretty cool and challenging experiences. Dr. Bill Huls, APHIS Center for Veterinary Biologics Facilities Manager, Ames, IA Having a desire for a change, I sold my practice and pursued a residency in Laboratory Animal Medicine at the University of California - Davis.  After completing that program I began my career with the USDA. The very first inspection I performed for APHIS was a valuable learning experience.  I worked side-by-side with an experienced inspector who taught be what to look for and how to effectively communicate our findings with the company.  This experience helped me get started on the right foot, which was very important for my future success. Jumping over to the regulatory side of veterinary medicine was a good switch for me.  Working for the government has been a rewarding experience while providing job stability, which is particularly important in these tough economic times.  My life has more balance now than in my ‘practice’ years, and I find it very rewarding to contribute to animal health by ensuring that veterinary biologic products are pure, safe, potent and effective.  I encourage veterinary students and veterinarians alike to learn as much as they can about as many species as they can and keep their options open, because you never know where your career will take you. It has been both an honor and pleasure for me to play an active role in keeping animals healthy and save animals’ lives.

There is a wealth of historical that’s inaccessible because today’s crop model software applications cannot easily interpret it. USDA’s National Agricultural Library (NAL) is working with the University of Florida and the Agricultural Research Network (ARDN) to solve this problem. ARDN is dedicated to making high value datasets from past research and experiments compatible with crop models and other analytical tools. With support from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), NAL and the University of Florida are piloting a “hackathon” approach to make this old useful. Experts gather several times a year to create standardized vocabulary and extract relevant information to use in the AgMIP Crop Experiment schema (ACE) – a widely used format for agricultural models. As part of the NIFA grant, the team will annotate four datasets using ARDN protocols. The initial datasets include research from projects at Iowa State University, University of Georgia, the University of Arizona, and the Kellogg Biological Station. These annotated datasets will be available on NAL’s Ag Commons website. NAL also supports ARDN by hosting VMapper software on the Ag Commons website. VMapper creates a file which contains the “road map” for translating the original into the ACE format. ARDN’s collaborative efforts will save crop modelers time and give them access to much more historical , accelerating research and new discoveries.

"USDA Grants Helping the Specialty Crop Industry Reach Food Safety Goals  Across the country, farmers growing fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture and nursery crops - or specialty crops - are being asked to be certified in USDA’s voluntary audit program, Good Agricultural Practices (GAP).  From restaurants and hotels to schools and institutions, wholesale buyers want to ensure the fruits and vegetables they purchase meet food safety standards under the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA).  One challenge for growers in many states is the lack of in-state auditors to perform the GAP certification reviews. One solution has been to leverage another USDA resource to educate and train producers, handlers and buyers on-farm food safety practices. USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) offers Specialty Crop Block Grants (SCBG) to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops which includes supporting GAP certification audits. Since , these grants have launched over 107 GAP and Good Handling Practices (GHP) outreach and training projects, and funded 116 GAP/GHP cost share projects through State departments of agriculture.

"USDA Office of Communications in  Conservation  May 21,   Following the devastating effects of tornadoes this week, USDA is offering assistance to those in need.  USDA offers many programs that can provide assistance to landowners, farmers, ranchers and producers during disasters.  No Presidential or Secretarial declarations are for the provision of much of this assistance. Agricultural producers are reminded that Federal crop insurance covers tornado damage, as well as other natural causes of loss.  Please remember to report your loss to your insurance agent or company within 72 hours and in writing within 15 days. Your insurance company will send out a loss adjuster as soon as they are safely able to do so and will document your insurance claim. Please remember that you cannot destroy your crop or plant a new crop until the loss adjuster or your insurance company has informed you that you can do so. Three disaster programs are currently available to farmers and ranchers (and private forest land owners) through the Farm Service Agency.  They are: Emergency Designation (low-interest) loans, the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP), and the Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP). Up to two-thirds of the counties in the United States have been designated as disaster areas in each of the past several years. Producers may apply for low-interest emergency (EM) loans in counties named as primary or contiguous under a disaster designation. For more information, contact your nearest USDA service center or any USDA state office. USDA has reached out to Oklahoma state partners to offer food assistance to those in need in areas affected by the tornadoes.  USDA, through the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) will continue to work closely with the state to provide support and technical assistance as needed. Many residents of the affected area are in need of shelter.  USDA Rural Development staff is identifying USDA-financed and currently available multi-family (apartment) units and will provide the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with information needed to assist those in need of emergency housing. For emergency assistance with immediate housing needs contact FEMA. Once the emergency is over, those wishing to buy or repair a home in an eligible rural area may qualify for a loan or loan guarantee through USDA.  Please contact your local USDA Service Center for additional information.

"Wisconsin State Statistician, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Conservation  Oct 02,  Wisconsin is the Dairy State, but can you guess what other agricultural crop they lead the nation in? Read below for the answer, and check back next Thursday for another Census of Agriculture Spotlight! The Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture. Welcome to America’s Dairyland! It is simply impossible to talk about Wisconsin agriculture without immediately bringing up our dairy sector. After all, as the Census of Agriculture results showed, 16.5 percent of all farms in our state have milk cows. Wisconsin has significantly more dairy farms at 11,543 than any other state. We are also one of only two states with more than one million milk cows. And, of course, who can forget about Wisconsin cheese? As NASS’ Dairy Products point out every year, Wisconsin farmers produce more cheese than any other state, producing more than ates. That’s nearly 3 billion pounds of cheese a year! Of course Wisconsin farming is more than just dairy. Our farmers are also the top cranberry growers in the nation. According to the latest census, our farmers harvested more than 20,000 acres of these berries. Lesser known is that our farmers are also responsible for most of the U.S. ginseng production. Wisconsin is also the state when it comes to corn for silage production. That’s not surprising considering the size of our livestock industry. Overall, we had nearly 3.5 million head in our cattle and calve herd in . We also have nearly 3.5 million turkeys and more than 13 million chickens. All of these sides of our agriculture are tended to by just under 70,000 farmers. In , this relatively small group cared for of more than 14.5 million acres of Wisconsin land and sold more than $11.7 billion worth of agricultural products. It costs quite a bit to raise these products with production expenses surpassing $9.4 billion in . Clearly farmers love taking care of land and they love farming itself.

"Working Lands for Wildlife Boasts New Practices, Greater Predictability for Landowners in Six Western States  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .15  Contact:Justin Fritscher  375-Jeff Humphrey  242- x222jeff_humphrey@fws.gov  WASHINGTON, March 30, – The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) today unveiled an ecosystem-wide model to aid the Southwestern willow flycatcher and help western landowners. The model will enhance or restore habitat for at-risk, threatened and endangered species while supporting working lands in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah. The program builds on existing partnerships with landowners in the Southwest to support habitat improvement for the Southwestern willow flycatcher, along with 83 other species that depend on the same riparian ecosystem. This action will result in healthier ranges, more productive ranches, and more robust rural economies.""By focusing on predictability on an ecosystem level, we will bring together an even larger group of agricultural producers in the Southwest to create habitat for the flycatcher and other wildlife,"" said NRCS Chief Jason Weller. ""These efforts will not only support the many species that depend on this riparian ecosystem, but also help ranchers move to more sustainable grazing systems and give them the support they need to keep their lands working.""""These efforts will help ensure not only the long-term health of ecosystems and countless species vital to the West, but they will assist rural landowners and provide tangible benefits to local economies,"" said FWS Director Dan Ashe. ""The Service has a long record of working with federal and state agencies and private landowners in creating holistic, long-term solutions such as this.""These efforts are part of the Working Lands for Wildlife (WLFW) partnership between NRCS and FWS, which helps create habitat on working landscapes for seven different at-risk, threatened or endangered species, including the flycatcher. Through WLFW, producers who maintain conservation prac¬tices and systems that benefit the targeted species will be covered for any incidental take that may occur as a result of the conservation activities for up to 30 years.Over the past three years, NRCS has worked with landowners in these six states to restore or enhance more than 7,000 acres of riparian land that the Southwestern willow flycatcher relies on for nesting habitat. Expansion of this program will engage more landowners by providing incentives for six additional conservation practices. It will also expand the scale of the program by providing predictability under the Endangered Species Act for 83 species in addition to the flycatcher. Some of the other species that share riparian habitat with the flycatcher in the Southwest include the New Mexico meadow jumping mouse, yellow-billed cuckoo, Chiricahua leopard frog and the Least Bell's vireo.The six new conservation practices available through WLFW for the flycatcher include: installation of a stream crossing, pumping plant, micro-irrigation system or livestock shelter; mulching; and planting for species habitat. These are among the supporting conservation practices that NRCS offers to ranchers.This effort builds on the historic success of voluntary conservation practices on private lands that benefit wildlife while supporting working lands. Recently, due in large part to proactive steps by private landowners, FWS delisted the Oregon chub, the first fish species to be delisted due to recovery. Listing the Arctic grayling was not because of similarly successful efforts to improve aquatic habitat. Additionally, through their partnership in the Sage Grouse Initiative, the agencies have seen gains in habitat creation for the greater sage-grouse through which private landowners have restored 4.4 million acres over the past five years – an area twice the size of Yellowstone National Park.For more on technical and financial assistance available through conservation programs, visit www.nrcs.usda.gov/GetStarted or a local USDA service center. is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

"Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  Conservation  Oct 07,  USDA is committed to working with our partners in the sheep industry to support them as they provide quality products to consumers and increase producer returns here at home. USDA Photo by Lance Cheung Since they were brought over during the earliest explorations of North America, the sheep industry has played a vital role in the agricultural history of our nation.  In the s, there were over 55 million sheep in the U.S., but today those numbers hover around one-tenth of that total.  There are about 80,000 sheep ranchers across the U.S., and, with support from the Farm Bill, they will have additional resources to help develop innovative approaches to address their long-term needs. Consolidation of the U.S. sheep packing industry, higher feed and energy costs, loss of animals to predators and lower lamb consumption, along with competition from imported of lamb cuts, have taken their toll on U.S. sheep producers.  In response to industry needs, USDA is committed to working with our stakeholders to ensure the long-term viability of the sheep industry. Authorized by the Farm Bill and administered by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the Sheep Production and Marketing Grant Program is designed to strengthen and enhance the production and marketing of sheep and sheep products in the United States.  The National Sheep Industry Improvement Center (Sheep Center) is the first recipient of this grant.  The Sheep Center will use these funds to award grants to other industry organizations, focusing on projects that will improve infrastructure, build business and develop industry-wide resources. USDA is committed to supporting the U.S. sheep industry—and the thousands of rural communities that benefit from the jobs, food and other products it generates. This grant program will create new opportunities for growth and innovation for this long-standing piece of American agriculture.

"in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Apr 18,   The Farm Bill has already set in motion and accomplished so much for our country. With historic support for specialty crop producers across the country, the bill will touch every one of our lives through one of the most basic of human needs: food. Specialty crops make up the bulk of what we eat—all of our fruits and vegetables, tree nuts and dried fruits—as well as things like cut flowers and nursery crops. They are half of MyPlate at every meal, and the daily source for most of our vitamins and nutrients. For many in rural America, these crops not only provide nutrition, they are also a primary source of income. For nearly a decade, USDA supported specialty crop growers across the country through the Specialty Crop Block Grant (SCBG) program. These grants enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops, sustain the livelihood of American farmers, and strengthen rural economies. Last year, the program provided $55 million for 700 state-selected projects nationwide that contributed to food safety improvements, increased access to healthy food, and provided new research to help growers increase profitability and sustainability. The new farm bill expands support through the SCBG program to more than $66 million in grants for specialty crop growers—a historic high. With projects focusing on everything from food safety to business planning, the block grants are designed to increase the long-term success of producers and broaden the market for specialty crops.  Many states select projects that dovetail with community needs, such as establishing farm to school programs, providing training in good agricultural handling practices (GAP), creating organic and sustainable production practices, and developing food hubs that will increase opportunities for small-scale growers. In Michigan, a grant helped the state Department of Agriculture and Resource Development work with partners to increase sales opportunities for specialty crop farmers in Southeast Michigan. They were able to identify and overcome barriers that prevented schools from purchasing products directly from local farmers, and ended up increasing the sales of apples, cucumbers, peppers, red potatoes, broccoli and several other crops within their state. Another grant in Idaho established a partnership between the state Department of Agriculture and Boise State University-Tech to provide workshops that helped improve food safety and implement sustainable production practices for onions, potatoes, apples, cherries, peas and lentils. The project resulted in higher audit scores, increased efficiency and sustainability for participating companies, which both improve consumer confidence and help producers’ bottom lines in the long run. Our dedication to strengthening rural America and increasing opportunities for specialty crop farmers will help keep our nation’s economy—and people—healthy for years to come. This week, we made the next round of SCBG funds available so that states can begin funding projects. If you’re interested in applying, I encourage you to contact your state department of agriculture.

"Volunteer/Intern, U.S. Forest Service National Forests in North Carolina in  Forestry  Aug 14,   Angeliz Vangas and Hanniah Rodriguez made a big impact serving as interns on the National Forests in North Carolina and are now heading back to school and continuing on their road to success. As part of the Student Career Experience Program (SCEP), this summer Vangas and Rodriguez interned in the U.S. Forest Service’s engineering department in Asheville, N.C. SCEP provides work experience that is directly related to the student's academic program or career aspirations and gives students exposure to public service while enhancing their educational goals. The civil engineering majors are rising seniors at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez and have a passion for engineering. Both are members of the student chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers, where they serve as treasurer and secretary, respectively. The students were introduced to the Forest Service last year when they interned at the agency’s Southern Region headquarters in Atlanta, Ga. There, they were given a crash course on how engineering worked within the agency and assisted with inspections within the national forests. The energetic duo took what they learned in Atlanta and put it into practice to deliver results in Asheville, N.C. this summer. They were instrumental in developing an application for a $7 million grant to repair many of the damaged roads in the Nantahala, Pisgah, Uwharrie and Croatan National Forests in North Carolina. They transferred sketches made of the damaged roads to an Auto-CAD, which is used to produce more technical computerized models of the damaged areas. These models are crucial in formulating proposals needed to obtain the grant and to determine how best to repair the roads. Vangas and Rodriguez said interning with the Forest Service has been an engaging and insightful experience. They enjoyed working in Atlanta last year and the city life that comes with it. They said it has been particularly interesting working in Asheville, N.C. because of its close proximity to the national forests. This proximity provided them with more field work experience and to see the environment that they are affecting. “It has been really easy to adjust here because everyone has been so welcoming,” Rodriguez said. Rodriguez chose to intern with the Forest Service because of the diversity of opportunities.  “Working with the Forest Service provides two work scenarios – both field and office work,” she explained. Vangas echoed these sentiments. “It’s nice using our technical skills to help improve the forests,” she said. Although they are unsure about what they want to do after graduation, both say they would like to continue working for the Forest Service in civil engineering. They enjoyed learning from and meeting a lot of new people who have been influential on paving their road to becoming civil engineers and perhaps future Forest Service employees.

These strategies, as exemplified by Vangas and Rodriguez's project, can help ensure effective road repairs while minimizing harm to national forests' delicate ecosystems."
"Food and Nutrition  Research and Science  Jun 29,   This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA's rich science and research portfolio.University of California – BerkeleyMy mouth begins to water just thinking about all the delicious fruits and vegetables I will enjoy this coming weekend celebrating the Fourth of July. And we’re lucky here in Northern California to have a wealth of fresh produce grown locally. Many stores, restaurants and even schools aren’t taking advantage of this local supply. This past spring, with support from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture and in coordination with the University of California Cooperative Extension Service, I started a project to open up new markets for local growers by connecting them with new buyers. In particular, we worked with strawberry growers of Southeast Asian descent in the Sacramento and Fresno regions. This is part of a larger program to increase the economic viability of Southeast Asian farms in California's Central Valley through on-farm research and training in crop production, pest management, food safety and marketing. Most of the 95 strawberry farm stands in the Sacramento region are owned by Hmong and Mien refugees from Laos, who turned to farming when they immigrated to the United States after the Vietnam War. They sell most of their product at farm stands, but during peak season demand can’t keep up with production. With limited language skills, most farmers can’t access new markets and leave the fruit to rot in the field. In partnership with local produce distributor, Produce Express, and several nonprofits including the Community Alliance with Family Farms, the Alchemist Community Development Corporation and Soil Born Farms Urban Agriculture and Education Project, we now bring fresh, local strawberries into children’s school lunches, restaurants and low-income neighborhoods. Some farmers deliver direct to the schools, allowing children to consume berries picked just hours before. We also want to reduce “food miles” or the distance food must travel from farm to fork. We created a Google map to help residents find their closest farm stand. Sacramento-area residents are able to enjoy fresh strawberries from farms located less than 10 miles from their residences. This year, twelve local strawberry farmers sold an additional 4,600 cases of berries beyond their own farm stands, earning a combined $58,000. These additional revenues are a welcome relief for these small farmers, who on average gross $15,000 in a good year. These partnerships are a win-win solution for both small farmers and residents, especially low income residents and school children, who have greater access to fresh, nutritious, local food. Fresh, local strawberries are now available to more than 60,000 school children through a partnership between local growers, the Sacramento School District and the University of California Cooperative Extension Service.

"USDA Agricultural Research Service Information Staff in  Research and Science  Mar 19,  Seasonal fluctuations in food availability may affect what Gambian women eat before and during pregnancy. Scientists have shown that these dietary differences can affect the development of genes in the unborn children. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research profile.  “High tech” isn’t always about images from outer space or a new computer technology, or even the genetic composition of a key crop. Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists are using a high-tech science called “epigenetics”—which means “above genetics”—to help achieve something even more wonderful: a healthier future for our children. Epigenetic mechanisms in our bodies are accepted as likely having a role in human disease, including cardiovascular disorders, type 2 diabetes, obesity and even certain kinds of cancer. These epigenetic mechanisms don’t change the DNA sequence of our genes, but they do change in the way those genes function.  This includes the influence of a mother-to-be’s nutritional status on the lifelong health of her baby. In an earlier laboratory study, ARS scientists tracked weight gains among baby rats whose mothers were either lean or overweight before conception and throughout pregnancy. All the baby rats were of normal weight at birth and at weaning.  But when the weaned offspring were given free access to high-fat rations, the babies from the overweight mothers gained significant more weight than the babies born to the lean mothers. Now ARS scientists have extended their epigenetics studies to women in three villages in the West African nation of The Gambia.  They focused on an epigenetics mechanism called DNA methylation, which is important for cell development and stabilizing cell function. In studies of 50 healthy children in the villages, the researchers showed that DNA methylation levels were higher at regions of five genes in children conceived during the peak rainy season months of August and September, when the Gambian mothers would have had less access to food because the previous year’s harvest would be running out. Two of the five genes in which elevated DNA methylation occurred are associated with disease: Tourette’s syndrome and hypothyroidism.  Since the children were about 9 years old when tested, the researchers think the epigenetic effects will likely be permanent. This study emphasizes the importance of good nutrition for a future mom, not just during pregnancy, but even in the period before she becomes pregnant, to help ensure better lifelong health for her baby.

"Commissioner of the AMS Plant Variety Protection Office in  Animals  Plants  Dec 28,   USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) recently hosted two examiners from China who were on hand to learn the U.S. system for examining new plant variety applications. AMS’s Plant Variety Protection Office and the American Seed Trade Association invited Yang Yang and Lingo Gao from China’s Ministry of Agriculture to work to improve global intellectual property protection. The two countries are working toward harmonizing their respective plant variety protection systems. Yang and Gao spent two months at the Plant Variety Protection Office in Beltsville, Md. The Plant Variety Protection Act provides legal protection in the form of intellectual property rights to developers of new varieties of plants in the U.S. Yang Yang (left) and Lingo Gao from China’s Ministry of Agriculture visit a learning center in Scott, Mississippi to see how cotton breeders collect plant variety information. The U.S. and China are working toward harmonizing their plant variety protection systems. The U.S., China and dozens of other countries are constantly developing new plant varieties. Breeders of varieties that are found to be new, distinct, uniform and stable can receive a certificate of protection in order to safeguard their intellectual property. The term of protection is 20 years for most crops, and 25 years for trees, shrubs and vines. The owner of a protected variety has exclusive rights to multiply and market the seed of that variety. The public benefits as the recipient of lower prices from increased productivity, and from quality food, feed, fiber and other products, that result directly from improved plant varieties. In addition to operating out of the Beltsville office, Yang and Gao visited universities and private companies that test and develop seeds.

"USDA Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics in  Food and Nutrition  Research and Science  Oct 16,   On October 16, World Food Day, it is hard to not be struck by how lucky we are in the United States. We have abundant food that costs us less to produce, on a per unit basis, than almost any other country in the world. Our farmers and ranchers produce more than we need, allowing us to be a powerhouse in global exports. And our food supply is among the safest of all the world’s nations. All that abundance and security has been underpinned by science and know-how.  Between the s and the s, agriculture science blossomed in what has become known as the Green Revolution. Thanks to the research done by Norman Borlaug, the “Father of the Green Revolution,” working with researchers around the world, developed high-yielding varieties and modern production practices that helped save untold numbers of people from starvation. Today, agriculture scientists are once again facing the need to create the kind of success through science that Dr. Borlaug achieved – this time with an even greater challenge:  increasing production by 70% by during a time of natural resource limitations and climate variability. The United Nations has projected the world population to grow to over 9 billion people by .  Today, over 800,000 people are hungry around the globe, an improvement but still unacceptable.   To meet this challenge, in President Obama launched with other G-8 Leaders the “Agriculture and Food Security Initiative”, collectively committing $22 billion in new investments in agriculture and nutrition.  The Feed the Future Initiative is the United State’s effort to support this global effort; the first Feed the Future Progress Report will be released this Thursday at the World Food Prize Foundation’s Borlaug Symposium by USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah. In addition, the G-20 has played a critical role in increasing market transparency and supporting agricultural development.  I recently led the U.S. Government’s delegation to the first-ever Meeting of Agricultural Chief Scientists, convened from an initiative of the G20 and hosted by the Mexican government. For the first time, the people in charge of their countries’ food and natural resources science agencies sat together in a room and forged agreements on how to determine the most crucial priorities for our nations, working together, in the coming years so that we can meet this global food challenge. We discussed “blue sky” ideas – the wish list ag researchers think may have the greatest potential to transform our ability to meet food needs while conserving precious natural resources: finding ways for plants to fix nitrogen from the air into their tissues, thus decreasing harmful run-off of fertilizers into watersheds; discovering methods to turn annual crops into perennials that don’t need replanting, to reduce soil erosion, labor costs and  fossil fuel inputs; and determining solutions to preserve our precious water supply.  We agreed upon the urgency of this fundamental research as well as coordinating our research to make the best use of limited government funds. Perhaps the most important development from the meeting, though, was our agreement to break down the walls between our scientific communities, and use online global platforms to share genomic and genetic , improve agricultural innovation systems, and open access to scholarly publications and other technical documentation. We recognize the common goal we share and know that none of us will reach it on our own – and we don’t have time to waste. Science is most successful when it’s done in a collaborative, coordinated manner. New technologies and information sharing opportunities give us the tools we need to work together and use the multiplier effect of our expertise to speed progress on this urgently needed agenda. Lastly, we also recognized the need to support agricultural research. Scientists around the globe are ready, willing and able to address the challenge of feeding the world. It requires the sustained commitment of stakeholders and investors around the world to meet the call to action this World Food Day represents.

"Eastern Mountain Region Director, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Conservation  Apr 30,  That's a lot of cows, and soybeans, and corn, and horses - Kentucky Agriculture is growing! Check back next week for another spotlight on another state and the results of the Census of Agriculture. The Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture. Kentucky and cattle have always been a perfect match, and as the most recent Census of Agriculture shows that bond remains to this day. In , the year for which we conducted the Census, Kentucky farmers sold more than $1 billion worth of cattle and calves. Beef cattle production has become an increasingly important sector for many farms transitioning away from tobacco production. Overall, about half of all farms in Kentucky owned cattle in . That’s not surprising, considering we have some of the best cattle pasture in the United States. While cattle have a long history in Kentucky, poultry production has emerged as a leading agriculture activity in the last 25 years. Broiler production on 826 Kentucky farms in totaled 761 billion head ranking the state 7th nationally. Kentucky, of course, is known for horses and in horse and pony sales were $178 million. This does not count the many horses born and raised on Kentucky farms, but owned by out of state interests, most of which are the thoroughbreds that made the Kentucky Derby so famous. While livestock is an important element of our agriculture, there are plenty of other sides to Kentucky farming. After all, in , our farmers and ranchers sold more than $5 billion worth of agricultural products, with nearly $2.3 billion coming from crop sales. Expansion of the Kentucky Proud ™ brand for Kentucky's agricultural products has also increased agricultural diversification. In Kentucky, soybeans and corn are the top crops.  Nearly 1.47 million acres of farmland were dedicated to soybeans, with farmers selling more than $752 million worth of the crop in . Corn was harvested from 1.53 million acres while sales totaled $694 million. And then there’s tobacco, which continues to be an important crop. Despite the continuing decrease in farms raising tobacco, Kentucky still has the largest number of tobacco farms in the United States. In , more than 4,500 of our farms grew this crop. This is a significant drop from the more than 8,000 tobacco farms the Census counted in , but we still have nearly 3 times as many farms as North Carolina, which is in distant second place in this category. As you can see, Kentucky has a strong presence of all aspects of U.S. agriculture. Our livestock and our crops sectors both have something special to highlight. Agriculture keeps evolving, and as we have seen, our farmers adjust right along with the industry and continue to maintain a strong presence in the Bluegrass State. In just a few short years, we’ll conduct the Census of Agriculture to see how our agriculture continues to move forward. So stay tuned!
