Web and social media analytics also provided key insights to popular content and user preferences, which we continuously evaluate to make adjustments to our digital content.\nEnhancements to USDA.gov include:\nRepositioning the homepage photo carousel on the left to optimize content flow and organization\nPlacing social media icon links on the top right to maintain consistent navigation across USDA.gov subpages\nA new TV and Radio Hub feature on the homepage to highlight USDA’s YouTube and Weekly Radio activities\nExpanding our Popular Topics section across two columns for quick and direct access from the homepage\nTwo additional graphic badges on the homepage to highlight special programs and initiatives\nModifications to the overall look and feel to provide a cleaner, less cluttered appearance\nThrough these enhancements, USDA.gov further extends the OneUSDA vision by incorporating the USDA branding to our website. We will also work with USDA Agency and Offices to modify their websites to consistently align with these visual standards in the coming weeks.\nFollowing the release of the Digital Government Strategy by the White House in May -- USDA’s Office of Communications, Web Communications Division launched a digital content review of the USDA.gov website to revitalize and strengthen its web presence aiming to improve service to the public with high-quality digital government content.\nBetween and , USDA published approximately 6,388 web pages, including over 4,000 newsroom pages.

Of those pages – over 1,400 were identified as outdated or obsolete and removed from the website, reducing total site content by approximately 25% and topical content by more than 70%.\nImprovements were also made to hundreds of pages which included accessibility and usability enhancements and a metrics assessment of all content on the site was conducted. New web measures and best practices have now been implemented to further optimize content and ensure federal and strategic plans are fully implemented across the site.\nIn addition, we launched USASearch on the site in January .  USASearch is a free search engine tool based on open source technology and is provided by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA).

Of that, 20 billion gallons are targeted to come from sources such as switchgrass, energy cane, woody biomass and other non-food feedstocks. This year, Argyropoulos said, U.S. production is expected to approach 14 billion gallons from all sources.\nSarah Bittleman, Senior Advisor on Energy to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, outlined the USDA programs that, in total, show the department’s commitment to a full array of renewable energy development activities.  She spoke about the five regional biomass research centers that have been designated across the nation to identify feedstocks that will support a growing demand for biofuels and she said USDA’s Risk Management Agency is working to provide crop insurance products to support the feedstock energy crops that American farmers and ranchers will produce.  Bittleman also said that “the least expensive energy is the energy you never have to use,” and she spoke about how USDA’s Rural Energy for America program is helping farmers, ranchers and small business owners cut energy costs and improve energy efficiencies.\nShe also discussed the important partnership between USDA and other departments including EPA and the Department of Energy as they work to fulfill President Obama’s renewable energy goals as outlined in his State of the Union address.\nPaul Bryan, Senior Program Manager with the Department of Energy, discussed his background in the petroleum sector and outlined for the audience the opportunities and challenges that refiners face as they transport and blend fuel. He spoke of how renewable fuels create economic opportunities and “jobs that cannot be outsourced,” reduce greenhouse gas emissions, cut direct and indirect costs of imported oil and keep the U.S. a technology leader. Bryan said, “It all starts with sustainable supplies of feedstocks.”\nJournalist Jerry Hagstrom, veteran national agriculture reporter, provided his analysis of the political climate in the current reality of $100/barrel crude oil.  Summing up the importance of renewable energy production to rural America, moderator Harry Baumes, Ph.D., director of USDA’s Office of Energy Policy and New Uses, noted that he “doesn’t think there is one agency in USDA that doesn’t have an energy component.”\nThe Ag Outlook Forum concludes later today.\nDr Harry Baumes (at podium) from USDA, leads a panel discussion on renewable energy issues at the Ag Outlook Forum (Photo by Bob Nichols, USDA)\n Category/Topic:\n Energy\n Tags:\n Agricultural Outlook Forum\n DOE\n Energy\n Energy Independence and Security Act\n energy independent\n EPA\n Harry Baumes\n Paul Argyropoulos\n Paul Bryan\n President Obama\n Renewable Fuel Standard\n RMA\n Rural Energy for America\n Sarah Bittleman\n Tom Vilsack",

StrikeForce for Rural Growth and Opportunity is an effort Secretary Vilsack launched in to address the distinct set of challenges America’s most rural areas face. This added effort also helps to fulfill USDA’s commitment to Native American tribes. Since StrikeForce began, I’ve had the honor of meeting with many Native American tribal members to identify where USDA Rural Development may serve their communities best.\nThe Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah welcomed the USDA family around a great wooden table at their headquarters in Cedar City. Representatives from Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Farm Service Agency (FSA), and Rural Development (RD) came together with the Utah Governor's Office to show our combined support to the Paiute Tribe. More importantly, we were there to listen to what the Tribe and its five constituent bands could tell us about their plans for the future, as well as their needs.\nThe number of committed minds at one table guaranteed we would hear some exceptional ideas. Gaylord Robb handles economic development matters for the Tribe and suggested they plant a pumpkin patch, saying he’s seen others attract hundreds of people per day. Geri Lafferty, Chairwoman for the Paiute Tribe, added that in the past school children have had to travel more than an hour to purchase pumpkins for fall celebrations. The one suggestion got the ball rolling for other ideas to follow. Mark Gibbons, FSA State Executive Director added that, in addition to pumpkins, the Tribe could make the most of Utah’s growing season by double-cropping on the same land. Another person said they could use the produce to sell at farmer’s markets or serve meals in local community centers.\nWhether the pumpkin patch ends up the most sincere has yet to be seen, but there was no lack of sincerity in the combined efforts of the participants of this meeting – and it is through our StrikeForce partnerships and this cooperation that we will succeed in bringing new prosperity to our most impoverished rural areas.\nGeri Lafferty (right) welcomes USDA representatives Doug O’Brien (left) and Tim Wilson of NRCS (center) to Paiute Indian Tribe headquarters in Cedar City, Utah.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n FSA\n Halloween\n Native Americans\n NRCS\n Paiute Tribe\n pumpkins\n RD\n StrikeForce\n Tom Vilsack\n Utah",

Now is the time to start making your plans so that your Thanksgiving dinner will be safe and stress-free.\nPlan out your menu, and from there make your shopping list.\n Make a list of the foods you can buy well in advance (including canned goods and mixes, potatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and onions) and purchase them now.\n If you are buying a frozen turkey it can also be purchased well ahead of time, but remember to allow one day for each 5 pounds of weight to thaw it in the refrigerator.\n If you are buying a fresh turkey, check the manufacturer’s tag to make sure it will keep until Thanksgiving. If there is no ‘use by’ or ‘best by’ date, wait until 1-2 days before Thanksgiving to purchase your turkey.\nTimesaving Tip: Prepared Foods\nSave time by buying vegetables already washed and cut from the produce section, the freezer section, or even your grocery store salad bar. Side dishes and desserts may also be available; these can be purchased up to four days before Thanksgiving. Keep them in the refrigerator or freezer until ready to use.\nAs Thanksgiving gets closer, take the time to clean out your refrigerator to make room for all the holiday foods that will need to be stored there. This is also a good time to make space on your counters.\nTimesaving Tip: Having Guests?\nAssign some of the cooking to them, especially the dishes you don’t care to prepare yourself. If you’re responsible for the main meal, have your dinner guests bring appetizers and desserts.\nIt’s important that the food you are serving is held at a safe temperature.\n If your guests are bringing food, find out in advance if their dishes will need to be refrigerated, if they will need to be kept warm or if they will be cooked at your house.\n Food that needs to be kept warm should be placed in the oven, warming trays or chafing dishes to keep them hot.\n Thanksgiving dinner is a long meal, so you don’t want food (whether hot or cold) sitting at room temperature before mealtime. Place cold foods in the refrigerator and keep hot foods above 140°F.\nOnce dinner has been served, pack up any leftovers as quickly as possible and refrigerate.\n 76 percent of respondents in a recent USDA study said they would refrigerate leftovers after letting them cool to room temperature first. This is not necessary, and could actually make your food unsafe. Food poisoning bacteria grows faster at room temperature, so for safety you want the leftovers to cool down as quickly possible.\n Leftovers cool down faster in the refrigerator than they will on the counter, so divide them into small portions or shallow containers for rapid cooling. Use within four days, or freeze.\nTimesaving Tip: Make Leftovers Last\nNow that your Thanksgiving leftovers are in smaller portions in the freezer or refrigerator, use them for future family meals. Just a quick reheat to 165°F in the microwave, and those leftovers will be a great timesaver for your busy family!\nHave questions about Thanksgiving? Call the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline to talk to a food safety expert, available from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, in English and Spanish.

Ash applied to the USDA National Scholars Program during her senior year of high school. She recalls guidance counselors providing excellent summaries of different scholarship opportunities, but she decided that the USDA National Scholars Program offered the best fit for her career aspirations.\nUSDA scholars are awarded annual tuition, fees, books and room and board for each academic year of their scholarship. They also have an opportunity to work with USDA each summer and, upon completion of their academic degree program, to continue their professional career with USDA.\nShe spent last summer in Orangeburg, South Carolina completing an internship as a soil conservationist with USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. Ash, originally from Covington, Georgia just outside Atlanta, appreciated the rural setting of Orangeburg. “It was really fun to experience a different climate and observe different agricultural methods,” she said.\nHer internship experience highlighted the important ways the USDA National Scholars program allows students to connect hands-on field work with classroom knowledge. “I’m taking an entomology course this fall,” Ash said, “I’m already relating the course material to what I learned last summer.” She considers this opportunity to explore real world applications of academic knowledge to be the biggest difference between the USDA National Scholars Program and other scholarships.\nDuring her first summer internship, Ash received training and experience in developing Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) plans with producers that integrate conservation practices into working lands. She also had the opportunity to shadow a soils conservation technician in the field to ensure producer compliance with EQIP plans.\n“Jordyn entered a busy work environment and picked up things super quick,” says Dextrin Dorsey, district conservationist and Ash’s internship supervisor. “When things got tight, she’d step in and offer to help. She was professional at all times and a pleasure to have in the office.”\nAsh is already thinking ahead to future internships. “My goal for next summer is to shadow an agronomist,” she said. She is taking advanced courses in horticulture and botany this semester to prepare for that possibility.\nThe National Scholars Program is currently accepting applications for the -25 school year through March 1, .

Producers must decide when to plant and pick crops, package produce, find buyers and select the right shipper to transport products to market. Hundreds of people and thousands of decisions are needed to get the fruits and vegetables people love to stores at peak freshness.

Unfortunately, our nation is facing an unprecedented nutrition crisis, with far too many Americans facing both food insecurity and obesity.  Although it seems paradoxical, the two actually go hand in hand far too often.  To reverse the course of this two-sided crisis, we must create a cultural change that facilitates and encourages healthy food choices among all Americans.\nOne example of how USDA has been working to implement this cultural shift is the Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP) project that was recently conducted in Massachusetts. The goal of this project was to provide SNAP participants greater access to healthy foods and better nutrition through financial incentives at the point of purchase.  Specifically, we tested the impact of providing families with 30 extra cents in SNAP benefits per benefit dollar that they spent on fruits and vegetables.  We were very encouraged by the results.  On average, people who received the incentives ate about 26 percent more fruits and vegetables per day than people who did not receive the incentives—a substantial increase!\n Kevin Concannon, Undersecretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services\n Posted in\n Food and Nutrition\n Oct 06, \n 3 Responses",

Check back next Thursday for another spotlight from the Census of Agriculture.\nThe Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture.\nThe Census of Agriculture results are out and, just as many predicted, Indiana agriculture continues to grow. True to our state's motto, \"The Crossroads of America,\" the state of Indiana has a very diverse agriculture. The Hoosier State is a large contributor of corn, soybeans, tomatoes, ducks, milk, hogs, chickens and turkeys. And these are just a few of many commodities produced in Indiana.\nAccording to the census results, there are 58,695 farms (ranking 7th nationally) on 14,720,396 acres of farm land in Indiana. Even though was a drought year, Indiana ranked 10th nationally in total sales by topping $11 billion, a 36 percent increase from just five years ago, which was the last time my agency conducted the Census of Agriculture. We also ranked 7th nationally in crop sales with just over $7.5 billion and 18th nationally in livestock sales with just over $3.6 billion.\nThe majority of our agricultural income in Indiana traditionally comes from crops and was no exception. Indiana growers produced more than 597 million bushels of corn and sold nearly $4.1 billion worth of this crop. Our local growers also produced nearly 219 million bushels of soybeans which results in sales of more than $2.9 billion and more than 19 million bushels of winter wheat, with total sales amounting to more than $140 million.\nNot to be outdone, the Livestock industry is also well represented in the Hoosier State. Indiana farmers sold more than $659 million worth of milk in , putting Indiana into 14th place nationally in that category. And hog sales were just below that number at over $1.2 billion in sales. In the poultry industry, Indiana ranked 3rd nationally with a layer inventory of over 25 million layers and ranked 7th nationally with a turkey inventory of over 5 million.\nOn the demographics side, the average age of Indiana farmers is 55.8 years, which is below than the national average of 58.3 years. Only 4,764 operators are under the age of 35 and slightly less than 16 percent of our principal operators have been operating any farm less than 10 years. Women are the principal operator on over 9 percent of Indiana farms.\nThese are just some of the exciting facts about Indiana agriculture.

(Photo by City of Durango)\nLike the famous cartoon character Yogi Bear, black bears are quick to take advantage of food left out by people. Black bears forage on garbage, bird seed, dog food, and other food items commonly found around homes and businesses. This has led to an increase in conflicts between bears and people in cities and towns across America. Unfortunately, these conflicts often end badly for the bears with many being killed or moved to prevent injuries to people and property damage.\nTo help address these issues, researchers with USDA-APHIS Wildlife Services’ National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) partnered with Colorado Parks and Wildlife to evaluate whether the use of bear-resistant trash containers in Durango, Colorado, could reduce bear-human conflicts in the mountain town.\n“The changes we observed were immediate once residents starting using bear-resistant trash containers,” states NWRC research wildlife biologist Dr. Stewart Breck. “We divided the town into two treatment and two control areas for comparison. The residents in the treatment areas received bear-resistant containers free of charge, while residents in the control areas continued to use their own trash containers. Trash-related conflicts were 60 percent lower and compliance with local wildlife ordinances increased 39 percent in the areas with bear-resistant containers.”\nResearchers recommend that municipalities within or adjacent to bear habitat consider bear-proofing measures, such as providing residents with bear-resistant trash containers, implementing bear-proofing ordinances or regulations, and increasing the enforcement of existing regulations.\n“Simple changes in human behavior can reap big benefits,” notes Breck. “If people keep their trash and other potential food items, like birdseed and dog food, off limits to bears, not only will they protect their homes and property from bear damage, but they’ll also protect bears.”\nFor more information on this study, please see Assessing Ecological and Social Outcomes of a Bear-Proofing Experiment (, 6 ) in the Journal of Wildlife Management.\nNWRC is the research arm of APHIS’ Wildlife Services program. Its mission is to use scientific expertise to help reduce human-wildlife conflicts related to agriculture, natural resources, property, and human and health and safety.

This year, excitement in the U.S. pavilion was particularly high as the United States recently concluded negotiations with South Korea on the pending U.S.-Korea trade agreement (KORUS), which will provide American agriculture with improved access to Korea’s $1 trillion economy.\nThe United States is already Korea’s top supplier of a broad variety of food and farm products. U.S. agriculture, fish and forestry exports to Korea totaled $5.8 billion in , making Korea the fifth largest export market for U.S. farm products. Under the KORUS, American products will become significantly more affordable for Korea’s 49 million consumers, since the trade agreement will eliminate most of Korea’s tariffs (taxes on imports).\n Katie Gorscak, Public Affairs Specialist, Foreign Agricultural Service\n Posted in\n Trade\n May 02, \n Respond to this story",

Additionally, almost all of the $11 million per year that USDA purchases for use in Puerto Rico’s school meals are purchased from companies in the continental United States.  What’s more, each year the island’s School Food Authority purchases about $80 million in food to be served in school.  We saw these as opportunities for local farmers and decided to do something about it.\nThe Market Expansion Conference, held June 23-24 in San Juan, teamed seven U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agencies and other Commonwealth and federal partners to show over 250 farmers how to sell food to local schools, expand their businesses and increase their participation in USDA programs.  Puerto Rico’s milk farmers, cattle ranchers, pineapple growers and many others eagerly listened to USDA experts explain grading and licensing, and provide information in the areas of funding and procurement.\nJuan Ortiz Servia, State Executive Director for the USDA Farm Service Agency, greets a local farmer at the Market Expansion Conference held June 22 & 23 in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\nUSDA has many diverse constituencies and, as part of our cultural transformation, we are working to reach and serve those constituents in the most effective way possible.  In this case it meant conducting the entire conference in Spanish.  Juan Garcia, Acting Deputy Administrator for Farm Service Agency (FSA)’s Farm Programs, even delivered the keynote address in Spanish.

Last week I only had to travel as far as Kansas City to meet nearly two dozen African ministers of trade, commerce, and agriculture for a visit to the Kansas City Board of Trade as part of the African Growth and Opportunity Act Forum.\nAs agriculture plays a key role in African development, governments have a crucial role to play in ensuring a favorable market climate for their farmers and agricultural products. The ministers learned about the Board of Trade’s day-to-day exchange operations, where hard red winter wheat is bought and sold in the futures market. We took a tour of the trading floor to see traders in action and also met with researchers at some of America’s premier land grant universities to learn how they provide farmers and USDA with valuable research and new technologies.\nI explained how USDA creates a favorable climate by supporting market infrastructure like the Kansas City Board of Trade in a number of ways. For example, USDA collects and facilitates reporting on domestic and international crop prices, which informs trading decisions.  The Department of Agriculture also establishes and enforces grading standards for agricultural products, so that buyers know the quality to expect. Finally, the U.S. Warehouse Act allows agricultural products to be graded and classified, providing a receipt which can act as portable collateral for a future loan. Government support and standardization provides buyers with reliable information allowing them to make confident decisions. I hope the ministers will take some of these ideas back with them.\nThe United States is actively helping African governments create and monitor their own commodity exchanges, for example, with Malawi’s Agricultural Commodity Exchange for Africa (ACE).  ACE is an internet-based regional exchange operating in the spot (immediate) and forward (futures) market, set up with help from U.S. Agency for International Development.  ACE helps to give small-scale farmers leverage in negotiating for their crops by providing them with reliable market information both pre- and post-harvest, which ultimately improves competition and communications, and ensures higher prices for higher quality.\nParticipating in the AGOA forum has been a pleasure for me, and I look forward to next year, when we can hear about success from agricultural business partnerships created during this year’s forum. \nUnder Secretary Jim Miller speaks about how USDA supports commodity exchanges in the United States.\n Category/Topic:\n USDA Results\n Trade\n Tags:\n African Growth and Opportunity Act\n Economy\n FFAS\n Jim Miller",

The press conference was preceded by an informal breakfast with a Mary’s Center nutritionist, families and young women, where chefs provided cooking demonstrations. The menus featured nutritious, visually appealing and delicious WIC-approved foods. I saw firsthand the critical role our Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) plays in improving nutritional assistance for pregnant women and young children.  The foods reflected recent changes to the food packages, making them healthier and culturally relevant to our participants.\nThe breakfast helped set the stage for the messages delivered by the speakers, each of whom talked about the connection between child nutrition, children’s health outcomes and future achievement.   As I looked around the Center, I couldn’t help but be encouraged by the hard work and dedication of this important community partner providing such a wide range of services to the community.  In other words, it’s a program that does a lot for the health of their community.\nWhile at the Center, I had the chance to speak about the administration’s strong commitment to nutrition assistance as an essential support for low-income families.   My focus was clear: the administration remains strongly committed to nutrition assistance as an essential support for  families.  And we know that in order to end hunger we have to improve access to our programs and remove barriers that prevent people from participating.  We’ve made great strides in achieving our goal but we must continue to work on new and creative approaches to getting more Hispanic households participating in our programs.\nI was reminded of the power of our programs as I listened to Brenda Alvarado’s story—a 17-year-old who had been a WIC baby and continues to participate in health and nutrition counseling programs provided at Mary’s Center.  Her message about how much these programs have meant to her and her family resonated with everyone in the room.

Immediately support for such an effort poured in and the first People’s Garden was built here in Washington, DC. A few months’ later employees outside the Capital Beltway received a challenge from Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack encouraging them to be involved in these efforts and create similar gardens at their USDA facility or within the community where they work. A movement that started with one garden was about to spread its roots and it did just that in .\nThis past year, thousands of USDA employees and partners heeded Secretary Vilsack’s call to give back by volunteering their time to participate in the department-wide People’s Garden Initiative. The garden at Headquarters is now just one of 1,241 People’s Gardens that have expanded to all 50 states, two U.S. territories, and three foreign countries. Thanks to USDA’s partnership with Keep America Beautiful the number of gardens doubled.\nPeople’s Gardens are located on federally owned or leased property, at schools, faith-based centers, and other places within the community. Fresh fruits and vegetables are being grown for those in need and native trees, shrubs and flowers for wildlife. Sustainable landscape practices that nurture, maintain and protect the health of our soil, water and air are used. And these beautiful, thriving gardens became places for neighbors to gather, learn, share, and enjoy within both rural and urban areas.\nThe Initiative’s Share Your Harvest campaign was hugely successful resulting in People’s Gardens donating the most food, 20% of USDA’s total, for the Feds Feed Families summer food drive. USDA won first place from the Office of Personnel Management for donating more food than any other Federal Agency.  This was the result of only 373 of the total gardens that grew and donated  122,522 pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables to their neighborhood food pantries, kitchens and shelters – improving access to healthy, affordable food at a local level in .\nPartnerships with schools took shape so youth would learn how to grow, tend, harvest and prepare nutritious seasonal produce, in the educational settings of the classroom, the garden, the kitchen, the school cafeteria and the home. This included an announcement for a $1 million grant to fund a People’s Garden School Pilot Program by USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service. One grantee will be selected this spring to develop and run community gardens at eligible high-poverty schools; teach students involved in the gardens about agriculture production practices, diet, and nutrition; and evaluate the learning outcomes.\nCreating gardens has allowed employees new ways to connect with colleagues, neighbors, and local volunteer organizations in their community. These efforts, along with the hard work of organizations involved in similar efforts, have proven that the simple act of planting a garden can make real and lasting change to improve food access and promote healthy lifestyles in communities with highest risk and greatest need. Let’s build on these successes and broaden our reach in .\nWant to learn more?

Prior to the launch, Hunger Task Force worked for nearly a year with schools, parks, Boys and Girls Clubs and other organizations to ensure that there would be sites at which the USDA meals could be served.\nWhen all the footwork had been done, Milwaukee was ready for the launch of its program which is covered by most local media. The event takes place at the loading dock at Milwaukee Hunger Task Force’s food bank where volunteers from Kohl’s—which pledged $1.5 million over three years to provide suppers for kids to complement the Summer Food Service Program—loaded signs that read “Kids Eat Free Meals HERE” and “Comidas de verano gratis para los niños AQUÍ” into their cars. Kohl’s and Hunger Task Force staff then fanned out across the city to surround feeding sites with the bright green signs, so that kids and communities know where to go to get a meal during the summer.\nKohl’s volunteers await directions from Milwaukee Hunger Task Force Director Sherrie Tussler while local news cameras look on. \nUSDA show that in , over 17 million children lived in food insecure households.\nThanks to the efforts of the “village” of Milwaukee, that city’s children are more likely to have access to a summer meal—and to know where to find one.\nPlease follow USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service on Twitter.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Boys and Girls Clubs of Milwaukee\n FNS\n Kohl’s\n Milwaukee Hunger Task Force\n Milwaukee Park System\n Milwaukee Public Schools\n Salvation Army\n Summer Food Service Program",

However, the home did not have the available funds to do so.\nSteve’s facility had previously worked with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development to assist with financing a much-needed water system upgrade for Fahrney-Keedy Memorial Home. “After working with USDA Rural Development for a loan to help fix our water tower, I thought I would reach out again and see if this type of expansion matched other programs that may be available,” said Coetzee.\nSteve contacted USDA Rural Development and learned about the Community Facilities Loan and Grant program which provides affordable funding to develop essential community facilities in rural areas.

Photo by A. Jay, Chun-Li Integrated Marketing and Communications Co., Ltd\nThanks to Foreign Agricultural Service employees serving at USDA’s 98 international posts, American Thanksgiving traditions – and food – are being enjoyed around the world this November. \nThis is certainly the case in Taiwan, where the Agricultural Trade Office (ATO) in Taipei teamed with China TV to highlight the holiday on an episode of the popular TV show “King of the Happy Life” this week.\nValerie Brown from ATO Taipei was joined by Daisy Hong, who represents the grower-owned cooperative Ocean Spray, and chef C.K. Chen from Taipei’s Sherwood Hotel. In addition to Thanksgiving staples like turkey and pumpkin pie, they featured new recipes, including stuffing and hot cranberry-apple cider made with Ocean Spray products.\nAfter taping the show, Chen began taking orders for traditional American Thanksgiving baskets, which the Sherwood Hotel sells every year. Not only do these baskets feature traditional American dishes, many of the ingredients are exported by the United States, including turkey, cranberries, broccoli, potatoes, beets, lettuce and California wine.\nFollowing the Thanksgiving episode of “King of the Happy Life” last year, Chen was so overwhelmed with orders that he had to limit the number of baskets available this year.\nThe popularity of these Thanksgiving baskets is reflective of increased demand for U.S. food and agriculture around the world.  Earlier this month, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that U.S. agricultural exports reached a record $137.4 billion in fiscal year , which exceeds the previous record by $22.5 billion. The agricultural trade surplus soared to a record $42.7 billion in FY.\nThis rise in exports is good news for all Americans, especially considering every $1 billion of U.S. agricultural exports supports 8,400 American jobs. Last year alone, agricultural exports helped support 1.15 million jobs.

The bright blue sky and expansive mountain range set a dramatic backdrop for the six raised beds and two greenhouses. Mona, a precocious 12 year-old student at Magdalena Middle School in New Mexico, wastes no time charging into the greenhouse and swiftly picking red leaf lettuce. She instructs me on proper harvest techniques while happily munching on Swiss chard, kale and lettuce straight from the garden – she clearly has no need for salad dressing.\nSince , the Office of Community Food Systems has awarded over $20 million to more than 300 grantees for farm to school, which encompasses efforts to integrate regional foods in child nutrition programs. It also connects children to the source of their food through cooking classes, taste-tests, farm visits and school gardens. Grants range from $14,500 to $100,000 for farm to school planning, implementation and training.\nIn May, I had the chance to visit New Mexico’s Magdalena Municipal School District, a and Farm to School grantee. The school used the funds to contract with Omar, a local farmer who mentors students to grow and harvest over 10 crops. Students proudly shared what they learned from the garden club, including “irrigation systems” and “how to get rid of aphids using ladybugs.” The school’s salad bar is the star of the lunchroom and is described as “restaurant-quality,” as it includes student-grown lettuce, leafy greens, cucumbers and tomatoes from the school garden. Since they no longer need to purchase lettuce during the winter, the cafeteria staff shared, “the garden has saved us a lot of money!”\nUsing additional grant funds from the state, the school will pay students to maintain the garden through the summer and sell the produce at a farm stand. This type of program is incredibly important in a community like Magdalena, where the closest grocery store is 30 miles away. Joaquin Lujan, a local farmer and partner to the school garden project, explained “New Mexico is one of the poorest economies in the country, and kids go hungry. It is vital that projects like this survive.” When Leslie Clark, the school principal, and Michael Chavez, the New Mexico Department of Education State Director, were asked what they would say to fellow administrators about the benefits of Farm to School, they responded “It reaches kids that would not otherwise be reached and engages them in learning.”\nOn June 12, we awarded Farm to School grants to 65 grantees, which will reach approximately 5,500 schools and more than 2 million students. Selected projects are located in urban, rural and suburban areas across 42 states and Puerto Rico. We estimate that 37 percent of the target school districts are rural. Additionally, 14 projects will occur in the pre-K environment, while 27 projects will occur in summer feeding programs. State agencies and Indian Tribal Organizations remain a priority for Farm to School grant funding.  And this year, we will fund 17 state agencies and one Indian Tribal Organization, The Karuk Tribe of California.\nWe congratulate our Farm to School Grantees, including Magdalena School District, as they are handed the torch to continue the farm to school work that has impacted over 23 million children nationwide thus far.

(USDA, Erich Glasgow)\nWhile we are raising awareness about invasive pests during Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month, I wanted to share a bit about what I do every day to protect agriculture. When you picture someone on the front lines of stopping invasive pests, you probably picture someone outside – in a field or a tree. But I fight invasive pests from a completely different location – my computer.\nA big way invasive pests can move from one location to another is through unregulated internet sales. We are seeing more and more of these sales, and it’s a real concern. Why? With normal commercial or retail sales, we can use techniques like quarantines and fumigation to make sure that purchased items are pest-free or don’t enter pest-free areas. But many times, sales on the internet do not follow these techniques, opening up the chance for invasive pests to move freely to new areas. My job is to look for these types of sale offers online and stop them.\nIt may not seem exciting, but I enjoy the challenge. Looking for person-to-person sales of prohibited agricultural items on the internet involves a lot of research and investigative work. I use many tools to help me do my job, including open source, government and subscription databases and software that lets me form a “map” of connections to provide a visual of how prohibited items are moving into the country. When I identify a sale of regulated items, I work with the internet company to identify the buyers and sellers, and work to close the pathway by stopping the sale. This can be by removing or amending the listing to include restrictions on where the product may be sent. In many cases, I coordinate with other SITC employees, who physically visit the locations to perform inspections and search for the prohibited item(s).\nOne area where we see growing promotion and sales of agricultural products is on social media. I am spending more time reviewing social media posts to look for previously unidentified pathways for items to enter the U.S.\nI enjoy my work and I’m proud of the role I play in helping stop illegal internet sales. I never know what my day will look like. Many days, I never leave my computer. Other days, I may give presentations to help others understand the work we do. I’m even the lead author on a white paper on preventing illegal sales through e-commerce. I worked with officials from the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand on that project. In , I received the Employee of the Year award from the Plant Protection and Quarantine leadership for my efforts to protect American agriculture.\nWe are increasing our outreach and education activities to help make sure people understand why buying agricultural items on the internet – especially from foreign countries or individuals instead of companies – can be dangerous. I find many people just aren’t aware that certain products are restricted or banned completely. They just want to purchase something and look for the best deal.\nHelp me raise awareness and protect our agriculture from invasive pests. Be careful when buying agricultural products on the Internet. When in doubt, you can always contact us to find out if an item is allowed, restricted or banned. Together, we can keep harmful invasive species from entering the country through illegal internet sales.\nUnited States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue has proclaimed April as Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month (, 518). The goal of IPPDAM is to: increase public awareness of invasive species; provide tips to prevent their spread; and, encourage residents to report signs of them.\nTrained detector dogs can check mailed parcels and cargo for invasive pests that can lead to costly eradication efforts if they become established.

USDA photo by Bob Nichols.\nIt’s hard to believe it’s been nearly seven years since the lives of the citizens of New Orleans and surrounding areas of the Gulf Coast were changed forever in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. This epic storm demanded an immediate and unprecedented response. I was proud to be part of USDA’s team that quickly mobilized to provide disaster food assistance.\nMillions of people in the Gulf area needed food, and with charitable organizations setting up mass feeding sites to serve evacuees, there was a huge need for commodities.  USDA provided 22 million pounds of food, such as fruits, juices, vegetables, meats and grains, as well as infant formula and baby food, for use in congregate meal service and distribution of household food packages until the Disaster Food Stamp Program (now Disaster SNAP) became operational.\nUSDA quickly approved over ates, including Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, to operate Disaster Food Stamp Programs for storm survivors.  Disaster Food Stamp Programs usually provide a single month of benefits to needy survivors, but the need was so great and the damage so widespread that survivors from large areas of Louisiana and Mississippi received a second or even a third monthly benefit.\nThere was another twist in getting Disaster Food Stamp benefits to those in need – many people had fled the Gulf area and taken refuge in other parts of the country—survivors travelled to all parts of the country, from the east coast to the west and all points in between.  So, for the first time, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) established an evacuee policy which authorized other States to immediately serve people who had fled the Gulf, some of whom had no belongings or documents. In all, over 1.4 million households received more than $amp benefits.\nWe also granted waivers to schools outside of the devastated areas, allowing them to provide free school meals to children who had fled the impacted areas and had begun attending classes elsewhere.\nI can’t tell you how many FNS staff spent week after week on the road or on conference calls to ensure that our programs were responding to the needs of survivors.  But I can definitely tell you that every one of them wanted to be a part of the response in any and every way they could.  Again, I’m proud to have been a part of such an effort.\nUSDA was one of few Departments to be recognized by the White House for its efforts in “what went right prior to and in the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.”\nMore important than any recognition, however, was making a difference in the lives of those effected by this historic disaster.  And beyond the immediate response, the Katrina experience prepared us to better serve countless other survivors of natural disasters that have occurred in the years since.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n disaster\n DSNAP\n FNS\n hurricane\n Hurricane Katrina\n Jessica Shahin\n usda150",

The piece aired on Thursday, January 14th.\nYesterday, an ABC Good Morning America (GMA) crew visited the Academy for Global Citizenship in Chicago. Why was GMA at a small neighborhood school on the Second City’s southwest side on a frosty day in January? To help underscore the importance of Agriculture Secretary Vilsack’s recent announcement of proposed changes to school meal standards.\n“With many children consuming as many as half their daily calories at school, strengthening nutritional standards is an important step in the Obama administration’s effort to combat childhood obesity and improve the health and wellbeing of all our kids,” the Secretary said as part of a major announcement yesterday that was praised by Administration officials and nutrition advocates across the country.\nGMA decided to feature the Academy and its students during its broadcast of the Secretary’s announcement because its meals already conform with USDA’s proposed rules. In fact, late last year the school was awarded the Department’s Gold Medal of Distinction for improving the health, nutrition and fitness of students through USDA’s Healthier US School Challenge.\nI decided to visit the school during GMA’s visit there and what I saw was impressive. For lunch, plenty of healthy options were served—from teriyaki chicken with broccoli, carrots and almonds, to colorful fresh berries—and the students were devouring the food. In fact, some of the students (pictured below) delighted in showing me—and the film crew—their clean lunch trays.\nWhile it was easy to get distracted by the cameras and microphones, I was most excited to see children eating healthy and nutritious food as part of USDA’s school meal program. And with the passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of , signed into law by President Barack Obama on December 13, , and these proposed rules, America’s children are likely to get a whole lot healthier.\nPlease follow USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service on Twitter.\nStudents who appeared to be unofficial members of Chicago's Academy for Global Citizenship's Clean Plate Club spoke with reporter Blaird Smart for a segment on proposed rules for new meal patterns that aired on ABC's Good Morning America on January 14th.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Academy for Global Citizenship\n Chicago\n CNR\n FNS\n Good Morning America\n HealthierUS School Challenge\n Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act\n Illinois\n Let's Move\n Presient Obama\n Tom Vilsack",

The vegetables are grown on Micheli and his wife’s (Brittany Davis) niche market operation financed by an FSA Microloan.\nThis post is part of a Microloan Success feature series on the USDA blog.  Check back every Tuesday and Thursday as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s Farm Service Agency.\nWhen Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack hosted a town hall meeting in San Antonio, Texas, in January , he shared information about USDA’s microloan program.  The program allows beginning, small and mid-sized farmers to access up to $35,000 in loans using a simplified application process.\nBeginning farmers Brittany Davis and Anthony Micheli were in the audience and they were listening.  The two were inspired to meet with their local Farm Service Agency (FSA) representatives to apply for a microloan.\nDavis and Micheli own a vegetable, egg and honey operation in Hays County, Texas, where they grow seasonal vegetables that are sold at several farmers' markets throughout the area. They also run a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program. CSA programs allow consumers to purchase a share from the farmer and in return, the consumer receives fresh vegetables each week. The couple currently has 60 CSA members. They stopped accepting new members temporarily, so they could expand and improve their operation. They plan to resume the CSA program this spring when they are fully operational.\nDavis and Micheli grew their operation this year by adding 2.5 acres. FSA approved them for a Microloan that they used to make several improvements to the property.\nThe Microloan helped them do many things: bring an old well back into working condition; add a bigger storage tank and run pipe for irrigation from the well to the field; and it enabled them to add a cold storage room, high-fence the property and purchase a tractor and equipment.\n\"We worked with the ladies in the Guadalupe County FSA office to secure our Microloan and they were just awesome,\" said Micheli. \"You can tell that the employees work for us. It's a government program where the people really care and try to get you set up quickly.\"\nDavis and Micheli are already talking about paying off this Microloan and applying for another Microloan to build a barn.\n\"This loan program gives hard working people the opportunity to move their business forward several huge leaps to become more successful,\" said Micheli. \"Without the equipment and improvements we made with the Microloan funds, it would have taken us 10 to 15 years to get where we are now.\"\nTexas led the country with the highest number of microloans, 268 totaling $5,377,100. To date, USDA has issued more than 4,900 microloans totaling $97 million.   Visit the FSA website to learn more about our farm loan programs.\nAnthony Micheli and Brittany Davis operate a farmers’ market stand in Texas, selling vegetables grown with the aid of an FSA Microloan.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n Beginning Farmers\n Farmers Markets\n FSA\n KYF2\n microloan success\n microloans\n small farmers\n Texas\n Tom Vilsack",

In just one week, the FSDZ hosted a Food Safety Education Camp on Gallaudet University’s campus for students from Kendall Demonstration Elementary School and Maryland School for the Deaf, followed by an exhibit at the Marine Corps Marathon Health and Fitness Expo by GE, where over 100,000 health-conscious participants were ready to learn illness prevention measures.\nThe goal of the USDA Food Safety Education Camp is to reach out to young children about food safety, and the trip to Gallaudet University proved to be a success. This camp was especially meaningful and worthwhile for the FSDZ staff, and more than 70 students, teachers, and parents learned the importance of food safety through storytelling, the Food Safety Soccer Game, and the Food Safety Wheel Game. The students, familiar with nutritious lunches, were intrigued by the additional importance of using a cold pack or thermos to keep food at a safe temperature. The Food Safety and Inspection Service continues to reach out to deaf and hearing impaired consumers with its SignFSIS food safety videos in American Sign Language, which can be accessed here.\nJust a few days later, the FSDZ was one of the biggest attractions at the Marine Corps Marathon Health and Fitness Expo. With its prime location near the main entrance, the mobile was the first stop for thousands of runners and volunteers supporting the Marine Corps. After taking a brief tour with her family, one avid runner exclaimed, “I’m glad I took my family in there, I’ve never seen anything like this. I’m going to tell some of my friends to visit because it’s good information.”\nIf you haven’t seen the USDA Food Safety Discovery Zone and its staff in action, the final event for the tour will be at the National Science Teachers Association Baltimore Area Conference, to be held at the Baltimore Convention Center on November 11-13, . On Thursday, November 11, the event will be from 11:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. On Friday, November 12, the hours will be from 9:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m. The event will conclude on Saturday, November 13, from 9:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m. We hope to see you there!\nElementary students learn to Clean, Separate, Cook, and Chill by playing the Food Safety Soccer Game at the Food Safety Education Camp, held on Gallaudet University’s campus on October 27.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n Tags:\n DC.\n Food Safety Discovery Zone\n FSIS\n Washington",

Agriculture in the United States is a mixing bowl of diversity, and it’s most evident when comparing large- and small-scale farming operations. Having grown up on a small, family farm in Iowa, I saw first-hand not only how important our small farmers and ranchers are to the nation, but also the challenges they face daily.\nThere is much variation among small family farms and ranches. No one definition comes close to capturing the richness and diversity of these operations. For example, while many farmers and ranchers are loyal to their traditional production systems, others constantly seek new opportunities and experiment with alternative crops, production methods and innovative marketing approaches. As a result, the United States produces a striking range of food and fiber, from soybeans to sesame, from beef to buffalo.\nYet, with all this variation, there are common challenges they face that many large farms don’t, such as access to capital, acquiring land, opening doors to new markets, learning to manage risk and finding training and mentoring services.\nUSDA works every day for producers of all sizes. This week, the department announced additional support and resources for America's small and midsized farmers and ranchers, including an investment in grants from USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to support research, education and Extension work at universities across the nation. This announcement is part of USDA’s continued support for America’s small and midsized producers.\nThe work being undertaken at these 10 universities will develop programs to assist small and medium-sized farmers grow their operations, enhance their production and become economically viable. The grants are part of NIFA’s Agriculture and Food Research Initiative and focuses on developing models to assist small farmers in their decision making respect to management strategies, new technologies, sustainability, competitiveness and viability.\nA few examples from this year’s funding include a project at the University of Illinois to research risk mitigation strategies for producers in the advanced biofuel industry, while Oklahoma State University is researching economic development opportunities in the local and regional food systems. The University of Vermont is studying how to improve the quality of labor management decisions for small and medium-sized farm operators. A full list of awardees is available on the NIFA website.\nSmall farmers and ranchers account for nearly 90 percent of all farms in the country. They are helping the United States produce the most affordable, abundant, safe, and healthy food supply in the world. With an impact that huge, we need to ensure that they have access to the resources they need to thrive.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Agriculture and Food Research Initiative\n Farmers\n Illinois\n Iowa\n NIFA\n Oklahoma State University\n Producers\n Ranchers\n small farmers\n University of Vermont",

The highest was for fresh raspberries, at $2.06 per edible cup equivalent. Mid-range prices included 64 cents for fresh peaches and $1.14 for canned apricots.\nAmong the 94 fresh and processed vegetables, the lowest average price was for dry pinto beans, at 13 cents per edible cup equivalent. The highest was for frozen asparagus cuts and tips, at $1.07. Mid-range prices included 62 cents for frozen broccoli and 52 cents for fresh-cut spinach.\nInterestingly, processed fruits and vegetables were not consistently more or less expensive than their fresh counterparts.

This is a substantial goal, but one that the United States, with the help of American agriculture, can meet or beat. However, I believe to achieve this goal we will need to expand our focus on drop-in or third generation fuels. These are biofuels that can directly substitute for gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel. \nToday more than 9 billion gallons of biofuels are produced annually by first-generation biofuel technologies that turn corn grain starch into ethanol, an increase from 1% of the U.S. fuel supply in to 7% in .\nHowever, Congress in the Energy Independence and Security Act of (EISA) stipulated that only 15 billion gallons of the 36 billion can be provided by ethanol produced from grain, or what is called first-generation biofuel. This means that 21 billion gallons of biofuels will need to come from sources other than corn grain. Second-generation biofuel technologies that turn crop residue such as corn stover or dedicated energy crops such as switchgrass into ethanol, and third-generation biofuel technologies that turn these feedstocks into advanced biofuels – synthetic substitutes for gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel – will have to come rapidly into commercial use. \nIf we are to reach our target of 36 billion gallons of biofuels by , we will need to change the way we do business. The U.S. has funded thousands of worthy projects, but there has been little effective integration of these efforts across government agencies, and also there has not been a focus on partnering with public and private resources to rapidly develop biofuel supply chains capable for achieving our nation’s biofuels goals.  Significant parts of the supply chain have been ignored or have received too little attention such as sustainable feedstock production systems, solutions to lower the cost of biomass transport, and efforts to leverage America’s existing fuel distribution and utilization systems.\n For example, the amounts of biomass and other dedicated energy crops that are needed to produce second- and third-generation biofuels basically requires creation of an entirely new agricultural commodity sector. There are many economic and environmental uncertainties to be expected as this sector emerges.   We intend to focus on feedstock development for a range of second- and third-generation bioenergy crops.  We will continue to work in corn – where our Agricultural Research Service scientists have made important recent discoveries in genomics.  And we will build a robust research portfolio in perennial grasses (like switchgrass and miscanthus), energy cane, sorghum, and other potential dedicated feedstocks.  To ensure continued genetic improvement of bioenergy crops, NIFA and DOE Office of Science have partnered to fund six projects totaling $6.3 million for fundamental science to accelerate plant breeding programs by characterizing the genes, proteins, and molecular interactions that influence biomass production.\nUnder Secretary Tonsager and his team have taken a leadership role in helping to ensure that people throughout rural America can contribute to building this new capability to produce and deliver biofuels to the market.  Without their work in commercializing biofuels and developing markets to realize rural wealth, our research on biofeedstock development and cultivation won’t ensure the energy security biofuels can bring.  Promising developments in the laboratory or inventions by a farmer or an aspiring entrepreneur will simply never see the light of day. Innovation and our ability to meet the food, fuel and fiber needs of the country will come from all sorts of places and we need to incubate those technology breakthroughs as well. \nWe need this now more than ever, so that we can unleash the creativity and skills of people in government, in college laboratories, in the garages of aspiring entrepreneurs, and in the R&D facilities of the private sector. \n - Raj Shah, Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics\n Category/Topic:\n Energy\n Tags:\n ARS\n Biofuel\n Biotechnology\n DOE\n EISA\n NIFA\n Rural",

This history dates back to the completion of the Erie Canal in the early s, which linked the Great Lakes to the Atlantic seaboard, significantly increasing the export of food, particularly Midwestern wheat, to England.\nTo this day, the United Kingdom offers tremendous opportunities for U.S. agriculture and the United States exports more than $1.6 billion annually in agricultural, fish and forestry products to the UK. Many of these products are showcased each year during USDA-endorsed trade shows, such as the International Food Exhibition (IFE), which took place in London in March.\nNineteen U.S. companies participated in the U.S. Pavilion, including 11 new-to-market and new-to-export companies. Several U.S. companies were lucky enough to meet with the Olympic Organizing Committee that had a team looking for products to be used at the Summer Olympics in London in . The exhibition produced $469,000 in on-site sales and $1.9 million in projected 12-month sales.\nRobin Rhea, owner of Slather Brand Foods, Inc., is pictured here during the International Food Exhibition (IFE) in London.\nDuring the show, U.S. exhibitors introduced more than 100 new products, ranging from sauces to baby food to ice cream. Delicious sauces are the name of the game for Slather Brand Foods Inc., a new-to-export company who explored export opportunities as part of the U.S. pavilion.\nRobin Rhea is the owner of Slather Brand Foods, Inc., based in Charleston, South Carolina. As a Southern U.S. Trade Association (SUSTA) member, she learned about the assistance USDA’s market development programs provide to companies like hers. Ms. Rhea used Market Access Program (MAP) funding in order to participate in this year’s show in London, a first for her company. She credits her attendance at the show with helping her connect with potential exporters and assess the opportunity to sell her product outside of the United States.\n“The UK market is definitely ready for Slather Brand Slatherin' Sauce,” said Ms. Rhea. “There is very little competition to speak of in the sauce category.  Moreover, the UK is just coming into its own in terms of BBQ and they are hungry for diversified products. In addition to retail markets there was an overwhelming interest in the food service industry and it will top our targeted list when we are ready to export.”\nThe company plans to continue to expand its domestic reach in the coming year and explore exports as part of its business plan in .

The CCRC is an online, nationally-relevant resource that connects land managers and decision-makers with useable science to address climate change in planning and application.  The CCRC plays a key role in the USDA Climate Hubs’ effort to help land managers (the Forest Service, other agencies, and the general public) understand and respond to a changing climate.\nClear, engaging, and scientifically accurate climate education is an important part of the process for incorporating climate change into natural resource management.  Natural resource managers are already witnessing changes in their forests and rangelands that are associated with the changing climate.  These include increased droughts, more widespread insect outbreaks, longer fire seasons, and earlier starts to growing seasons.  In order to foster and maintain healthy forests and rangelands into the future, land managers need to understand how climate change is affecting forest ecosystems right now and what they can expect in the future.  Unlike traditional farming, the forests we establish now are a long-term investment and must be able to survive and thrive many decades into the future.  This requires that forest managers have an understanding of the stresses that lie ahead for the landscapes they manage.\nThe module, “Climate Change Effects on Forests and Grasslands: What You Need to Know”, gives a brief overview of the effects of climate change on water resources, vegetation growth, wildlife, and disturbances.  The first education module, “Climate Change Science and Modeling”, provides a basic climate change foundation, and this new module builds on that foundation by examining climate change effects around the country.  Both modules were developed to educate land managers and the general public about the causes and impacts of a changing climate on landscapes across the country.

The ways they accomplish this include: smoke monitoring; providing input in developing and maintaining state smoke management programs; providing input and analysis to projects with activities that could affect air quality; air quality monitoring; and ensuring that forest management plans include activities to meet national standards set by the Clean Air Act.\nAnd, we are seeing results.\nIn the midst of news about worsening environmental degradation due to climate change, air quality in the Eastern and Southern regions is improving. compiled by the Air Program from to shows that rain became less acidic, wilderness views became clearer, and tropospheric ozone levels dropped on our national forests. That means residents from Minnesota to Missouri to New Hampshire in the East, and from Virginia to Florida to Puerto Rico in the South are breathing easier and enjoying more scenic views.\nThese findings are attributed to decades of work by the Forest Service and partners from state and federal air regulatory agencies.\nIt’s hoped that additional positive findings will stem from this, such as improvements in soil productivity and health of aquatic organisms. Environmental scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have already collected showing improvements in acid neutralizing capacity in some Adirondack and Catskill streams and lakes, a key environmental indicator of aquatic health. We expect similar findings will soon be discovered in streams in the Eastern Region.\nWe can all celebrate by looking for opportunities to contribute to clean air in our communities.

Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture.\nOklahoma consistently ranks in the top five states for beef cattle and winter wheat, but our agriculture is much more than just rolling fields of wheat and cattle. With more than 80,000 farms counted in the Census of Agriculture, Oklahoma remains in 4th position in the number of farms in the nation. The bulk of our farms are less than 500 acres in size, but contributed $2.2 billion dollars to the market value of agriculture products sold (including government payments).\nThe average age of farmers nationally and in Oklahoma is now 58.3 years, increasing in both since the last census. Here in Oklahoma however, this increase is happening at a significantly slower rate than the U.S. average.\nThough wheat and cattle production continue to rank and as Oklahoma’s top commodity by value of production in year-over-year terms, we are also known for our hog production with 2.3 million hogs counted in the Census of Agriculture.\nOn the demographic side, we ranked second in the country for the number of American Indian principal farm operators second only to Arizona. These operators own more than 1 million acres of Oklahoma farmland, and rent an additional 750,000 acres of the state’s 34 million acres of farmland.\nOther top rankings for Oklahoma according to the census include:\nFifth in the nation for the number of farms producing and selling value-added commodities, with 3,815 farms.\nThird in the nation for the number of farms that raised or sold veal calves with 889 farms.\nFifth in the nation for the number of farms practicing rotational or management-intensive grazing, with 11,477 farms.\nWhile Oklahoma might be better known for its oil and gas, 609 farms harvested biomass crops for use in renewable energy, the fifth highest number in the nation.\nOur farmers also boast having the second largest inventory of on-farm horses and ponies in the nation. The only larger inventory is in our neighbor state, Texas.\nAs you can see, while Oklahoma is rightly known for its cattle and wheat, our agriculture is so much more than that.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) remains focused on carrying out its mission, despite a time of significant budget uncertainty. Today's announcement is one part of the Department's efforts to strengthen the rural economy.\"This support will benefit rural businesses and the communities where the recipients are located,\" Vilsack said. \"These awards also will advance USDA's goals to develop a bio-based economy and support local and regional food systems.\"In today's announcement, 110 awardees are being selected for USDA Rural Development Value-Added Producer Grants (VAPG). The grants help agricultural producers increase their income by expanding marketing opportunities, creating new products or developing new uses for existing products.The awards announced today include 11 projects involving bio-based products. They include grants to convert: corn stover to anhydrous ammonia; miscanthus fiber, wood and goat manure into biochar and enhanced compost; and sorghum to electricity and fertilizer.A number of Native American applicants will also receive support for their projects. For example, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe Farm & Ranch Enterprise of Colorado will receive over $92,000 to bring a cornmeal product to market. This grant will help the Tribe market and distribute the Indian cornmeal products, and secure customers. This year marks the first time that tribal entities have received funding through the VAPG program.Glenmary Gardens in Bristol, Va., will use a $213,000 grant to expand the processing and marketing of locally grown fruits and vegetables into jellies, ice cream, and flavored syrups. Glenmary Gardens is a family-owned operation providing freshly grown berries, fruits and vegetables to the Virginia and Tennessee Tri-City area. Old Wood LLC in Las Vegas, N.M., will use a $300,000 working capital award to expand sales of its unique, engineered-panel and wood-block flooring made from small-diameter trees.Value-Added Producer Grants are an important element of USDA's Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative, which coordinates USDA's work to support local and regional food systems. Previous VAPG awards supporting local and regional projects are mapped on the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food compass, Rural Development is funding an array of projects involving locally produced and marketed foods. These include cheese, wine, reduced-cholesterol dairy products, produce, packaged poultry, pork and beef products, and a variety of processed or prepared foods from locally grown fruits and vegetables.Wisconsin Food Hub Cooperative in Madison, Wis., will use a $150,000 working capital award to assist in the startup of a regional fresh produce food hub and packinghouse that was created to enhance access to wholesale markets for the local farm economy and create private-sectors jobs. The food hub will aggregate local produce sold under the Wisconsin Farmed brand.Since the start of the Obama Administration, the VAPG program has helped more than 600 agricultural producers and rural businesses.Through the Farm Bill, Congress made several enhancements to the VAPG program. It expanded the definition of value-added to include locally-produced agricultural food products, and it gave priority to projects that focus on increasing opportunities for small and mid-size family farmers and ranchers, beginning farmers and ranchers, and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers.For a complete list of Value-Added Producer Grant award recipients selected today, click here. Funding for each project is contingent upon the recipient meeting the terms of the grant agreement.President Obama's plan for rural America has brought about historic investment and resulted in stronger rural communities. Under the President's leadership, these investments in housing, community facilities, businesses and infrastructure have empowered rural America to continue leading the way – strengthening America's economy, small towns and rural communities. USDA's investments in rural communities support the rural way of life that stands as the backbone of our American values. President Obama and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack are committed to a smarter use of Federal resources to foster sustainable economic prosperity and ensure the government is a strong partner for businesses, entrepreneurs and working families in rural communities.USDA, through its Rural Development mission area, has a portfolio of programs designed to improve the economic stability of rural communities, businesses, residents, farmers and ranchers and improve the quality of life in rural America.USDA has made a concerted effort to deliver results for the American people, even as USDA implements sequestration – the across-the-board budget reductions mandated under terms of the Budget Control Act. USDA has already undertaken historic efforts since to save more than $828 million in taxpayer funds through targeted, common-sense budget reductions. These reductions have put USDA in a better position to carry out its mission, while implementing sequester budget reductions in a fair manner that causes as little disruption as possible. is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

The Technical Advisory Committee, or “TAC” for short, is composed of scientists and commercial industry experts from around the United States as an independent body that provides input to agencies regarding the technical focus and direction of the Biomass Research and Development Initiative.\n“I think for U.S. Agriculture and for rural America, we have to continue to add dimensions to our agricultural sector, and so we are looking for the ways that are being learned in the Pacific Northwest agricultural production, practices and products and what might really work well for creating green energy and green products here,” Tonsager said, adding that the TAC came to see what is being done in the Pacific Northwest related to bio-fuels and bio mass production. “This is an exploration we are talking to the people in this region, experts in this region trying to understand the various commodities produced here and what might economically work best.”\nInterest in the potential of bio-fuels production in the Pacific Northwest continues to grow as commercial production continues to become more economically viable. In , Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the award of grants to the University of Washington (UW) and Washington State University (WSU) to research the development of a renewable energy market in bio-fuels in the Pacific Northwest that could result in generating rural jobs while decreasing America’s dependence on foreign oil.\nUW received $40 million to focus on using sustainably grown woody energy crops to produce bio-gasoline and renewable aviation fuel; while WSU received $40 million to focus on feedstock development, sustainable forest production and establishing new methods to identify the most promising plant lines for bio-fuel conversion.\nAnd earlier this year, ZeaChem, Inc. received a $235 million loan guarantee from USDA to finance construction of a biofuel refinery in Boardman, Oregon, near the Washington border, that is expected to produce up to 25 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol annually.\nUnder Secretary for Rural Development, Dallas Tonsager recently visited the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash., with other members of a technical advisory committee exploring ways to further the use and development of advanced bio-fuels.

Not only was I a USDA National Scholar, but I also served as the “queen” of my university all while maintaining a 3.5 cumulative grade point average.\nThough I never envisioned myself at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, my undergraduate experience has taught me that it doesn’t matter where you attend school. What matters is how hard you work, getting an education and taking advantage of opportunities.

At times the challenges and risks facing farmers, especially those just starting out, can seem difficult and daunting.

The Affordable Care Act allowed her to remain on her parent’s health insurance through the age of 25. But after she turned 26, she had to take a job in town that came with health benefits.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nIf you want to find a fungus that controls disease-spreading insects, you might want to go somewhere known for its biodiversity. So it makes sense that USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) microbiologist Richard Humber will be traveling to Brazil over the next three years to join Brazilian scientists in searching for fungi to control black flies, sand flies and the types of mosquitoes that spread malaria, dengue and yellow fever.\nFungi are now used to control insects on crops. Beauveria bassiana, a fungus found in soils throughout the world, is widely sold for controlling thrips, whiteflies, aphids and beetles. Different types of fungi are also sometimes used to control mosquitoes, but they are not easy to handle or to apply, and their effectiveness has been questioned.\nBrazil is considered a leader in using fungi and other microbial agents as biocontrols, and Humber’s search is being funded by a Brazilian government program known as “Science Without Borders.”\nHumber is a natural fit for the project. He is curator of the ARS Collection of Entomopathogenic Fungal Cultures in Ithaca, N.Y., and has spent years helping Brazilian scientists maintain and upgrade the quality of their collection at the Institute of Tropical Pathology and Public Health at the Federal University of Goiás, in the city of Goiânia.\nIn its collection, ARS maintains more than 12,500 fungal cultures from all over the world. The isolates are stored in sealed vials inside tanks containing liquid nitrogen that keep the fungi preserved at a rather chilly temperature of minus 317 degrees Fahrenheit.\nAs part of the project, Humber and his Brazilian colleagues will make three trips into a savannah-like tropical region of Brazil known as the “Cerrado.” The area, made up of low lying forests and grasslands, is an ecosystem being threatened by encroaching farms and urban development. The scientists are not sure what they will find or how many isolates they will bring back, but what they collect will be kept in both the Brazilian and ARS collections. The fungi collected will infect only insects, and pose no risk to human health.\nThe fungus Beauveria bassiana infecting a weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus, from Colombia.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n ARS\n Brazil\n fungus\n New York\n Science Tuesday\n South America",

(National Park Service/ Greg Fauth)\nLee Roeser was born to be a mule packer.  At a very early age, he learned the craft from his parents who ran a mule pack station in Mammoth Lakes, California. At age 6, he was already helping with the family business. By age 13, he began working as a packer; and at 16, he was hauling explosives, gear and tools for the public, the Forest Service and other government agencies, and mining and movie production companies.\n“You must be passionate for the well-being of the animals,” said Roeser, a packer for the U.S. Forest Service on Inyo National Forest, home of one of the Pack Stock Centers of Excellence.  “I do it for that and my love of the mountains and opportunity to continue to learn.”\nThe U. S. Forest Service has a long tradition of using pack stock to bring supplies to remote locations to support fire and trail crews. Currently, there are 11 packers and four packer trainees who service the Pacific Southwest Region. Pack-supported rangers and resource crews are also a common sight in wilderness areas, which do not allow mechanized transport of supplies and equipment.  A 12-year Forest Service employee, Roeser embodies the most important qualities of a pack stocker: care for the animals, customer service and knowledge-making adjustments on the job.\nMule packer Lee Roeser leads a pack to Shadow Lake on the Inyo National Forest. (Courtesy Jen Roeser)\n“He grew up in an environment where there was a very high standard of packing for 50 years,” said Michael Morse, wilderness supervisor for the Mammoth District of the Inyo National Forest, co-director of the Pack Stock Center of Excellence, and a fellow packer.  “His highest priority is always the safety of the animal and the packer.  We consider Lee to be the best of the best and it shows in his work.”\nTwo years ago, Roeser faced an exceptional challenge:  to haul heavy boxes, shovels and other equipment up a trail on the 12,500-foot Mt. Whitney in the Inyo National Forest for a trail reconstruction project. There were safety hazards along the trail and the project was going to take several months requiring more than 300 mule loads.  Despite all the challenges, Roeser and his team didn’t have a single injury or accident.  Roeser employed the strategy of using a ranger in front and back to look for the public to keep everyone safe. “It was flawless,” praised Morse.\n“What makes me tick is always looking to make packing better for the animals and myself,” said Roeser.  “I want the equipment to be more in harmony with the mules.  You can’t be a packer for the salary.  You have to have a love for working with mules in the mountains.”\nMule packer Lee Roeser leads a pack up Mt.

As a result, the state’s overextended water system is in crisis. All segments of California’s economy— one of the largest in the world—are experiencing the effects of this drought. The economic, social and environmental impacts on agriculture, industry, jobs, communities’ drinking water and the ecosystem will reverberate across the country, and that is why actions need to be taken to address the situation not just in the short term, but also to sustain the state over the long run.\nFollowing two years of dry conditions, on January 17, California Governor Jerry Brown proclaimed a State of Emergency for drought. Subsequently, the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce have committed to helping California prepare for and lessen drought impacts. In addition, as called for in President Obama’s Climate Action Plan, the National Drought Resilience Partnership, which includes the Department of the Interior, Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Energy, will help align federal resources and policies to better support response to drought impacts and build long term sustainability and resilience in California’s water system.\n Commissioner, Bureau of Reclamation \nWilliam W.

WWN provides resources to women to help them effectively care for and enhance their private forestland.\nMinnesota Women’s Woodland Network members visited Camp Vermillion on May 16 for a “Walk in the Woods.” \nOn a recent evening, WWN hosted a “Walk in the Woods” at Camp Vermilion in Cook, Minn. The 268-acre summer camp, owned by Voyageurs Lutheran Ministry, served as a model property for the foresters who attended the event.\nThe ministry has worked with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) since , when Camp Vermilion lost several trees to a wind storm. Over the years, NRCS has helped the group develop a forest stewardship plan to best manage the forest and its resources.\nThe plan calls for the selective harvesting of trees, planting of new trees, protecting new plantings from deer and establishing firewise practices near cabins and other structures.\nThe 19 WWN members who attended the walk were able to examine all of these improvements and discuss the implications, learning some best practices for their own lands.\nThe Walk in the Woods was hosted by Julie Miedkte, University of Minnesota Extension Forester, and Marge Sella, NRCS District Conservationist.\nWWN has over 300 members after just two years in existence.

Elizabeth is the granddaughter of the original homesteader and the first in her family to seek NRCS conservation assistance.\nNRCS oversaw the installation of riparian fencing to on the ranch to protect a creek on the property—a tributary of Stemple Creek—from over-grazing and erosion, improving water quality. We also partnered with a local conservation organization to plant native vegetation for improved wildlife habitat, hiring local contractors to do the work.\nWith the $200,emple Creek Watershed improvement, NRCS completed similar work on two other farms, a conventional chicken farm and a small family-run dairy.\nThe Recovery Act, was created by the Obama Administration to boost the economy, in part by developing and improving the Nation’s infrastructure. The Stemple Creek work (on these three properties, but also many others) is part of a continuum of proactive partnership and voluntary conservation that developed after the EPA declared the watershed impaired under Section 303d of the Clean Water Act in due to high sediment loads. The creek flows to California’s northern coast, where it empties into the Gulf of Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. The sanctuary provides habitat for threatened species such as the California freshwater shrimp.\nThe Recovery Act funds granted to these three projects has contributed to the tremendous conservation improvements in the Stemple Creek Watershed over the past 20 years, which have resulted in dozens of miles of restored stream banks and almost every dairy in the watershed completing water quality improvements.

(Photo by Kim Lanahan-Lahti, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Division of Forestry)\nFor years now, the U.S. Forest Service has been encouraging visitors to our nation’s forests and grasslands, to not only enjoy all there is out there, but to play safe and play clean.\nOne example of this outreach effort is the PlayCleanGo: Stop Invasive Species In Your Tracks campaign.\nPlayCleanGo has 130 partners, all fostering active participation in actions designed to interrupt recreational pathways of spread for invasive species. By becoming a partner, you can spread the message to stop invasive species in your tracks.\n“PlayCleanGo is designed to give outdoor recreationists a clear call to action to be informed and attentive in helping stop the spread of invasive plants and insects and improving overall forest health,” said Monica Lear, U.S. Forest Service Forest Health Protection Director. “These pests can expand like a different kind of wildfire, from forest to forest by unsuspecting visitors just looking for some fun and adventure.”\nFrom camping to fishing to hiking, getting outside and into nature is one of the many activities that our forests support. Outdoor recreation provides physical challenges, contributes greatly to the physical and mental health of individuals, provides economic benefits to communities, and has become an essential part of American culture. PlayCleanGo is helping these recreationists preserve the land they already love and enjoy.\nThrough positive messaging, the program provides simple steps people can take to avoid accidently spreading invasive species. \nThis advice includes letting visitors know to stay on designated trails, remove mud and seeds from shoes and gear, and burn only local or certified firewood. For example, garlic mustard, an aggressive plant invader of wooded areas throughout the Northeastern and Midwestern US, can form dense stands and displace native species by competing for available light, nutrients and water resources. Garlic mustard seeds stick together when damp and adhere readily to small soil clusters, making it easy for them to stick to muddy boots, pant cuffs, and animal fur. Through easy actions like inspecting hiking equipment, clothing, and pets before going out on a hiking trail and conducting the same inspection upon leaving the trail, the PlayCleanGo campaign is helping slow the spread of invasive species.\nPlayCleanGo was launched by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, in partnership with the University of Minnesota Extension, Minnesota departments of Agriculture and Transportation, and Explore Minnesota.\nCreating a new and successful awareness campaign, like Smokey Bear and his fire prevention message, depends on broad, frequent exposure to the public. For this reason, PlayCleanGo invites public and private organizations to join the effort by becoming a partner.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Forestry\n FS\n invasive species\n Minnesota\n PlayCleanGo\n Smokey Bear\n University of Minnesota",

The successful hunting trip cemented lasting relationships between the men and established an area in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, which is still known today as Camp Monaco.\nThe centennial celebration began with a morning horseback trail ride following a route very similar to one Prince Albert I took a century ago. A local outfitter and fly-fishing guide, Lee Livingston Outfitting Inc., guided Prince Albert II and his party through the changing leaves of the forest where they were greeted with splendid mountain views and a few grizzly bear sightings.\nThe trail ride was followed by a luncheon at the Pahaska Tepee, Buffalo Bill Cody’s original hunting lodge on the Shoshone National Forest. While enjoying the splendor of the historic lodge, guests were treated to the history of the original hunting trip, as well as stories about Prince Albert I and Buffalo Bill Cody.\nShoshone Forest Supervisor Joe Alexander (left) and Prince Albert II of Monaco stand by the plaque commemorating Prince Albert I’s original trip and the centennial celebration ride.

The plaque commemorates the original trip in , as well as the centennial celebration ride. It also recognizes the establishment of the Camp Monaco Prize, which is dedicated to the scientific exploration and public education to safeguard the biodiversity in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The plaque will be placed at the wilderness boundary at a later date.\nShoshone National Forest Supervisor Joseph Alexander and Wapiti District Ranger Susan Stresser had the opportunity to meet with Prince Albert II following the unveiling, further fostering the positive association between Monaco and the Forest Service that began a century ago.\nPrince Albert II of Monaco rides through the river on a guided tour by Forest Service employees and Lee Livington Outfitting, Inc.

        "content": "Natural Resources Conservation Service, Oregon in\n Conservation\n Feb 20, \nTim Fisher, a landowner in Baker County, Oregon, recently completed forest stand improvements on 232 acres of his land in partnership with the Natural Resources Conservation Service.\nLike many woodland owners in eastern Oregon, Tim Fisher enjoys and appreciates the value wildlife brings to his 1,500-plus acres in Baker County.\n“I love watching the elk up here,” he said as he drove his pickup truck up a steep dirt road on his property, a mountainous view surrounding him. “I come up here to watch them at sunrise, and it’s beautiful.”\nThanks to technical and financial assistance from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and help from other agencies, Fisher is doing work on his land to make wildlife habitat even better — while also reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire.\nLast year, contractors completed slash treatment on 232 acres of his land, opening up the canopy and putting much-needed space in between the trees. More work will continue this spring and summer.\n“Just by opening the canopy of the trees, you bring tremendous benefits to the land,” Fisher said. “It reduces the risk for wildfire, it helps with soil erosion, the wildlife habitat stays intact, the trees grow taller and stronger, and the wood can become marketable timber.”\nFisher worked with local NRCS staff, the Oregon Department of Forestry and his contractor to identify tree stands for slashing that would yield the most effective results. Before contractors began work, the targeted area averaged 1,000 trees per acre. Afterward, the result was 150 to 250 trees per acre, with an average of 17 feet of spacing in between trees.\nA view of Tim Fisher’s woodlands before contractors completed timber thinning.\nContractors used a technique called slashbusting, which is almost what it sounds like --- a large excavator essentially “shreds” trees, leaving a scattered pile of nutrient-rich pieces behind. Those pieces decompose over time and return nutrients to the soil, which improves fertilization and reduces piling (think large piles of tree branches) compared to traditional hand-pile slashing.\n“The elk and deer love this area now that it’s open,” Fisher said.\nBut habitat improvement isn’t the only benefit of slash treatment. The primary benefit is reducing the threat of catastrophic wildfire.\n“Dense, overstocked forests pose a higher risk for catastrophic wildfire because the excess vegetation creates a fuel ladder, allowing fire to rise higher into the canopy where it causes the most damage,” said Parker Ussery, NRCS district conservationist. “By thinning timber stands, wildfire has less fuel to spread and we improve the overall resiliency of the forest.”\nProjects like the one on Fisher’s land are part of the East Face of the Elkhorn Mountains project — a $2.6 million endeavor funded by NRCS and the U.S. Forest Service through the Chiefs’ Joint Landscape Restoration Partnership.\nThe East Face partnership combines the skills and expertise of the NRCS, ODF, the Forest Service, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Bureau of Land Management.  Together, these partners identified more than 47,000 acres in Oregon’s Wallowa-Whitman National Forest and BLM lands to target for fuels reduction and forest stand improvements, as well as adjacent private lands.\nThis project is a good example of Chiefs’ Joint Landscape Restoration Partnership at work and one of 13 funded in fiscal . This week, NRCS and Forest Service announced their plans to invest $10 million in 15 new projects, which are leveraging an additional $5 million from partners.\nForest stand improvements on Tim Fisher’s land has opened the canopy, bringing multiple benefits to the land—reduced risk for wildfire, less soil erosion, improved soil health, and improved tree growth and wood quality.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Bureau of Land Management\n Conservation\n Forestry\n FS\n NRCS\n Oregon\n Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife\n Wallowa-Whitman National Forest\n Wildfire",

Terri Williams of the Fresno Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Service released the Western Screech-Owls on July 24 near where they were found over a month ago in a downed tree in the Sierra National Forest.\nThe birds were weak and dehydrated when Williams first received them from the Forest Service on June 20.  But under her care, Puff and Fluff tripled in weight, enjoying a steady diet of mice, day-old chicks and crickets. They grew strong and healthy and soon began showing signs that they were ready for release into the wild. According to Williams, the owls were tearing their own food, eating a whole mouse in one gulp, catching crickets, flying easily, finding hiding places in their enclosure during the day, and showing appropriate defensive actions towards humans, such as beak-clacking and hissing.\nAnother tell-tale sign that the owls had matured was their recent drop in weight. As babies, owls beef up quickly for rapid growth.  When it is time for fledging, they are often too heavy for easy flight – sometimes even heavier than an adult. According to Williams, they put on extra weight so they can survive the \"thin\" times when they are perfecting their hunting skills.  The drop in appetite and weight corresponds with the time they leave the nest site, and when food from their parents is less reliable.  The weight loss also helps them fly better.\n“For me, (the release back into the wild) is like a graduation and a return to freedom,” Williams said.  “There is nothing like watching a bird really fly free when it has been limited to an enclosed flight area.\n“When they have had a second chance at survival it is especially exciting,” she said.  “These two were initially cautious about leaving the carrier, but once they did they flew confidently and landed perfectly on a branch in the same beautiful coniferous forest they had come from.”\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n birds of prey\n California\n Forestry\n FS\n owls\n Sierra National Forest\n wildlife rescue",

She was on-site at both facilities, and helped corral some animals at the Dakota Zoo so they could be transported to other facilities.  However, she is quick to point out that the zoo staff at both facilities, with the assistance of several cooperating state and local agencies, state veterinarians, four neighboring zoos and the National Guard, had everything under control.\nFlood waters threaten the Roosevelt Park Zoo in Minot, ND\n“Things can always be improved, but I’m pretty pleased with how these zoos handled these situations,” said Jirsa-Smith.  “The Roosevelt Park Zoo got all its animals out in a 12-hour period and all but the bears were loaded without any chemical immobilization. That’s incredible.”\nThe Dakota Zoo and the Roosevelt Park Zoo had evacuation/contingency plans, and this was vital to ensuring the safety of these animals.  Both zoos fall under Animal Care’s regulation because they are covered under the Animal Welfare Act as animals that are exhibited to the public.  In , the Dakota Zoo created an evacuation plan based on flooding threats and the zoo implemented its plan successfully during this emergency.\nFor the last 18 months, the Animal Care Program has funded a cooperative project on emergency planning for zoos with Chicago’s Lincoln Park Zoo, on behalf of the Zoo Animal Health Network (ZAHN), Association of Zoos and Aquariums, and other stakeholders.  ZAHN provided an array of reference materials involving planning and recovery to the Dakota Zoo. Animal Care is currently finalizing a regulation that will amend the Animal Welfare Act to require all facilities regulated under the Act to develop contingency plans.\n“The fact that these two North Dakota zoos invested in planning is absolutely critical, and it made both evacuations so successful,” said Dr. Chester Gipson, Animal Care’s deputy administrator.\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Tags:\n Amy Jirsa-Smith\n Animal Care\n Animal Welfare Act\n APHIS\n Chester Gipson\n flooding\n North Dakota",

New development will create more than 2,800 permanent jobs in the retail, hospitality, and office sectors.\nManufacturing presents a great opportunity for our country. Exports and trade are our strengths and that hasn’t gone away. But our challenge, as mentioned at the roundtable, will be to create a skilled workforce. We need to reinvest in community colleges and vocational schools. If the American Jobs Act was passed, North Carolina would receive $675,700,000 in funding to support school infrastructures and as many as 8,800 jobs.\nWe’re taking what we learned in Brevard back to Washington. This visit is one of many that will help USDA, EPA, HUD, and DOT find creative ways to support economically vibrant, environmentally healthy rural communities and regional planning efforts through the Partnership for Sustainable Communities. The USDA has Rural Development field offices and employees that can be a great resource to rural areas that are looking to find ways to create jobs and economic growth. EPA offers assistance through its brownfields and smart growth programs, with specific tools on EPA’s website. The Partnership has many resources that we’re eager to use to help communities across the country.\n Category/Topic:\n USDA Results\n Rural\n Tags:\n Bob Perciasepe\n DOT\n EPA\n HUD\n Kathleen Merrigan\n North Carolina\n Partnership for Sustainable Communities\n Rural Development\n White House Rural Council",

Ya sea en escuelas, centros comunitarios o en casas de todo el país, estos programas trabajan en conjunto como una red de seguridad nutritiva para asegurar que ningún americano que cualifique pase hambre.\nConsidero que la nutrición suplementar para mujeres, infantes y niños, mejor conocida como WIC (por sus siglas en inglés)  es un programa especial. Dicho programa provee alimentos suplementarios a los más vulnerables—infantes, embarazadas, mujeres lactando y luego del parto y a niños hasta la edad de 5 años que enfrentan un riesgo nutricional. WIC también provee referencias para atención médica y social, y para educación nutritiva, incluyendo la promoción y el soporte a la lactancia materna.\nUn nuevo reporte del USDA del programa y características de WIC (disponible en ingles) confirma el éxito de estos esfuerzos. Por ejemplo, al revisar la información recopilada se registró un aumento del 4 por ciento en dos años en la participación de madres del programa WIC que lactan sus niños con leche materna. De las agencias estatales que reportaron madres que lactaron a sus hijos en el , se reportó que 67 por ciento de los infantes entre los 6 y 13 meses estaban siendo amamantados o lo estuvieron durante un tiempo en comparación con un 63 por ciento registrado en un estudio anterior que se realizo en el . Es más, la lactancia materna entre participantes de WIC ha estado en continuo aumento desde , y este año por primera vez, el porcentaje de mamas lactantes fue mayor que el número de nuevas madres no lactantes. Los hallazgos son una buena noticia, ya que la lactancia materna es el método ideal de alimentación para infantes, ya que provee beneficios para la mama y el niño.\nLas ayudas del programa WIC están llegando a madres y niños de escasos recursos. Cerca de tres cuartas partes de los 9 millones de participantes en WIC que reportaron sus ingresos se encuentran por debajo de lo que se considera como pobreza, a comparación del 15 por ciento entre la población general de los Estados Unidos. La mayoría de los que reciben las ayudas de WIC tienen menos de 5 años y más de la mitad de los participantes eran menores de 3 años.\nEntre otras buenas noticias es importante señalar que la obesidad infantil ha disminuido entre los participantes de WIC(disponible en ingles). En el , el 15.3 por ciento de los niños en WIC de un año confrontaban problemas de obesidad comparado con los hallazgos registrados el 16.8 por ciento en el . De manera similar, en el se reportó que 14.7 por ciento de los niños entre las edades de 2 y 4 experimentaba obesidad mientras que en el la cantidad disminuyo a 14.0 por ciento. El centro para el control de enfermedades profundizo en el estudio usando datos del WIC de 43 estados y territorios de niños entre las edades de 2 y 4 años. Descubrieron que al revés de la tendencia anterior, en 19 de los estados/territorios hubo  reducciones significativas y que 21 de ellos no reportaron problemas de obesidad infantil, con solo 3 mostrando aumentos.\nWIC ayuda a trazar el futuro de nuestro país de una manera vital al proveer a madres e hijos la nutrición que necesitan para tener embarazos exitosos y en el caso de los niños, un crecimiento saludable. De hecho, investigaciones anteriores han demostrado que las ayudas que ofrece WIC ejercen un papel importante en embarazos ya que ayudan a evitar complicaciones como fiebre, embarazos prematuros o incluso las costosas tarifas de los cuidados de salud. Este es un programa que no solo está proporcionando nutrición a familias de bajos ingresos, pero también reduciendo la mortalidad infantil y en verdad creando una generación futura más saludable.\nA version of this blog, is available in English (La versión de este blog está disponible en ingles)\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Breastfeeding\n Childhood Obesity\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n HealthierNextGen\n Infants\n Infants and Children\n lactancia materna\n Nutrition\n USDA \n WIC",

Now image if bread, like wine, was valued for its “terroir” - the idea that the land where the ingredients come from impart a special flavor or essence to the final product. Well that may not be a far fetched idea if you try Borealis Breads up in Portland, Maine.\nDeputy Secretary Merrigan traveled to Portland Friday to announce $19 million in funding to grantees across the country that will address critical organic agriculture issues through the integration of research, education and extension projects. Ellen Mallory of the University of Maine was one such recipient, receiving over $1.3 million in research funding for the Northern New England Bread Wheat Project.  Ellen, in cooperation with University of Vermont and USDA's Agricultural Research Service, is helping local farmers produce high‐quality organic bread wheat for our region’s millers and bakers.\nMaine used to be known as the 'Bread Basket of New England' until the industry collapsed. But Ellen's research is looking to revive that title by putting organic wheat back into production by local farmers. But the story gets even better – the demand for the wheat has increased so much that a local granary, Aurora Mills, opened to process the wheat into flour. This resulted in new jobs and a 2nd granary is in the works, even more jobs based on local production.\nTaking the story one step further in the creation of a local/regional food system, Jim Amaral, proprietor of Borealis Breads is using the homegrown wheat in his breads.  Why? Well Jim lays it out pretty clearly: breads made with Maine grain are better in quality and taste. Jim goes on to explain it is more than just better bread, it is more jobs and more business local opportunities. With over 100,000 breads made last year, Borealis is now expanding operation and Jim is confident that “100 years from now, Mainers will be eating breads made from local grain.” If there is a better example of the 'Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food' initiative in action, we would like to see it.\nMaine Public Broadcasting Network covered the event; listen to the broadcast here\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n ARS\n Deputy Secretary\n Grant\n Kathleen Merrigan\n KYF2\n Maine\n Portland\n wheat",

Another part of the plan is the installation of a state-of-the-art piece of technology called an SBR, or Sequencing Batch Reactor.  This device works with bacteria in three different chambers to get rid of most phosphorous and nitrogen, down to almost drinking water quality.  “It’s a better quality than [the water] that most people get out of their wells,” said Jane Kreiter, Director of Water and Wastewater in Berlin.  The treated effluent is then pumped by pipeline to a spray irrigation site on Purnell Crossing Road in Libertytown, Maryland where it is used to water trees and crops.\nThe town has plans in the works for a second spray irrigation site in Newark which, when competed, would eliminate the need for dumping treated effluent into the coastal bays.  Many people are concerned about having the spray site in their backyards.  Kreiter is quick to point out that in Florida, people are already using treated wastewater to clean their cars and water their plants.  She says that the public is just not well informed on this, because we’ve never really had to conserve water like in Florida.  Kreiter adds that the sprayed effluent will have no negative effects on the groundwater table and aquifers.  The final decision about the new spray site will be made at a meeting of the Worcester County Commissioners some time in the near future.  If approved, the spray irrigation project is projected to cost an additional $6 million.\nKreiter says that they hope to have the upgrade and expansion project in Berlin completed by December, but adds that the recent bad weather has pushed them far behind where they should be.  When completed, this plant will be the largest wastewater treatment plant in Maryland that spray irrigates.\nTouring the Berlin, MD Wastewater Treatment Plant construction site are (l-r) Dr. Merle Marsh, Director of Special Projects, Worcester Preparatory School; Jane Kreiter, Director of Wastewater; student reporter Jamie Welch, Worcester Preparatory School; and James C.

Click to enlarge.\nUSDA is firmly committed to ensuring that all Americans have access to a safe, healthy, adequate and affordable diet. Unfortunately, our nation is facing an unprecedented nutrition crisis, with far too many Americans facing both food insecurity and obesity.  Although it seems paradoxical, the two actually go hand in hand far too often.  To reverse the course of this two-sided crisis, we must create a cultural change that facilitates and encourages healthy food choices among all Americans.\nOne example of how USDA has been working to implement this cultural shift is the Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP) project that was recently conducted in Massachusetts. The goal of this project was to provide SNAP participants greater access to healthy foods and better nutrition through financial incentives at the point of purchase.  Specifically, we tested the impact of providing families with 30 extra cents in SNAP benefits per benefit dollar that they spent on fruits and vegetables.  We were very encouraged by the results.  On average, people who received the incentives ate about 26 percent more fruits and vegetables per day than people who did not receive the incentives—a substantial increase!\nIncentives are also part of our ongoing effort to encourage SNAP clients to shop at local farmers markets. The USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) recently completed Nutrition Assistance in Farmers Markets: Understanding the Shopping Patterns of SNAP Participants.  This survey collected information from over 3,200 SNAP participants who shopped at farmers markets, as well about 1,500 who lived near markets, but opted not to purchase from them. Survey results showed that shoppers view incentives as very important.  In fact, participants who knew that particular markets offered incentives when using their SNAP benefit cards were 40 times more likely to shop at those markets!\nFarmers markets and nutrition incentive programs have quickly expanded in number over the past five years and they are playing a key role in improving access to healthy and affordable local food options among people who are at risk of food insecurity.  To encourage innovative uses of the incentives in a wide range of retail settings, Congress authorized the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive grant program in .  Information on this important grant opportunity is now available on the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture’s website; applications are due December 15, .\nWhile no single solution can solve the problems of food insecurity and obesity among Americans, USDA continues to explore creative strategies, including various incentive programs.  We are encouraged by the results thus far, and hopeful that such programs will play a role in building a healthier, food-secure America.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n diet quality\n Farmers Markets\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n HealthierNextGen\n Healthy Incentives Pilot\n Kevin Concannon\n Massachusetts\n NIFA\n Research\n SNAP",

Each time she returned home from college she noticed that more land was being tilled and islands of oak trees within the fields were disappearing.\nIn , Dunlap learned about a new Farm Bill program called the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and was excited about how the program could benefit their farms. Her parents agreed. After talking with their local USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) staff, they discovered that an entire farm could be eligible for the program.\nCRP is one of the largest private lands programs for conservation used extensively throughout the country to reduce soil erosion, improve water and air quality and provide wildlife habitat.\nToday, the original Dunlap farm fosters multiple CRP practices, including wetland restoration, timber, prairies, buffer strips, riparian buffers, grass waterways, shallow water areas, tall grass prairies and various wildlife habitat and food plots. Dunlap has dedicated more than 220 acres of her land in Pickaway and Ross counties to conservation.\nCRP is a voluntary program that allows eligible landowners to receive annual rental payments and cost-share assistance to establish long-term, resource-conserving covers on eligible farmland throughout the duration of their 10-to-15-year contracts.\n“CRP is a blessing and it has helped me save our family farm by preserving the land and establishing wildlife habitat,” said Dunlap. “This program gave me hope that I would be able to restore my land through conservation practices so I could bring back diverse wildlife and have the opportunity to plant trees again.”\nOver the years, Dunlap’s CRP practices did indeed expand. Besides improving the soil health, Dunlap noticed an increase in wildlife numbers. It restored diversity to the farm.\n“The program provided me income and the opportunity to apply restorative methods to save my land and allow wildlife species to return, reproduce and thrive,” said Dunlap. “It has brought back beauty to the landscape, improved soil fertility and created new ecosystems that will continue to improve over the years. The impact of CRP will benefit many future generations.”\nSince , CRP has helped prevent more than 9 billion tons of soil from eroding and protected more than 170,000 stream miles with riparian and grass buffers, more than 100,000 acres of bottomland hardwood trees, nearly 300,000 acres of flood-plain wetlands, and 250,000 acres each for duck nesting habitat and upland bird habitat.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Conservation\n Conservation Reserve Program\n Farm Bill\n Farmers\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n FSA\n Ohio",

This school was chosen because of the exemplary job they have done in providing healthy meals and physical activity for their students.\nPrior to the First Lady’s arrival, I was honored to present our agency’s highest award in the HealthierUS School Challenge (HUSSC) to . Tammany Parish School System. HUSSC recognizes schools that meet strict requirements for nutritious meals and physical activity for students. I presented gold-with-distinction medals and certificates to each of the school’s principals and food service staff, and for the first time a monetary award accompanied the recognition. Each school received $2,000 for a total award of $50,000 to the school district’s food service program.\nI’m sure that the visit by the First Lady will be remembered here for years to come. I’m proud to be part of the effort to end childhood hunger and reduce obesity, but we can’t do it alone. In addition to federal and state funding and programs, it takes the earnest participation of parents, children, and the community, as well as the schools. Congratulations to the St. Tammany Parish Public School System for providing a shining example of how schools can help in the fight against childhood obesity.\nSchools on stage accepting HealthierUS School Challenge plaques.Southwest Regional Administrator (right) presents check to St. Tammany Parish Public School System\nFirst Lady Obama praises schools for improving child nutrition.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n Bill Ludwig\n Brock Elementary School\n First Lady\n FNS\n Healthier US School Challenge\n HUSSC\n Louisiana\n Michelle Obama\n Slidell\n St. Tammany Paris School System",

Faced with greater time constraints from work, childcare, and commuting, they often turn to convenience foods. Convenience foods are defined as types of foods that save time in food acquisition, preparation, and cleanup. Convenience foods are restaurant meals and ready-to-eat food from grocery stores. The ready-to-eat food encompasses many types of food ranging from bananas to frozen pizza that require little or no preparation. Although these convenience foods save time, they tend to have lower nutritional values and can be more expensive than food that takes more time to prepare. In our recent report, Consumers Balance Time and Money in Purchasing Convenience Foods, we use USDA’s -13 National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS) to explore why Americans purchase convenience foods, what types of convenience foods they purchase, and the factors affecting their decisions; such as time constraints, prices, the food environment, and financial resources. More specifically, we examine how each factor affects foods with varying degree of convenience that consumers purchase: fast-food, full-service restaurant meals, ready-to-eat foods from grocery stores, or non-ready-to-eat foods from grocery stores.\nEmployment creates time constraints from both the time spent working and the time spent commuting. These time constraints shift consumer demand from grocery store foods to restaurant meals. The shift to full-service restaurants is most notable when all adults in the household are employed. Households where all the adults are employed purchase 12 percent less ready-to-eat food from grocery stores and 72 percent more food from full-service restaurants than households where not all adults are employed.\nHaving children in the household also affects convenience food choices, both because parents select foods they believe their children will eat, and because parents spend time taking care of children and therefore have less time to prepare food. Households with children purchase 19 percent more fast-food meals and 38 percent less full-service restaurant meals than households without children. However, as the number of children in the household increases, they purchase more foods from grocery stores and less from restaurants. In addition, single parents, who do not have a partner to help out with child care, purchase 14 percent more ready-to-eat foods than all other households.\nFinancial resources also play an important role in convenience food choices. Convenience foods from fast-food or full-service restaurants tend to be more expensive than those bought from grocery stores. Not surprisingly, as household incomes rise, households shift from ready-to-eat food from grocery stores to fast-food and full-service restaurant meals. On the other hand, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides program participants with funds to purchase food from grocery stores, and as a result, SNAP participants tend to buy more food from grocery stores and less from restaurants than non-participants who are eligible for SNAP.\nConsumers’ decisions on how much of different types of convenience foods they purchase is influenced by time constraints, prices, the food environment, and financial resources. Understanding what motivates these consumers to purchase convenience foods has important implications for public health, given that convenience foods are often associated with lower nutritional value.\nTime constraints due to employment are associated with greater preference for convenience foods.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Economic Research Service\n convenience foods\n FoodAPS\n SNAP",

(Cristi Palmer, IR-4 Project, Rutgers University)\nThis post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. \nWhat began as a program to ensure the safe production of a diverse food supply is now providing a value-added application of its core expertise: protecting honeybees from parasites and people from vector-borne diseases.\nUSDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) funds the IR-4 Program (“Inter-Regional Project ”), which was established more than 50 years ago and is headquartered at Rutgers University. The IR-4 funds laboratories that test pesticides intended to protect specialty crops. That testing generates that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires for pesticide registration. Without the help of IR-4, the cost of the research for pesticide registration for specialty crops would be prohibitive.\nThe IR-4 is a collaboration among NIFA, land-grant universities, USDA’s Agricultural Research Service and Foreign Agricultural Service, EPA, Department of Defense, specialty crop growers, and industry. The IR-4 helps growers increase yields of higher quality products and harmonizes regulatory standards that enhance international trade. According to a report, the program supports more than 104,000 U.S. jobs and adds $7.2 billion to the gross domestic product annually. This is a huge return on NIFA’s $12 million annual investment.\nExecutive Director of IR-4, Jerry Baron, and NIFA National Program Leader Rob Hedberg attribute IR-4’s success to engagement with grower organizations, regulatory agencies, and the agricultural community, saying IR-4 has become a global model for other countries to register safe pesticides.\nDue to the efforts of IR-4’s biopesticide and organic support program, EPA recently approved the use of potassium salts of hops beta acids to protect honeybees from Varroa mites. These extracts from hops (the same plant used to flavor beer) are helping to protect pollinators from a major contributor of colony collapse disorder.\nThe IR-4’s public health pesticides program recently assisted in introducing “attractive toxic sugar baits” (ATSB) in the United States, which can devastate mosquito populations in less than a month. ATSBs contain sugar (the bait), garlic oil (which kills mosquitoes), and an attractant that targets specific mosquito species, such as Aedes aegypti (which transmits tropical viruses like dengue) and Anopheles spp. (which carry malaria).\n“Recent threats highlight the desperate need for a stronger, diversified vector-control toolbox,” said Karl Malamud-Roam, PHP manager. According to Hedberg, the ability to apply knowledge gained for one purpose to a separate public health threat illustrates the “serendipity of having the right information at the right time.”\nNIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n ARS\n Environmental Protection Agency\n FAS\n NIFA\n Rutgers University\n Science Tuesday",

Launched in , more than 1,500 StrikeForce partnerships have already helped USDA support nearly 190,000 projects and invest $23.5 billion in high-poverty areas in rural America.\"Growing the economy by investing in rural communities, farmers, makers and innovators, and increasing opportunities for families are keys to our nation's future,\" said Vilsack. \"StrikeForce has proven to be an effective, collaborative process that builds partnerships and enables USDA to bring economic opportunity directly to rural Americans where they live and helps rural communities leverage their assets.\"Currently, 85 percent of our country's persistent poverty counties are in rural America. More than one-third of rural Americans and one-in-four rural children live in poverty. Research has shown that even kids growing up in families earning as much as twice the poverty threshold are still nearly three times as likely as all other children to have poor health, are more likely to finish two fewer years of school, and are more likely to learn earn half as much money in their adult life.USDA's StrikeForce delivers promising, sustainable results by building partnerships with community organizations, businesses, foundations, universities, faith-based and other groups to help challenged communities shape a future based on local assets and regional strengths. With the addition of Oklahoma and Puerto Rico in , StrikeForce technical assistance reached people in 880 counties and parishes, helping USDA invest nearly $7.5 billion to create jobs, build homes, feed kids, assist farmers and conserve natural resources in some of the nation's most economically challenged areas.Other significant, measurable results for include: Helped create or save more than 5,800 jobs in high-poverty rural areas. Assisted over 14,600 farmers and landowners to preserve natural resources and protect the environment. Helped nearly10,000 farmers with farm loan assistance, almost three quarters of them socially disadvantaged or beginning farmers. Provided more than rikeForce states.Altogether, 970 counties, parishes, boroughs, and census areas in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia are now eligible for \"intensive care\" through StrikeForce.StrikeForce is part of the Obama Administration's commitment to address persistent poverty across America. USDA identifies census tracts with over 20 percent poverty (according to American Community Survey ) to identify sub-county pockets of poverty. As areas of persistent poverty are identified, USDA staff work with state, local and community officials to increase awareness of USDA programs and help build program participation through intensive community outreach and technical assistance. Visit www.usda.gov/StrikeForce.USDA also works with other federal partners to synchronize and leverage related work underway through the White House placed-based priorities like the Promise Zone Initiative; the Rural IMPACT Demonstration; Local Foods, Local Places; and Strong Cities, Strong Communities.Since , USDA has made significant investments in the four states with counties receiving the StrikeForce designation: In Florida, USDA invested nearly $61.6 billion between and . This includes more than $6.5 billion in economic development to support affordable housing and create jobs; more than $1.4 billion in infrastructure development, including electricity, broadband and telecommunications, water, and community facilities; and more than $926 million through conservation efforts to protect Florida's land, water and air resources. In Missouri, USDA invested more than $32.1 billion between and . This includes more than $4.7 billion in economic development to support affordable housing and create jobs; more than $2.9 billion in infrastructure development, including electricity, broadband and telecommunications, water, and community facilities; and nearly $1.7 billion through conservation efforts to protect Missouri's land, water and air resources. In Montana, USDA invested more than $11.4 billion between and . This includes nearly $1.7 billion in economic development to support affordable housing and create jobs; nearly $828 million in infrastructure development, including electricity, broadband and telecommunications, water, and community facilities; and more than $1.2 billion through conservation efforts to protect Montana's land, water and air resources. In Ohio, USDA invested more than $36.8 billion between and .

Greenwalt & C. Labandeira, Smithsonian Institution.)\nAn intrepid fossil hunter on the U.S. Forest Service’s Flathead National Forest in northwest Montana doesn’t need to dig too deep to find exquisitely preserved fossil insects with traces of their original stomach contents. Amazing as this sounds you just need to visit rock outcrops of the Kishenehn Formation exposed on the banks of the Flathead River.\nThere, researchers affiliated with the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History have discovered a treasure trove of tiny, 46-million year old fossil insects from the Eocene Epoch, which were deposited in sediments of an ancient lake early during the Age of Mammals. The preserved insects—over 7,000 specimens have been collected over the last several years—include fossil mosquitos. At least one specimen preserves an abdomen still engorged from its last meal.\nFossil DNA?\nNot quite, but the preservation is exceptional enough to allow chemical identification of iron-containing heme subunits of the blood molecule hemoglobin.\nRecognition of these 46-million year old biomolecules reflects advances in chemical analytical techniques that are now used in paleontology and would have been unheard of only decades ago. How did the tiny insects in these rocks come to be so well preserved?\nTo answer that, we need to visit the Eocene lake.\nFossil wasp from Kishenehn Formation. Scale bar is 1 mm. (Photo credit: D. Greenwalt & C. Labandeira, Smithsonian Institution.)\nImagine a cloud of insects arise at dusk, enshrouding the lakeshore in dense swarms after avoiding the harsh midday sun. A squall blows many far offshore. As the wind quells, disoriented fliers follow the moon’s shimmering reflection off the deeper lake’s glassy surface. Exhausted, they drop into the water. Far from the nutrient-rich shoreline, fish are few and many of the insect carcasses slowly settle undisturbed to the lake bottom.\nOxygen is nearly absent in the offshore lake-bottom muds, and there is little to disturb the settled remains, which are soon enmeshed in sticky mats of algal filaments that bind insects and sediment grains alike. Clay and silt particles continue to settle out from the water above to blanket the lake bottom, forming a seasonal rhythm of alternating shale layers called varves. Deeper burial beneath the varved lake bottom sediments eventually shut down decomposition of the buried insects.\nBurial beneath hundreds to thousands of feet of sediments squeezes most of the organic material out from the carcasses into the pore spaces of the surrounding sediment—where it may contribute to oil formation. In fact, these rocks are often referred to as “oil shales.”\nLeft behind are thin insoluble carbon films and other chemicals residues which preserve in exquisite detail miniscule anatomical details and sometimes even gut contents, ultimately revealed by splitting the rock 46-million years later with a paleontologist’s rock pick.\nFossil weevil from Kishenehn Formation.

The venue for the meeting between federal officials and tribal leaders was in the beautiful remote Copper River valley at the Tazlina Community Hall. Tazlina is located seven miles south of Glennallen on Alaska’s Richardson Highway.\nTribal representatives and other partners from the region used the session in early August to discuss issues affecting their villages. Leaders from Rural Development, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Farm Service Agency, Small Business Administration, Housing and Urban Development and the Economic Development Administration (EDA) were on hand to listen and participate in the dialogue.\nWilson Justin, administrator of the Cheesh-na Tribe in Chistochina, began the day-long session with an invocation.  A healthy discussion ensued, with local economic development one of the primary topics of conversation.\nWilson Justin (left) joins Barbara Blake from the Intertribal Agricultural Council with a community member and Cheesh-na Tribe members Irene Johnson and Sandy Moore during a recent tribal consultation meeting in Interior Alaska\n“The Copper River valley has an abundant supply of timber, much of it standing dead due to beetle infestation.  Harvesting this timber presents an economic opportunity and challenge for the region.  The Native village of Gulkana currently heats several community buildings with wood.  They hope open a wood pellet manufacturing operation in the future.  The Ahtna Native Corporation has located natural gas on their land which they hope to develop. The EDA, SBA and UDSA-Rural Development hope to provide financial assistance for economic development projects that create jobs and attract private investment in the Copper River valley,” said Shirley Kelly of EDA.\nAmong the other items of discussion were: adequate and affordable housing; food production and availability; natural resource management and the cost of energy.  Site control for housing and invasive species were two, attention-grabbing topics for people in the region.\nMore Tribal Collaboration Meetings will be scheduled throughout the year.

They give us so much,” Leavell said. “We have many challenges to keep our American forests healthy … and yet the forests have proven to be exceptionally resilient, it’s up to us to keep it that way.”\nForest Service Chief Tom Tidwell bestowed the honor. “We are grateful to Chuck for using his platform as a world-famous musician to help spread the word about the importance of sustainable forest management,” Tidwell said. “When Chuck talks, people listen.”\nLeavell and his wife, Rose Lane, have studied conservation techniques here and abroad, constantly finding ways to improve their wildlife and forest management.

Partnering with the Ad Council and Sony Pictures Entertainment, the Forest Service recently launched its Discover the Forest campaign featuring the Smurfs and their new movie, The Smurfs 2.\nStudies have shown that the time children in the United States spend outdoors has declined 50 percent over the past 20 years. Population shifts to urban and suburban environments, an increase in children’s indoor activities, and a lack of awareness of, or access to, nearby nature locations have contributed to this trend. However, research shows there are many benefits to kids spending time in nature. Time spent outdoors gives children the ability to explore, use their imaginations, discover new wildlife and engage in unstructured and adventurous play.\nTo encourage kids – and grown-ups – to “unplug” and get outdoors, the Discover the Forest campaign partnered with Sony Pictures to launch a series of public service announcements (PSAs) and educational materials featuring characters from the animated adventure, The Smurfs 2. The PSAs and the educational materials aim to encourage parents, caregivers and their kids to go out to the forest to experience the wonder and magic of nature.\nAs inhabitants of the forest, the blue, fun-loving Smurfs are the perfect ambassadors for forest recreation.

Whooping cranes generally mate for life, and may return to the same watering holes again and again over the years.\nThe creation of the 330-acre floodplain, in the historical Purgatory Swamp between the Wabash and Embarras Rivers, was an almost immediate boon for migrating and regional wildlife. As soon as the restoration work was completed, water pooled into a wet area that attracted the pair of whooping cranes, who stopped by this week. The cranes had previously been banded as No.4 Female and No. 16 Male, according to a source with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and are probably on their way back to their nesting site in Wisconsin or Canada.\nThis floodplain project was one of 11 Illinois Emergency Watershed Protection – Floodplain Easement Program projects funded by the Obama Administration’s American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of (Recovery Act). In the past century, over half of the floodplains in Illinois have been altered by levees, lock and dams, and stream channelization. Water that enters these lands not only takes longer to drain, but also causes millions of dollars in crop damage.\nTo help reduce damage to flood-prone lands, and the associated costs for farmers and local governments, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service offers landowners a chance to take flood-prone areas out of production through conservation easements, beginning the process of restoring these lands to their original function as floodplains.\nThough restoring a floodplain is not a quick process, some benefits are visible almost immediately—like the appearance of the pair of endangered birds! And some of the benefits of wetlands, like downstream flood prevention and water quality protection, are less visible, but just as important.\nLearn more about NRCS ARRA Programs.\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\nCheck out other conservation stories on the USDA blog.\n Category/Topic:\n Initiatives\n Conservation\n Tags:\n ARRA\n Conservation\n Illinois\n Lawrence County\n NRCS\n U.S. Fish and Wildlife",

His study was first to report that the decades-long stream of rural-to-urban migration had reversed.\nIn Mr. Beale’s obituary in September , The Washington Post extolled his encyclopedic knowledge:\n“Two or three times a year, Calvin L. Beale would leave his desk in Washington and travel to the University of Wisconsin to speak to graduate students. A professor of rural sociology at the university, Glenn Fuguitt, knew that Mr. Beale had spent decades studying the population trends of rural regions for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and that no one alive had a deeper understanding of his subject.\n“After his lecture, Mr. Beale would join Fuguitt and the grad students for dinner. In his characteristically reserved but attentive way, he asked the students where they were from. He would then recite the name of each student's county, no matter how remote, and detail its primary businesses and cultural history. As a final flourish, he would describe the local courthouse.”\nHaving once said, “You can’t know what’s going on in the country from behind a desk in Washington,” Calvin visited most U.S. counties. Along the way, he photographed over 2,000 county courthouses. Eighteen of his favorite photos can be viewed in a USDA Flickr gallery.\nERS demographer Calvin Beale mapping population patterns in rural America\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Calvin Beale\n ERS\n ERS 50th Anniversary",

We accomplish these goals in cooperation with other U.S. government agencies and with private-sector partners ranging from non-governmental organizations to research institutions to agribusinesses. And we are always looking for ways to be more effective.\nSo this week, at the International Food Aid and Development Conference (IFADC) in Kansas City, we got back to basics, discussing steps we are taking to operate our international aid programs more efficiently to ensure that program dollars go directly to eliminating hunger and poverty. We focused on how USDA can strengthen our partnerships with academia and international relief and development groups, as well as with local and international companies.

Photo courtesy Crowley Petroleum Distribution.\nWhen a flood damaged the banks of the Yukon River in Fort Yukon, Alaska, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service stepped in to help prevent a major environmental catastrophe.\nThe citizens of Fort Yukon are predominantly Alaskan Natives who live a subsistence lifestyle, relying on fish from the Yukon River as one of their main food sources. The community is not accessible by road and all supplies are either barged in during the short summer or flown in at extreme expense. An entire year’s fuel supply for the village’s vehicles, heating and power is held in a 750,000 gallon tank farm.\nIn May , a major break-up flood—a spring flood that occurs when the river ice is breaking up—caused widespread bank erosion on the Yukon River. During this type of flood, the ice sometimes forms huge ice jams that can dam the river and make the flooding even more extreme. Fast-flowing water pushes the ice downstream, causing it to scour the banks and plow into buildings.\nThe flood destroyed a series of finger dikes NRCS had installed in the mid-s through its Emergency Watershed Protection Program. Without the dikes the tank farm was left vulnerable to erosion as the tanks were mere feet from the eroding river bank. To save their fuel and protect the river, Fort Yukon residents requested NRCS’s help in replacing the bank protection.\nThe Yukon River during spring break-up; the tank farm can be seen on the riverbank in the background. Photo by NRCS District Conservationist Joanne Kuykendall.\nHowever, stabilizing the bank was impractical. First, NRCS engineers estimated stabilization efforts could run as high as $23 million dollars. That put the project out of reach for both NRCS and the project sponsor, the Gwichyaa Zhee Gwich’in Tribal Government, which would contribute 10 percent of the cost of the project. Equally problematic were the uncertain long-term prospects for any erosion control measures made to the bank.\nSo relocating the tank farm away from the river bank to a more stable, less flood-prone location seemed the best alternative. The relocation ultimately cost just over $10 million, with the sponsor and a private entity furnishing approximately 20 percent of the funding.\nThe project prevented what would have been a catastrophic fuel spill into the Yukon River. It protected the village’s infrastructure, helped preserve the subsistence fishing-based lifestyle of Fort Yukon’s residents and protected the water supply of countless people and animals downstream.\nFollow NRCS on Twitter\nCheck out other conservation-related stories on the USDA blog.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Alaska\n Conservation\n Environment\n flood\n NRCS",

The event truly showcased talented youth from all over the country.\nThe National FFA Organization began in as a group of 33 young farmers and has since grown to more than 500,000 members. Through agricultural education, FFA members develop leadership skills and prepare themselves for personal and career growth.\nEncouraging members to be well-rounded, the National FFA is about more than just traditional agriculture. The modern agricultural industry intersects with biology, chemistry, engineering and business and the National FFA urges its members--ranging in age from 12 to 21 years old--to excel in all of these areas. Because the organization stresses the importance of being well-rounded, members pursue positions in diverse professions. Notable alumni include President Jimmy Carter, former professional athlete Bo Jackson, and pop singer Taylor Swift.\nAMS is proud to be one of the more than 300 exhibitors who participated in this year’s National FFA career show in Indianapolis, Indiana. We travel to events like this to meet and share ideas with the future leaders of the agriculture industry. We hope that our presence inspires these young students to seek a position within the USDA. We were impressed by the National FFA members and their leadership potential as we got to know some of them throughout the week.\nConvention attendees had a busy schedule. They attended educational sessions and workshops, networked with organizations at the career fair, and heard from prominent speakers from various professions. Members were also treated to social events that included a performance by country music sensation Steel Magnolia and a rodeo. They also heard from Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who emphasized the importance of the agriculture industry and encouraged members to pursue a career in this field.\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack makes remarks at the 84th Annual National Convention of the FFA on Thursday, Oct. 22, , in Indianapolis, IN.

(Janie) Dunning, Missouri State Director in\n Rural\n Mar 24, \n Lying in the heart of Mid-America and the historical crossroads of two US highways, Macon, Missouri is a city with a rich cultural heritage and strong vision for the future. Macon offers the amenities of a small friendly city with the advantages of a growing city. History acknowledges the fact that in a man named John Beaumont, a real estate man and promoter, donated 10,000 young maple trees in payment of taxes of $116.00 to the City of Macon.  Now Macon is known as the \"City of Maples\" with over 275,000 maple trees.\nAs the senior population increases yearly, the Senior Center of Macon saw an increasing need for nutritious meals to be provided to the older residents.  Plans were made, blueprints were drawn, and the search for funding was begun in earnest.\nThe determination and fortitude of the Board of Directors resulted in funding for a new 4,500 square foot senior nutrition center.  USDA Rural Development was able to fund a Community Facilities (CF) grant a direct loan.  Additionally, the State of Missouri through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program will provide a grant towards the total cost of the project.\nThe CDBG and USDA financial assistance means a lot to the community and the Senior Center of Macon whereas we will have an accessible facility to provide services to the seniors and meet the needs of the community,” said John Richard Jones the Senior Center Board President.  “We appreciate the assistance of USDA and Mark Twain Regional Council of Governments in the respective application processes as well as Bank Midwest and Macon Senior Housing on making the site available and the Macon County Commissioners for sponsoring the CDBG application.”\nThanks to dedicated people anxious to improve the quality of life in their hometown, senior residents will enjoy fun, fellowship, and a delicious lunch in one place. Home delivered meals will be provided for those who cannot make the trip to the center.\nA community room will be a welcome addition and will be handicapped accessible, improving the well-being of older adults by responding to their diverse needs and interests.  Hot meals, good conversation and caring interaction will be on the menu each day at the Senior Nutrition Center.\nTo find out how USDA Rural Development can assist your community, click here. \nMissouri State Director Janie Dunning (Third from Right) presents a plaque recognizing the community accomplishments of the nutrition center.

USDA photo by Lance Cheung. \nIn this week’s guest post, Dr. Stephen Cook describes the childhood overweight and obesity epidemic based on first-hand experience with patients in his clinical practice.  He also discusses the important role that school nutrition plays in both short- and long-term health outcomes among our nation’s children.\nDr. Stephen Cook, M.D., Ph.D., American Heart Association Volunteer\nIt’s a hard truth to swallow, but childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions – and diet has a lot to do with it. In the city of Rochester, where I currently live and work, almost half of all children are overweight or obese. In fact, one of the patients in my practice was already considered obese at the tender age of three. By the time he turned four, his BMI was over the 98th percentile for his age.\nUnfortunately, as a pediatrician, I see many overweight and obese children. But, I believe there are ways we can defeat these disturbing trends if we intervene when the child is still young. In this case, we talked with the patient’s mother and she agreed to make changes to his physical activity levels and his diet. We then tracked his growth for almost three years and his weight gain slowed down. Eventually, he lost two pounds and because his height was increasing, he is now in the 69th percentile – the normal range for his age.\nIt’s clear to me that behavior patterns are set at a young age. Small changes early in life make a big difference in our later years. While many parents play their part to help kids eat healthy at home, their efforts can be undermined during the school day, when kids consume the majority of their daily calories.\nI wish all children were encouraged to develop healthy eating habits at home, but speaking from experience, this isn’t always the case. At the University of Rochester’s Golisano Children's Hospital, where I practice, about two thirds of our 13,000 patients are living in poverty. The children we serve attend the Rochester City School District, and nearly 80 percent qualify for free or reduced-cost lunch. For some of these kids, it’s the only healthy meal they will eat all day.\nThat’s why the nutrition standards put in place by the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) are so critical for the health of our nation’s young people. A report from the Institute of Medicine, a highly respected, independent science-based organization, supports every standard the act requires. For instance, the HHFKA includes a provision to lower the amount of salt allowed in school meals over a decade. Without this reduction, more kids will develop high blood pressure that could lead to heart disease and stroke before they reach adulthood. This is particularly alarming because I am already seeing young patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension and fatty liver disease – diseases that I used to see only in adults.\nThe HHFKA sets the stage for our schools to not only combat obesity, but prevent children from getting the very chronic diseases that are associated with being overweight or obese. I am pleased that kids are now eating more fruits and vegetables and less junk food in schools, thanks to the HHFKA. That’s exactly the type of behavior changes we need to promote in the school setting to stop obesity in its tracks.\nI feel so strongly about this topic that I testified at an Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee hearing convened by Senator Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., on June 12. As a children’s health expert and American Heart Association volunteer, I described the current childhood obesity epidemic, shed some light on the costs of treatment, and explained how school meals are a front-end investment to keep our children healthy.\nEven though 90 percent of schools are meeting these standards, some want to roll them back or get rid of them altogether. It is my hope that the tremendous progress we have made will not be undone. We must remember that children’s health is at the heart of the HHFKA. This law is essential for protecting their current and future health and for the health of our nation.\nDr. Stephen Cook, a volunteer with the American Heart Association, provides his perspective as a pediatrician and explains why the school nutrition standards are critically important for the health of our nation’s young people.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n cafeteria stories\n Childhood Obesity\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n HealthierNextGen\n Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act\n HHFKA\n Institute of Medicine\n New York\n NSLP\n SBP\n school meals\n school nutrition",

The greatest tradition is the centerpiece to your meal – turkey. Over 2,500 American turkey farms work to bring just the right bird to your table. Here are tips to help you select your turkey and pointers to manage leftovers.\nThere will be plenty of turkey products, but shop early if you have a particular bird in mind. A hen, weighing 8 to 16 pounds, is a great option for smaller crowds. For larger crowds, look for a tom which weigh 16 to 24 pounds. You might consider pairing a smaller bird with a turkey breast or two, an excellent choice for intimate meals or as a supplement to the centerpiece turkey for larger gatherings.\nFrozen birds have a wider selection of sizes. If you are looking for smaller sizes, check out fresh or specialty birds such as antibiotic free. You’ll want to purchase one pound of turkey for each person and a bit more for leftovers. Lastly, you’ll want the highest quality turkey. Only birds that exemplify the best eating characteristics earn the USDA Grade A shield, so look for the shield! Curious about prices? You can find advertised retail prices through our National Turkey Retail Report (, 502 ).\nWhile the turkey centerpiece is the greatest Thanksgiving tradition, a close second is the leftovers. Store leftovers within two hours of cooking. Leftovers can be refrigerated for three to four days before you freeze them. When reheating, be sure they reach 165 °F on your food thermometer. And gobble up those leftovers to avoid food waste.\nWe’ve touched on selecting your turkey and leftovers, but how do you prepare the bird? The National Turkey Federation created Thanksgiving 101 as a guide to prepare your turkey, along with recipes for leftovers like BBQ Turkey Pizza.

        "content": "U.S. Forest Service in\n Forestry\n Apr 13, \nCurrent restoration goals include thinning and using fire as a management tool to reduce fuel loads. (Photo by Clint Gould, U.S. Forest Service)\nLike a phoenix rising from ashes, blackened portions of the Stanislaus National Forest, which were left by the Rim Fire that blazed through the Sierras in August of , have begun to spring to life. Left with a burn scar that is one-third larger than New York City, a reforestation team is diligently working to bring forth a new forest.\nSince the fire, much has been done in the way of making the forest safe for public travel and recreation along main travel routes. Snags and fire-damaged trees present significant safety hazards to humans. They also create a tremendous fuel load on the ground (biomass) as they fall. This fuel can feed future fires, which can be severely damaging to the soil.\nThus far, many thousands of burned trees have been removed via salvage logging.  Logging not only allows the wood to be repurposed, but it also clears the path for the future forest and the animals that will inhabit it.\nThe next step in this restoration process is reforestation. Maria Benech, Interdisciplinary Team Leader for the Rim Fire Reforestation project, has been working with a host of scientists, resource specialists and the public to develop a project plan for the future forest.\nWithout intervention, it could take several decades, even centuries, for the forest to reestablish its place in the natural cycle. The intensity and sheer size of the fire left large gaps in the forest canopy. These gaps are far greater than those historically seen.\n“Seed-producing trees are so far away from some of these openings that it is very unlikely trees could naturally regenerate for a very long time,” said Benech.\nBiodiversity, wildlife habitat and fire resiliency are priorities driving the reforestation plan.\n“We are looking about 60 to 100 years into the future to picture our end goal,” said Benech. “That includes incorporating information on forest resiliency to fire, historic forest structure and climate change models.”\nThe project lists the following needs:\n1) return a mixed conifer forest to the landscape;\n2) restore mature forest for wildlife habitat and connectivity;\n3) reduce fuels for future fire resiliency;\n4) enhance deer habitat; and\n5) eradicate noxious weeds.\nCreating a forest that can adapt and survive natural disturbances is also important. That is why the reforestation plan calls for thinning of 11,285 acres of existing plantations.\n“Forests in California need to be able to bounce back following disturbance, and fire is a natural and critical agent of change,” said Jeanne Higgins, forest supervisor for the Stanislaus National Forest. “Removing fire from the equation is not part of the plan, but reducing the intensity of future forest fires certainly is a part of our overall mission. Thinning will help us to reach that desired resilient state.”\n“Reintroducing fire into the forested areas early is one way the Stanislaus has of lessening the damaging effects of intense fires,” said Chris Schow, fire management officer. “Frequent fires tend to burn with less severity and the post-fire effects are less damaging because there is less fuel to drive up the intensity.”\nThe Rim Fire killed conifers that were shading out many of the large oaks that once thrived on this landscape when fire was more frequent.  Without competition, these oaks, which readily re-sprout from their bases, are rebounding in the burned area.\nThe reforestation plan takes into account the importance of oak trees and is recommending seedlings are not planted within a 25-foot buffer of these re-sprouting trees.\n“Acorns are such an important food crop for so many species of wildlife,” said Marcie Baumbach, forest wildlife biologist. “That’s partly why we are doing things differently this time.”\nDeer are one species that rely on acorns during cold winter months. They are also an indicator species for overall forest health, and have been studied by some of California’s earliest visitors. Current studies conducted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife indicate that migratory deer herds are on the decline statewide.\nMigratory deer, such as the Tuolumne deer herd, travel mountainous corridors between higher and lower elevations in the Sierra Nevada. Downed timber from the Rim Fire interrupted some of these travel corridors.  It also disrupted habitat critical to their survival.\nEnhancing wildlife habitat is just one aspect of this multi-faceted project. The reforestation plan is a road map for the future that highlights a variety of resource issues.\nThe public is welcome to attend upcoming reforestation events.\nRestoring health to our landscapes and watersheds can positively impact water quality downstream.

Many experts predict this specific strain could spread rapidly, causing a wheat shortage affecting food security worldwide. Ninety percent of the wheat grown worldwide is susceptible, so if no preventive action is taken, it could cause wheat shortages and affect food security.\nCurrent wheat varieties do not have resistance to this specific strain of Ug99.  However, USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists in the Cereal Disease Laboratory in St. Paul, Minn., searched the USDA germplasm collections for wheat and its wild relatives to discover the resistance gene Sr35 that is effective against Ug99. The gene was found in Triticum monococcum, a close relative of pasta and bread wheat. Now, scientists with the Triticeae-Coordinated Agriculture Project (T-CAP) and Kansas State University have copied this gene.\nThe study, authored by Eduard Akhunov at Kansas State University and Jorge Dubcovsky at the University of California-Davis, was published in today’s issue of the journal Science. As part of the study, co-author Matt Rouse, an ARS plant pathologist at St. Paul, screened wheat varieties for Ug99 resistance at the only U.S. laboratory authorized to handle the Ug99 plant pathogens.\nThis research, funded by USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and ARS, represents an important milestone in the fight against this potentially devastating disease. The Sr35 gene, when bred into commercial varieties, confers near-immunity against Ug99 and other related strains. The gene has already been deployed by ARS wheat geneticists into U.S. wheat varieties.\nWheat lines transformed with Sr35 are resistant to Ug99, suggesting that biotechnological approaches can be used to control this disease. This work also builds a platform for further understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the interactions between the stem rust pathogen and wheat. This work shows promise for developing more durable strategies to control this devastating disease.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Africa\n ARS\n Food security\n Kansas State University\n Minnesota\n NIFA\n Uganda\n wheat",

Credit: CDC\nHere at USDA, we’re on a mission to help all of our nation’s children have the best possible chance at a healthy life.  So, we’re very encouraged by some recent news from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):  the rate of obesity among low-income pre-school children appears to be declining for the first time in decades.\nThe declining rates show that our collective efforts are helping to gain ground on childhood obesity, particularly among some of the more vulnerable populations in our country.  Low-income children are often at a disadvantage when it comes to getting the food they need to grow up healthy, which is why USDA’s nutrition programs and resources are so vital.\nUSDA programs like WIC—with its new, healthier food package offerings, and CACFP—with its increasing emphasis on nutrition and physical activity are making a difference in the lives of millions of children.  In addition, educational materials like Healthy Eating for Preschoolers and Nutrition and Wellness Tips for Young Children can help adults get children off to the right start in life.\nOur efforts don’t stop there. School-aged children are now getting healthier and more nutritious school meals and snacks, thanks to changes implemented under the historic Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act.  Our Team Nutrition initiative provides nutrition education to help schools serve healthier meals and motivate kids to form healthy habits. We’re supporting healthy, local foods in schools through our Farm to School grant program. And we’re improving access to fresh produce and healthy foods for children and families that receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.\nDon’t get me wrong—we still have a long way to go before America’s childhood obesity epidemic is a thing of the past.  Far too many—1 out of every 8—preschoolers are still obese.  And, obesity in these early childhood years sets the stage for serious health problems throughout the entire lifespan.  But we at USDA are proud of our ongoing efforts to ensure the health of America’s next generation, and we know that these efforts are playing a vital role in turning the tide on early childhood obesity.

Among that 1%, the average age of the American farmer is 57 years old—making it imperative for us to engage and encourage young people to pursue agricultural careers.\nEarlier this summer, while visiting Browning, Montana, I had the opportunity to meet with Dr. Billie Jo Kipp, President of the Blackfeet Community College (BCC) and Mr. Terry Tatsey, Director of Agricultural Programs at the college.  Their efforts and commitment to educate local students and keep young people in agriculture is inspiring.\n Ed Avalos, Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs\n Posted in\n Conservation\n Aug 26, \n 4 Responses",

        "content": "APHIS Public Affairs – Detailed in\n Plants\n May 13, \nIn a symbolic gesture of friendship, Japan ceremoniously gifted the United States with two live cherry trees at an event held on the D.C mall last month. The trees represent a future gift of 250 trees that will replace the historic cherry trees to be removed in a project to repair the Tidal Basin seawall that will begin this month. Cherry trees hold deep cultural significance in Japanese tradition and have become beloved symbols in Washington, D.C., celebrated annually during the Cherry Blossom Festival. However, the journey of these trees from Japan to the United States is not without challenges.\nOver a century ago, the mayor of Tokyo learned of First Lady Helen Taft's admiration for Japanese cherry blossoms and offered to send 1,000 trees to beautify Washington, D.C., which he later increased to 5,000. Unfortunately, that first batch of 2,000 trees arrived infested with invasive insect pests and had to be destroyed. This event underscored the need for plant health protection, leading to the passage of the Plant Quarantine Act in .\nToday, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) plays a crucial role in safeguarding the United States against harmful plant pests and diseases. For the recent cherry tree gift, APHIS’ International Services team in Japan played a critical role conveying U.S. import requirements and securing special permits. PPQ and Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries officials meticulously inspected each tree, washed root balls, removed soil, replanted trees in sterile peat moss, and packaged them in pest-proof boxes for the flight.\nUpon arrival and transport to the Beltsville, MD, plant inspection station, PPQ staff thoroughly inspected the trees to ensure they were free of pests and diseases.\nThe trees will now undergo further monitoring and care at the National Plant Germplasm Quarantine Center before being planted along the seawall in the future. This meticulous process ensures that the trees will be strong and healthy, preserving the tradition of the cherry blossoms in the Tidal Basin for years to come.\nPPQ's efforts to safeguard the capital's cherry trees not only honors a longstanding tradition but also serves as a testament to the importance of plant quarantine and the crucial role that APHIS plays in protecting our natural resources from invasive pests and diseases.

NRCS photo.\nA creek in coastal Mississippi was once listed as an impaired waterway, void of a healthy aquatic ecosystem. But with the help of environmental agencies and conservation-minded farmers, the creek was removed from the “bad” list.\nOrphan Creek in Hancock County, Mississippi was listed in as a Clean Water Act impaired waterway. The creek and its tributaries, including Dead Tiger Creek, form a watershed of about 25,000 acres and push their waters to the Jourdan River and eventually the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality monitors water quality on Orphan Creek. Using retrieved from and in the Mississippi Index of Stream Quality, or MISQ, Orphan Creek scored 53.2 and 51.5, respectively and failed to support its designated aquatic life use.\nScores have to be higher than 61 on the MISQ scale to be considered adequate to support aquatic life. While the creek was already listed under the Clean Water Act, this poor rating led to the creek’s selection as a priority watershed for restoration.\nThe poor water quality was attributed to agricultural nutrients and soil erosion.\nMDEQ partnered with the Mississippi Soil and Water Conservation Commission and USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to make conservation improvements to area farms to keep cattle out of waterways and erosion control.\nThe conservation work included managing nutrients, planting grass in bare pastures and installing more than 2,800 feet of cattle fencing.\nJohnny Williams was one of the farmers who worked with NRCS in the watershed. Williams seeded good forage on his pastures and installed cross-fencing and a solar powered well on his ranch in northwestern Hancock County. The cross-fencing separates pastures into smaller ones, which reduces risk of grass being overgrazed and soil erosion.\nThe solar-powered well uses renewable energy to produce water. Since the well takes the place of a pond, less nitrogen and cattle waste are distributed into the watershed. Plus, because his land is located in the buffer zone of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Stennis Space Center, solar energy was a must.\nThe fencing, stronger plantings and well help Williams reduce runoff of nutrients into waterways.\nNutrients impair water quality, and in high quantities, can cause algal blooms and decrease oxygen in water.\n“We wanted to improve the environment,” Williams said. “I eat oysters and shrimp all the time. I don’t want the algae growing in the bay. That’s what the nitrogen was doing.”\nIn , the original and sampling location was surveyed again by MDEQ. This time, the creek received a score of 76.5. In addition, was also collected at two new sites on Orphan Creek, and the scores were 78.9 and 82.\nAs a result of the improvement, Orphan Creek was assessed as attaining aquatic life and is no longer considered impaired.\nWhile the need for conservation work continues, farmers and different agencies are showing how a positive difference can be made through voluntary conservation. Williams encourages more farmers and ranchers to take advantage of the assistance available through NRCS.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Conservation\n Farmers\n Mississippi\n NASA\n NRCS\n Ranchers\n Renewable Energy\n water quality\n watersheds",

Record heat waves and drought are not only leading to more frequent and intense wildfires but are also putting one of life’s most valuable resources at risk: the water we drink.\nA new Forest Service research report describes how extensively public drinking water systems rely on national forests and grasslands.\nWater use per person has been declining for decades; however, a variety of factors such as population growth, food production and ecosystem conditions under a changing climate are contributing to overall greater demand for water – especially in certain parts of the country.\nIn the West, national forests and grasslands supply drinking water to almost 90% of the people served by public water systems. Some western cities, like Aspen, Colorado, and Portland, Oregon, are more than 90% dependent on national forests alone for their drinking water. The story is similar in the eastern U.S., though most of this water is supplied by private forests.\nStill, more than a century of research has demonstrated that forested lands provide the cleanest and most stable water supply compared to other lands. Within the lower 48 states, more than 99% of people who rely on public drinking water receive some from forested lands.\nThis report is the first of its kind to measure how individual national forests and grasslands contribute to surface drinking water supplies while accounting for networks of pipelines and canals that divert water from the source to areas of high need, also known as “inter-basin water transfers.”\nThese inter-basin transfers are incredibly important sources of drinking water, especially in the West, where cities like Los Angeles receive more than two-thirds of their water from forested lands in California and Colorado.\nBy showing where our drinking water comes from at a fine scale, this report supports USDA’s Wildfire Crisis Strategy, and work supported by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. It helps land managers prioritize forests and watersheds for hazardous fuels reduction, watershed management, and restoration treatments that protect people, communities and resources across the country.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Forest Service\n Forestry\n water\n national forests\n Grasslands\n Colorado\n Oregon\n California\n You May Also Like\n USDA Thinks Outside the Box at Inaugural Innovation Event\n USDA Provides Winning in Women in 's Climate Sustainability Datathon\n Veteran Finds New Mission Through DOD SkillBridge and USDA’s MVAL Assistance",

Photo credit: Jason Johnson, NRCS-Iowa\nFor farmers across the country, it comes as no surprise to hear that conservation tillage practices – particularly continuous no-till – can save time and money compared to conventional tillage. The potential benefits of no-till are well-documented, from improving soil health to reducing annual fuel and labor investments.\nStill, continuous no-till has been adopted across only ates. Why? One concern involves money saved compared to money spent. Can fuel and labor reductions really make up for the money invested in switching to a new farming practice?\nTo help farmers answer this question, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) conducted an annual fuel savings study comparing gallons of fuel used in conventional tillage practices to gallons used in conservation tillage practices like seasonal and continuous no-till.\nWe hope the results will help farmers weigh their options when considering adoption of conservation tillage practices.\nFarmers across the country save fuel and money by adopting conservation tillage practices.\nFuel saved is money saved.\nOn average, farmers practicing continuous conventional till use just over six gallons of diesel fuel per acre each year. Continuous no-till requires less than two gallons per acre. Across the country, that difference leads to nearly 282 million gallons of diesel fuel saved annually by farmers who practice continuous no-till instead of continuous conventional till.\nFarmers who manage at least one crop in their rotation without tilling – seasonal no-till – save an additional 306 million gallons of fuel annually.\nThese savings add up for individual farmers.\nLet’s assume an average off-road diesel fuel price of $2.05 per gallon. If a farmer farming 1,000 acres of crops switches from continuous conventional till to continuous no-till, he or she saves 4,160 gallons of diesel fuel – more than $8,500 worth – each year.\nJust switching from continuous conventional till to seasonal no-till saves a little more than 3.2 gallons of fuel per acre. Across 1,000 acres, that equals roughly $6,600 worth of fuel saved annually.\nSaving time and improving soil health lead to additional economic benefits.\nNo-till has significant economic benefits beyond reduced fuel usage.\nA farmer who plows 15 acres per hour, for instance, would save roughly 67 hours of work with each eliminated pass over a 1,000 acre field by adopting no-till. Depending on labor costs and equipment maintenance, that’s an additional several thousand dollars saved each year.\nFields managed using no-till for multiple years generally have a higher water holding capacity than conventionally tilled fields. This is particularly valuable in drought-prone areas, where lack of water is a major concern tied to crop loss. No-till adoption also reduces soil erosion, increases soil biological activity and increases soil organic matter. These benefits can lead to additional economic gains for farmers over time.\nWe’re here to help.\nAt the NRCS, we understand that farmers need to care for their bottom line while caring for their land.\nVisit our website or your local service center for more information about integrating conservation practices like no-till into your management plan. To learn more about CEAP and our commitment to improving conservation strategies across America’s working lands, please visit NRCS’ Conservation Effects Assessment Project page.\nSoil managed through no-till often has higher biological activity and more organic matter than soil that’s conventionally tilled.

        "content": "in\n Rural\n Jun 20, \n Cross-posted from the Huffington Post:\nLast Wednesday, I participated in a regional forum of the White House Working Families Summit that was held at Virginia State University in Petersburg, Virginia. Coming from a small town in Southwest Georgia myself, I can relate to the unique challenges that rural Americans face. Growing up, my father worked seven days a week on our peanut and cattle farm with help from my mother. To make sure our family had a constant source of income and health insurance, my mother also worked off the farm at the local independent bank. I am fortunate to be the product of hard working parents who provided my sister and me with the best opportunities possible.\nAll families have a right to have access to a good education system, affordable healthcare and jobs. Our rural families are concerned about creating strong prospects for their children, whether it is on or off the farm. But it is also essential that there are opportunities that will attract young people back to rural areas and help us secure the future of agriculture.\nThe Obama Administration is committed to providing opportunities for working families across the country. That's why earlier this year President Obama created the Made in Rural America Export and Investment Initiative to help rural businesses and leaders take advantage of new investment opportunities and access new markets abroad.\nIn rural America, transportation and market access issues create complex challenges for working families. During the summit, I spoke with Maxine Ayers, legal assistant by day and partner in a seven-generation family farm by night. Maxine is working hard to help prepare her son to take over the family farm. In addition to working her job and taking care of the farm, she is also responsible for her in-laws' medical care and must regularly drive two hours to get her in-laws the care they need. I also spoke with Dee Dee Darden, owner of a country store and farmer, who faces similar rural transportation hurdles. On top of running her store and farm, she must drive three to four hours to sell her livestock. While transportation issues are still a challenge, USDA brings economic opportunities to rural communities through programs such as the Rural Community Development Initiative and Rural Business Opportunity Grants.\nThere are many ways that USDA is working to create opportunities in rural areas. First, we work to address issues of access and quality of life through efforts like Rural Development's community facilities and broadband programs. Second, we support new markets for farm and ranch products, at home and abroad. Whether it's promoting international trade, bringing products to local and regional markets or supporting the bio-based economy, USDA programs help expand opportunities for rural businesses to thrive. Third, your local USDA office can help you find programs for your community, your business and your family.\nIn the United States, there are twice as many farmers that are ages 65 or older than those ages 45 or younger. As our aging farmers transition to retirement, it is crucial that we determine who the next generation of farmers and ranchers will be. It is easy to forget that one percent of the population is responsible for feeding the entire country and much of the world.\nYoung, talented rural leaders are needed to help us tackle challenges like climate change, food security and the overall health of our economy. It was so promising to see college students in the audience who were passionate about farming and rural America. Whether it is their local FFA or 4-H chapter or serving in student government, I always encourage young folks to get involved in their local communities.\nI am proud to be from rural America, and I know that others feel the same sense of community that I do, but there are many challenges that rural residents face. Folks in rural America have an unparalleled amount of drive and passion that makes their communities a vibrant place to live. At USDA, we will continue to do everything we can to help working families succeed for generations to come.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Farmers\n Georgia\n Krysta Harden\n Made In Rural America\n President Obama\n Ranchers\n RD\n Rural America\n Rural Business\n Rural Business Opportunity Grant\n Rural Community Development Initiative\n transportation\n Virginia\n Virginia State University\n White House",

I am proud to say that we’ve made important progress on every title of the Farm Bill, including issuing disaster assistance payments, updating risk management tools, modifying farm loan programs, announcing new support for agricultural research, establishing new conservation programs, and much more.\nMy team and I at USDA have gathered together some top statistics that show how the Farm Bill is at work in your state—and the record results we’ve achieved this time around. For example:\nWe’ve hosted more than 30 outreach and listening sessions to share information and hear from stakeholders like you. As we work to efficiently and effectively implement Farm Bill programs and policies, we will continue to engage with stakeholders about their priorities and the impact that the new provisions will have on their communities. Learn more at www.usda.gov/farmbill. \nWhile it took over one year after the Farm Bill was passed, disaster assistance programs were ready to go in under 10 weeks this time around. As of August 7, USDA has processed 182,384 disaster assistance payments to help farmers and ranchers. Those payments, totaling more than $2.01 billion, will help thousands of farmers and ranchers across the country begin to rebuild after drought, blizzards and flooding. Disaster assistance helps to keep farmers and ranchers in your state from losing their operations and going out of business in the face of extreme weather. To learn more, visit \nThe Regional Conservation Partnership Program, a new approach to conservation that brings together new resources and partners, has drawn an overwhelming response with requests for more than six times the $394 million available in federal funding this year. Nearly 5,000 partners from all 50 states submitted 586 initial proposals. Look for new conservation projects at work in your state, in addition to USDA’s ongoing work in conservation, when we begin funding projects later this year.\nWe’ve appointed the 15 members of the Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research (FFAR) board of directors. The new foundation will leverage public and private resources to increase the scientific and technological research, innovation, and partnerships critical to boosting America's agricultural economy. In a time of federal budgetary constraints, the new foundation is another innovative way to continue and expand investment in agricultural research. FFAR will complement existing federally-funded research—some of those projects taking place at the Land Grant Institution in your state—and accelerate solutions to the challenges faced by American agriculture.\nWe’ve made record progress, but we’re not done yet.

Summer’s rising temperatures make picnics a playground for bacteria as families prepare, cook, and eat food outside. Here are some tips to keep you safe:\nPledge Allegiance to Cleanliness\nWash your hands before and after you handle food:\n Wet your hands with clean, running water, turn off the tap and apply soap.\n Lather your hands by rubbing them together with soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.\n Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds.\n Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.\n Dry your hands using a clean towel.\nDon’t have access to a faucet? Carry bottled water, soap, paper towels, hand sanitizer or disposable moist towelettes that contain at least 60 percent alcohol.\nUse Red, White and Blue Cutting Boards\nAvoid cross contamination by using separate, different colored cutting boards — one for fresh fruits and vegetables, one for cheeses, and another for raw meats.\nSpark Up that Grill\nIf you’re grilling at your picnic, remember to cook raw meat and poultry to a safe minimum internal temperature: ground meats at 160 F, whole cuts of meat at 145 F with a three-minute rest time, and poultry at 165 F.\nLand of the Free-zer\nPack coolers with bags of ice, gel packs or even frozen water bottles to store your food. Use an appliance thermometer in your cooler to monitor that your food stays chilled at 40 F or below.\nFor more information about food safety, contact the USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline to talk to a food safety expert or chat live at ask.usda.gov from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n Tags:\n Food Safety and Inspection Service\n FSIS\n Food Safety\n Fourth of July\n foodborne illness\n Summer\n You May Also Like\n USDA Process Verified Program: Transparency from Farm to Market\n Pack It Safe, Pack It Smart: Back-to-School Lunchbox Packing Essentials\n Food Safety Sparklers: Clean, Separate, Cook and Chill",

One question, for example, asks, “Are specific habitat components for breeding expected to change within the associated vegetation type?”  To determine vulnerability, users of the tool must answer if the breeding habitat components are expected to increase, decrease or be unchanged.\nAssuming climate change projections are correct, users then will note whether the information available is “adequate” or “inadequate” to assign a score for each question.  If the information is sufficient, an overall score will be assigned, representing the species’ relative vulnerability to climate change.\nThe tool focuses solely on the effects of climate change on land animals. Scores can be used to rank at-risk animal species and identify vulnerability “hot spots” within large landscapes, such as national forests.\n“This tool doesn’t provide a definitive answer about the extent climate change will affect animal species,” said Deborah Finch, program manager of the Grassland, Shrubland and Desert Ecosystems Science unit of the Rocky Mountain Research Station, “but information is power, and we’re empowering land managers to start assessing vulnerabilities and making decisions about where to direct their limited resources.”\nFinch, along with Megan Friggens and Karen Bagne, both Rocky Mountain Research Station researchers, developed the questions. They say that users should rely on information gathered from published materials, expert consultation and personal knowledge to complete the questionnaire.\nA full report of the System for Assessing Vulnerability of Species is available at here.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Forestry\n FS\n Rocky Mountain Research Station\n System for Assessing Vulnerability of Species",

The center has been offering ambulatory surgery in 13 specialties for seven months.  Residents appreciate knowing the local doctors and staff, as well as enjoying lower costs and convenient scheduling.  The center is on track to meet their goal of performing 1,760 surgeries annually.\nO’Brien’s second stop was at the Fairmont City Library Center where he met with board members and Library Director Barbara Rhodes.  The Mississippi Valley Library District purchased the old American Legion building to meet the needs of a previously un-served area of the district.  The building needed a lot of renovation, but it offered the best option for quickly establishing service for the community with is burgeoning Latino population.\nMonroe County Surgical Center Business Office Manager Brandy Nyberg; from USDA Rural Development, State Director Colleen Callahan, Business Programs Specialist David Chestnut, Agriculture Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development Doug O’Brien; First Bank Vice President Donna Luechtefeld-Tebbe; Rural Development Area Specialist Gary Mersinger; and First Bank Southern Illinois Region President Douglas Distler discussed how their collaboration is helping the surgical center chalk up successes.\nThe library district jump-started the renovations with a Community Facilities grant from Rural Development.  The funds were used to renovate the restrooms, construct a new main entrance and provide a 24-hour book and mail drop.  Rhodes believes the grant was a springboard to other funding opportunities. Beyond library services, the center now offers scores of services for the community, including English language instruction, tutoring, college classes, YMCA activities, college test preparation, a meeting place for the Latino Roundtable, and a teen technology initiative.\nDistrict Library Director Barbara Rhodes shares information on the value of Fairmont City Library Center’s computers with Rural Development State Director Colleen Callahan and Agriculture Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development Doug O’Brien. Students use the library center’s computers for school work and the teen technology program that prepares them for jobs that require technology skills.\nO’Brien found many reasons for the library center’s success.  According to Rhodes, the grant was a springboard to other grant awards.  Rural Development was one of few sources of bricks-and-mortar funding available to the library.  In addition, Rural Development was able to offer the library a personal touch throughout the process, readily offering guidance and quick responses.  With the library’s clear focus on what it needed, Rural Development helped create an outstanding community asset Fairmont City.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Business and Industry loan guarantee\n Community Facilities Grant\n Rural Development",

Yet pollinators have been having a rocky time, lately. Beekeepers have struggled to maintain their honey bee colonies, the primary pollinators for our crops in the United States. They are managing a suite of simultaneous and interacting stressors to bee health, including severe weather episodes, inadequate nutrition, exposure to pesticides, and numerous damaging pests and diseases. Native pollinators also seem to be struggling with some of these same stressors, as well as land use change and habitat loss.

Photo credit: Scott Bauer\nPlant breeders use certificates of intellectual property rights protection as an important marketing tool. The Plant Variety Protection Office (PVPO), part of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), is a user fee funded program that grants these certificates after careful and detailed review. Breeders of new plant varieties hold the certificates exclusively for 20 years. That benefit creates an incentive for the plant and seed industry to develop new varieties. Since , PVPO has issued more than 8,700 certificates.\nSometimes offering a great service can also create problems, such as customer requests stacking up. That is exactly what happened to PVPO which found itself with a backlog of pending applications. The program took the issue head on by initiating a business process review in .\nBased on the review, the staff duties were adjusted for greater efficiency and hard-copy applications were moved to an electronic examination. The new structure and electronic examination format reduced application handling and followed a logical process flow that helped reduce the growing backlog.\nIn addition to implementing these efficiencies, this year the PVPO launched an inventory reduction plan with a challenging goal of 700 applications. With three months to go, the program is likely to beat this goal and process an additional 150 applications. That is more than double the average for the last 10 years! Even with 380 new applications, the inventory has already been reduced from 1,124 to 830 pending applications. This is the lowest inventory since !\nPVPO is again improving service to the plant and seed industry by developing a new customer oriented system. It will feature electronic fee payment and application filing with supporting , analyses and the ability to submit high resolution photographs. The first phase of the project was just completed and a web accessible system for customers will be fully operational by the spring of .\nAMS customers and stakeholders will appreciate the new customer oriented system.

After all, about 20 percent of all U.S. agricultural production is exported, providing a critical source of farm income, supporting more than a million jobs, and generating nearly $200 billion in additional economic activity each year in our rural communities and beyond.\nUnder the Biden-Harris Administration, U.S. agricultural exports have grown significantly, posting the three highest years in history in -. And USDA remains committed to tapping more, new and better global market opportunities for our producers and agribusinesses through our trade policy and market development work.\nSome of that work is behind the scenes, like our efforts to knock down trade barriers – including India’s tariffs on U.S. poultry and berries, which were reduced in March – and to ensure that our trading partners live up to their agriculture-related commitments under trade pacts such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\nAnd some of the work is more forward-facing, like our trade missions and trade shows, which put U.S. producers and exporters in direct contact potential customers. Over the past three years, 13 USDA agribusiness trade missions helped 227 companies to tap new opportunities in key markets worldwide. There are still four more missions to come yet this year – to Canada, Colombia, Vietnam, and Morrocco. We also give U.S. producers and companies a chance to showcase their products to potential foreign buyers numerous USDA-endorsed international trade shows each year.\nIn addition, USDA is building on the success of our longstanding market development programs by taking creative new approaches and allocating significant new resources to expanding foreign markets.\nEarlier this week, Secretary Vilsack announced the first $300 million in awards, under the new $1.2 billion Regional Agricultural Promotion Program (RAPP), to help 66 partner organizations expand export opportunities in diverse and dynamic new markets. And last week, we announced the first funding opportunities under the new Assisting Specialty Crop Exports (ASCE) initiative, an innovative partnership between USDA and the specialty crops sector to address the unique challenges that hinder U.S. exports of produce, tree nuts, horticultural crops, and related products.\nThe bottom line is that agricultural trade matters – to USDA, to the farm sector, to our nation, and to the world. So take a moment to celebrate this World Trade Week. Cheers! Prost! Kanpai! Cin cin! Santé!

        "content": "USDA Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services in\n Food and Nutrition\n Initiatives\n Feb 11, \n Cross posted from the Let's Move blog: \nIt has been one year since First Lady Michelle Obama kicked off her Let’s Move! initiative with the goal to solve the problem of childhood obesity within a generation. The anniversary calls for a time to reflect on its vast contributions, but to also continue the important momentum.\nSince the beginning, this administration has leveraged USDA’s 15 nutrition assistance programs to improve domestic nutrition. From adults who nourish their families with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, to children who wade through lunch and breakfast lines at school—our programs touch 1 in 4 Americans.\nAlthough our primary goal is to prevent hunger, obesity is a dual challenge with serious health and economic implications.  Let’s Move! offers the opportunity to take a look at USDA nutrition programs and identify partnerships to tackle the multitude of health consequences associated with obesity.  A year later, we’re proud that we’ve made headway, with every sector of society stepping up for the nation’s next generation.\nOne of the first things we did was put together a coordinated government-wide Taskforce on Childhood Obesity.  Highlighting seventy recommendations on working together with all our partners, the report sharpens many key emphasized for child nutrition reauthorization.\nChild nutrition reauthorization is at the heart of Let’s Move! President Obama signed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of into law on December 13, reauthorizing our core child nutrition programs. Not only does the law upgrade standards for school meals, it helps expand program access to more kids—especially those in disadvantaged areas.\nWe’re moving quickly to implement the bill’s provisions, but our action doesn’t end there. We’ve undertaken many additional efforts and forged much progress. In particular, we’ve focused on schools, an environment ever so critical to helping kids build healthy lifestyles.\nFor that reason, we partnered with America’s culinary community, including White House Chef Sam Kass, to launch Chefs Move to Schools. The effort pairs chefs with schools to develop nutritious, tasty, and well-presented recipes for school meals.  In September we launched Recipes for Healthy Kids, a nationwide recipe contest that yielded 340 submissions and we’re excited to announce those winners in the coming months.\nOne of our most exciting partnerships is with the National Football League. Through our joint Fuel Up to Play 60 program, students devise strategies to get their fellow classmates healthier and moving at least 60 minutes every day.\nWe’ve also expanded existing programs. In , USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service established the HealthierUS School Challenge to reward schools for excellence in promoting nutrition and physical activity.  We are well on our way towards our goal of 1,250 schools by the end of June, with plans to add 1,000 in the next two years.\nThere is tremendous dedication to achieving the First Lady’s goals.  This past year, we’ve driven the conversation about how we eat, move, and grow and get our food. One year in, we’re well on a path to ensuring this generation of youngsters is healthier than their parents.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n Chefs Move to Schools\n FNS\n Fuel Up to Play 60\n HealthierUS School Challenge\n Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act\n Kevin Concannon\n Let's Move\n Michelle Obama\n President Obama\n Recipes for Healthy Kids\n SNAP\n Taskforce on Childhood Obesity",

The Beijing ATO is staffed by Foreign Service Officers from USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), who work in more than 100 offices around the world to establish solid export relationships for U.S. agriculture. In five short years, BHG has become one of the premier retailers of high-end imported foods to domestic Chinese consumers. In addition, BHG’s purchases of U.S. high-value food products jumped from $3 million in the first quarter of to $7 million in the second quarter.\nBHG opened its first store in and at the time sold a limited number of U.S. products, most of which were in bulk packaging. In , BHG made contact with the Beijing ATO during a U.S. food promotion at Parkson’s Plaza, seeking information on how to source directly from the United States in order to expand their product line and bring down costs. As an immediate result, BHG added Silk soy milk, Nature Valley and Quaker Oats products, among other specialty items, to their product line.\nSince that initial connection in , the FAS office in Beijing has worked directly with U.S. agricultural cooperators—or USDA market development program industry partners—and BHG to set up in-store promotional events featuring a wide variety of U.S. agricultural products. BHG also participated in a buyer’s mission in March to the Natural Products Expo West through the help of the Organic Trade Association, a USDA cooperator. BHG’s participation was an important event, as it allowed senior BHG buyers to not only view and source natural foods, but to meet with and examine products from a wide range of other west-coast based suppliers. As a result, two containers of organic products worth over $40,000 were shipped in April, with additional shipments currently being negotiated.\nForeign Agricultural Service Acting Administrator Suzanne Heinen visited the Solana Mall BHG store during the July promotion.\nIn recent months, ATO staff members have continued to build on this relationship by accompanying BHG buyers to the SIAL food show in Shanghai where they put BHG in contact with the U.S. Meat Export Federation, a USDA cooperator, resulting in BHG purchases of U.S. pork this summer. In July, the ATO launched a 13-store USA food fair with BHG featuring U.S. craft brew beer and U.S. pork for the first time.  FAS Acting Administrator Suzanne Heinen attended one of these in-store promotions during her recent visit to China, witnessing firsthand the positive reception to U.S. agricultural products.\nBHG has aggressive expansion plans and, as it expands, it will take its distribution networks with it.  The Beijing ATO, in collaboration with the cooperators, hope to keep this partnership alive as the chain expands, giving U.S. food products a foothold in fast-growing cities throughout China.\n Category/Topic:\n Trade\n Tags:\n Agricultural Trade Office\n Bejing\n China\n FAS\n Shanghai\n Suzanne Heinen\n Trade\n U.S. Meat Export Federation",

Every May Americans recognize their efforts and express gratitude during Military Appreciation Month. At USDA, we also celebrate the contributions that our Military members have made to agriculture and farming.\nIn , for the first time the Census of Agriculture, conducted by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), collected information about agricultural producers who served or are currently serving in the U.S. Armed Forces.\nThe resulting showed that 370,619 producers – 11% of the country’s 3.4 million producers – had military service. These producers accounted for 129,144,965 acres and $41 billion in agriculture sales.\nFarms operated by producers with military service accounted for 11% of total U.S. agriculture sales, with 53% ($22 billion) in crop sales and 47% ($19 billion) in sales of livestock and livestock products. The ag census also found that 17% of all farms had a producer who served or is serving in the U.S. Armed Forces.\nThe Census of Agriculture, currently underway, will provide updated information on military producers, which they can use when making decisions about their operations.\nCollecting on producers with military service is critical to providing needed programs and services. For example, USDA offers programs that benefit veterans who want to transition to agriculture, or start or expand a rural business. USDA is committed to ensuring service members have the tools they need to grow and thrive in agriculture.\nIt’s not too late for all producers to respond to the ag census.

In some locations, the buying limits for purchase card holders may differ, as noted in the Mission Area summaries provided under the question “What Does USDA Typically Buy?” above.\n Requirements up to $10,000 for supplies, $2,500 for services, and $2,000 for construction may be filled directly by government purchase card (GPC) holders. These purchase requirements do not usually go through the contracting office. To be considered for these purchases, companies are encouraged to submit their capability statements to the USDA Vendor Capability Submission Portal which can be accessed by all USDA purchase card holders, small business specialists, and contracting staff.\n For requirements over $10,000 and up to $25,000, the program and contracting office will garner a minimum of three quotes to ensure reasonable competition.\n Proposed contract actions expected to exceed $25,000 are synopsized on the SAM Contract Opportunities page (unless an exception applies) or use established sources such as those identified below. Before proposed contract actions over $25K are synopsized, they are often forecasted on the USDA Procurement Forecast (up to three years in advance of the need).\n Government-wide contract vehicles frequently used by USDA include:\n General Services Administration (GSA) Multiple Award Schedules (MAS)/ Federal Supply Schedules (FSS) for categories such as facilities, industrial products and services, information technology, office management, professional services, scientific management and solutions, etc. Contract opportunities on the Schedules and other GSA vehicles are typically available on GSA’s eBuy tool.\n Information Technology (IT) Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) including:\n GSA GWACs\n NASA Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP)\n NIH Information Technology Acquisition and Assessment Center (NITAAC)\n USDA and other Federal agencies often establish ordering agreements like Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) vehicles or Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) that can be used whenever a need that fits the IDIQ or BPA scope is identified.

These notices, or contract opportunities, cover announcements through official solicitations in the pre-award process. Businesses interested in contracting with the government can use this system to research active opportunities.\n Businesses can read USDA’s Vendor Communication Plan (, 565 ) and a memo on Communicating with Industry (, 354 ) for additional information on how USDA communicates with businesses (vendors) and what types of communication are allowable.\n Businesses may submit unsolicited proposals to USDA at any time. For instructions regarding unsolicited proposals, see FAR 15.6. Unsolicited proposals should be sent to the appropriate Mission Area POC (, 79.7 ) for consideration in accordance with USDA policy.\n I am new to government contracting - how do I contract with USDA?\n The Small Business Administration (SBA) provides useful information and guidance if you are new to working with the Federal Government.

Generally, a large business is the prime contractor and small businesses are the subcontractors. The prime contractor is the government contract-holder, and subcontractors work for and are paid by the prime contractor. This allows small businesses that are not prepared to work directly with a Federal agency to participate in Federal procurements.\n Special contract clauses may be included contracts with “other than small” businesses that require the prime contractor to maximize the participation of small businesses through subcontracting opportunities. Businesses can view subcontracting opportunities across the government on SBA’s Directory of Prime Contractors with Subcontracting Plans.\n Are there USDA-specific contracting policies and procedures?\n Please visit the USDA Policies and Regulations web page for links to USDA-specific policies and procedures including the Federal Acquisition Regulation and associated deviations, the Agriculture Acquisition Regulation (AGAR), and the USDA Contracting Desk Book.\n To help navigate the many acronyms in government contracting, please also reference the OCP Definitions and Acronyms list.\n What are the vendor qualification requirements?

A video-conference discussing climate change was held between DC-area students at Forest Service headquarters and students in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nAmerican students ages 10-14 provided a younger perspective on climate change today as they reported about their use of the new educational programs, the Climate Change Wildlife and Wildlands: A Toolkit for Formal and Informal Educators and the Greenschools! program. The Toolkit was produced by an interagency group of educators and scientists to help middle school audiences investigate the impacts of climate change in eleven eco-regions around the United States.\nThe two student teams represent classes that have partnered with NOAA and the U.S. Forest Service to investigate the impacts of climate change using the Toolkit and GreenSchools! materials.\nDuring their presentation, the students discussed what they have learned about the causes of climate change, how it is affecting habitats, and the resulting impacts on plant and animal species.\nA team of fifth graders from Clermont Elementary, in Alexandria, Virginia, discussed the Chesapeake Bay and the changing habitat of the diamondback terrapin.  Students from Paul Public Charter School in Washington, D.C. explained what they have learned about their school's energy use, solid waste and recycling; water, school site and air quality in order to create a greener school.\nAs a result of their studies, the student groups have been inspired to take action in their local communities. A special guest at the video-conference event was Happy, the diamondback terrapin, on loan from the Terrapin Institute.\nThe DC students were very engaged with their virtual class-mates in Copenhagen and excited to be on a panel by asking thought provoking questions. They discussed similarities between the United States and Denmark, and discussed important ways that other 5th graders can help reduce their carbon footprint.\nRead more about the event in today’s Washington Post story here.\n Tags:\n Climate Change\n Copenhagen\n Denmark\n FS\n GreenSchools!\n NOAA\n schools",

Air National Guard photo: Tech. Sgt. Matt Hecht\nA tune John Fogarty wrote in echoes among veterans who spent time in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Lyrics reference a calm before a storm that’s “been comin’ for some time.” For many the turbulence continued long after departing Southeast Asia. Public sentiment roiled in a backlash of anti-war marches and protests when they returned. “Welcome Home” was rare and delivered in hushed tone—mostly from those with personal insight of where they had been.\nIt took a toll on a generation of some nine million members of our armed forces who served during a 20 year period from -. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, approximately 7.2 million are living today. Healing wounds seen and unseen, suffered in spite of their burden, has been an unending effort across government agencies and the nation.\nSince then veterans’ organizations, public and private partnerships have made strides in mending damage. Iconic tributes like the Vietnam Memorial and annual Rolling Thunder motorcycle rally in Washington, D.C. provide some comfort for a generation that lost 58,220 men and women. Meanwhile, the search continues for 1,600 service members throughout Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam who remain unaccounted.\nThe war has a complicated legacy that casts long shadows. Fifty years ago, Americans witnessed explicit images in photographs and television. Places like Khe Sanh, Hue, Tet, and My Lai summon indelible memories among those who survived, then faced the challenges of returning home. Soothing their injuries, both moral and physical, is ongoing. More recently the President signed the Vietnam War Veterans Recognition Act designating March 29 of each year as National Vietnam War Veterans Day.\nThe 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War became official following passage of the National Defense Authorization Act in . By presidential proclamation in , the commemoration extends through Veterans Day . The tribute makes no distinction among veterans who served in-country, in-theater, or were stationed elsewhere during those two decades. All answered a call to duty.\nToday gives everyone a chance to recognize Vietnam Veterans for their service and sacrifice during one of the longest conflicts in our country’s history.\nAs Americans unite to thank them, USDA is grateful to include more than 10,000 former service members in its ranks. The Department is especially proud of the contributions of this and every generation of veterans and their families.\nVeterans strengthen America’s rural economy. USDA continues to stand alongside them with services like mentorship, loan programs, funding for training and technical assistance, and advice about employment, education, and entrepreneurship.\nIt's been coming for some time.\n Category/Topic:\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n Agricultural Marketing Service\n AMS\n veterans\n Vietnam\n Vietnam War",

As you prepare to welcome a large gathering of family and friends, keep these core food safety practices in mind:\n Clean—Wash hands and surfaces often. Hands should be washed for 20 seconds with clean water and soap. If no running water is available, use hand sanitizer or moist towelettes that contain at least 60 percent alcohol.\n Separate—Separate raw meats from other foods to avoid cross-contamination of harmful bacteria. Use separate cutting boards when preparing raw meat and poultry and other foods that are ready to eat, and use different utensils and platters when placing raw foods on the grill or smoker and taking cooked foods off.\n Cook—Cook food to the safe minimum internal temperature as measured with a food thermometer. Burgers and other thin foods, such as sausages and boneless chicken thighs, should have the thermometer inserted through the side and into the center to get the most accurate thermometer reading.\n Chill—Refrigerate food promptly within two hours (or one hour if the temperature is over 90 F). Keep hot foods hot above 140 F and cold foods cold below 40 F to avoid the Danger Zone. Hot foods like burgers, hot dogs, and chicken can be kept hot by placing them on a grill on low, in heated chafing dishes, or in a slow cooker, and cold foods like deviled eggs, salads, and guacamole can be nestled in a bed of ice.\nFor more information about food safety, call the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline , email MPHotline@usda.gov, or chat live at ask.usda.gov from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday to reach a food safety specialist in English or Spanish.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n Tags:\n Food Safety and Inspection Service\n FSIS\n Food Safety\n Fourth of July\n Meat and Poultry Hotline\n You May Also Like\n USDA Process Verified Program: Transparency from Farm to Market\n Pack It Safe, Pack It Smart: Back-to-School Lunchbox Packing Essentials\n Food Safety: Prepare for the Unexpected",

(click to enlarge image)\nCross posted from the Huffington Post:\nLiving in a rural community shouldn't have to come with a hefty price tag for healthcare. On this National Rural Health Day, we celebrate the fact that thanks to the Affordable Care Act, it no longer has to.\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) is already making a difference in the lives of millions of rural Americans. Prior to the ACA, many rural families had a hard time finding affordable insurance coverage, paying an average of nearly half of their costs out of their own pockets. Many didn't have access to affordable health insurance through an employer because they were self-employed as farmers, ranchers or rural business owners and entrepreneurs. While those folks take calculated business risks every day, their health should not be one of them.\nToday, they can choose from a variety of affordable insurance plans and many will qualify for financial assistance to help them pay for coverage. During the last open enrollment period, which ran through March of , nearly seven out of ten people across the country found coverage for less than a $100 a month. The ACA also forbids insurance companies from discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions and covers preventive care. This is especially beneficial for rural Americans who, on average, suffer from higher rates of chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure than those living in urban areas. The ACA also includes a special rule that requires insurance companies to publically justify premium increases of more than ten percent--which means no more expensive surprises for rural families from year to year.\nThe Administration has also taken steps to address the underlying challenges to staying healthy in rural America. It has more than doubled the size of the National Health Service Corps, which offers scholarships and loan repayment to health practitioners in return for practicing in rural communities and other underserved areas. More than 3,500 Corps members now serve in rural areas, and an average of 86 percent of them will remain in their communities even after completing their service. These investments help keep a steady stream of young, motivated doctors and nurses in rural America. That's a good thing because while one in five Americans lives in a rural community, just ten percent of doctors practice there.\nThe ACA also invests significantly in expanding services at community health centers, where 7.5 million rural Americans get access to primary and preventive care. That comes on top of the more than $3 billion USDA has invested since to strengthen health infrastructure in rural areas, building rural hospitals and health clinics and expanding access to health care in remote rural areas through telemedicine. Today, we announced an additional $10 million in grants to improve access to health care in rural America.\nFor many rural Americans, this is the first time in recent memory that they've been able to afford health insurance and get comprehensive, regular healthcare.\nTake Naomi Rosan, a farmer in rural Georgia, for example. Naomi has suffered from rheumatoid arthritis since high school and hasn't been able to afford health insurance for many years. Naomi desperately needed surgery to improve her mobility, but couldn't afford it without health insurance--until the ACA. For the first time in years, Naomi is able to climb on her tractor and put in a day's work without pain, all thanks to the coverage she received through the ACA.\nThe Affordable Care Act gives hardworking rural families the financial security and peace of mind they deserve. It makes rural communities stronger and rural families healthier. Find out more at healthcare.gov or 1-800-318- before February 15, --because no one should go without healthcare because of where they live, or be forced to leave the communities they love to get the coverage they need.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Technology\n Tags:\n ACA\n Affordable Care Act\n Distance Learning and Telemedicine\n Healthcare\n National Rural Health Day\n NIFA\n Rural Development\n rural health\n Tom Vilsack",

Photo used with permission.\nWith declining budgets in the public school system, there has been a steady decrease in school fieldtrips in recent years. This plight further widens the disconnect between children and nature.\nTo help bridge the gap between the schoolroom and the natural world, the Shawnee National Forest will offer a new school program this year called Naturalist in the Classroom.  The program will be piloted to third- through fifth-grade students in Union and Alexander counties located in southern Illinois, and will focus on two themes – forest ecology and wetland ecology.\nForest Service employees will visit the classroom several times during the semester to cover topics, such as the role of water, the function of wetlands, forest functions, and tree identification, or subjects identified by the teacher.  Naturalist in the Classroom will culminate in a one-day field trip at a Forest Service site with Forest Service natural resource and conservation education professionals to show students how what they learned applies in the field and in national forest management.\nThere will be hands-on activities and games from various national curriculums, such as Project Learning Tree, Project Aquatic Wild and WOW! Wonders of Wetlands will be used.\nNaturalist in the Classroom aims to strengthen and expand the Shawnee’s environmental education program, get kids outdoors, and assist local educators in meeting Illinois’ learning standards.  Schools benefitting from the program are located in areas with high unemployment and have some of the highest underserved populations in southern Illinois.\n“We are really excited about implementing this new program in local schools,” said Allen Nicholas, forest supervisor at Shawnee National Forest.  “There are so many barriers to getting children in the outdoors these days.  We hope the Naturalist in the Classroom project will be the bridge in getting kids into the outdoors, as well as connecting them to the expertise of our natural resource professionals.”\nThe spring application deadline is Feb. 5; the fall application deadline is Sept. 5.\nThe Shawnee National Forest will offer a new school program this year called Naturalist in the Classroom.

At age 92, he’s going strong and ready to do more.\n“I was out on the tractor trying to locate a cow,” said Duncan, who farms 43 acres of his family’s land in Union, S.C.  It’s the same land he used to plow with mules before planting cotton, peanuts and corn.\n“Back then, we didn’t have any tractors,” said Duncan. “Now, that was hard with long hours.  But we farmed to survive.”\n Tanya Brown, Writer/Editor, Farm Service Agency\n Posted in\n Conservation\n Apr 01, \n Respond to this story",

The venue for the meeting between federal officials and tribal leaders was the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska Vocational Training and Resource Center.\nTribal representatives and other partners from the region used the session to discuss issues affecting their villages. Leaders from USDA Rural Development, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Farm Service Agency, the U.S. Forest Service, Small Business Administration, Housing and Urban Development, the Economic Development Administration (EDA), and Intertribal Agriculture Council were on hand to listen and participate in the dialogue.\nEdward Thomas, President of the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska, began the daylong session welcoming all visitors.  A healthy discussion ensued, with local economic development and subsistence as primary topics of conversation.   When asked about his impression regarding the meeting, President Thomas responded by saying, \"The meeting was really good.  It was great to see various agencies in attendance and not just USDA.  Tribal leaders really need to get involved in opportunities with USDA, specifically Rural Development, and start taking advantage of those programs.\"\nAmong the other items of discussion were: adequate and affordable housing; food production and availability; natural resource management, food inspection, and the cost of energy.  Also discussed in greater detail were programs surrounding community gardens, food production economic opportunities, and shellfish farming.\nMore Tribal Collaboration Meetings will be scheduled throughout the year.  On-going meeting information and meeting schedules can be followed at: \nU.S. Small Business Administration District Director, Karen Forsland leads a session on Business Development in Juneau.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Alaska\n Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes\n Economic Development Administration\n Intertribal Agriculture Council\n Rural Development\n SBA\n Tribal",

Imagine if everyone has access to the vital conditions for health and wellbeing: the factors that people depend on to reach their full potential. What does that future look like?\nOne way we’ll know that we’ve achieved this future is that everyone will experience nutrition security – meaning they have consistent and equitable access to healthy, safe, and affordable foods that promote optimal health and well-being – and diet-related illnesses will no longer be the leading cause of death in the United States, especially for people of color who are historically at greatest risk.\nThat was the focus of our discussions in late March at the second regional Come to the Table summit on nutrition security and healthcare at Trinity Health in Ypsilanti, Michigan, hosted by ProMedica and The Root Cause Coalition. Alonzo Lewis, president of Trinity Health Ann Arbor, set the tone by encouraging the 150 stakeholders in attendance to build on the momentum of the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health by strengthening the intersections between nutrition and healthcare.\nIn addition to panel discussions comprised of experts in various fields, there was a lively town hall which provided everyone an opportunity to add their voice and experience to the conversation on hunger as a health issue. All in the room acknowledged that as a country, we have work to do. But as USDA Secretary Vilsack said in his recorded remarks, “Together, there is no challenge we can’t overcome.”\nCreating solutions that are sustainable over time takes innovation, determination and collaboration – something The Farm at Trinity Health is very familiar with. After the summit, attendees visited The Farm, one of the nation’s oldest hospital-based farms. The Farm evolved from a discussion about food as medicine among health care professionals into the multi-faceted, regional program it is today. Access to produce is key to increasing the intake of fresh fruits and vegetables, which supports good health. In , The Farm donated 15,554 pounds of produce to 22,339 patients and healthcare workers via its Produce to Patients program. And, because access to healthy food is only the first step toward better health outcomes, The Farm also offers education programs field trips, summer camp, and cooking classes to help people learn to cook healthier foods.\n“The Farm is a great example of a program that connects thousands of people to the healing power of nutritious food,” said USDA Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services Deputy Under Secretary Stacy Dean while touring The Farm. “I am inspired by their model and look forward to hearing more about their impact on health outcomes in the years ahead.”\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Nutrition Security\n Tags:\n Food and Nutrition Service\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n Nutrition\n food insecurity\n Hunger\n Collaborative Action\n healthy food\n Equitable Systems\n You May Also Like\n SNAP-Ed Connects Culture, Land, and Food\n Healthier Foods, Healthier Minds\n National Women’s History Month: Celebrating FNS’ Unsung Heroines",

The event allowed USDA, a department  President Lincoln referred to as the People’s Department –– to reach hundreds of thousands of people, 140 characters at a time.  What really struck me was how many insightful questions came in about energy and USDA, and, in particular, one that was asked on our Facebook page shortly before the hour long chat.\nThis question got right at the heart of the ethanol energy balance issue. A report from USDA’s Office of the Chief Economist shows that today, with improved ethanol production techniques, for every unit of energy going into ethanol production over 2 units of energy comes out.  This demonstrates our domestic energy production is not stagnant – as our domestic oil and gas production hits record highs our domestic biofuels production is also making records and lowering gas prices.\nI’m so glad that the Secretary and I had the opportunity to sit down and have this virtual conversation with all of you. There is so much going on in domestic energy production and so much potential for growth that it is truly amazing – and we are doing it 140 characters at a time.\nTo find out more about USDA’s accomplishments in the energy sector, be sure to visit our Energy Results Document.

I learned about how the Land Stewardship Project has used USDA’s Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program to train new and beginning farmers in Minnesota and how TOCA is using the Farmers Market Promotion Program and the Small Socially-Disadvantaged Producer Grants Program to support local food security in the Tohono O’odham Nation in southern Arizona.  Haile Johnston of Common Market, a food hub, spoke about how their organization’s recent Community Food Project award will continue their work to use local food to increase healthy food access in Philadelphia’s low-income communities.\nStudents from Ames High School in Iowa joined the conversation to describe how their participation on the Lexicon of Sustainability’s Project Localize art project gave them a first-hand look at sustainable agriculture.  “Doing this project made me want to be a farmer,” said Elena Ingram, a senior at Ames High School. A Food, Farms and Job bill will provide renewed funding for many of the programs that help young farmers get their start.\nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Coordinator for Local and Regional Food Systems Elanor Starmer leads a live Google+ Hangout to discuss the importance of a comprehensive Food, Farm and Jobs Bill to local and regional food systems at USDA on Thursday, Nov. 21, .

NRCS photo.\nWe’ve all heard the old adage, “It’s not what you know but who you know.” For Matthew Roberts, the “who” was only a first step on a path that has led him to contribute more than 1,000 hours of volunteer service to the Wytheville, Virginia Service Center and his community.\nMatt’s career coach thought the Earth Team program would be a great fit for the Wytheville Community College student and referred him to the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Little did anyone know how good a fit that would turn out to be.\n Matt filled the void of a recently retired technician and made a remarkable impact on conservation implementation in the Wytheville office, essentially doubling office productivity.\n“Matt’s exceptional work ethic and qualifications enabled him to work alongside our staff as a peer,” said Rodney Williams NRCS district conservationist in Wytheville.\nWhile volunteering 40 hours or more a week during the summer, he assisted with surveying, inspected fencing and met with clients to discuss and implement conservation and environmental compliance plans.\nWorking with an NRCS soil scientist, Matt assisted in developing an extensive rotation grazing operation, which not only helped natural resources and the environment, but also improved the farming operations and productivity.\n“Few volunteers are capable of working at this level,” said Williams. “He really understands and respects the scope and mission of NRCS.”\nMatt hopes to one day become a perfect fit as one of NRCS’ conservationists.\nThe Earth Team volunteer program helps the agency meet conservation needs in communities. Volunteers enable NRCS to stretch available resources and help put additional conservation practices on the ground. Their efforts help improve land and wildlife habitat and contribute to cleaner water and air. Nationally, more than 25,000 volunteers donated 318,500 hours to the agency worth about $7.2 million last year.\nThis week, NRCS marks National Volunteer Week by recognizing the hard work of its thousands of volunteers, including Matthew Roberts.\nMatt was one of four people selected for the Earth Team Individual Award. Other award-winning individuals include:\nLody Black – A senior in high school, Lody volunteered 262 hours at the Clay Center Service Center in Kansas. Through his assistance, the office was better able to provide timely assistance to farmers and ranchers.\nAmanda Curry – A student at Florida State University, Amanda volunteered 354 hours at the Frenchtown Service Center in New Jersey helping to evaluate private lands for wildlife habitat, wetland restoration, stream enhancement and agronomic conservation practices.\nRicky Jones – A local community college student, Ricky volunteered nearly 200 hours at the Sonora Soil Survey Office in California. His work was an essential component of initial mapping in the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park soil survey.\nGet involved with the Earth Team volunteer program.\nRicky Jones helped the soil survey team with field sampling missions.

Through this program, utilities are paying farmers to implement conservation practices that reduce nutrient runoff into local waterways.\nThe Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), part of USDA, has been a Federal leader in supporting the development of Environmental Markets, including the groundbreaking Ohio River Basin trading program. To help our stakeholders and the public understand our interest and role in environmental markets, I’m excited to announce that today we are launching a series of new web pages dedicated to NRCS’s work in supporting the development of environmental markets.\nEnvironmental markets, broadly defined, are mechanisms that give value to and allow for the purchase and selling of ecosystem services. NRCS views environmental markets as another tool to get conservation on the ground. While NRCS has substantial funding to dedicate to private lands conservation, our funding will never be enough to address the natural resource needs of the Nation’s expansive private lands. Environmental markets complement NRCS’s work by bringing private and other non-Federal investments to private lands conservation.\nYou can read about our many environmental markets projects and success stories on the new Environmental Markets web page. The page also includes a new Environmental Markets video explaining NRCS’s role and highlighting some of our partners. There is also a link to our Environmental Markets Toolkit, which includes ecosystem service quantification tools such as COMET-Farm. Visit often as the page will be updated frequently with news, tool refinements, and success stories.\nInterest in environmental markets is growing throughout the Nation. California has a carbon cap-and-trade system. There are now wildlife habitat banks for Greater Sage-grouse and Lesser Prairie-chicken. Water quality trading markets continue to mature. All of these efforts have the potential to benefit farmers, ranchers and private forest landowners as they work to produce food and fiber and conserve their natural resources. The launch today of our Environmental Markets web page announces to the public and our stakeholders NRCS’s intent to continue our leadership in this area.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n California\n Conservation\n environmental markets\n Farmers\n Landowners\n NRCS\n Ohio\n Ohio River\n Ranchers\n water quality",

Photo: USDA-NRCS\nClean water is a priority for all of us. When farmers manage nutrients, they are also helping to minimize the runoff of nutrients into local streams and rivers.\nBottom Line: For Improved Water Quality, Nutrients Matter.\nFor Improved Water Quality, Nutrients Matter infographic (Click to enlarge)\nFarmers rely on two major nutrients in fertilizer — nitrogen and phosphorus — to help crops grow. When excess fertilizer leaves the field and enters local waterways in surface water runoff, those nutrients cause algae in the water to bloom much faster than it would under normal conditions. The algae eventually breaks down, and the bacteria involved in decomposition deplete oxygen in the water to unhealthily low levels. Ultimately, fish and other aquatic organisms often die as a result of this oxygen depletion. This process is called eutrophication.\nVoluntary Conservation is Part of the Solution.\nWorking with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), farmers apply a system of conservation strategies to keep valuable fertilizer on their land and out of nearby waterways. Filter strips move row crop operations away from streams and function as collection centers for nutrient runoff. Cover crops reduce soil erosion and hold nutrients in place. No-till practices also reduce soil erosion and improve field-level water infiltration capacity.\nNRCS works with farmers to apply conservation practices to address a number of resource concerns, including water quality. Photo: USDA-NRCS, Tim McCabe\nAccording to David Brandt — a corn, wheat, and soybeans producer in Carroll, Ohio — those last two practices make all the difference.\n“Innovative farmers are working to improve air and water quality across the country,” says Brandt, “and what we’re doing with cover cropping and no-till is really working.”\nBrandt has been using no-till practices since and cover cropping since . “If every farmer in the United States cover cropped, we’d see even more nutrients held in-field. That really matters when we’re thinking about water quality. When a raindrop falls, we need to be able to control it.”\nBrandt’s message is clear: Conservation practices are good for his land, the environment around him, and his bottom line. “We need to educate as many people as we can, farmers and non-farmers alike. The work we do here really makes a difference, and that’s something to be proud of.”\nOur Numbers Tell the Story.\nApproximately ates are used for cultivated crop production. That’s almost three areas the size of California, managed by farmers and landowners with production goals similar to David Brandt’s.\nNationwide, conservation practices on croplands play a critical role in improved water quality. Modeling efforts show that national cropland conservation practices implemented from to decrease edge-of-field nitrogen losses by 3.8 billion pounds per year and edge-of-field phosphorus losses by 584 million pounds per year relative to if no conservation practices were in use.\nIf you were to put those nutrients on a train, you’d have enough nitrogen and phosphorus to fill nearly 21,000 train cars stretching 237 miles – a distance further than Washington, DC to New York City - per year.1\nIn terms of fertilizer, nitrogen savings alone account for about 927 million dollars’ worth of anhydrous ammonia held in-field annually.2\nMr. Brandt is unsurprised by these findings, citing less than 100 pounds of soil lost per acre from his fields each year. “We need to get this information out there,” he says. “We need to show the numbers to tell the story.”\nConservation practices help to minimize erosion, hold valuable nutrients in-field, and improve soil health. Photo: USDA-NRCS\nWe Expect a Future of Improvements.\nEvery day, new producers are stepping up to work hand-in-hand with NRCS to implement systems that improve water quality and reduce input costs by trapping and controlling in-field nutrients.\nMany producers have joined their friends and neighbors in landscape-scale efforts to minimize agricultural impacts and improve water quality throughout entire watersheds. By adopting a systems approach to conservation across the landscape, these targeted efforts have resulted in an ever-growing list of streams restored in working agricultural land.\nWe already have several success stories.\nIn the Chesapeake Bay region, conservation practices used by farmers in reduce the total nitrogen and phosphorus delivered from crop fields to rivers and streams by 44 percent and 75 percent, respectively. Cropland conservation efforts in place across the Western Lake Erie basin in reduce the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen entering Lake Erie by 41 and 17 percent relative to conditions without these efforts.\nEvery pound of nutrients held in-field is a pound that cannot enter local waterways. It is also a pound that producers will not need to replace.\nTo view the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) studies and results in a multimedia format, visit the CEAP Story Maps. Visit the NRCS website to learn more about voluntary conservation programs for your working lands.\n1 Assumes that the freight capacity of one train car is 210,000 pounds and the length of one train car is 60 feet.\n2 Assumes the use of anhydrous ammonia fertilizer that is 82 percent nitrogen and priced at $400 per ton.\nCover crops like Austrian snow peas, vetch, small grain and clover hold sediment and nutrients in-field and out of nearby waterways.

The attractants include plant odors and pheromones, which are naturally occurring chemicals created and used by insects to communicate with each other.  These attractants are used to lure beetles to traps that are hung on trees that the beetle will attack.  Traps can aid in early detection of insects in areas where survey staff may not be working. When the traps are checked by staff members and a beetle is found, nearby trees may be surveyed to determine if they are infested. This year, the traps will be placed in the spring and early summer in strategic locations in all three ALB-affected states: New York, Massachusetts, and Ohio.  APHIS is also working with the U.S. Forest Service and Penn State University on their research with similar ALB traps.\n Rhonda Santos, APHIS Asian Longhorned Beetle Eradication Program\n Posted in\n Animals\n Plants\n Apr 23, \n 2 Responses",

        "content": "USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service in\n Health and Safety\n Nov 15, \nHere’s an important Thanksgiving food safety tip that will surprise many: USDA doesn’t recommend stuffing a whole turkey. The practice increases the risk of cross-contamination and takes the turkey longer to cook. Cook stuffing separately instead.\nBut if you decide to stuff your turkey, we recommend the following:\n Don’t stuff a turkey the night before cooking it. Bacteria can multiply in the stuffing and cause foodborne illness when a stuffed bird is refrigerated.\n The wet and dry ingredients for the stuffing should be prepared separately and refrigerated until ready to use. Mixing dry and wet ingredients produces an environment that bacteria may thrive in hours before cooking.\n Fully cook raw meat, poultry, or seafood ingredients before adding to stuffing.\n Combine the ingredients and place them in your bird immediately before cooking. Don’t stuff whole poultry with cooked stuffing.\n In addition to the turkey, the stuffing’s center needs to reach 165 F.\nHere are timetables for turkey roasting based on a 325 F oven temperature:\nUnstuffed\n8 to 12 pounds — 2¾ to 3 hours\n12 to 14 pounds — 3 to 3¾ hours\n14 to 18 pounds — 3¾ to 4¼ hours\n18 to 20 pounds — 4¼ to 4½ hours\n20 to 24 pounds — 4½ to 5 hours\nStuffed\n8 to 12 pounds — 3 to 3½ hours\n12 to 14 pounds — 3½ to 4 hours\n14 to 18 pounds — 4 to 4¼ hours\n18 to 20 pounds — 4¼ to 4¾ hours\n20 to 24 pounds — 4¾ to 5¼ hours\nFor more Thanksgiving tips, check out our fact sheet. Read our latest USDA study on safe food handling.\nFor more information, contact the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline to talk to a food safety specialist or chat live at ask.usda.gov from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.

When he returned to the United States, he attended Florida International University (FIU) to receive his undergraduate and graduate degrees in social work.\nAs an FIU student, he learned about the FIU Veterans and Small Farmers Outreach Program (VeSFO). The intent of this program, funded by USDA, is to provide veterans, socially disadvantaged and new farmers in South Florida with necessary technical information, farm entrepreneurial skills and access to government assistance programs they need to start and sustain viable farm operations.\n“I did all the different types of therapy you can do as a veteran,” Jarret said. “I tried them all but didn’t get the same connection as I get when I work with the land. I can live a happy and healthy life.” \nJarret has been the owner and operator of Cool Runnings Organic Farms in Homestead, Florida, since . He currently raises goats, poultry and rabbits. He also grows a variety of vegetables and tropical fruits such as longans, starfruit and jackfruit.\n“I grew up on my grandfather’s farm in Jamaica. He had 140 acres of sugarcane and some animals as well,” said Jarret. He moved to the United States when he was 12 years old.\nTo further enhance his operation, he participates in the FSA Microloan program, which finances the needs of small, beginning farmer, niche and non-traditional farm operations, such as truck farms and farms participating in direct marketing and sales, such as farmers markets.\nProducts from Cool Runnings Organic Farms can be found at the Pembroke Pines Farmers Market through Whole Foods, Doral Farmers Market and Wynwood Farmers Market. He sells his produce to other vendors who sell his produce at other South Florida farmers markets. In addition to farmers markets, he sells his products to restaurants and hotels.\nThis week, USDA is joining farmers, like Jarret, in celebrating National Farmers Market Week. Farmers markets give consumers access to locally grown and farm-fresh products, while giving farmers the platform to grow and connect with their customer base.\n“As a consumer and a farmer, I think it’s important to know where your food is coming from,” said Jarret. “Not only do I get to feel satisfaction from the fruits of my labor, but I’ve also gained so many contacts by going to markets.”\nJarret’s business is community oriented. He collaborates with FIU’s Agroecology Program to help educate students.\n“I have students each semester needing to meet community involvement requirements,” he said. “They get a first-hand knowledge of what farming is like and the difficulties of it. Having that knowledge, they can go and create tools to assist farmers.”\nAside from students, he works with veterans to teach them how to farm, teaches community volunteers about agriculture and also works with a faith-based halfway house to help people find a life purpose.\nCelebrate National Farmers Market Week by visiting your local farmers market and supporting the farmers who supply fresh produce and products to your community. Use the National Farmers Market Directory to find a market near you:  To date, there are nearly 8,700 markets in the USDA Farmers Market Directory.\n Category/Topic:\n Farming\n Tags:\n Farm Service Agency\n veterans\n farming\n veteran farmers\n Florida\n National Farmers Market Week\n Farmers\n microloans\n Farmers Markets",

KORUS will take effect on March 15, .\nThe Foreign Agricultural Service recommends that U.S. agricultural exporters and those interested in expanding sales to international markets visit the page, called What U.S. Exporters Need to Know about the KORUS Agreement, to learn about the agreement, understand new tariff schedules, and gain valuable information about the fifth-largest market for U.S. farm products.\nInformation available on the Web page includes a list of South Korea’s top-imported commodities, a detailed view of the population, and analysis of the United States’ trade competitors. Exporters can also download the latest import statistics, which are updated monthly, to accurately evaluate market trends. ATO Seoul routinely updates to showcase market trends and changes and to notify exporters in advance of the competition.\nOnce KORUS is fully implemented, American agriculture will gain improved access to South Korea’s $1 trillion economy and 49 million consumers. KORUS benefits nearly every sector of U.S. agriculture—including beef, poultry, pork, wheat, corn, soybeans, cotton, and many other commodities. More than half of U.S. agricultural products will gain immediate, duty-free access to the South Korean market as soon as the agreement is implemented.\nThe new trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama signed by President Obama in October will support tens of thousands of American jobs and open new opportunities for American businesses. When implemented, these three agreements will increase farm exports by an additional $2.3 billion—supporting nearly 20,000 American jobs and delivering higher incomes for farmers and ranchers, more opportunities for small businesses owners, and jobs for folks who package, ship, and market agricultural products.\nU.S. agricultural products are booming in popularity worldwide. Farm exports in fiscal year reached a record high of $137.4 billion – exceeding the past record by $22.5 billion – and supported 1.15 million U.S. jobs.

Recent updates have made the directories easier to use on the go, on your phone or computer. We’ve also launched a new directory for agritourism. As the platform continues to grow, here are a few tips on how to navigate this resource. We especially hope you’ll use it during National Farmers Market Week, when supporting local markets can be a few clicks away.\n Use it on the go. This website is convenient to use on a phone or tablet. The new technology behind USDA’s Local Food Directories gives you seamless access on your phone and pulls map locations so that you can navigate to a location with a single click. Take advantage of this feature when you are out with friends and need to convince them that a local market is closer than they think!\n Know what to search for. Looking for “apples” or “bread” can guide you to several farmers markets and CSAs that include the item you need. You can also search terms like “no pesticides,” “women-owned,” or “minority-owned” to find businesses that qualify under these definitions. By selecting one of the individual directories and slowly zooming out on the map, you can reveal all locations available under that directory. Zooming out to the full country shows nationwide results.\n Report new markets. If you frequent a neighborhood market or CSA that is not listed on the webpage, ask your market manager if they would be interested in participating. With over 3,800 listings, the directory continues to grow. With your help, future listings can be more extensive. If interested, they can email directoryupdates@usda.gov to get information on adding their market to the directory!\n Category/Topic:\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n Agricultural Marketing Service\n AMS\n USDA Local Food Directories\n Local Food Directories\n National Farmers Market Week\n You May Also Like\n USDA Process Verified Program: Transparency from Farm to Market\n New Resource Toolkit Increases Consumer Understanding of the USDA Organic Label\n Local Agriculture Market Program Grant Recipient Helps Small Farms and Their Community Prosper",

        "content": "Office of Communications in\n USDA Results\n Energy\n Sep 28, \n Seattle-Tacoma International Airport served as a dramatic backdrop today for an announcement by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack that  delivers $136 million in research and development grants to public and  private sector partners in 22 states. In short, the grants look to make energy for autos and marine and jet crafts from plants. By unlocking that potential—known as bioenergy—Vilsack said a “next-generation of biofuels” would create new economies in rural areas across the United States. Eventually, these regional, renewable energy markets will generate sustainable jobs and decrease America’s dependence on foreign oil. And that future, said Vilsack, is closer than we think.\n“This is an opportunity to take woody biomass from our forests to create fuel for jets to fly anywhere in the world,” said Vilsack. “This is a great day for our country. We’re building something new, creating jobs everywhere in the country.”\nOutside, under a shimmering morning sun, planes taxied in neat rows up and down and across the airfield. Jets climbed sharply into the sky and glided smoothly down to the Sea-Tac runway. The sheer power needed to propel an aircraft into flight is staggering, but researchers from universities in Washington, Iowa, Louisiana, Tennessee and elsewhere believe they have cracked the code to harness that energy. Inside the airport, gathered with Vilsack, leaders from academia, government and businesses were excited to get this project started, which is estimated to help create 23,000 jobs across the Northwest.\nEnergy from plant materials may hold only vague meaning for many Americans. But biofuels, when mixed with the gas that powers our cars and trucks, saved drivers almost 90 cents per gallon at the pump last year and supported hundreds of thousands of American jobs.  Moving forward, new sources of renewable energy could be game-changers: reducing the influence that foreign nations have in setting our fuel prices, and creating thousands of good-paying new jobs, particularly in our rural communities.\nAmericans know that reducing our dependence on foreign oil will mean greater security for our economy and our nation.  But to squeeze the available energy from trees, tall grasses and slash—or forest waste—and turn it into usable fuel requires the efforts of our brightest scientists, our best companies, and strategic investments in research.\nAt USDA, we want to help regions identify if they are candidates to benefit from the bioenergy economy given their capacity to grow the plant materials needed and appropriate regional infrastructure to use it. When local communities move forward with projects to produce biofuels, it means jobs and wealth for the region. Construction workers must build the bioenergy facilities. Trained employees will operate them. And local farmers or forest-owners will be paid for the feedstocks needed to produce the fuel.\nThat’s what Vilsack means when he says USDA is helping to establish “regional energy markets”—he means small engines of growth dotting the rural landscape across the country.\nWhen President Obama outlined his vision for a new energy future for the nation, he challenged Americans to cut our imports of foreign oil by one third by . He understands, as does Vilsack, there is no sense in paying $300 billion a year for imported oil. We should be spending more of those hard-earned dollars right here at home, creating jobs in the process. It is an opportunity we can’t afford to miss.\n Category/Topic:\n USDA Results\n Energy\n Tags:\n bioenergy\n biofuels\n Energy\n President Obama\n Seattle\n Tom Vilsack\n Washington",

        "content": "Acting Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service in\n Conservation\n Research and Science\n Sep 21, \n When it comes to expanding market share, increasing revenue and getting the word out about a great product or commodity, checkoff programs prove that there’s strength in numbers. Officially called research and promotion programs, checkoff programs give agricultural producers, importers and other stakeholders in the marketing chain the power to maximize resources while managing risk.\nThe strategy for increasing or expanding commodity markets takes more cooperation within the industry than competition between individual farms and businesses.  Consumers may not know exactly which farm grows or raises their fruit, beef, cotton or lumber, but they will decide what to buy based on knowledge, quality and availability.\nThe consumer’s perspective that there is a general uniformity to some commodities serves as the catalyst for many individual farms and businesses to collaborate on a comprehensive, industry-wide strategy to expand markets.  Promoting a commodity as a whole instead of by individual businesses means everyone in the industry benefits through increased sales, consumer awareness and higher overall demand.\nCheckoff programs help make that happen.  Completely funded and operated by industry stakeholders, the checkoff programs allow commodity groups to pool resources for advertising campaigns, market research, new product development and consumer education.  They empower the industry chain to establish their own goals and decide for themselves how to best develop new markets and strengthen current markets for specific commodities.  For every $1 spent in a research and promotion program the return on investment can range as high as $18.\nUSDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) oversees the research and promotion programs, which are led by boards of small and large producers, importers and other commodity stakeholders.  Board members, nominated by the industry and appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, bring a wealth of diverse perspectives and backgrounds to the programs.  Their experience with a variety of operation sizes, production methods, distribution options, and marketing strategies all contribute to the common goal of promoting their commodity to more consumers.\nFor example, the dairy industry’s “Got Milk?” campaign, originally developed by the California Milk Processor Board (CMPB), has spawned many humorous spinoffs in the 16 years since its launch. The campaign also transcended its original advertising medium, with over 75 products, including toys, posters and clothing carrying its message. It reinforced “milk” as a household name.\nResearch and promotion programs also identify new uses and strategically tap into new markets. Cotton Incorporated began their Cotton. From Blue to Green® program in as part of its work for the Cotton Board.  They partnered with an insulation manufacturer to transform used jeans into UltraTouch ™ Denim Insulation.  Not only does this program promote the commodity, it also forges community ties and promotes a less traditional use of their product.  They even sponsor grants for community buildings and partner with organizations like Habitat for Humanity.\nCheckoff programs also benefit from unified messaging and cohesive campaigns. Before the National Mango Board was formed, producers and growers competed against each other with varied success.  Now members from around the world share institutional knowledge and ideas with a clear focus and purpose.  By educating consumers on the nutritional value of mangos and using guest chefs to inspire new recipes, producers and importers continue to see market growth.  Consumers now eat nearly six pounds of mangos per person annually compared to just two pounds in when the board first launched.\nThere are currently 19 checkoff programs, representing a wide variety of commodities. From the Fabric of Our Lives® (cotton) to the incredible edible egg™, research and promotion programs have expanded and created identities for things we use every day, increasing consumer awareness and expanding markets for many U.S. commodities.\nVisit the AMS checkoff site for a list of research and promotion boards administered by AMS at the USDA.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n AMS\n Cotton Board\n Industry Insight\n National Mango Board\n research and promotion programs",

In Texas, nearly 3,000 schools participate in farm to school activities. Some of these schools work with Texas A&M AgriLife Extension’s Learn, Grow, Eat, and Go program. Jeff Raska, a school garden specialist with the AgriLife Extension, works with numerous programs and offers practical advice to schools establishing a school garden. Here, he discusses the importance of a strong school garden committee. \nBy Jeff Raska, Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Dallas County Texas\nA school vegetable garden can be a wonderful outdoor classroom for studying natural science. Having worked with school gardens on and off for more than 25 years, I have seen many great school garden programs bloom, and then fade as time passes and school priorities change. For the last seven years, I’ve had the privilege of working with school gardens as a 4-H Club program assistant for Dallas County and have had the benefit of seeing a wide range of needs and challenges that schools face when trying to start a garden. However, the most successful programs have a few important things in place.\nOne of the first common elements is a dedicated garden committee. The committee can include teachers, parents, community members or school support staff. It’s important to have certain duties assigned to each member. For example, there needs to be a point person who reaches out for help when needed and maintains accountability. This is important because if the garden is funded by outside resources, such as grants or corporate sponsors, certain benchmarks must be met. I have honestly tried to talk some schools out of pursuing a school garden because they didn’t have a committee structure in place. The committee is important for success.\nThe committee needs to determine why they want to invest time and resources into a school garden program, and how it will benefit the students.  The committee should write a list of goals they want to accomplish and the benefits the school garden will bring. Then, they need to balance those benefits with the costs involved such as the startup and yearly maintenance fees; the time it will take out of someone’s daily school duties; the team it will require to schedule and carry out a garden program; and how they will incorporate the garden into the school’s lesson plans.  The committee can be responsible for start-up funding and long-term maintenance costs, as well as material procurement and maintenance schedules.\nThe committee should research and recommend a school garden curriculum that best fits the schools lesson plans and goals. I recommend the Learn Grow Eat Go Curriculum developed by the Texas A&M AgriLife Junior Master Gardener team through a USDA research grant.  It not only incorporates the horticultural aspects, but also teaches nutrition, cooking and a classroom exercise plan for a complete healthy living model. I incorporate a nutrition element in all school programs I teach (being primarily Title 1 schools) because nutrition education is important in low-income communities.\nThe people on the committee will change as the years pass (kids and parents move up, teachers move schools, principals change) so a good foundation committee needs to be established and put in place to keep the garden blooming for years to come. I never use the word sustainable in horticultural systems, as no natural eco system just sustains itself.  In the same way that an ecosystem evolves to climatic changes, understand that school garden programs must also plan to evolve to be able to enjoy long-term success.\nStudents show Administrator Rowe a cucumber proudly harvested from their garden. Members of the school staff, the Texas AgriLife Extension and parent volunteers all helped build and maintain the garden.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n 4 H Club\n Farm to School\n gardens\n Nutrition Education\n School Gardens\n Texas\n Texas A&M University",

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nThis year’s weather has presented some challenges for Florida’s citrus growers. In December, sub-freezing temperatures hit the citrus-growing region in the state, threatening this year’s citrus crops, which account for more than half of all citrus production in the United States.\nTo measure the cold weather’s effect on citrus crops in Florida, on Jan. 10-11 USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) representatives visited 240 orange groves and 90 grapefruit groves across Florida’s citrus producing region. These crews went to randomly selected trees to cut and score fruit to determine the extent of freeze damage. In each selected grove, two pieces of fruit were selected from each of four trees.\nEstablishing the extent of the freeze damage a sequence of steps, which followed the Federal-State Inspection Service standards. To determine the damage severity, our crew members cut off the outer quarter inch of the fruit to look for damage, then cut off the next quarter inch, and finally, cut the fruit at the center.\nNASS found evidence of freeze damage in about 28 percent of the early season and midseason oranges and 13 percent of the late season varieties. For early and midseason oranges, 12 percent had damage at the center cut (the most serious damage). Just over two percent of the late season oranges had damage at the center cut. For grapefruit, only three percent of the tested fruit were damaged. Less than one percent of the grapefruit had center cut damage.\nThe full set of the results were recently released in a Florida citrus report and can be found online.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n citrus\n Florida\n Florida citrus report\n freeze damage\n NASS\n Science Tuesday",

These \"Implementation Strategies\" will encourage collaboration at the local level to identify the region's comparative advantages and assets, and plan investments to expand the area's appeal to manufacturers. In addition, these grants can be used to help communities prepare for the second phase of this initiative, IMCP \"Challenge\" grants.Phase Two of the \"Investing in Manufacturing Communities\" Partnership: President Obama's fiscal year budget includes funds for the Department of Commerce to award five to six IMCP \"Challenge\" grants, expected to be up to $25 million each. These funds are intended to be supplemented by coordinated investments from several other federal departments and agencies. The challenge will reward communities for having the best long-term strategies for attracting private investment and increasing exports, and should combine many of the elements companies seek when they are deciding where to locate or expand, such as: specialized research centers at local universities; business incubators focused on targeted technology sectors; community college programs to train workers in targeted industries; public works projects to upgrade infrastructure or enhance energy efficiency; viable export promotion plans; well-integrated supply chains; and an engaged community of local government, education, workforce, and business leaders.Deputy Secretary Blank unveiled the \"Investing in Manufacturing Communities\" Partnership on April 17, at the new, 200,000-square foot Able Engineering facility in Mesa, Arizona, a community that has leveraged the resources of the public sector, private firms and educational institutions to achieve a successful model of economic development.\"This first round of Implementation Strategy grants will lay the foundation for what the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership seeks to accomplish: encouraging strategic planning at the local level that will maximize a region's ability to attract investment,\" said Deputy Secretary Blank. \"Overall, this new partnership is designed to improve the way we use federal resources for economic development initiatives, by challenging communities to coordinate their development efforts around workforce training, infrastructure, and innovation to create the best possible environment for investment. This initiative is an important part of the Obama administration's commitment to revitalizing American manufacturing, strengthening our economy, and creating good-paying jobs.\"\"Manufacturing continues to be a tremendous job-creator across our nation–including in rural America,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. \"Today, more and more companies are manufacturing incredible new products across rural America, including more than 25,000 'biobased' products–things we use every day that are created from homegrown materials. By making investments today that create new opportunity for manufacturers, we're sowing the seeds for well-paying sustainable jobs tomorrow.\"\"The United States has some of the world's most innovative small manufacturers and entrepreneurs, and the 'Investing in Manufacturing Communities' partnership is a key step forward in building America's manufacturing capacity across the board,\" said SBA Administrator Karen Mills. \"SBA is proud to be involved in this initiative as it will help communities strengthen and increase opportunities for small businesses in our manufacturing supply chains, which will help them do what they do best, grow and create jobs.\"\"Communities that once housed large manufacturing sites already have significant advantages–from infrastructure access to skilled workforces - which can be applied to new and advanced manufacturing opportunities,\" said EPA Acting Administrator Bob Perciasepe. \"EPA's Brownfield Area Wide Planning grant program enables us to use the economic development expertise and resources throughout the Obama administration to assist local communities in transforming these outdated sites into prosperous manufacturing centers. This program, in addition to other coordinated federal technical assistance programs like E3, will help grow manufacturing and strengthen communities across the country.\"To apply for Fiscal Year Implementation Strategy grants, please visit: more information on the entire IMCP, please visit is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

Volunteers will be working in rural Panama and meeting with local communities to raise awareness about as well as report suspected cases of New World screwworm, one of the most costly and economically significant pests of livestock in South America.\nThe New World screwworm is a parasite of warm-blooded animals, including humans. Female screwworms are attracted to and lay their eggs in exposed flesh wounds.  After eggs hatch, larvae burrow and feed on flesh, causing severe tissue damage and may even be lethal to the host. The screwworm was eradicated from the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Curacao and, finally, all of Central America in using the Sterile Insect Technique in which sterile male flies are released in massive numbers to mate with wild female populations. The mated female flies then lay non-viable eggs, leading to a decrease and subsequent eradication of screwworm populations. To prevent the screwworm from spreading north of South America, The Commission is maintaining a barrier at the Darien Gap between Panama and Colombia, by utilizing both preventive release of sterile flies and field surveillance.\nEffective surveillance is crucial to maintaining the screwworm barrier. Beyond Peace Corps Volunteers, U.S. Panama Commission for Eradication of Screwworm relies on field staff and an estimated 552 honorary volunteer inspectors, composed of farmers and private veterinarians to stay on the lookout for suspected cases of screwworm.  There is a constant threat of screwworm reintroduction beyond the Darien Gap from Columbia, where the pest is still present and the migration of people, domesticated animals, and cattle pose a risk. Because most of the Darien Gap and rural areas in Eastern Panama are not easily accessible, APHIS enlisted Peace Corps volunteers, who are already trained and skilled at working with rural communities, to assist with the screwworm surveillance program and reach out to local communities and their officials to explain the risk this pest poses to both people and livestock.\n“Not only are we creating opportunities for Peace Corps Volunteers who have an interest in agricultural work, it’s an opportunity for APHIS to enhance our screwworm surveillance,” said Deputy Administrator of International Services, Beverly Simmons, who oversees all international action programs, including screwworm.\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Tags:\n action programs\n APHIS\n eradication\n Panama\n Peace Corps\n screwworm",

Loren Crank Jr. and Barry Hamilton with NRCS worked with Bill Todachennie, the chapter’s vice president, on this project.\nGrasses for grazing livestock are making a comeback on Utah’s McCracken Mesa thanks to a project partnership among the Aneth Chapter of the Navajo Nation, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\nKnown as the McCracken Mesa Rangeland Project, the Aneth Chapter is working to rehabilitate degraded land through a grass establishment project. McCracken Mesa rises 5,500 feet and covers 57,000 acres. An estimated 37,000 acres are intended for grazing livestock. But the mesa’s terrain, extreme weather and overgrazing from livestock have left much of the land bare.\nThe use of native grasses ensures a more sustainable ground cover for the mesa along with habitat for wildlife. Plants that are native to an area typically are the most suitable for restoration efforts because they boast advantages such as adaptability to the soil and have mastered surviving and thriving in the sometimes harsh environment.\nNRCS funds supported a two phase rangeland project to manage existing brush and to reseed native grasses, such as Indian rice, blue grama, galleta and Western wheatgrass.\nThe first phase began on 750 acres in and was successful. Brush has been cleared, and native grasses can be seen growing across the rangeland. The second phase of the project has started on 1,000 acres. The conservation work on McCracken Mesa is a model for the Navajo Nation.\nBill Todachennie, vice president of the Aneth Chapter, said this project can serve as a guide for the Navajo Nation because it provides an opportunity for tribal members to see firsthand the successful rehabilitation of native rangelands. In turn, other land stewards of the Navajo Nation can work to implement the project’s successful conservation practices on their ranges.\nNRCS staff members Don Andrews (left) and Loren Crank Jr. (right) and Eshyla Becenti (center), with Utah Work As Employed, assess the native grasses growing on the first phase of the McCracken Mesa Rangeland Project.\nTodachennie said chapter members look forward to the day when just like their ancestors, they too will see abundant tall grasses waving in the breeze and plenty of forage for grazing livestock.\n“Back in my younger days when they talked about it, I couldn’t envision it. Now I do,” he said.\nThese efforts are part of USDA’s StrikeForce for Rural Growth and Opportunity Initiative, a coordinated effort across the Department to increase economic opportunities and address the needs of rural communities experiencing persistent poverty. Currently, StrikeForce teams are working in twenty states.  Since , StrikeForce teams have overseen 400 projects and activities to address persistent poverty in Utah’s remote rural areas, including Indian Country.\nGrasses for grazing livestock are making a comeback on Utah’s McCracken Mesa which rises 5,500 feet and consists of 57,000 acres.

Photo courtesy Farm Credit Council\nToday's farms, ranches and agricultural enterprises are more diverse and more specialized. And today's farms and related businesses require new financial services, more equity and greater flexibility from their lenders if they are to effectively manage their businesses. Producers and rural entrepreneurs of all types need access to dedicated, specialized lenders to meet their complete credit and financial services needs.\nFarm Credit was created to meet that need and continues to pursue its mission of service to agriculture and rural America. Because Farm Credit institutions are cooperatively owned by the agricultural producers who borrow from them, Farm Credit remains dedicated to improving the quality of life on the farm and in rural America through competitive lending, financial services and sound business advice.\nFarm Credit provides sound and dependable credit to American agricultural producers, their cooperatives and farm-related businesses. We also provide loans for things such as agricultural processing and marketing activities, rural housing, rural utilities, and international agricultural trade. We do this by making appropriately structured loans to qualified individuals and businesses at competitive rates and by providing financial services and advice. Farm Credit offers more than just a loan - we offer more than 94 years of expertise in financing and agricultural business practices.\nFarm Credit institutions are chartered by the federal government and must operate within limits established by the Farm Credit Act. The Farm Credit System is regulated by an independent federal agency, the Farm Credit Administration, which has all of the enforcement, regulatory and oversight authority as other federal financial regulators.\nAgricultural producers who borrow from Farm Credit are the ones who make the controlling decisions about their institution. They elect their own boards of directors and their institution's earnings are either retained to capitalize additional lending or paid out to borrowers in the form of patronage dividends. The capital that Farm Credit loans to farmers comes from the sale of bonds on the open market by the System. Farm Credit is not subsidized by the federal government nor is it a government agency.\nIn addition, all Farm Credit institutions have locally tailored programs specifically focused on the needs of young, beginning and small farmers- the future of U.S. agriculture. Because System institutions are guided by boards of directors comprised of agricultural producers, many of whom have sons and daughters involved in agriculture, they are highly sensitive and responsive to the needs of young and beginning farmers.\nYou can find out more about the Farm Credit System at our new website.\nOctober is National Cooperative Month.  This is the last in a series of guest blogs presented this month to highlight cooperatives across the Nation. \n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n co-op\n Farm Credit Coucil\n National Cooperative Month\n Rural Development",

NRCS photo.\nDid you know it’s travel season for monarch butterflies? Each fall, millions of these black-and-orange butterflies journey south from their summer quarters in the United States to their winter homes, which for some is as far away as Mexico.\nPopulations of these beautiful insects have decreased significantly over the past two decades, in part because of the decrease in native plants like milkweed – the sole source of food for monarch caterpillars. Because monarch butterflies are always on the move, they need to have the right plants in bloom at the right time along their migration route. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), agricultural producers and a wide array of other groups are working to create and enhance habitat to help the species rebound.\nA promising new study has uncovered a piece of the puzzle. A research team at Iowa State University is studying how monarchs grow and develop on various species of milkweed in hopes of unlocking the full potential of monarch habitat restoration efforts.\nMilkweed plays a vital role in the life cycle and migration of the charismatic butterflies. While the importance of milkweed is clear, the performance of different milkweed species in supporting monarch population growth is not. Because Iowa is home to 17 different native species of milkweed, it is an ideal location to study how each plant species affects monarch growth and survival. This is key to maximizing the benefit of the many acres of milkweed being planted for habitat restoration.\nIn order to monitor the growth and survival of larva across milkweed species, the project team at Iowa State University evaluated nine of the 17 native milkweed species in a greenhouse experiment. Project findings after two years show that while monarchs can survive on all nine milkweed species tested, the probability of reaching adulthood varied from 30 to 70 percent. A member of the project team published an article highlighting this study in the October issue of Environmental Entomology.\nThe greenhouse experiment determined that monarch larvae have a higher chance of survival on specific species of milkweed. Photo courtesy of Iowa State University.\nLarval survivorship differed most noticeably between larvae that fed on tall green milkweed (A. hirtella) and butterfly weed (A. tuberosa) or poke milkweed (A exaltata). Fewer monarchs that fed on Sullivant’s milkweed (A. sullivantii) survived than those that fed on poke milkweed (A. exaltata). No other pairwise differences in larval survival were significant.\nBy developing and sharing an understanding of how different milkweed species influence monarch development and survival, this project is contributing to efforts to help this species recover. In addition to the greenhouse experiment, the team is currently evaluating the nine milkweed species at field demonstration sites across Iowa.\nIn addition to the greenhouse experiment, the team is currently evaluating the nine milkweed species at field demonstration sites across Iowa. Photo courtesy of Iowa State University.\nThe study was funded by NRCS through a Conservation Innovation Grant, and findings can help NRCS in its work with producers on private lands to create and enhance high-quality habitat for the species. Two-thirds of the continental United States is privately owned, and landowners and agricultural producers can play a crucial role in helping the monarch recover.\nThrough the Farm Bill, NRCS provides assistance to agricultural producers to help make conservation improvements that benefit the monarch while also increasing the productivity and resiliency on working lands.\nTo learn more about Conservation Innovation Grants, visit our CIG webpage.

Do You Know How USDA's Nutrition Assistance Programs can Play a Vital Role in Helping Those Most in Need Following a Disaster?\n Twice a year, as part of America’s PrepareAthon!, USDA works closely with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as well as with other Federal, state and local partners to promote emergency preparedness.  When disasters strike, it’s not only important for you and your family to be prepared, it’s also critical that your community be prepared.  USDA supports local communities by providing access to healthy meals in emergency situations.\nUSDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) ensures people have access to nutritious food when they find themselves suddenly in need of assistance following a storm, earthquake, flood or other disaster emergency.  Oftentimes after a disaster, retail food stores are closed making it impossible for families to get the food they need.  Even after stores reopen, disaster survivors often still are recovering financially which makes buying food difficult.  FNS programs are there to help in those circumstances.\n Cora Russell, Food and Nutrition Service\n Posted in\n Food and Nutrition\n May 17, \n 26 Responses",

Photo credit: US Forest Service\nOn June 9, , a lightning strike sparked a wildfire in the mountains west of Fort Collins, Colorado, burning into the Roosevelt National Forest. The High Park fire burned over 87,000 acres and remains the third largest fire in recorded Colorado history, with more than 250 homes destroyed.\nMatt Champa, assistant prescribed fire specialist with the Canyon Lakes Ranger District of the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests, remembers clearly the two and a half weeks the High Park Fire burned. Matt was among the individuals actively working on the ground to suppress and contain the fire; at its height, more than 2,000 people were involved in the suppression effort.\nAlthough Matt serves as a firefighter when needed during fire season, he and his team work year-round to restore fire-adapted ecosystems and to help reduce the risk of extreme wildfires in the future. Prescribed fire, or controlled burns, is the careful planning and application of fire to promote healthy forests, for instance reducing the amount of hazardous fuels and encouraging the growth of native plant species. These activities recognize the important ecological role of wildfire in these ecosystems. \nBut when you’re faced with over 650,000 acres of national forest land, as Matt is with the Canyon Lakes Ranger District, how do you decide which areas should be treated? I had the opportunity to shadow Matt as he surveyed fuel treatment projects on the Roosevelt National Forest and gained insight into this work. The main takeaway, Matt emphasized, is that this is a team effort. A suite of specialists, including geospatial planners, wildlife biologists, hydrologists, and timber professionals, work together to identify sites for treatment in a process that is strongly grounded in science. Perhaps most importantly, this work is done collaboratively with local communities through a public scoping process. To maximize effectiveness, the team tries to focus its efforts where communities are doing complementary work.\nIt is also important to recognize the long timescale of these projects – fully completing a fuel treatment takes an average of ten years from start to finish. Although this seems long in terms of human time scales, it is quite short for these ponderosa and lodgepole forests, where trees can grow for hundreds of years. \nScientists with Forest Service Research & Development support land managers like Matt by conducting cutting-edge research to help make fire and fuel management more effective, safe and ecologically appropriate. At the Rocky Mountain Research Station, scientists use case studies, field research and simulation models to better understand fire regimes and the ecological impacts of management activities and to develop management techniques that incorporate the patterns and processes that result from natural disturbances.  \nFor example, Research Forester Mike Battaglia and other collaborators work directly with Forest Service land managers to address questions and concerns about ponderosa pine restoration on the Colorado Front Range, which is part of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFRLP). Their research is helping provide land managers with for their restoration work.\n“In the early stages of fuels reduction management in ponderosa pine forests, there was an urgency to reduce forest density without considering how the trees were spatially distributed within the stand and on the landscape,” said Battaglia. “However, we now know that much of our ponderosa pine forests consisted of small tree groups, with small and large openings, and individual trees distributed across the stand.”\nUsing sophisticated fire behavior models, they are investigating how these complex forests historically burned to determine structures that will meet fuel hazard reduction objectives while maintaining forest structures that provide other ecological benefits. Information from these studies is intended to inform future management activities.\nMatt has worked for over a decade in this area, and his connection to and knowledge of the land run deep. Matt inspired me with the passion he has for his work and his dedication to the communities that he serves. The highlight of our day together was when he showed me where a completed fuel treatment curbed the spread of the High Park Fire along the edge of the Cache la Poudre Wilderness. The difference that an effective fuel treatment project can make is clearly demonstrated here; where one side of the site is comprised of charred tree remains and the other of healthy trees.\nThis post is part of a series featuring the Forest Service’s work on restoration across the country.\nA pile of hazardous fuels, prepared for burning.

The mural was painted by Towson University student John Rice. \nI’m thrilled that I could join Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan last week when we announced the recipients of the People’s Garden Grant Program in Baltimore, Maryland.  The backdrop for the $60,000 grant announcement to Towson University was set at the Eat Healthy Live Healthy Urban Garden in the Cherry Hill neighborhood. Cherry Hill is an approximately one square mile, geographically isolated, food desert neighborhood. These residents are impoverished and experience some of the highest rates of chronic disease in Baltimore city.\nTowson University received this grant so that People’s Gardens could be established by many communities throughout the Cherry Hill area. The garden projects which Towson University will select for the Baltimore area must demonstrate collaboration between two or more organizations within Cherry Hill working toward the betterment of the community. At least 200 community residents of all ages will be engaged as a result of the grant, including school children, adults and seniors. And at least four school gardens and four community gardens will be established with at least 2 raised (waist high) beds built to engage seniors.\nI had the opportunity to meet and talk with Juanita Ewell, the manager of the Eat Healthy Live Healthy Urban Garden, who shared how she’s worked with youth and seniors living in the neighborhood to turn this once trash ridden and weed infested field into a space that the community can eat from. When I asked her how she learned to garden she replied, “I’ve grown into it.”\nThis grant was just one of ten grants awarded to support 155 “People’s Gardens” in neighborhoods from Maryland to Alaska.  Bringing more garden projects to this and many other communities will greatly improve the resident’s access to locally grown, nutritious food.  There are communities across the country - in both urban and rural areas – that will use the “seed money,” a.k.a. sub-grants created by the People’s Garden Grant Program, to gain access to healthier foods simply by growing it themselves.\nThere are a lot of communities that would like to create a People’s Garden, but they lack either the financial or educational means to fulfill this goal. As a matter of fact, we received 366 proposals, requesting $4.6 million to create or expand gardens through this grant program.\nUnfortunately, we were not able to fund every proposal, however with this “seed money” we are able to facilitate the initial investment needed, $725,000 to be exact, for ten communities which we hope can make a big impact.  If you’re interested in the specifics about the grant projects, we have information posted on the People’s Garden website.  We’ll be updating our web pages as the projects move forward.\n Category/Topic:\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n Baltimore\n Kathleen Merrigan\n Maryland\n People's Garden",

(Courtesy photo American Tree Farm System)\nHurricane Michael, which roared through Florida, Alabama and Georgia on October 10, hit timberland owners and timber markets hard.\nJohn Alter and his wife Elizabeth manage more than 1,000 acres in Malone, Florida, including 18 Tree Farm stands. The Alters were honored as Florida’s Outstanding Tree Farmers of the Year in .\n“This is a true disaster,” said Alter. “My immediate focus is on determining what to do with what’s left of my timber, and I do not have access to everything right now.”\nTimber damage on John Alter’s land in Florida. The total losses to Florida timber producers and consumers from Hurricane Michael may exceed $1 billion. (Photo by John Alter)\nThe monetary estimate of timber damage in Florida alone is well over $1 billion. The hurricane also caused extensive damage in Georgia and Alabama.\nResearch shows that damage from individual storms and other forest threats, such as insects, fire, and disease, can create widespread wealth redistribution among timber land owners. The entire supply chain is impacted – from landowners to loggers to the mills and beyond. Southern Research Station Forest Economics and Policy researchers Thomas Holmes and Jeff Prestemon’s studies show that growers with damaged stands lose wealth.\n“Prices fall during the salvage period due to the spike in volume and quality degradation,” said Holmes. “Plus, not all damaged timber can be salvaged.”\nTimber growers with damaged stands and timber consumers – mills – tend to lose out, he explained. However, timber producers with undamaged stands benefit because wood is still needed, and prices can rise to make up for the lack of high-quality wood available after salvage operations. He predicts that, based on a timber market welfare analysis, the aggregate losses to timber producers and consumers in Florida from Hurricane Michael may exceed the current $1 billion estimate.\nIn the past, state governments have taken steps to assist timber managers with salvage operations. Some examples include relaxing weight limits on roads; allowing logging trucks to carry heavier loads; permitting larger than normal log storage volumes at mills; and assisting private landowners and nongovernmental organizations with salvage planning.\n“It would take 2.4 million logging trucks to remove all of the dead trees that we have in Florida as a result of this hurricane,” said Florida Forest Service State Forester/Director Jim Karels.\nThe Forest Service is supporting restoration efforts by working closely with state foresters in Florida and Georgia to increase timber sale and salvage operations. At the states’ request, agency specialists will also provide technical assistance to help private landowners write plans for treatments and get their timber to market. The Forest Service will also provide funding to state forestry agencies to administer landowner reforestation programs.\n“Active cooperation between state and federal agencies will be the key to recovery,” said Rob Doudrick, SRS Director. “Our research will provide the sound science for making decisions.”\nUsing satellite imagery, Southern Research Station scientists are able to see the impacts of Hurricane Michael’s destructive winds and Florence’s drenching rains. The ForWarn tool, which SRS scientists helped develop, reveals impacts before people can view damage on the ground.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Forest Service\n Forestry\n Southern Research Station\n Hurricane Michael",

It’s where they showcase family photos in the hall or on the mantle, cook holiday meals, and rest after a long day. Home provides a place of comfort, security, and stability. For many individuals and families, that home is an apartment in a rural community made possible in part by Rental Assistance through USDA Rural Development (RD).\nUSDA is currently helping nearly 300,000 eligible tenants nationwide living in RD-financed multifamily housing afford to pay their rent through RD’s rental assistance program. This ensures low-income and elderly tenants pay no more than 30% of their income in rent. During a time when many people are struggling to keep up with rising costs of food, gasoline and everyday necessities, this funding is critical to making sure everyone has a place to call home.\nFor 21 families in Union Valley Apartments in Finleyville, Pennsylvania, this funding means the tenants can live in the town they describe as safe and friendly.\nUnion Valley resident Carole Fosbaugh has health issues that make it difficult to walk up the hill from the bus stop to her apartment. With rental assistance, Carole doesn’t have to spend as much of her income on rent; she hopes to buy a used car so she can get to and from the doctor and other places without having to walk up that hill.\n“[Rental assistance] helps seniors very much, because we all live on limited incomes, and sometimes it’s very hard,” Fosbaugh said. “So, when you end up getting that, it makes life a lot, lot better.”\nThis program supports President Biden’s recent action plan to help renters who are struggling with high rental costs, with a particular focus on building and preserving rental housing for low- and moderate-income families.\nAs the nation celebrates National Homeownership Month, we also recognize families who take great pride in their cozy, safe and affordable apartments.

As President Obama and I work together to boost the rural economy and create jobs across America, it’s important to recognize the strength we draw as a nation from our forests, grasslands, farms, ranches, rivers and wilderness areas.\nAnd it’s even more important that we all work together to protect them.\nIn , President Obama established the America’s Great Outdoors initiative to help reconnect Americans to the land, promote recreation and tourism that bring jobs to rural communities, and build on America’s long history of conservation.\nUSDA has played an integral role in this effort, and we’ve achieved historic results to help restore, protect and conserve our natural resources.\nUnder the Obama Administration, USDA has enrolled a record amount of private working lands into conservation programs that help landowners protect clean water, conserve habitat, and benefit our environment. In fact, we’ve worked with more than half a million private landowners, farmers and ranchers to improve conservation practices on their land.\nFor example, through a commitment to the Conservation Reserve Program, over the last three years we’ve enrolled over 12 million acres while also targeting the program to the most environmentally-sensitive lands – protecting farmland and providing economic benefits on the farm and in rural communities.  This spring we announced a special initiative through CRP to protect a million acres of wetlands, grasslands, and wildlife habitat in partnership with farmers.\nUnder the Wetlands Reserve Program we’ve seen similar interest, enrolling more than 650,000 acres nationwide since to improve water and soil quality.\nOn our 193 million acre National Forest lands, the USDA Forest Service has developed a new “planning rule” to manage and restore our National Forests so that they are more resilient to wildfire, and so they continue to conserve our water resources and wildlife while providing jobs and opportunity in local communities.   And we’ve accelerated forest restoration work on public and private lands by treating more than 12 million acres over the past 3 years to sustain, enhance, or restore watershed function and resilience.\nUSDA’s innovative targeting of conservation funding through 19 landscape-scale initiatives – from the Great Lakes to western sagebrush rangeland to the Longleaf Pine forests of the southeast – is helping generate three to five times the benefits of more general approaches.  Our voluntary efforts with farmers are reducing nutrient runoff to rivers and streams by as much as 45 percent.\nThese investments are helping rural communities create jobs while ensuring sustainable lands. They’re supporting a strong rural economy. They’re giving rural Americans new opportunities to give back to the land, a long-held American value that’s rooted in our small towns and rural communities.\nI’m proud that under President Obama, we’ve taken historic action to preserve natural resources, farmland and wild areas for future generations. I know that these restoration efforts, taking place every day across America, will continue providing an economic boost for agriculture and rural communities, while helping to protect the natural resources and pristine lands that we all hold dear.\n For an audio version of this week's column, click here. \n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n AGO\n Conservation\n CRP\n Forestry\n FS\n FSA\n National Forest lands\n NRCS\n President Obama\n Secretary's Column",

My travel to South America was an opportunity to discuss our most recent trade successes and how we can further build on this great relationship and momentum. \nIn Chile, I met with the Chilean Minister of Agriculture, Carlos Furche and Chilean Agriculture and Livestock Service (SAG) officials to discuss bilateral animal and plant health trade issues. US Ambassador to Chile, Michael Hammer, was also in attendance. To better understand their domestic processes and procedures for imports, I participated in a tour of a grocery store selling U.S. products including U.S. beef and visited a feedlot and a dairy farm as well as other agricultural sites near Santiago. This year Chile granted market access to U.S. live cattle and renewed domestic access to U.S. bovine embryos, more easily allowing Chile’s farmers to improve the national beef and dairy herds with genetics supplied from the U.S. The last time I visited Chile was five years ago, so it was great to refresh the cooperative and collaborative working relationship between USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and SAG.\nAnother highlight from my trip to Chile was a tour of a Pre-Clearance Airport Inspection site at the Santiago Airport. After Mexico, APHIS’s largest preclearance presence overseas is in Chile. The program was launched over ates.  A total of 155 different commodities are included in this program. During the - season, 97.4 million cases of products were exported, worth a total of US$ 1.3 billion. The success of this joint preclearance program between USDA – APHIS and Chile’s SAG has helped to build longevity and strength in our trade relationship.\nUSDA Undersecretary Edward Avalos and Peruvian Minister of Agriculture Juan Manual Benites showcase the lovely Peruvian peppers now allowed access to the U.

US Ambassador to Peru, Brian Nichols, was also in attendance. In our discussion, we emphasized the importance of using sound science and our strong working relationship in facilitating bilateral trade.  We were able to discuss our recent accomplishment in finalizing the U.S. cattle agreement allowing exports to Peru. Likewise, Peru was able to discuss the importation of Peru peppers and citrus into the U.S., whose final rules were published in September. While in Peru, I also visited a satellite operation of a U.S. based blueberry nursery that exports high quality genetic material for producing blueberry fruit in Peru.\n Also in Peru, I had the opportunity to give opening remarks at the 8th World Avocado Congress held in Lima, where I provided an overview of the U.S. avocado industry, a history of the avocado imports from Mexico, Peru and Chile, and talked about the success of the Hass Avocado Research and Promotion Program.\n My trip to South America was timely, important, and productive. It demonstrated the excellent working relationship the U.S. has with both Chile and Peru, and the importance of collaboration between APHIS, SAG, and SENASA.

She shared the yield with friends and family members. Consequently, each year the demand for such grew. This spurred her interest in efficient production and scientific approaches to small-scale farming.\nIn February , Coleman attended the Mississippi Women for Agriculture two-day annual conference hosted by Alcorn State University (ASU), an land-grant institution with a mission to strengthen agricultural research and instill scientific practices. USDA staff was in attendance. After participating in conference workshops, Debora continued to network with ASU and USDA staff members. The month after, she was certified in a Farm Service Agency (FSA) borrower training program.\nDebora believes in an “each-one, teach-one” approach to adopting and broad dispersion of innovative solution-finding. The following August, she held her first shiitake mushroom education program, using a practical, hands-on approach.\nOver the years, Debora’s farming has evolved from hobby to surplus production and teaching the young and old the rudiments of farming. “[Farming] is not only a value-added activity because of the healthy products it produces, but the activity itself promotes solace and serenity,” Debora noted as an unexpected bonus derived from agricultural pursuits.\nIn , Debora made farming a full-time pursuit. After using her personal savings to purchase a 5-acre for farming in rural Hinds County, she made application for a farm number with the local FSA office. Once her property was identified as a farm by USDA, she accessed the Natural Resources Conservation Services’ (NRCS) Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and was awarded, after the second year of funding, a water-well, high-use pad, fencing and irrigation through EQIP. In , she was awarded a Rural Development Value Added Producers Grant for shiitake mushroom which she used for marketing, promotion and working capital. To protect her crops, Debora recently applied for a High Tunnel System and is awaiting approval.\nDebora said, “farming as an entrepreneurial enterprise and there are many financial needs for a new agriculture business.” Understanding that resources beyond USDA are needed, she receives guidance and services from the U.S. Small Business Administration and its Small Business Development Center.\nThe spring she participated in the Southern States “Path to Prosperity” event in Mississippi. After learning the importance of having separate business and personal checking accounts, Coleman opened a small business checking account with Bank Plus. She now understands that banks that serve all businesses, regardless of size, is critical to local growth and prosperity. Her positive experience has led her to encourage others to attend the \"Path to Prosperity\" series when it comes to their area.\nDebora said, “the Path to Prosperity has made me understand that I am operating an agriculture enterprise and not just farm.”\n Category/Topic:\n Equity\n Farming\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n small business\n Farmers\n Mississippi\n Environmental Quality Incentives Program\n Value Added Producer Grant\n high tunnels\n You May Also Like\n Basketball Legend Seeks USDA's Help to Transform Family Farm Into a Sustainable Agricultural Enterprise\n USDA, Federal Agencies Partner to Kick off National Small Business Month in the Midwest\n Veteran-Owned Business Partners with FAS to Export Spices Around the World",

        "content": "USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service in\n Conservation\n Forestry\n Dec 15, \n Day and night, pollinators are at work all around us—and it's not just honey bees. Did you know that pollinators are responsible for one out of three bites of food we eat? If you'd like to learn more, we've pulled together five blogs from highlighting some surprising facts about these busy helpers and the many ways different USDA agencies, farmers, ranchers and other partners are working to keep all pollinators healthy.\n1. Cattle and Honey Bees Graze in Harmony on Wisconsin Farm\nWhen USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) launched a new coordinated effort to improve honey bee habitat in , Fitton was one of the first to participate. He works closely with NRCS to make improvements to the land that provide better forage for his cattle, improve existing hayfields and convert former corn fields into healthy pasture.\nReed Fitton has enhanced honey bee habitat on the pastures he manages near Gays Mills, Wisconsin.\n2. A Diet to Help Conserve Bees When Food Is Scarce\nIn exchange for their labor, flowers provide bees with pollen and nectar as food. But few people wonder what’s available for bees to eat when there are few plants blooming in the late fall and early winter.\nMegaBee, an artificial diet developed by ARS and S.A.F.E. R&D, LLC, helps sustain honey bees in the face of pressures such as poor nutrition, pathogens, parasites and sublethal exposure to pesticides.\n3. Using Agroforestry to Help Pollinators Help You\nOne question many people are asking is: how can we incorporate more pollinator habitat into our communities, agricultural lands, and forests? Ongoing research by the U.S. Forest Service demonstrates that the number of pollinators in our landscapes can be increased through agroforestry and other land management practices.\nBlueberry bushes provide food for both bumblebees and people. (Photo credit: Nancy Adamson/ National Agroforestry Center.)\n4. NRCS Partners with Farmers, Ranchers to Aid Monarch Butterflies\nBecause monarch butterflies are often on the move, they need to have the right plants at the right time along their migration route, including milkweed, which is the sole food source for monarch caterpillars. We worked with butterfly experts across the United States to choose the best plant species for monarchs based on geographic location and value to monarchs.\nNRCS is working with farmers and ranchers to create and enhance habitat for monarchs.

Invisible or unobserved to many, bats are hard at work every night in many places throughout the world doing what bats do:  eating tons of insects, pollinating flowers and spreading seeds to grow new plants and trees.\nLesser long-nosed bat pollinating a saguaro cactus in the desert Southwest.

Yes, and the cafeteria too.\nClassic images of eager children handing perfect apples to their teacher abound. In the idealized imagery, the apples are often shiny, red, and round. And if you are angling for a good grade, or really like your teacher, the apples are big. But in New Hampshire it was “school boy” apples, the small ones 2 – 3 inches in diameter, which launched an impressive farm to school program.\nThe New Hampshire Farm to School Program (NHFTS) was established in as a pilot program funded by the USDA’s Sustainable Agriculture Research & Education (SARE) program to introduce local apples and cider into New Hampshire K-12 schools.\n“We really saw the small apples as an entry point for our farm to school program. Not many supermarkets or other vendors are interested in the smaller fruit, but they are the perfect size for schools,” said Elisabeth Farrell, Sustainability Program Manager of the Sustainability Institute at the University of New Hampshire.\nElementary students take a class fieldtrip to Hetner’s Orchard to see their apply supply, first hand!\nWhat started with one farmer and one school has blossomed into a much bigger network. Within three years, over half the K-12 schools in the state – serving some 120,000 students – were purchasing local apples for their cafeterias. The program continues successfully today, with farms such as Apple Annie, Apple Crest, and Brookdale Fruit Farm, among many others, selling apples, cider and other products to schools across the state.\nIn addition, new businesses are in the works to support the growing demand schools have for local products. For example, Rob Larocque, owner of Carter Hill Orchard in Concord, recently created an apple grower co-op to deliver and distribute apples to schools across the state.  Larocque will soon launch a website, www.nhgrowerscoop.com, to facilitate apple deliveries and sales, which are expected to serve to least half a dozen public school districts as well as other institutions in southeastern NH.\nThose small school boy apples certainly planted some productive seeds. I suspect the efforts taking place in New Hampshire will be bearing fruit for many years to come.\n(Editor’s Note: For more examples of how USDA supports direct connections between local producers and local schools, see the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass.

        "content": "for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services Michael Scuse in\n Trade\n May 18, \n On Monday, I had the honor of hosting Indonesia’s Vice Minister of Agriculture Bayu Krisnamurthi at my 1,700-acre corn, soybean, and wheat farm in Smyrna, Delaware. This opportunity is a direct result of my visit last month to Jakarta where I led 18 U.S. companies on an Agribusiness Trade and Investment Mission. When Vice Minister Bayu told me he would be traveling to the United States this month, I invited him to visit my farm. He warmly accepted my invitation.\nThe United States and Indonesia are strong allies and trade between us continues to grow. In November , President Obama and President Yudhoyono formally launched the U.S.-Indonesia Comprehensive Partnership. Through this partnership, both of our countries are looking to expand trade and investment and commercial relationships, creating tremendous possibilities for economic development and cooperation.\nLast month’s Trade and Investment Mission helped further strengthen our mutually beneficial trade relationship. Over a three-day period, U.S. company representatives and more than 100 Indonesian buyers, producers, and investors held 225 one-on-one business meetings. As a result, significant sales are expected in the near future as nearly a dozen export deals were either made or are in process. Most importantly, nearly every U.S. company representative reported having established new business contacts that will pay off in the mid- to long-term.\nIn addition, the Vice Minister’s visit to my farm gave us the opportunity to get to know one another better and reinforce our countries’ strong bilateral relationship. I also think it was useful for the Vice Minister to see how U.S. farmers use new technologies, including biotechnology, to increase production, while using less petroleum-based inputs like fertilizers and pesticides. Indonesian farmers have already seen positive results for agricultural output and rural incomes from using this technology.\nRecently, the Indonesian government formed a biosafety committee that approved two biotech corn products for food safety and import use. The committee is working toward implementing a transparent, science-based regulatory system for products of agricultural biotechnology consistent with international standards and obligations. I offered my support and the expertise of my USDA colleagues to the Vice Minister and his staff as we continue our collaborative efforts in the area of agricultural biotechnology.\nOverall, I think Vice Minister Bayu’s visit to a typical farm in the northeastern United States went well. It’s not every day that my wife and I host a Vice Minister from anywhere, let alone Indonesia. But the opportunity to build a stronger relationship presented itself and I’m pleased the visit worked out.\nLast week, U.S. farm exports reached an all-time high of $75 billion during the first half of fiscal year . This puts us on track to reach the current USDA export forecast of $135.5 billion by the end of the year. U.S. exports to Indonesia, in particular, are up nearly 35 percent over the same period last year. Farm exports alone will support more than one million jobs in America this year. Strong U.S. farm exports will be a key contributor to building an economy that continues to grow, innovate and out-compete the rest of the world.\n Category/Topic:\n Trade\n Tags:\n agricultural exports\n Biotechnology\n FAS\n Indonesia\n trade and investment mission\n U.S.-Indonesia Comprehensive Partnership",

From engaging in critical natural conservation efforts to helping kids learn more about nutrition and gardening to working directly with local organizations in communities enduring chronic poverty, USDA is proud to be an AmeriCorps partner.\nAmeriCorps service crews are working side by side with the Forest Service to protect public lands and fight fires.  For instance, a recently announced $3.8 million partnership between AmeriCorps and the USDA’s Forest Service and over 100 other organizations participating in the 21st Century Conservation Corps, creates service opportunities for 300 new AmeriCorps members.  Through this opportunity, military veterans and youth restore our treasured public lands by rebuilding trails, managing forests and rehabilitating campsites for generations to enjoy. These service members are also doing critical wildfire management activities like tree thinning, prescribed burns and hazardous fuel control. Meanwhile, in northwest California, the AmeriCorps Watershed Stewards Project is restoring coastal watersheds from San Francisco to the Oregon border.  This effort, a partnership between the California Department of Fish and Game, Humboldt State University, and other members of the fisheries, watershed and science community, has been going strong for twenty years.\nUSDA is also a proud supporter of FoodCorps. This AmeriCorps program places volunteers in schools to bring local and regionally grown foods into the cafeteria and provide nutrition education to students, helping to empower our next generation with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions about what they eat. Through these efforts, 182 service members have built more than 400 school gardens, reaching over 120,000 kids in schools across 16 states and the District of Columbia. As an added bonus, those same FoodCorps members helped to harvest an additional 40,000 pounds of produce, which was donated to families in need in their local communities.\nA new partnership with USDA’s Tribal College Program and the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, and the Fish and Wildlife Service will place 125 AmeriCorps VISTA members in some of our nation's most underserved and impoverished communities. These AmeriCorps members will work with local non-profits in 32 states and territories to address the root causes of poverty and protect America's natural resources, heritage, and tribal cultures. Meanwhile, 52 AmeriCorps VISTA volunteers were placed in rural eastern Kentucky as part of the Obama Administration's Promise Zone Initiative to create jobs, increase economic activity, improve educational opportunities, leverage private investment, and reduce violent crime.\nThe 900,000 AmeriCorps members that have served over the past 20 years are the best that America has to offer.  They know how to get things done, and coast to coast, they are making a difference. Thank you AmeriCorps for all you've done in 20 years, and we look forward to decades of continued success.\nAmeriCorps members are restoring trails like the one pictured here, managing forests and working on other critical land management activities.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Food and Nutrition\n Forestry\n Tags:\n 21st Century Conservation Service Corps\n AmeriCorps\n Bureau of Indian Affairs\n Bureau of Land Management\n California\n Conservation\n Department of Interior\n Forestry\n FS\n Kentucky\n National Park Service\n Nutrition\n Oregon\n Promise Zone Initiative\n U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\n veterans\n volunteers\n Washington DC",

Coppess recognized program complexity as one area that policy makers will be paying close attention to when Farm Bill discussions get into full swing. The gathering also pointed out the need to address the difficulties witnessed by the dairy industry. The administrator informed the crowd that the Dairy Industry Advisory Committee was recently formed to address the host of problems that plague dairy producers everywhere.\nCoppess concluded his comments by recognizing the significant contributions farmer make to improve the economy and preserve the environment.  He reminded people that the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) recently accepted over 50,000 enrollment offers preserving over 4.3 million acres in CRP. He also touted the benefits that agricultural exports provide U.S. economic growth.  “The American farmer’s abundant production of food, fiber and fuel is a key ingredient in our nation’s economic recovery,” said Coppess. “For that boost to the economy we all owe U.S. farmers a sincere and profound thank you.”\nThe Farm Science Review is a three-day event that garners more than 140,000 visitors who can explore more than 4,000 products presented by nearly 600 commercial exhibitors.

The camp was organized and hosted by the university’s School of Forest Resources with funding provided by the Forest Service’s Northern Research Station. Participants came from diverse backgrounds and places, including young women and minorities traditionally underrepresented in forestry, as well as those from rural and urban communities.\nThunderstorms knocked out power at the Tanglewood 4-H camp in Lincolnville, Maine, the day before camp was to begin, prompting University of Maine faculty and staff to quickly relocate the camp to the university campus. The new location gave students on-site access to the University Forest, Perch Pond and the Orono Bog Boardwalk. Northern Research Station scientists, faculty and a number of graduate students joined campers during the day for lessons and activities related to forest inventory, interpretative signs, recreation management, fish sampling, forest operations and forest management planning.\nThe students enjoyed evening campfires, swimming, nature walks and opportunities to talk to natural resources experts.\nThe students peppered their hosts with many thoughtful questions. They wanted to know what it means to be a wildlife manager, what a forester does on an average day, and how camp instructors became interested in their field of study.\n\"I think the most constructive things I learned at camp were how to identify trees, how to estimate a distance by counting my paces and the importance of the forest to streams and rivers,” said Discover the Forest camper Christopher Wilson of Hartland, Maine. “Everything we learned was interesting.\"\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n 4 H\n camp\n Connecticut\n Discover The Forest\n forest\n Forestry\n FS\n high school\n Maine\n Massachusetts\n New Jersey\n New York\n Northern Research Station\n Rhode Island\n students",

This program is available to local businesses and partners that remove hazardous fuels from national forests and transport the material to be processed for wood products or services.\n“The timber and wood products industries help support healthy and sustainable forests,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. “Thanks to historic funding from the Biden-Harris Administration, this funding opportunity empowers local communities to create and support jobs while helping the USDA Forest Service implement sustainable forest management practices that reduce wildfire risk and support the Wildfire Crisis Strategy.”\nRemoving hazardous fuels from forests can reduce the risk of wildfires, protects watersheds, and improves forest health and resilience. Hazardous fuels are typically woody material with little commercial value. Although these materials can become useful products or services, the transportation costs are often prohibitive. Without transportation assistance, these materials are often burned in place or not removed from the national forests, increasing the risk of insects, disease, and wildfires that threaten ecosystems, communities and critical infrastructure.\nMade possible by the Biden-Harris Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, the grants support wood utilization facilities across the country and the rural economies that depend on them. In , these grants helped remove almost 59,000 tons of hazardous fuels from nine national forests to facilities that produced peeled poles, firewood and animal bedding.\nApplications for this grant opportunity will be accepted for 30 days. Public information sessions will be available later and will support organizations in completing the application and answering questions. Project selections will be announced later this year. For more information, visit the Forest Service website.\nUSDA touches the lives of all Americans each day in so many positive ways.

With the current drought and unstable dairy prices, I know that Maryland farmers are finding it difficult to make ends meet.  Secretary Vilsack and I are concerned about the “disappearing middle” in American agriculture – those farmers and ranchers who find themselves squeezed between low prices for their products and high operating costs.  Over the past decade Maryland, like many other states, has been losing many of these mid-sized family farms.  According to the latest Census of Agriculture, between and alone, 155 Maryland farmers with gross sales between $100,000 and $500,000 disappeared.  While some of these farmers may have moved into higher gross sales categories, my best guess is that many just went out of business.\nLocal and direct markets are one way to help existing farmers hold on and new ones flourish.  By being closer to the consumer farmers are able to capture more value for their products.\nMaking sure consumers have an opportunity to know their farmer is also about appreciating all the things other than delicious food that farmers do for us.  Discussion at the Governor’s House focused on the importance of farms to rural economic health.  For instance, farms support seed and feed businesses, equipment repair, and food processing.  Sustainably managed farm and ranchland is also critical to protecting our water supplies, and in Maryland farmland preservation is a key part of the overall strategy to improve the Bay.  Farm kids also populate rural schools and are at the center of maintaining and revitalizing our rural communities.\nPerhaps this is why Maryland, like many states, has a program that promotes locally grown and raised foods.  I encourage my fellow Terrapins to send me an email and let me know how you are meeting the Governor’s challenge.  Now go enjoy that sweet corn!\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n Annapolis\n Buddy Hance\n Census of Agriculture\n Farmers\n Farmers Markets\n Kathleen Merrigan\n KYF2\n Martin O'Malley\n Maryland\n Ranchers\n Tom Vilsack",

Many of the projects are funded by President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, the nation’s largest-ever investment in combating the climate crisis. USDA also unveiled the “Rural Energy Resource Guide” to make it easier for rural communities to identify federal funding for clean energy, including programs made possible by President Biden’s historic Inflation Reduction Act.\nThe projects advance President Biden’s Investing in America agenda to grow the nation’s economy from the middle out and bottom up. They will create jobs and spur economic growth in rural communities through clean energy projects that lower energy costs for agriculture producers and rural small businesses and families.\n“The Biden-Harris Administration and USDA are committed to expanding access to modern clean energy systems and fueling options that strengthen the nation’s energy independence while creating good-paying jobs and saving rural Americans money,” Secretary Vilsack said. “We are excited to partner with hundreds more family farms and small businesses as well as rural electric cooperatives and local clean energy developers to address the impacts of climate change, grow the economy and keep rural communities throughout the country strong and resilient.”\nIn all, USDA is providing more than $375 million in funding through the Powering Affordable Clean Energy Program (PACE) and the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). Both of these programs are part of the President’s Justice40 Initiative, which aims to ensure 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal climate, clean energy and other investment areas flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.\nBackground: PACE\nVilsack announced more than $275 million to rural electric cooperative projects moving forward in the awards process through the Powering Affordable Clean Energy program to expand access to clean energy for communities in Alaska, Arizona, Kentucky and Nebraska.\nBy using renewable energy from natural sources such as the sun and wind, the projects will make it more affordable for people to heat their homes, run their businesses and power cars, schools, hospitals and more. For example:\n In Fairbanks, Alaska, Golden Valley Electric Association, Inc. has been selected to receive $100 million to build a 46-megawatt battery energy storage system. This energy storage is essential to provide rural Alaskans with reliable clean energy when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing. It is a critical part of the people of Alaska’s efforts to create a transformative clean energy economy that protects their natural environment while providing reliable, affordable energy to their communities.\n The Alaska Electric and Energy Cooperative Inc. has also been selected to receive $100 million to install a 45-megawatt four-hour battery energy storage system adjacent to its Soldotna Substation. The cooperative is a wholly owned subsidiary of Homer Electric Association Inc., a distribution electric utility serving over 24,330 members across more than 3,000 square miles in Alaska’s western and southern Kenai Peninsula.\n In Benson, Arizona, Sierra Southwest Cooperative Services Inc. has been selected to receive approximately $55.2 million to finance three battery energy storage system projects totaling 35 megawatts and lasting for four hours in duration.\n In Estill County, Kentucky, Lock 11 Hydro Partners LLC has been selected to receive approximately $16.6 million to build a new 3-megawatt run-of-river hydroelectric plant at Lock and Dam 11 on the Kentucky River. This project will use modern run-of-river energy practices that limit the environmental impact of hydropower and ensure affordable, clean energy for rural Kentuckians.\n In Nebraska, Bluestem Energy Solutions LLC has been selected to receive approximately $3.6 million to build a 2-megawatt community solar facility with the City of Madison electric utility.\nIn May , Congress made $1 billion available through PACE to fund new clean energy projects and energy storage in rural America. The program provides low interest loans with up to 60% loan forgiveness to renewable energy developers, rural electric cooperatives and other rural energy providers for renewable energy storage and projects that use wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal and biomass. Prior to today’s announcement, Secretary Vilsack announced five PACE applications totaling $139 million moving forward at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association’s PowerXchange annual meeting in San Antonio, Texas in March . Earlier this month, Secretary Vilsack announced two more projects in Colorado totaling more than $81 million.\nUSDA expects to continue making Powering Affordable Clean Energy awards in the coming months.\nBackground: REAP\nVilsack announced nearly $100 million in loans and grants through REAP to support 473 projects in 39 states and Puerto Rico.\nThe REAP program helps agricultural producers and rural small business owners expand their use of wind, solar, geothermal and small hydropower energy and make energy efficiency improvements. These innovations help them increase their income, grow their businesses, address climate change and lower energy costs for American families.\nThese investments will cut energy costs for family farms and other businesses, increasing their resiliency and allowing them to invest back into their communities by creating new jobs and other opportunities. For example:\n In Auxvasse, Missouri, Stormy Hollow LLC, will use a $84,274 grant to install energy efficient heating mats and LED Lights. This project is expected to save $25,073 per year. It will replace 358,194 kilowatt hours (kWh) (39.17 percent of the business’s energy use) per year, which is enough energy to power 33 homes.\n In St. Lawrence County, New York, Wilson Dairy LLC will use a $82,939 grant to purchase and install an energy efficient grain dryer. This project will save $22,905 per year and will replace 434,395 kilowatt hours (kWh) per year.\n Mal Enterprises Inc. will use a $500,000 grant to purchase and install lighting sensors, HVAC controls, HVAC & refrigeration cases in three grocery stores in Hamlin, Spur, and Tahoka, Texas. The improvements will reduce 77 percent of the energy used by the three stores and save $32,956 annually.\nUSDA is making the REAP awards in Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming and Puerto Rico.\nSince the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA has invested more than $2.1 billion through REAP in 7,216 renewable energy and energy efficiency improvements that will help rural business owners lower energy costs, generate new income, and strengthen their resiliency of operations.\nUSDA continues to accept REAP applications and will hold funding competitions through Sept. 30, . The funding includes a dedicated portion for underutilized renewable energy technologies. For additional information, contact a local energy coordinator.\nA complete list of all REAP projects can be found online.\nBackground: Rural Energy Resource Guide\nToday, USDA also unveiled the “Rural Energy Resource Guide” which will make it easier for rural communities to identify federal funding for clean energy, including programs made possible by President Biden’s historic Inflation Reduction Act.\nThe guide showcases USDA Rural Development programs that are helping individuals and organizations finance renewable energy systems and infrastructure across rural America. Programs featured in the guide offer funding to:\n Make energy-efficient home repairs.\n Finance small- or large-scale energy infrastructure.\n Fund energy efficiency equipment for business and industry.\n Generate emergency energy in rural areas.\n Produce clean energy from sources such as biobased materials.\nThe Rural Energy Resource Guide also includes stories from Rural Development customers on ways USDA programs and services have helped them meet their clean energy needs.\nUSDA Rural Development provides loans and grants to help expand economic opportunities, create jobs and improve the quality of life for millions of Americans in rural areas. This assistance supports infrastructure improvements; business development; housing; community facilities such as schools, public safety and health care; and high-speed internet access in rural, tribal and high-poverty areas.

Through her National Institute of Food and Agriculture-funded research project, Dr. Yuying Liang, with the UM College of Veterinary Medicine, developed eight vaccine candidates against highly pathogenic H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses.\nResearch has shown that avian influenzas can mutate rapidly, and Liang said that this is a challenge to creating effective vaccines. “We do not know what strain or mutation of HPAI will appear or when it will appear,” Liang said.  “Existing vaccines are unlikely to be effective in new outbreaks.”\nThe key to reducing the spread of an HPAI outbreak is to have a targeted vaccine ready to deploy. “Our approach uses a live viral vector that would cause a strong and broadly protective immune response both in antibodies and T-cells,” she said. “Both are critical in creating a robust immune response.”\nFree viruses are ready to attack new cells. Antibodies can bind to these free viruses, blocking them from infecting new cells. Once viruses infect cells, antibodies cannot reach them. T-cells are needed to recognize and kill these virus-infected cells.\nThe eight vaccine candidates are currently being tested on mice. Next research phase is to evaluate efficacy in a live animal. Supply chain issues caused by the pandemic slowed research progress. UM has patented and licensed Liang’s viral vector.\n“We were fortunate to receive NIFA funding to jump start our research,” Liang said. “This work has great potential for advances in both animal and human health.”\nUSDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service spearheads surveillance and education efforts on HPAI, while Agricultural Research Service scientists are researching effective ways to control the disease.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n National Institute of Food and Agriculture\n NIFA\n USDA Science\n avian influenza\n vaccine\n You May Also Like\n Shining a Spotlight on USDA Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area Employees\n NIFA Investment Paves the Way for Veterinary Students\n USDA Women in Science Share Advice with the Next Generation",

(U.S. Forest Service/Hartwell Welsh)\nWith the Year of the Salamander now in full swing, there’s no wonder why everyone seems to be talking about these little creatures… they are the new canary in the coal mine when it comes to understanding forest health.\nWoodland salamanders, small, ground-dwelling or subterranean, and primarily nocturnal creatures, are a common species in North American forests; and researchers from the U.S. Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest Research Station say they are reliable indicators of recovery in damaged forest ecosystems.\nResearch Wildlife Biologist Hartwell Welsh and Biological Science Technician Garth Hodgson conducted a study that looked at woodland salamanders in Mill Creek, an old-growth redwood forest in Northern California. The forest had been extensively logged for more than 100 years, which dramatically changed the dynamics of the forest ecosystem — altering the way trees grew, and removing much of the original habitat and native wildlife.\nThe study considered different parts of the forest, which were compared with reference old-growth stands on adjacent parklands, and found a positive relationship between salamander presence and body condition, and tree growth, development, and structural changes. The scientists discovered that when woodland salamanders are in higher abundances, it indicates a healthy recovering forest.\nThis research is important because old-growth forests are quickly diminishing, but they provide critical environmental services. According to the researchers, old-growth forests support the world's most species-diverse ecosystems and serve as unique carbon sinks which contain the largest land carbon stocks on the planet. This type of forest helps to capture carbon from the atmosphere that would otherwise contribute to global warming.\nThe Mill Creek forest was recently attained by the California state park system, and is intended to have its logged-over areas restored to old-growth forestland. If successfully restored, it will help to sequester carbon and will provide homes for the rare and currently absent wildlife that once lived there.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n biometrics\n body condition\n California\n carbon\n forest\n Forestry\n FS\n old-growth ecosystem\n Pacific Southwest Research Station\n redwoods\n salamanders\n seral recovery\n succession\n surface counts\n Wildlife",

In fact, had the programs not previously expired, we would have been able to provide an estimated $500 million dollars in additional help for drought-impacted livestock producers in .\nThis safety net assistance helps our farmers and ranchers focus on growing more for our nation – and it ensures that farm families have somewhere to turn when the going is especially tough.\nBut the importance of these programs doesn’t stop at the edge of the farm field. A strong agriculture sector impacts every American.  American agriculture provides more than 80 percent of our food supply here at home. Our prosperity enables the U.S. to export billions of dollars worth of agricultural products around the world, supporting more than one million jobs. Our productivity means that American families pay less for their food at the grocery store than the people of any developed nation.\nOne in 12 jobs is related to agriculture – including in our biggest cities. When the business of agriculture is thriving, more jobs are created in transportation, packaging, processing and sales. And when farmers and ranchers are successful, they invest in their operation, spurring manufacturing and greater business opportunity.\nAt USDA we are committed to doing everything we can to support a thriving agriculture sector. Unfortunately, without a comprehensive, multiyear Food, Farm and Jobs Bill, it’s tougher to provide a smart and defensible safety net. This isn’t just critical for farmers – it’s important for every American. That’s why I’ll continue to work with Congress over the coming year to secure a five year Food, Farm and Jobs Bill that will give our producers the tools they need to grow and thrive.\nFor an audio version of this column, please click here. \n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n disaster\n Farm Bill\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n Safety Net\n Secretary's Column\n Tom Vilsack",

It has been150 years since the first Morrill Act of , which was signed by President Abraham Lincoln. The action established land-grant universities in every state and territory. The second Morrill Act of provided funding to designate separate institutions of higher learning for blacks in those states that did not open the doors of their universities to black students. USDA photo by Lance Cheung.\nOne hundred fifty years ago – just two months after the creation of the U.S. Department of Agriculture – President Lincoln signed the Morrill Act, a historic measure that created the land-grant university system. Twenty-eight years later, Congress enacted a second Morrill Act to establish African American land-grant universities.\nCommonly referred to as Universities, these schools have remained the custodians of access to and opportunity for higher education in underserved communities, as well as leaders in agricultural, environmental and public health studies.\nUnderstanding the special role Universities play in preparing the next generation of American leaders, on Friday, June 29, we signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between USDA, EPA and the Council of Universities, an organization comprised of presidents and chancellors of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), to help build upon their rich history.\nOriginally, Universities taught agriculture, military tactics, and the mechanical arts, as well as classical studies. Over time, as those studies evolved to incorporate the breadth of college academics, HBCUs have proven to be a vital link between African Americans and higher education. HBCUs represent about ates – but they enroll 12 percent of all African American college students, produce 23 percent of all African American college graduates, and confer 60 percent of all engineering degrees earned by African American students. HBCUs also educate half of the country’s African American teachers and 40 percent of all African American health professionals.\nThe MOU we signed today represents a five-year commitment to increase cooperation between EPA, USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), and all Universities. EPA and USDA will support internships, training, technical assistance, faculty exchange opportunities, increased mentoring and other collaborative environmental and public health activities.\nIn addition to career-building programs such as the USDA/ National Scholars Program, we believe this MOU will help to give students of the Universities the skills they need to succeed in a modern American economy that’s built to last. Affordable access to  our public colleges and universities is a key component of our nation’s future success. And that is why the Obama Administration believes we must reward hard work and responsibility by keeping interest rates on student loans low. When Americans get a fair shot at an affordable college education, they can obtain skills they need to find a good job and a clear path to the middle class.\nThis MOU will also assist in giving more Americans a fair shot by expanding the conversation on environmentalism. Too often, America’s lowest income communities are also the communities burdened by the most pollution. Illnesses like heart disease, cancer, and asthma are linked to air pollution and other environmental threats – and all have had a tragic impact on African Americans and other minority communities.  Removing the barriers poor environmental conditions can pose to overburdened communities is essential to providing all Americans with the opportunities they deserve. This MOU will help increase public engagement and listening sessions with the underserved and historically underrepresented communities so that we are better equipped to fight for environmental justice.\nThe benefits of expanding access to higher education are clear. For more than 100 years, federal scientists and university researchers have supported farmers and ranchers who produce a safe and abundant food supply for our families. This work has helped sustain an agricultural trade surplus since the s and led to the record farm income we’re enjoying today. This research also helps preserve and protect our environment. Together, we have helped develop no-till farming practices and new crop rotation systems tailored to meet the needs of American farmers and increase their bottom line. At the same time, these practices – and other new techniques like using wood chips as part of a sub-surface drainage system – reduce runoff of soil and chemicals that can negatively impact our water supply.\nOur work to protect human health and the environment, and to sustain and improve the incredible productivity of our farmers and ranchers relies heavily on America’s innovative leaders in scientific development. The strong partnerships between our federal agencies and our nation’s land-grant system are an essential part of training those leaders so our country can meet the challenges of today – and those of tomorrow.\nOver the years, land-grant colleges and universities have had a tremendously positive impact on our nation, graduating more than 20 million students. In partnership with the federal government, more than 100 land-grant institutions and other research partners have helped conduct the groundbreaking research that remains the envy of the world. In the years and decades to come, science can – and must – do so much more. It can provide the keys to good health and nutrition for our families, lead to clean energy solutions to power our cars, trucks, homes and offices, and promote sustainable food production to feed the world.\nUSDA and EPA are proud to partner again with our nation’s s Universities. Together, by bringing advancements in science and technology, we can make a positive difference in the lives of Americans and people around the world.\nLeft to right Tuskegee University President and Council of Universities Chair Gilbert Rochon, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Lisa Jackson sign the Memorandum of Understanding among the department, agency and council on Friday, June 29, , in Washington, DC.

(U.S. Forest Service photo)\nMost people don’t conjure up images of the U.S. Forest Service when they think of the Smithsonian’s Air and Space Museum. But every fire season the work of the Forest Service’s planes and helicopters, carrying smokejumpers, are vitally important to controlling the spread of wildland fires.\nThis is why the Smithsonian recently honored the legacy of 17 of some of the most lionized smokejumpers in Forest Service history. Known as the Triple Nickles, these smokejumpers were the first all-African American crew in American firefighting.\n“It was World War II. You have to remember this was a time when segregation was still a part of everyday life. But 17 black men stood up to serve their country and become the first African-American paratrooper unit,” said Deidra McGee, a Forest Service employee who has been promoting the Triple Nickles since . McGee met these valiant men that year in Washington, D.C. at the Ellipse near the White House, during a ceremony commemorating Smokey Bear’s 50th birthday.\nThe men wanted to join the fight in Europe during World War II, but their dreams were shattered when military leaders in America and Europe feared racial tensions would disrupt war time operations. At about the same time, the Forest Service asked the military for help to minimize damage caused by balloon bombs launched by the Japanese across the Pacific Ocean with the intent to start forest fires in the western U.S..\n“In the end, few of the incendiary devices reached U.S. soil, but the Triple Nickles were instrumental in helping the Forest Service fight naturally-caused fires,” said McGee. “They became history’s first military smokejumpers who answered 36 fire calls and made more than 1,200 jumps that summer of .”\nSadly, the event at the Smithsonian saw none of the original Triple Nickles as only platoon member Clarence Beavers remains alive and he is physically unable to leave his bed for any extended period of time. Instead several others, with close ties to the original 17, attended to represent their comrades.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Forestry\n FS\n Smithsonian Air and Space Museum\n smokejumpers\n Smokey Bear\n Triple Nickles\n Washington DC\n White House",

The Aspirus Health Foundation, Inc. received two Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) grants through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Rural Development (RD) DLT Program, that enabled Aspirus to grow their Telehealth infrastructure into communities in north-central Wisconsin and the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan. USDA photo.\nThis week at USDA we are celebrating National Health IT week by highlighting USDA’s ongoing efforts to expand modern health care access to rural America. Yesterday, we announced two new steps to improve health care for rural Americans – both through new investments in health infrastructure and ongoing interagency partnerships designed to better focus Federal efforts on rural health care.\nUSDA is expanding a partnership with HHS and the Department of Veterans Affairs, as part of our work together on the White House Rural Council, to leverage funds and other efforts that will support advanced health care technology in rural hospitals. This partnership is an extension of a successful pilot launched in five states – Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi and Texas – to identify rural critical access hospitals in persistent poverty areas in need of advanced health care technology. For example, during the pilot phase of this partnership, the USDA Rural Development Iowa State Office, the Iowa Regional Health IT Extension Center (REC) and the Iowa State Office of Rural Health convened the first Iowa Rural Health IT Forum to expand care for Critical Access Hospitals.\nMeanwhile, we are continuing to let folks know about HHS and VA health care initiatives. This has included the Department of Veterans Affairs Rural Veterans Coordination Pilot Program, to empower rural organizations in promoting high-quality health care and mental health services for our veterans. And last week, The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Rural Health Policy announced grants to build telehealth networks, delivering mental health services to rural veterans as well as funds that will recruit and train a workforce with expertise in Health IT.\nWe also continue to strengthen partnerships with rural communities by investing in high-quality health care infrastructure. Yesterday, USDA announced loans and grants that will help improve health care facilities – providing assistance with everything from building a new critical access hospital building, to modernizing surgical equipment and improving patient registration. These new investments complement efforts that USDA has already made, since , that have expanded distance health care tools to more than 1,600 health care institutions and provided support for more than 1,000 health care facilities.\nAll of these efforts are helping to create a modern health care infrastructure to better serve rural Americans. At the same time, we are working together to be sure that all Americans have access to affordable health care – in particular by reminding folks across the nation that new opportunities for coverage under the Affordable Care Act will soon be available through new Health Insurance Marketplaces. Beginning in , more than 7.8 million uninsured rural Americans under age 65 will have new opportunities to enroll in affordable health care.\nThis is critically important in rural America, where nearly one in five uninsured Americans lives and where a greater share of residents lack health insurance.  A large proportion of folks in rural America will be eligible for discounted insurance coverage through their states’ Health Insurance Marketplaces, so we’ll continue helping to get the word out in rural America. The Department of Health and Human Services provides a wide range of information on the benefits of the Affordable Care Act – and how to obtain coverage if you’re not insured – on www.healthcare.gov.\nRural America faces unique barriers to health care, but together we can meet these challenges. I’m looking forward to continuing USDA’s work alongside our interagency partners that will further expand health care for rural Americans in generations to come.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Affordable Care Act\n Department of Veterans Affairs\n Grants\n Health Care\n HHS\n Illinois\n Iowa\n Kansas\n Loans\n Mississippi\n Poverty\n RD\n Rural America\n rural communities\n Texas\n veterans\n White House Rural Council",

Eligible households will receive one month of benefits – equal to the maximum monthly amount for a SNAP household of their size – that they can use to purchase groceries at SNAP-authorized stores or from select retailers online to meet their temporary food needs as they settle back home following the disaster. Iowa will operate its D-SNAP application from June 25 through June 29, . Iowa will share additional information about D-SNAP application dates and locations through local media.\nThe timing of D-SNAP varies with the unique circumstances of each disaster, but always begins after commercial channels of food distribution have been restored and families are able to purchase and prepare food at home. Before operating a D-SNAP, a state must ensure that the proper public information, staffing, and resources are in place.  \nThe D-SNAP announcement today is the latest USDA action taken to help Iowa residents cope with the severe storms and its aftermath, which also include:\n Approving a 10-day reporting waiver for food purchased with SNAP benefits that was lost as a result of the power outages due to severe storms and tornadoes in Adair, Adams, Black Hawk, Buena Vista, Butler, Calhoun, Cass, Cedar, Cerro Gordo, Clay, Clinton, Dallas, Dubuque, Emmet, Fayette, Franklin, Hancock, Hardin, Harrison, Humboldt, Iowa, Jackson, Jasper, Johnson, Keokuk, Kossuth, Marion, Marshall, Mills, Montgomery, Muscatine, O’Brien, Page, Palo Alto, Polk, Pottawattamie, Poweshiek, Scott, Shelby, Story, Tama, Union, Warren, Washington, Webster, and Wright counties.\nFor more information about this and other available aid, callers from Iowa can dial 2-1-1 or 972-.

The booming, bustling city was the perfect place for a show of its magnitude, where 99 U.S. companies and organizations showcased their products to the main players from China’s food and hospitality sectors.\nThe USA Pavilion was the largest international venue at the event and, of the U.S. companies exhibiting there, over half were small or medium-sized businesses, 23 were new to the Chinese market, 16 were minority-owned and nine were completely new to exporting.\nIt was exciting for me to witness representatives from these companies forging relationships and generating sales leads in the world’s largest market. And it was especially gratifying for me to know that they were doing so with the help and support of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and our partner state regional trade groups (SRTGs). China is the United States’ top market for bulk commodities and tremendous potential exists to expand U.S. exports of high-value food and beverage items.\nAs I walked the trade show floor meeting with the participating entrepreneurs, I was struck by just how popular U.S. products are – especially nuts, dried fruits and dairy products. Based on the numbers, it was a stellar year for U.S. companies at SIAL China. Participants reported $15.4 million in on-site sales and close to $142.6 million projected sales over the next 12 months.\nIn addition to the SRTGs, FAS cooperator organizations were out in full force at SIAL China. Among those promoting quality U.S. food products were the Almond Board of California, Blue Diamond Growers, the California Walnut Commission, the National Pecan Growers Council, the U.S. Cranberry Marketing Committee, the U.S. Meat Export Federation and the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council.\nDuring the month of June, USDA is highlighting the Made in Rural America Initiative and our efforts to help rural businesses and leaders access federal resources to connect with new customers and markets abroad.

Although demand remains high all year round, many of the nation’s food banks experience a major decline in donations during the summer months. USDA programs, however, work year-round to help those affected by hunger.\nThrough The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), USDA helps those in need by purchasing items for food banks and community service organizations. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) Commodity Procurement staff coordinates with the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to send quality, wholesome foods to these establishments. In , AMS purchased more than 212 million pounds of food for TEFAP.\nIn addition to our regular TEFAP purchases, AMS purchased more than 116 million pounds of domestically-produced items this fiscal year via surplus removal efforts. Like the TEFAP purchases, these “bonus buy” products stock the shelves of food banks, pantries, and soup kitchens. As an agency, it means a lot that our mission of facilitating the marketing of agricultural products also allows us to support low-income and food-insecure families.\nWhile the summer temperatures have started to cool down, USDA is still fired up about our leading role in an event designed to fight hunger. Over the last three months, USDA employees donated nearly 1.6 million pounds of food and other items for the Feds Feed Families Campaign, which asks federal employees to donate items to help fill food banks all over the country. Since it started in , the campaign has raised more than 15 million pounds of food from agencies across the federal government.\nWhether it’s food provided through TEFAP, bonus buys, or campaigns like Feds Feed Families, USDA will continue our fight against hunger and food insecurity while creating more opportunities for our nation’s farmers and ranchers.\nThe USDA Feds Feed Families (FFF) team meets at the kickoff event at the Capital Area Food Bank. USDA Undersecretary Ed Avalos (back row in the middle with black jacket and blue tie), AMS Administrator Anne Alonzo (front row to the left with yellow jacket and black dress), National FFF Program Leader Doug Keeler (middle with tan suit and black pants), USDA FFF Program Leader Duane Williams (back row far left), and the rest of the team helped the department donate 1.6 million pounds of food.

However, one residential backyard, nearly 6 miles from downtown Atlanta, calls into question whether this is suburbia at all. There were swings, a tree house, and even patio furniture. Yet one feature certified this was not your mother’s suburban home: over a dozen chickens living comfortably in a custom made “Coop de Ville.”   \nThe rise of “backyard poultry” is one of many agricultural phenomena tied to a growing food consciousness and increased urbanization. And while USDA’s fundamental job doesn’t change, the Department does because the challenges do.  The recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at increasingly popular backyard chicken coops underscore this. While this concern was not clearly expressed in the Act of Congress that created the Department, the mandate was. USDA still works to “acquire and to diffuse…information” towards facilitating the protected growth of American agriculture. That service is what brought Research, Education, and Economics Undersecretary Dr. Catherine Woteki to this residence in Decatur, GA. Accompanied by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service officials and a man known best as the “Chicken Whisperer,” Dr. Woteki toured the site and helped to shed light on current HPAI research and important biosafety measures.\n Melvin Washington, Confidential Assistant, Research, Education and Economics Mission Area\n Posted in\n Initiatives\n Animals\n Plants\n Apr 29, \n 1 Response",

Secretary Vilsack announced that SE Municipal Solar LLC in Nebraska has been selected to move forward to receive nearly $30 million to build eight solar photovoltaic generation facilities totaling 18.72 megawatts. The facilities will produce enough electricity to power more than 1,ate and will be located in Alliance, Gering, Sidney, Imperial, Ansley, Pender, Crete, and Stuart, Nebraska.\nThe funding for USDA’s PACE program is from the Inflation Reduction Act, which is the largest investment in rural electrification since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Rural Electrification Act into law in .  The Inflation Reduction Act partners with rural communities to deliver clean, affordable energy.\n“Rural communities are the backbone of America, and the Biden-Harris Administration is proud to partner with them to create a more affordable and sustainable future that will benefit rural families, businesses and the health of our planet for generations to come,” Secretary Vilsack said. “The project we’re announcing today will create good-paying jobs, lower energy costs for consumers, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen the resiliency of our nation’s electric grid.”\nAlso today, USDA Rural Development Rural Utilities Service Administrator Andrew Berke attended the Nebraska Governor's Ag and Economic Development Summit in Kearney, Nebraska where he highlighted the PACE program and SE Municipal Solar LLC. Joining him were representatives from the Department of Energy, Department of Defense, and Environmental Protection Agency.\n“Thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, we have seen incredible ingenuity when it comes to finding new ways to provide clean, affordable energy to rural Americans,” Administrator Berke said. “The PACE project we are announcing today – and many others to come – reduces costs, creates jobs, and provides new economic opportunities for rural Americans. This gives people in rural America a better chance to succeed and stay in the rural communities they love.”\nThe project is also committed to hiring apprentices and providing workforce training to create job opportunities. This award not only supports the local economy but also contributes to skill development and community empowerment.\nThese awards continue the big investments that the Biden-Harris Administration are making to create good paying jobs and lower energy costs in Nebraska.\nThis announcement comes just months after USDA previously announced projects across the state, in which the Department:\n Invested more than $20 million in Rural Energy for America Program awards to rural small businesses and agricultural producers.\n Selected Bluestem Energy Solutions LLC to receive an approximately $3.6 million PACE award to build a 2-megawatt community solar facility with the City of Madison electric utility.\n Selected Midwest Electric Cooperative Corporation to receive a nearly $17 million PACE award to finance solar renewable energy resource facilities and energy storage systems for communities in Wallace, Grant, Paxton and Lakeview.\n Selected the village of Emerson to receive a $1 million PACE award to finance a solar facility which makes efficiency improvements to its energy distribution system serving the Emerson community.\nBy using renewable energy from natural sources, these investments will make it more affordable for people to heat their homes, run their businesses and power cars, schools, hospitals and more.\nIn May , USDA made $1 billion available through PACE to fund new clean energy projects and energy storage in rural America. This program provides low interest loans with up to 60% loan forgiveness to renewable energy developers, rural electric cooperatives and other rural energy providers for renewable energy storage and projects that use wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal and biomass.\nIt is part of the President’s Justice40 Initiative, which aims to ensure 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal climate, clean energy and other investment areas flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.\nTo date, USDA has selected 13 projects in 6 states totaling $495 million to move forward in the PACE application process.\nUSDA expects to continue making PACE awards in the coming months.\nUSDA Rural Development provides loans and grants to help expand economic opportunities, create jobs and improve the quality of life for millions of Americans in rural areas.

That's why, through smart investments and regional partnerships, we continuously work to expand opportunities by fostering the creation of diverse and productive rural economies through everything from home loans to financing for infrastructure and business ventures.\nInfrastructure, like homes, buildings, roads and power, is the first step toward prosperity and growth in any community. For small rural communities, however, large-scale infrastructure development can be challenging. Small towns have more limited resources and a smaller tax base that can make access to credit difficult. Fortunately, USDA Rural Development can help. We are proud to partner with rural communities across America to provide affordable financing for these essentials, including financing to bring high speed broadband, including remote, poor and under-served areas. Additionally, we provide loans, grants and technical assistance for water systems, wastewater systems, essential community facilities like schools and hospitals, small business start-up or expansion.\nRural Development also finances a variety of housing options for people living in rural places — whether they’re just starting out in life, growing their family, want the convenience of apartment-style rental housing, or are in need of daily living assistance and care during their golden years — our programs help rural Americans find the resources they need to find adequate housing for themselves and their families.\nBy the numbers: since , Rural Development has helped about 89,000 rural small businesses grow, creating or saving more than 420,000 jobs, and has invested in more than 6,600 critical community projects including hospitals, libraries, schools, and public safety facilities. Rural Development has helped more than 900,000 rural families buy, repair or refinance a home, and provided funding for more than 3,000 multi-family housing complexes. We have also invested in new and improved broadband service to nearly 1.5 million rural residents, which expands access to state-of-the-art health care, educational and cultural resources, and provides the opportunity for local businesses to compete in the global economy. Additionally, we have helped modernize rural electric infrastructure for about 8.5 million rural residents and businesses, and provided grants and loans for water and waste-water projects to help safeguard the health of approximately 14.5 million rural residents.\nAt USDA Rural Development, many of our employees live and work in the same rural communities alongside our rural customers and stakeholder and partner organizations. By investing in rural places, we are helping communities position themselves for future, long-term sustainable growth and even helping to tackle ongoing social concerns like health or safety risks and outmigration.

During the spring of , I served as a legislative intern for APHIS’ Office of Legislative and Public Affairs (LPA). Working in LPA, I helped APHIS’ efforts to safeguard the health and viability of America’s agriculture and natural resources by ensuring effective communication with Congress, the States, industry and stakeholders.\nAs a legislative intern, my responsibilities included responding to congressional inquiries, tracking legislation and doing policy analysis of potential new legislation. Additionally, I was able to learn the process for a national news rollout as LPA and worked to inform interested parties of new biotechnology regulatory decisions.  Working with program staff to respond to congressional inquires honed my communication and problem solving skills. My constant exposure to Capitol Hill me to have a deep understanding of the political climate, the legislative process and to quickly analyze complex issues. I really enjoyed working in LPA because every day would bring a different issue, a different inquiry or a different project. During my time at APHIS, I got to work on a wide variety of issue ranging from plant pests, like the Asian Longhorn Beetle, to animal disease traceability. Thanks to the exposure and mentorship from the LPA staff, I was able to secure a job as a federal government affairs analyst at Western Growers, an agriculture trade association. My experience at APHIS taught me more than any class or book could have ever done.  It allowed me to apply my skills learned in the classroom to real life.\nI strongly encourage anyone interested in public policy, political science or communications to get an internship at the USDA.  I obtained my internship through the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) National Internship Program (HNIP).  HNIP has partnerships with several federal agencies, including the USDA, and places interns in various positions based on their interests and skills. In addition to HNIP, there are many programs out there for students to gain valuable, real life experience outside the classroom.

This stone marker is all that’s left. \nTraveling into Reading the first signs of damage were the trees stripped of bark and limbs, as well as debris scattered across acres of newly planted corn fields miles from the town. The town’s water tower stands tall and undamaged, but only a block away the home of the Meek’s family was so decimated all that remains is a vacant lot and the limestone marker bearing the family’s name.  Houses now bear spray-painted “X’s” and other code marks that denote structural integrity or need for demolition.  The town’s major employer, a grain elevator, is now a twisted pile of metal.\nBesides a weather-inflicted scar, both Joplin and Reading share another common thread – resilience.  Shortly after the tornado, Reading T-ball teams took the field for a game and next weekend Reading intends to host its annual Alumni Banquet.  Both events are a nod to normalcy flying in the face of upheaval and demonstrate the resolve to rebuild their community.\nUSDA Rural Development State Director Patty Clark tours the city of Reading with local officials to assess the damage after the May 21 tornado. In the background is a pile of debris from the Reading Post Office (right), which was destroyed by the tornado.\nSteps forward will come slowly – but Reading still plans to hold its annual community fish fry in a couple of weeks.  We agreed that would be a great opportunity to meet with homeowners individually to explain Rural Development programs so USDA plans to host a home fair just prior to the fish fry.  Reading’s mayor greeted the idea enthusiastically but told us not to expect fish.  All of the fish had been stored in home freezers and can’t be used so there will be hamburgers and hot dogs instead.  The food really doesn’t matter – the community gathering does.\nUSDA offers programs to assist rural Americans as they work to recover in the aftermath of a disaster.  For more information click here. \n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Kansas\n Reading\n Rural Development\n Tornado",

        "content": "and Under Secretary Jim Hubbard in\n Conservation\n Forestry\n Apr 20, \nAgricultural and private forest land management contributes significant ecological benefits to the Gulf of Mexico.\nToday marks 10 years since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. USDA, through its Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and U.S. Forest Service, worked alongside other federal agencies to respond to this disaster and supported the Gulf of Mexico region in its prevention, preparedness and restoration efforts.\nFrom coral reefs and hyper-saline lagoons to emergent wetlands and vast sea grass meadows, the Gulf of Mexico hosts a diverse array of habitat and at-risk wildlife species, such as the Louisiana black bear. Its 5 million acres of coastal wetlands provide critical stopover habitat for hundreds of migratory waterfowl species and neo-tropical songbirds each year. Additionally, the Gulf’s ecosystem is a vital food source, producing over 1.3 billion pounds of seafood annually. The health of this ecosystem is not only essential to the local community but to the entire nation.\nOur nation’s agricultural producers have played a key role in helping the recovery in the Gulf of Mexico region, making conservation improvements across Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida over the last 10 years.\nThe land area of the Gulf’s five states encompasses more than 290 million acres. Agricultural land and privately-owned forestland account for 86 percent of these vital working lands. Accordingly, agricultural and private forest land management contributes significant ecological benefits to the Gulf of Mexico, requiring a unique working relationship among USDA, state land management agencies and landowners. As a result of the landscape’s makeup, the Gulf ecosystems will be determined largely by efforts to manage these private lands.\nUSDA is working with governments and entities at the local, state and federal levels to improve the Gulf ecosystem. Following the oil spill, USDA has served on the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Trustee Council and the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, working collaboratively with other governments and entities on strategies to aid restoration of this ecosystem. Investing more than $242 million over the last six years alone, the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Partnership has restored, enhanced or protected over 260,000 acres in seven priority landscapes across the Gulf states, over half of which are wetlands.\nTaking a proactive approach after the oil spill, NRCS launched the Gulf of Mexico Initiative (GoMI), initially focusing on targeted watersheds. GoMI worked hand-in-hand with other NRCS landscape-level conservation efforts, including the former Migratory Bird Habitat Initiative, which was launched just weeks following the spill and ultimately created 470,000 acres of additional habitat for migrating shorebirds and waterfowl affected by the spill. These efforts are continued through the National Water Quality Initiative and the Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative (MRBI).\nFrom to , $288 million was obligated for MRBI project contracts through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, providing treatment on over 1.37 million acres. These targeted investments have increased the adoption of critical water-quality conservation practices by over 30 percent. Additionally, NRCS renewed its GoMI efforts in , releasing a three-year strategy that directed $328 million to help producers make improvements to 3.2 million acres in the five Gulf states.\nNRCS continues to build on its investment, prioritizing the protection of sensitive lands and wetlands through easements, integrating conservation practices in watersheds to improve water quality, and to enhance wildlife habitat on working lands. The Forest Service has engaged in Gulf restoration planning efforts that address water quality and wildlife habitat resource concerns on federal, state and private lands. The Forest Service has also partnered with state forestry agencies and universities to develop a region-wide forest management strategy.\nFor nearly a century, NRCS and Forest Service programs have been highly focused on working with private landowners. USDA’s efforts target the significant opportunities to promote landscape-scale conservation programs that help these landowners invest in science-based conservation practices. USDA programs, such as the Gulf Coast Conservation Reserve Program, have been deployed to protect and restore critical wildlife habitat and improve water quality through the development of plans supporting wildlife habitat, conservation and forest management in the Gulf states.\nUtilizing a voluntary approach, USDA seeks to generate lasting ecosystem improvements by working closely with engaged landowners to maintain healthy watersheds, which depend on healthy agricultural and private forestland, and to achieve success through shared stewardship.\nWhat we learned from the Deepwater Horizon Spill will help NRCS and the Forest Service better respond to future disasters with prevention, preparedness and restoration efforts. For example, while a much different challenge, in , NRCS was able to deploy cover crop signups to help farmers with flooded fields restore soil health and tame soil erosion. Additionally, lessons learned on conserving natural resources in the Gulf region have been applied to other watersheds and regions.\nBy launching landscape-scale conservation, putting boots on the ground and working with diverse partnerships, USDA continues the important work of partnering with farmers, ranchers and private forest landowners to improve the health of this critical ecosystem.\nBill Northey is USDA’s Under Secretary for Farm Production and Conservation, which oversees conservation programs administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Farm Service Agency.

These are attributes about which we are proud here in America’s heartland.  By opening the offices at the Charles F. Prevedel building, NASS will not only improve its processes, it will also bring more than 350 new full-time and part-time jobs to St. Louis County, which will help us in our economic development efforts.\nNASS has a long standing reputation when it comes to conducting agricultural surveys and with more than 100,000 farmers in Missouri, many of our residents already know the agency. Many of us use the agency’s to learn more about the agricultural industry as we set our policies, develop land use plans, and understand the impact of this sector, which is such a strong part of our way of life and economy here.  Many farmers will be happy to see a stronger agricultural presence in our own state and to have an opportunity to contribute to NASS’s survey efforts.\nI was also very happy to learn that the building will be environmentally and energy efficient. With the help of the General Service Administration, the building is undergoing improvements and system upgrades. After the renovations are complete, the building is expected to receive a Silver Rating in the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program.\nOn behalf of all of the residents, I would like to welcome NASS to St. Louis County.  We look forward to a long and fruitful relationship.\n\"St. Louis County Executive Charlie A.

In Missouri there was massive destruction to infrastructure, including roads and bridges that were demolished. At one point, Missouri had over 300 roads closed across the state, including two major Interstates.\nIn a news release earlier today, Agriculture Secretary Perdue reminded farmers, families and small businesses that USDA is here to help. Amidst the destruction, USDA Farm Service Agency employees have been working diligently to assess damage and aid with disaster assistance to America’s farmers and ranchers. \nNow that the Missouri waters are receding, FSA staff are evaluating the impact on agriculture in these flood impacted areas. Sheria Yancey, county executive director for Franklin and Jefferson Counties in Missouri, estimated 70 percent of the corn crop in Franklin County and 60 percent in Jefferson County was damaged or destroyed. In addition to the damage to row crops and hay pastures, Yancey said the floods have also impacted a local orchard, sod farmers and many fruits and vegetable producers in her county.\nYancey said farmers are working quickly to get their farms back in shape in hopes to still get a crop in.\n“Thank goodness this didn’t happen in June or July because they can still get a crop planted,” Yancey said. “And we’ll do everything we can to try to make that happen too.”\nUSDA Secretary Sonny Perdue tours flood damage in Northeast Arkansas May 7, . USDA photo: Michawn Rich\nSecretary Perdue visited the Arkansas state leadership and flood sites last week to assess the volume of damage. Becky Davis, FSA county executive director in Randolph County, Arkansas, estimates most of the corn planted in her county is a complete loss but feels some of the planted rice might survive. The current of the flood waters was so swift in some areas that it pulled the plants right out of the ground. Also, many producers have lost their first cutting of their hay crop due to the grass being matted down and debris in the fields.\n“Our producers are already financially stressed and were already wondering if they were going to farm again,” she explained. “It’s really going to put a strain on them.”\nDavis said because of the swift currents, a lot of the farm ground in her county will be severely damaged and that she, like other states, will see a lot of activity with the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) to help repair the impacted farmland.\nRick Graden, acting FSA state executive director and executive officer in Illinois, said conservation structures, such as terraces, will need to be rebuilt in areas affected by the floods in southern Illinois.\nFlood waters of the Wabash River cover new corn crop on this southeastern Illinois farm.\n“In the end, we’ll have need for ECP funding to rebuild conservation practices that couldn’t withstand the deluge of Mother Nature,” Graden said.\nWinter Storm Ursa struck parts of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas the same weekend as the central U.S. flooding. The Oklahoma panhandle was one area hit hard by the blizzard where some areas reported up to 18 inches of snow.\nMike Griffin, FSA county executive director for Texas County, Oklahoma, said it was whiteout conditions, with the heavy, wet snow blowing sideways. Cattle piled up in fence corners, or in low-lying areas, to get out of the wintery conditions.\nSome cattle walked right through fences and herds have become comingled. Early estimates show nearly 4,000 head of livestock throughout the Oklahoma panhandle and southwestern Kansas have died in this weather event.\nMother Nature didn’t hold back as eight tornadoes touched down in Henderson and Van Zandt counties in Texas. The County Emergency Board for Henderson and Van Zandt Counties estimate the tornadoes impacted 1,500 farms with damage including: broken pond dams, destruction to livestock fences, damage to machinery, equipment and barns, as well as damage to county roads and bridges. It is estimated that at least 900 head of cattle were killed or are missing as a result of these tornadoes. More than 5,000 homes were damaged or destroyed.\nParts of Florida and Georgia continue to battle a wildfire that began in early April with a lightning strike. According to the Georgia Fish and Wildlife Service, the fire has spread over 148,000 acres. Florida FSA there has been some damage to some nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) where FSA’s Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP) may provide assistance.\nAs the flood waters clear and the cleanup continues, FSA employees will be working alongside the farmers and ranchers to ensure they get the assistance they need to recover from these devastating events.\nFor information on how USDA can provide disaster assistance, visit the Farm Service Agency disaster assistance webpage.\nThis corn field in Pemiscot County, Mo., had water standing on it for several days.\n Category/Topic:\n Farming\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Farm Service Agency\n Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue\n Disaster Assistance\n Farmers\n Ranchers\n Missouri\n Arkansas\n Producers\n Emergency Conservation Program\n Conservation\n Colorado\n Kansas\n Oklahoma\n Texas\n Florida\n Georgia",

Their School of Agriculture and Environmental Science has embraced the Obama Administration’s commitment to protecting the air we breathe, water quality, and land that supports and sustains us.\nThe President has taken unprecedented action to build the foundation for a clean energy economy, tackle the issue of climate change, and protect our environment.  He stated that “As we recover from this recession, the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of jobs - but only if we accelerate that transition. Only if we seize the moment.\"\nAs the Risk Management Agency’s Associate Administrator, representing USDA, I recently carried the message to A&T that we recognize and applaud the innovation and technology used on their research farm to safely and responsibly develop biofuels from animal waste solids, and for using that fuel to power vehicles used on the farm.  On the university farm biofuels are used extensively as replacements or additives for gasoline or diesel, and the educational value it provides is proving to be beneficial to producers and end users alike, thus strengthening small farm communities.\nAs hog operations in North Carolina increase in size, so does the amount of waste and the need for innovative strategies for its disposal and treatment, particularly as water quality regulations improve. Additionally, with the state’s growing population, more people are living near swine operations which increases the level of concern about environmental issues like water pollution and odor.\nIn step with the Chancellor’s vision for an institution that is ‘outwardly engaged,” the university farm uses “constructed wetland cells” containing plant life such as cattails and bulrushes to remove nitrogen, phosphorus and ammonium from swine wastewater, while water in the cells coverts nitrogen to nitrogen gas which is released harmlessly into the air.  Before reaching the wetland cells, swine wastewater flows through two anaerobic lagoons.  After treatment in the cells, wastewater is held in storage prior to land application.  The water is then filtered to the point that it can be used for land application or for washing down swine parlors, the effluent can be applied back onto the fields, and the solids used for Biofuels, essentially completing the renewable cycle.\nWetlands remove excess nitrogen and other waste from the water through filtration, plant uptake, sedimentation and other biological processes.  With soil and plant resources occurring naturally in the wetland environment, wetlands provide a natural buffer between waste and the valuable resource of clean water.\nI was very impressed with the accomplishments at North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University in Greensboro, NC and applaud their efforts. With the considerable environmental challenges our country faces, it is encouraging to meet a talented group of people committed to doing something about it.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Barbara Leach\n Environment\n North Carolina\n RMA",

While driving for work, Enoe stopped to deliver life-saving aid to a tractor trailer driver lying on the side of the highway.\n“Myself and four other drivers pulled over to help,” Enoe said. “Together we took turns providing chest compressions for about 30 minutes. Since no one had a disposable CPR mask, we couldn’t safely provide rescue breathing but we kept the man alive until emergency medical services (EMS) arrived and took over.”\nAt the scene, EMS personnel used an automated external defibrillator (AED) to shock the man multiple times before transporting him to a nearby hospital. Enoe credits the CPR courses USDA offers and tree climber rescue drills for his lifesaving knowhow. He takes a refresher course every two years to maintain his CPR certification and every month his climbing crew stages a mock emergency rescue to keep their skills sharp.\nFour years earlier while driving to inspect a tree, Enoe’s life-saving skills were tested then too.

After issuing a solicitation and competitive bids from domestic suppliers, the Agricultural Marketing Service awarded the first contract for two truckloads—that’s 80,000 pounds —of raw chicken leg quarters for shipment to Chicago’s schools.\nNext the Midwest Food and Nutrition Staff worked with Rachael Ray ’s Yum-o! non-profit to create a healthy, tasty meal. “I had so much fun creating this recipe with Chicago Public Schools,” said Ray. “I tried to create a recipe that would capture the cultural diversity of Chicago and most importantly, that the kids would love to eat.”\nThe result: Windy City Chicken -- a savory meal of chicken, sweet and spicy baked beans, brown rice and orange-glazed carrots. Prepared by food service staff, the new menu itesm were served to thrilled Second City students in more than 450 schools as part of National School Lunch Week on October 13th.  NBC-Chicago, which covered the event, captured the reaction of a number of children who raved about the meal. “It tastes like heaven,” said one student.\nStudents enjoyed the new lunch menu items made possible by a unique collaboration USDA agencies, a celebrity chef, and the Chicago Schools system.\nOctober was National Farm to School Month, which promotes locally-sourced foods in school meal programs, so the menu also featured locally grown food. Chicago Public Schools, through its primary food provider, Chartwells-Thompson, has the largest farm to school program in the Midwest, with more than $2.5 million in fruits and vegetables purchased from regional growers and producers. The carrots used for the special menu are one of the items in CPS’s well-known frozen local program. They were grown within 250 miles of the city, picked at their peak ripeness and flash frozen to preserve their fresh-tasting flavor—and nutrients.\nThe special menu entrée will be served again in the future.

Yet pollinators have been having a rocky time, lately. Beekeepers have struggled to maintain their honey bee colonies, the primary pollinators for our crops in the United States. They are managing a suite of simultaneous and interacting stressors to bee health, including severe weather episodes, inadequate nutrition, exposure to pesticides, and numerous damaging pests and diseases. Native pollinators also seem to be struggling with some of these same stressors, as well as land use change and habitat loss.

CCE is helping new local food businesses get up and running.\nThis, to me, is the most exciting thing: communities’ needs are diverse, and so are federal resources. USDA is not the only federal department hearing, and responding to, inquiries about regional food systems. They’re worked into planning grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Environmental Protection Agency helps communities turn “brownfields” into space for raised planting beds.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supports local food as part of healthy eating efforts. And much more.\nNow, you can learn about these resources on the expanded Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass. Our interactive map now features local food projects funded through ten federal agencies. It’s not comprehensive – we will continue to refresh the in future updates – but it’s guaranteed to spark ideas and help you find new resources to support your work. See what’s happening in your community; search for projects around the country by using the keyword search tab; or download the to analyze it in other ways.\nA few weeks ago in Philadelphia, I saw firsthand how communities are weaving resources together to build strong regional food systems. With partners from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Economic Development Administration, and the Philadelphia Mayor’s office, I visited The Enterprise Center (TEC), a thriving small business accelerator using local food demand to create jobs.\nWe started the morning off at Walnut Hill Community Farm, a project of TEC. The farm was built on land under a long-term lease from SEPTA, the local transit authority. Its farm stand and Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program accept electronic nutrition benefits such as SNAP (food stamps) and have grown at an astounding rate – from 8 CSA shares the first year to 60 in the second.\nFrom there, we headed down the road to The Center for Culinary Enterprises, another project of TEC. It features commercial kitchens, cold storage space, technical assistance and much more, all targeted to small food businesses. We met five local food entrepreneurs who now have access to resources they need to start up or expand.\nThe Center opened in September and projects creating 13 full time and 32 part time jobs, and at least 10 new food businesses to launch or expand as a result of having access to the facility. This will in turn create as many as 200 additional jobs in the first three years of operation.\nTEC’s funding is as diverse as its projects. It includes a variety of foundation, private and public sources, including support from the City of Philadelphia, the U.S. Economic Development Administration, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Walnut Hill Community Farm project received support through USDA’s Farmers Market Promotion Program in to help with infrastructure, development and marketing. This is a prime example of federal, state and local entities coordinating to meet community needs.\nI left TEC inspired by their vision for a comprehensive regional food system and by the goals that this work is helping them meet: job generation and small business development in a low-income area, healthy food access, sustainable land use. And I was inspired by how creative they have been in weaving together a variety of resources and putting them to work to benefit Philadelphia.\nCheck out the expanded KYF Compass map to see other examples and learn about federal resources you may not have known existed.

To roast, meat is placed on a rack in a shallow, uncovered pan and is cooked by the indirect dry heat of an oven.\nThe traditional centerpiece of many holiday meals served this time of year is the roast. Whether you use pork, beef, goose, turkey, or chicken, the most popular means to cook your meat of choice is in the oven.\nThe roasting recipe that was handed down to you from your great grandmother may need a little updating though. Whether it asks you to marinate at room temperature overnight, or cook until ‘the juices run clear,’ some instructions in heirloom recipes might be outdated. To help you make the dish your great grandmother intended, we pulled together a list of holiday roasting tips.\nBeef, Veal, Pork and Lamb: To avoid overcooking beef, veal, pork and lamb roasts use a meat thermometer. These roasts should be removed from the oven when they reach an internal temperature of 145 °F. For safety and quality, allow meat to rest for at least three minutes before carving or consuming. If you’re concerned about serving a dry roast, use a continuous read thermometer or start checking the temperature of your meat earlier then the recipe’s cooking directions.\nTurkey, Duck, and Goose: Domestic ducklings and geese have a great deal of fat. While it helps them float when swimming, fat is undesirable in a cooked duck. Therefore, it’s recommended to prick or score the skin of a whole duck before cooking so that most of the fat will render out. These birds should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 °F as measured by a food thermometer. Temperatures should be taken in three areas of the bird: the thickest part of the breast, the innermost part of the wing, and the innermost part of the thigh. For more information on safe poultry handling and cooking, read our Thanksgiving material.\nFor approximate cooking times to use in meal planning, visit FoodSafety.gov. For reasons of personal preference, consumers may choose to cook meat to higher temperatures but at the recommended temperatures the food is safe to eat. Following the at FoodSafety.gov will ensure that your roast brings you back to holidays past.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n Tags:\n Food Safety\n FSIS\n Holidays\n Meat and Poultry\n safe food handling\n Thanksgiving",

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nEarlier this month, representatives of USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) spent two weeks contacting farmers and ranchers around the nation to find out how much U.S. farmland is planted to specific crops and to determine the number of livestock on U.S. farms and ranches in .  In all, more than 35,000 interviews were conducted, with Texas accounting for about 5,000 of them.\nObtaining actual planting information and figuring out just how much cropland and pastureland is used by U.S. farmers is a massive task that NASS undertakes every year.  The process not only involves a lot of modern technology, but also requires a lot of synergy between NASS Field Offices, field collectors, and the producers themselves.\nTo ensure that all farm and ranch land is accounted for, NASS uses satellite imaging and aerial photography to divide the United States into more than 10,000 sampled land parcels, called segments. Every state in the nation has sampled segments representing their agriculture, with the Lone Star state accounting for over 1,100 of them.\nFrom left to right - Statistical assistant Robert Acosta and supervisory enumerator Dennis Mader review thousands of June surveys in the Texas Field Office while fellow supervisory enumerator Chester Ahrens conducts another telephone survey interview. \nOnce the segments are set, the field observations and personal interviewing begins. This process and the relationship between NASS, the field interviewers and our farmers and ranchers are vital to providing reliable statistics.  Most of the interviewing is handled by trained employees of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA).  Their interaction with farmers and ranchers allows NASS’s statisticians to focus on processing the information as it comes in.\nIn addition to these steps, sometimes the weather can be an obstacle for determining acreage numbers. In , while some states have been battling major floods, Texas and some of our neighbors have been dealing with unprecedented drought and major wildfires.\nBut once again we have been able to pull the resources together and successfully complete our tasks. The results of this major undertaking will become available in two days, when NASS releases the annual June Acreage report, on June 30. The report is highly anticipated by everyone involved in agriculture since it provides an important update to NASS’s Prospective Plantings report, released in March.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n June Acreage report\n NASS\n Prospective Plantings\n Science Tuesday",

The trees represent a future gift of 250 trees that will replace the historic cherry trees to be removed in a project to repair the Tidal Basin seawall that will begin this month. Cherry trees hold deep cultural significance in Japanese tradition and have become beloved symbols in Washington, D.C., celebrated annually during the Cherry Blossom Festival. However, the journey of these trees from Japan to the United States is not without challenges.\nOver a century ago, the mayor of Tokyo learned of First Lady Helen Taft's admiration for Japanese cherry blossoms and offered to send 1,000 trees to beautify Washington, D.C., which he later increased to 5,000. Unfortunately, that first batch of 2,000 trees arrived infested with invasive insect pests and had to be destroyed. This event underscored the need for plant health protection, leading to the passage of the Plant Quarantine Act in .\nToday, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) plays a crucial role in safeguarding the United States against harmful plant pests and diseases. For the recent cherry tree gift, APHIS’ International Services team in Japan played a critical role conveying U.S. import requirements and securing special permits. PPQ and Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries officials meticulously inspected each tree, washed root balls, removed soil, replanted trees in sterile peat moss, and packaged them in pest-proof boxes for the flight.\nUpon arrival and transport to the Beltsville, MD, plant inspection station, PPQ staff thoroughly inspected the trees to ensure they were free of pests and diseases.\nThe trees will now undergo further monitoring and care at the National Plant Germplasm Quarantine Center before being planted along the seawall in the future. This meticulous process ensures that the trees will be strong and healthy, preserving the tradition of the cherry blossoms in the Tidal Basin for years to come.\nPPQ's efforts to safeguard the capital's cherry trees not only honors a longstanding tradition but also serves as a testament to the importance of plant quarantine and the crucial role that APHIS plays in protecting our natural resources from invasive pests and diseases.

Here’s what you need to know:\nCooking Whole Cuts of Pork: USDA has lowered the recommended safe cooking temperature for whole cuts of pork from 160 ºF to 145 ºF with the addition of a three-minute rest time. Cook pork, roasts, and chops to 145 ºF as measured with a food thermometer before removing meat from the heat source, with a three-minute rest time before carving or consuming. This will result in a product that is both safe and at its best quality—juicy and tender.\nCooking Whole Cuts of Other Meats: For beef, veal, and lamb cuts, the safe temperature remains unchanged at 145 ºF, but the department has added a three-minute rest time as part of its cooking recommendations.\nWhat Cooking Temperatures Didn’t Change?\nGround Meats: This change does not apply to ground meats, including beef, veal, lamb, and pork, which should be cooked to 160 ºF and do not require a rest time.\nPoultry: The safe cooking temperature for all poultry products, including ground chicken and turkey, stays the same at 165 ºF.\nWhat Is Rest Time? \n“Rest time” is the amount of time the product remains at the final temperature, after it has been removed from a grill, oven or other heat source. During the three minutes after meat is removed the heat source, its temperature remains constant or continues to rise, which destroys harmful bacteria.\nWhy Did the Recommendations Change?\nIt’s just as safe to cook cuts of pork to 145 º F with a three-minute rest time as it is to cook them to 160 ºF, the previously recommended temperature, with no rest time. The new cooking recommendations reflect the same standards that the agency uses for cooked meat products produced in federally inspected meat establishments, which rely on the rest time of three minutes to achieve a safe product.\nHaving a single time and temperature combination for all meat will help consumers remember the temperature at which they can be sure the meat is safe to eat.\nHow Do You Use a Food Thermometer?\nPlace the food thermometer in the thickest part of the food. It should not touch bone, fat, or gristle. Start checking the temperature toward the end of cooking, but before you expect it to be done. Be sure to clean your food thermometer with hot soapy water before and after each use.\nTo see where to place a food thermometer in different cuts of meat, see Thermometer Placement and Temperatures. For more information on cooking temperatures for all types of food, see the Safe Minimum Cooking Temperatures chart.\nIf you have questions about cooking meat, feel free to contact us at the Hotline or online at Ask USDA.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n Tags:\n Ask Karen\n Food Safety\n food thermometer\n FoodSafety.gov",

        "content": "Rocky Mountain Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in\n Forestry\n Sep 02, \nDr. Richard Reynolds talks with a group of land owners and land managers about the benefits of ponderosa pine forest restoration to wildlife species. Photo credit: Jennifer Hayes, US Forest Service\nIt started with a call from a concerned landowner living on Pine Country Lane, nestled in the foothills just west of Denver. The landscape spread out before them was scarred from previous high-severity fires, the homeowners told their local Conservation District.\nTheir home was sitting at the top of a hill in a tinderbox surrounded by dense forests dying from bark beetle and tussock moth invasions. Decades of fire suppression has altered forests on the Front Range. These forests were historically adapted to frequent low-severity fire and, with suppression, have become fuel-dense and are now comprised of a different species mix.\nThat call was the catalyst to one of the most exciting restoration projects on the Colorado Front Range.\nNatural Resources Conservation Service Colorado state forester Jonas Feinstein, partnership-builder extraordinaire, clued me into this exciting project. Feinstein likened modern forestry, within the context of climate change, to a choose-your-own adventure novel. A dead (or ecologically departed) forest cannot adapt; we need to “restore the forest to a healthier, more complex condition so that it can live to choose its own adventure in the future.”\nThe goal now is to restore ponderosa pine and dry-mixed conifer forests to a more historic state, made of tree groups separated by open grass-forb-shrub areas, so that these forests have a better chance at future survival. Not only does this style of multi-resource restoration and management reduce fire risk and improve forest health, but it is also a huge draw for wildlife.\nFeinstein proceeded to tell me how the U.S. Forest Service’s Rocky Mountain Research Station’s recent publication, General Technical Report 310, Restoring Composition and Structure in Southwestern Frequent-Fire Forests, served as a guidebook for his work in the state. Captivated by Feinstein’s commitment to the land and his stories, I was convinced that I needed to visit these projects and help tell their story to a broader audience.\nAs a result, I found myself on a field trip with landowners from Pine Country Lane and adjacent communities. The landowners were brought together by Joseph Hansen, Jefferson Conservation District’s Conservation Forester, who is totally dedicated to ecologically-based forest restoration. Hansen and Feinstein wanted to show us what implementing ponderosa pine landscape restoration actually looked like on a demonstration site.\nSitting on a promontory overlooking vast sweeps of forest, the discussion focused on the many benefits of this project, especially wildland fire protection. They had learned of GTR-310, and knew there was a scientific basis for what was being recommended. As Richard Reynolds, research wildlife biologist at the Rocky Mountain Research Station, stepped forward to answer a question related to the benefits to wildlife, the owners got even more excited. Learning about this type of landscape restoration from the scientist who wrote the book seemed to validate their decisions to be part of the project.\nIt was really inspiring to spend time with these landowners – each in a different stage of project participation, from planning to complete – hearing their thoughts on why they want to participate or how they feel now that the work is done. Nancy and Ed Zorensky own the property on which we are standing. They moved here from New York in the s and embody the Colorado lifestyle.\n“It has been an evolution of understanding,” Nancy Zorensky said. “We will miss the trees, but overall, we know it [the forest] is healthier.”\nNeighboring property owner, Beverly Mozzetti concurred.\n“We want to do whatever is right for our property as long as science has said it is what is best for the land,” she said. “We are doing this for the next generation.”\nLandowner Julie Sobota said, “We live here because of the landscape…now that we have done this we are seeing butterflies and birds like never before, and this is just the first year.”\nA goal is to work to tie together across landscapes (ponderosa pine and dry-mixed conifer forests) with strategic and contiguous treatments. This means that while they are doing this work on roughly 1,230 acres of private land, the hope is that other neighboring property owners will also be able to treat their lands following the same underlying principles.\n“We are investing and managing for an authentic altered landscape that will pay ecological dividends for decades,” said Hansen.\nCollaboration across agencies and ownerships in these mosaic forests is key to successful landscape restoration in the Colorado Front Range. Seeing science being used as the underlying basis for land management decision making has built trust with the public. The restoration projects are clearly more than just a fire treatment and the locals are beginning to understand that. As Feinstein says, “this is forestry because of ecology; not forestry in consideration of ecology.”\nGTR-310 science delivery videos are available online.\nThis post is part of a series featuring the Forest Service’s work on restoration across the country. Forest Service Research & Development is celebrating 100 years of service and is proud to provide science in support of national restoration objectives.\nOverlooking most recent restoration treatment area on Pine County Lane in the foreground and a stand impacted by Tussock Moth in the background.

        "content": "& Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Lisa Jackson in\n Conservation\n Energy\n Apr 27, \n At Monty Collins' cattle operation near Pleasantville, a rotational grazing system helps protect soil and water quality. A few miles away near Prairie City, Gordon Wassenaar has used no-till farming and a precision sprayer for years to minimize pesticide use and runoff from his soybean fields. We visited both of these Iowa farmers last week, to discuss the collaboration between the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and farmers, ranchers and growers all across America.\nAmerican farmers are among our nation's first and finest conservationists. They understand better than anyone that clean water, clear air and healthy soil are the raw materials for agricultural production. From generations of experience, they know that you cannot continually take from the soil without giving back, and they have made incredible strides to protect the land they rely on.\nShared goals\n As members of President Obama's Cabinet, we have worked to ensure close collaboration between the USDA and the EPA. Our agencies share many of the same goals. We want our families to have clean water to drink and air to breathe. We want the nation's land to remain productive and healthy for our children. And we want to support our nation's farmers, ranchers and growers so they remain profitable and successful in their work to feed American families and strengthen the American economy.\nLast week was our first opportunity to travel together - though we have each been active in our work with the agricultural community. Talking to farmers is everyday work at the USDA, while senior EPA officials have met with hundreds of farmers and ranchers in the past two years. Visiting a cattle and a row-crop operation in Iowa was a great reminder of American agriculture's incredible productivity, and an opportunity to see first hand the cutting-edge conservation measures American farmers have pioneered over the past decades.\nStrides have been made\nIn the last 30 years alone, our nation's producers have worked hand in hand with government officials and local conservation groups to reduce soil erosion by more than 40 percent. At the same time, agriculture has gone from being the leading contributor to wetland loss to leading the entire nation in wetland restoration efforts.\nThe EPA has taken important steps to support not only this conservation work, but also the profitability of American farmers. The Renewable Fuel Standard we finalized last year will encourage farmers to continue to work with industry to innovate and produce clean renewable fuel. It will help secure our nation's energy future, replacing our dependence on foreign oil with clean, homegrown fuels produced by America's farmers. At the same time, it will create jobs, and should increase farmers' income by an estimated $13 billion annually.\nAddressing untruths\nOur work with farmers has also allowed us to address some of the misconceptions and myths about the EPA.\nFor a while, rumors flew around that, under a law passed by Congress, EPA was considering treating spilled milk like an oil spill. This was never the case; in fact, our efforts were focused on exempting dairy producers from regulations that should not apply to them. Thanks to the relationship between EPA and USDA - and work with the dairy industry and the agricultural community - we obtained a formal exemption for all milk and milk products, a change that could save farmers up to $140 million.\nAnother issue that is subject to myths and misconceptions is the question of farm dust. To be clear: We understand that you can't farm without dust. But Congress has mandated that we take a look at the science of various pollutants - including particulate matter in dust - every five years. This is something EPA has been doing for decades. And we are in regular communication with farmers and ranchers on this issue.\nThe collaborative relationship we and our respective agencies enjoy is reflected in our policy. Both the USDA and the EPA are pursuing common-sense standards that will let farmers make the decisions they feel are best for their own operations. If we are going to solve the major environmental challenges of our time - combating climate change, reducing soil erosion, and ensuring an ample supply of clean water for our families and food production - farmers need more than just a seat at the table. They need to help lead the way.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Energy\n Tags:\n Conservation\n Energy\n EPA\n Iowa\n Lisa Jackson\n Pleasantville\n President Obama\n Renewable Energy\n Renewable Fuel Standard\n Tom Vilsack",

Over the past three years, USDA Rural Development has helped to create or save more than jobs in Southwestern Wisconsin alone.\nThe forum explored regional efforts and partnerships, in conjunction with USDA Rural Development’s assistance, that have contributed to economic development, job creation/sustainability, and the expansion of necessary community services, on a regional level, in Southwestern Wisconsin.\n“While this forum provides an opportunity to reflect on some pretty significant accomplishments in this region, there is still much to be done. We need to look for ways to build new partnerships, gain greater cooperation between federal, state, and local governments, add value and diversity to our productive capacity and build rural communities that will last,” said Stan Gruszynski, USDA Rural Development State Director.\nForum attendees listen to guest speakers describing current efforts, and the positive affect they have had on improving the economic climate in Southwestern WI.\nUSDA Rural Development assisted 29 businesses and producers, helping to created more than 780 jobs. This includes a Value Added Producer Grant to Willow Creek Farms Charcuterie, Inc., an old fashioned purebred Berkshire hog farm in Prairie du Sac, Wis., to provide working capital to expand products and market penetration.\nIn addition, more than $11.8 million went to support critical projects including schools, hospitals, and first responder equipment through the Community Facilities Program, in 31 communities. For example, the Village of Gays Mills was awarded $1,383,800 in loans and grants in disaster recovery from the floods, and to assist in moving the village to higher ground. Projects include; new village community center, fire truck, snowplow equipment and public works building.\nGuest Speakers explained current efforts, and the positive affect they have had on improving the economic climate in Southwestern Wis. The organizations represented cited the successful use of Rural Development programs to expand needed community services, create jobs, and promote economic development.\nTony and Sue Renger, owners of Willow Creek Farms Charcuterie, Inc., told attendees about their naturally raised Berkshire hogs. They operate a small USDA certified processing facility.\nThose attending the event also toured the new Southwest Community Action Program (SWCAP) offices and expanded dental clinic facility, currently under construction. A USDA Rural Development Community Facilities Direct Loan helped to fund the project. The existing facility was inadequate for the volume of patients in the area that need medical and dental services.  To help fulfill this need, SWCAP has partnered with Access Community Health Center for the purpose of providing essential dental services to low income families.\nThe S.W.

USDA Photo: Tom Witham.\nDignitaries from the White House and USDA held a tree planting ceremony Thursday beside the National Mall to commemorate Tu B’Shevat, the Jewish New Year of the Tree. Thinking about the people planting that young Redbud tree to honor the conservation ethic of the Jewish community, I was reminded of just how important trees are to all of us.\nIn my job as the Chief of the U.S. Forest Service, I’m charged with leading the agency that manages 193 million acres of forests that belong to the American people, as well as providing assistance in the management of 500 million acres of state and private forests and 100 million acres of urban forests. That’s a tremendous responsibility for the agency, one that often requires thinking in terms of the big picture, and how our decisions will impact the landscape in 30, 50, or even 100 years.\nThe fact is, trees are tremendously important for all of us. In our forests, they provide rich habitats, capture storm water and help counteract the effects of climate change. But did you know that urban trees provide the same benefits? Trees in our communities help keep our rivers clean, filter our city air, and provide millions in savings on energy costs. Many people are unaware that trees properly placed around buildings can reduce air conditioning needs by 30 percent and save 20 to 50 percent in energy used to heat our homes and offices.\nThere are organizations in almost every town dedicated to helping volunteers plant trees in their communities. Tree-plantings can be a wonderful experience for the whole family, and help carry forward the conservation ethic inherent in Tu B’Shevat. The Arbor Day Foundation and American Forests are good resources to help you find a local tree event.\nThe Forest Service also offers a free online software suite that not only tells you what your neighborhood trees are doing for you, but can also help you decide where in your yard to plant a tree to reap the most benefits.\nTrees are being planted in celebration of Tu B’Shevat all over the world, and it’s my hope that these events will introduce more people to the good they can do in their communities by volunteering to plant trees.\nWe should all share the conservation values represented by Tu B’Shevat, the New Year of the Tree – our wellbeing, and the wellbeing of our children and grandchildren, depend on it.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Center for Faith Based and Neighborhood Partnerships\n clean air\n Conservation\n Energy\n FBNP\n Forestry\n FS\n new year\n planting trees\n Tom Tidwell\n trees\n urban forest\n White House",

USDA photo.\nWith large areas of our planet heating up because of climate change, some trees (and plants) are pulling up roots and heading north, to higher elevations and to cooling climes—well, sort of.\nA U.S. Forest Service-led study suggests there are a few dozen tree species in the eastern U.S. that are moving north at an unexpected rate.\n“For some plants and trees, moving north is real and their only chance for survival,” said Chris Woodall, a research forester for Northern Research Station and the study’s author. “Our study confirms a link between global warming and forest migration. It’s no longer conjecture.”\nIn fact, some tree species may be able to migrate from their home range more than 60 miles in a century. That could mean the yellow birch from the eastern U.S. might cross into Canada by the early s. Other trees that are moving north or to higher elevations include the northern white cedar, American basswood, sugar maple, black ash and bigtooth aspen.\nTrees depend on wind currents, birds or other animals to transport their seeds. Now seeds deposited in northern ranges, that were once too cold for these species, have also warmed and are now suitable for some migrating trees and plant species to take root.\nAnother study led by the University of Arizona found Alligator juniper at an elevation of 3,500 feet in the upland desert and grasslands of the Catalina Mountains near Tucson. Today, you won’t find the first stands of alligator junipers until you reach 5,000 feet.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Alligator juniper\n American basswood\n Arizona\n bigtooth aspen\n black ash\n Canada\n Chris Woodall\n Climate Change\n Forestry\n FS\n Northern Research Station\n northern white cedar\n sugar maple\n trees\n University of Arizona\n yellow birch",

Breakfasts, lunches, and snacks sold during the school day are now more nutritious than ever, with less fat and sodium and more whole-grains, fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and low-fat dairy. For many kids, the meals they get at school may be the only nutritious meals they receive that day -- and when children receive proper nourishment, they are not only healthier, but they also have better school attendance and perform better academically. It's not enough, though, to make the meals healthier -- we must ensure that children have access to those healthier foods.\nThe Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act authorized a program, known as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), that can help schools achieve their educational goals by ensuring that children in low-income communities have access to healthy meals at school so they are ready to learn. In this program, schools agree to offer breakfast and lunch for free to all students, and cover any costs that exceed the reimbursements from USDA. Designed to ease the burden of administering a high volume of applications for free and reduced price meals, CEP is a powerful tool to both increase child nutrition and reduce paperwork at the district, school, and household levels, which saves staff time and resources for cash-strapped school districts.\n Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Education Secretary Arne Duncan\n Posted in\n Food and Nutrition\n Jul 15, \n 1 Response",

The BMLP program rotates participants every three months to a new location in the U.S. With all of that going on, Lisa finds the time to ensure that my military training schedule is accommodated. While I was on military assignment, she maintained contact with me and made sure I was doing all right. When there was a problem with may pay due to my military leave, she swiftly took care of the issue and ensured I received back pay. The amazing part is that she does it all with grace.\nI know from my experience at NRCS, in management operations, and as a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserves how important good leadership is. Lisa is a prime example of how to lead, motivate and inspire a group of employees. I consider myself lucky to be in this leadership program, and privileged to have Lisa as my boss and my mentor.\nThe Patriot Award is more than just a certificate and a lapel pin. They are symbols of Lisa’s unwavering commitment to her military employees. The Patriot Award shows that Lisa goes that extra step above and beyond the written policy to ensure that her employees are taken care of, whether they are fulfilling duties under her at NRCS or conducting missions with the U.S. Army Reserves.\nThe award ceremony took place at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Portland, Oregon on August 2, , in front of an audience of about 50.

Ross Elementary School and Eugene A. Tighe Middle School in Margate City, NJ came in first place.  The schools’ Garden Gourmet tasting program allows students to sample the fresh fruits and vegetables harvested from the garden—and the garden opportunities don’t end at lunch!  At Ross Elementary, students digitally photograph vegetable beds and write multiplication and division word problems based on the garden layout.  These math word problems are then solved by fourth grade students.\nHonorable mentions went to Lawrenceville Elementary School in Lawrenceville, NJ and St. Philip’s Academy in Newark, NJ.  Both schools also found fun, exciting ways to incorporate their gardens into classroom curricula.  Lawrenceville Elementary’s kindergarteners used leaves of all different shapes and sizes from the garden in their math lessons on measurement.  The school’s second and third graders incorporated food into their lessons on world exploration by discussing the origins of today’s familiar foods.\nLessons at St. Philip’s Academy in Newark, NJ put an emphasis on fresh, healthy foods like those grown in their garden.\nThird graders from St. Philip’s Academy used their garden for a “Garden Fresh Pasta” project.  Science lessons taught students how to tell when crops are ready to harvest. Students then got to work using their writing, math, and cooking skills in designing and preparing a seasonal pasta recipe based on the garden’s offerings.\nThe contest, sponsored by Edible Jersey, Whole Foods Markets, and Applegate Farms, was open to any Pre K-12 New Jersey school with a school garden.  Interested in learning more about school gardens and incorporating food literacy into the classroom?  Read about USDA’s Farm to School effort and visit the Let’s Move!

        "content": "in\n Initiatives\n Conservation\n Food and Nutrition\n Nov 22, \n Cross posted from the Dairy Good blog: \nAcross the nation, Americans from all walks of life are taking steps to reduce the amount of food that goes to waste. Part of the solution lies in finding innovative new ways to use food that would otherwise by wasted. That’s where the Cleveland Browns, Ohio State University, the City of Cleveland, the Dairy Innovation Center and other partners are stepping in to help.\nOn Sunday, November 24, this new partnership will begin taking waste from FirstEnergy Stadium and turning it into clean, renewable energy. Anaerobic digesters like the one in Cleveland are being built in greater numbers across the nation.  In fact, working together with the dairy industry, USDA has provided more than 240 awards since to construct anaerobic digesters.\nFood waste is a big challenge for our nation for many reasons.\nFirst, it’s a food security issue. Wholesome food that’s wasted could help feed needy families through donations to food pantries and soup kitchens. In , the amount of uneaten food in homes and restaurants was valued at roughly $390 per U.S. consumer – more than an average month’s worth of food expenditures.\nSecond, food waste is a natural resource issue. In , 133 billion pounds of food in U.S. retail food stores, restaurants, and homes never made it into peoples’ stomachs. It takes about 22 million acres of land to produce that much food – in other words, enough land to cover more than three-fourths of Ohio.\nThird, food waste is a climate change issue.  Food is the single largest component of municipal solid waste going to landfills – and those landfills are the third largest source of methane.  By reducing the amount of food we toss into the trash, we can help reduce these potent greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency and a range of private and non-profit partners, USDA has created a new Food Waste Challenge to fight this problem. The Food Waste Challenge encourages folks to do three simple things. First, to find new ways to reduce food loss and waste. Second, to recover unneeded, wholesome food that can help feed those in need. And third, to recycle wasted food as much as possible.\nWhen it comes to reducing food waste, all of us are in this together. I’m proud of the effort being made in Cleveland, and I appreciate the hard work that’s gone into this new project at the FirstEnergy Stadium. At USDA, we’re committed to combating food waste and making our nation stronger in the process.\nYou can learn more about the U.S. Food Waste Challenge at \n Category/Topic:\n Initiatives\n Conservation\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Cleveland\n dairy\n EPA\n Food Waste Challenge\n Ohio\n Ohio State University\n Tom Vilsack",

The exhibit features American innovation and entrepreneurship through history, focusing on advancements in agriculture. The exhibit opened July 1, .\nThis summer we were given the opportunity to intern with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and throughout our experiences we have learned a lot about the agricultural industry and rural America. Today, agriculture plays a huge role in driving the rural economy and the American economy at large, but we realized it is also important to know how far we have come and what it took for us to get here. To get a better understanding, we took a field trip across the National Mall to Smithsonian Institute’s National Museum of American History American Enterprise exhibit, which launched on July 1st. We were excited to learn more about the role the USDA plays in people’s lives and the immense amount of history we are a part of.\nThe exhibit encompassed the history of American businesses from corporate companies to small farms and everything in between. We were pleased to see how much the exhibit focused on the journey of American agriculture, from the mid-s to present day.  We were able to interact with pieces of history that represented major successes as well as the setbacks that agriculture faced as we proceeded through a life-sized timeline of videos, pictures, historical trivia, and games.\nMuch of the exhibit focused on the ability of American ingenuity to triumph over struggles and obstacles across sectors and throughout history--American agriculture included. One of the major changes in agriculture that the exhibit documents is technological advancement, with exhibits and examples from every era of American history. In the s nearly 80% of the population was farmers but by the s the number was halved to just 40% of the population. Today, the percent of American farmers in our country has decreased to less than 2%, indicating the increasing efficiency of the agricultural industry. The efficiency increase can be credited in part to the tools and resources that have become available over the years. From horses to horse power; from Eli Whitney’s cotton gin and the McCormick binder to the Fordson tractor, the country has seen substantial technological change over a short period of time.\nFrom to the U.S. faced nine different economic recessions, and during each of these difficult periods, people in both rural and urban areas depended on their neighbors. Farming families had to make crucial decisions about their farms and ranches. There were people, such as Portia Sperry, who developed small businesses to get their communities thriving again. In the ’s Sperry designed a children’s doll, recruited farm women to help make them, and then convinced Marshall Field to sell them. In a time of struggle, Sperry is just one of many Americans who turned to her community to build something positive. As one of the phrases on the wall said, “Farmers do a lot more than just drive tractors.”\nWe know from our time here at USDA that the past ingenuity and current innovations of farmers and ranchers allow the agricultural industry to remain central to America’s economic success and vitality. This exhibit showed the triumphs that we have had in the past and gives us confidence that agriculture and rural America will remain our nation's strong foundation well into the future.\nJimmy Carter’s jacket from his time in Future Farmers of America on display at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History.

These initiatives include:\n Investments in conservation programs bolstered by the Inflation Reduction Act, including the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP)\n Investments in rural jobs and community infrastructure\n The Rural Partners Network (RPN)\n The ReConnect Loan and Grant Program\n The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP)\nWASHINGTON, November 1, - Today, President Biden will travel to Northfield, Minnesota to visit Dutch Creek Farms to lead his Administration’s Investing in Rural America Event Series and highlight investments from the Biden Administration in Rural America. During the visit, President Biden will announce over $5 billion in new investments from his Investing in America agenda – including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act – to advance rural prosperity, economic development, competition, and sustainability. President Biden will also discuss how Bidenomics and his Investing in America agenda are ensuring rural Americans do not have to leave their hometowns to find opportunity.\nOver the course of two weeks, President Biden, Cabinet members, and Senior Administration Officials are barnstorming across the country as part of the Investing in Rural America Event Series to highlight how the Biden-Harris Administration’s investments are bringing new revenue to farms, increased economic development in rural towns and communities, and more opportunity throughout the country.\nTo lead the Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in Rural America Event Series, President Biden will announce over $5 billion in new investments in rural America, including:\n$1.7 Billion in Investments in Climate-Smart Agriculture: The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is announcing nearly $1.7 billion in funding to support the adoption of climate-smart agriculture practices, which have direct climate mitigation benefits, advance a host of other environmental co-benefits, and offer farmers, ranchers and foresters new revenue streams. Dutch Creek Farms, where President Biden will visit today, is a family farm that grows corn and soybeans and raises hogs. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, Dutch Creek Farms has used several climate-smart agriculture techniques to make their farm more sustainable, including growing crops that naturally sequester carbon and improve soil quality, farming in a way that limits soil disturbance, and creating riparian buffers to protect nearby waterways from pollutants.\nThe funding President Biden will announce includes an unprecedented $1.1 billion investment across 81 projects through the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), which takes a voluntary approach to expand the reach of conservation efforts and climate-smart agriculture through public-private partnerships. The announcement also includes fiscal year investments from the Inflation Reduction Act that are helping farmers adopt climate-smart agriculture practices. Through the Inflation Reduction Act, USDA has enrolled more farmers and more acres in voluntary conservation programs than at any point in history, following a backlog that has existed for years. In , USDA enrolled nearly 5,300 additional producers in conservation programs across all 50 states (above what otherwise would have been possible through Farm Bill and appropriations funding), which will provide significant climate mitigation benefits. Today’s announcement includes:\n $100 million through the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP);\n $ewardship Program (CSP); and\n $250 million through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP).\n$1.1 Billion in Investments in Rural American Infrastructure: USDA is announcing $1.1 billion across 104 loan and grant awards to upgrade infrastructure in rural communities that will bring new jobs, clean water and fuel, and reliable electricity to people in nearly every state. This funding includes $5 million from the Inflation Reduction Act to further increase the availability of renewable, homegrown biofuels. The announcement is part of President Biden’s Investing in America efforts to rebuild the physical infrastructure of our country to grow the economy for decades to come, create good-paying jobs, and better position rural America to compete in a global economy.\n$2 Billion in Investments to Partner with Rural Communities to Create Jobs and Support Rural-led Economic Development: USDA is announcing $2 billion across 99 economic development projects in Rural Partners Network (RPN) communities in nine states and Puerto Rico – funding that will create jobs and build infrastructure as well as increase access to quality health care, affordable housing, and clean water and energy. RPN is transforming the way the federal government partners with rural communities by putting federal employees on the ground to help rural communities access federal resources. Last year, the Biden-Harris Administration launched Rural.gov to help connect all rural communities to federal resources. Today, the Administration is announcing it is piloting a new resource clearinghouse function on Rural.gov with funding opportunities for rural communities to facilitate access to federal programs.\n$274 Million to Expand Critical Rural High-Speed Internet Infrastructure: USDA is announcing nearly $274 million across 16 grant and loan awards to expand access to high-speed internet for people living and working across eight states. These investments include $260 million as part of the fourth round of the ReConnect Program funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which provided a total of $65 billion to ensure every American has access to affordable, reliable high-speed internet. In total, the Biden-Harris Administration is investing $90 billion to deliver affordable high-speed internet to everyone in America, including in rural communities that often lack access to high-speed internet.\n$145 Million to Expand Access to Renewable Energy and Lower Energy Costs for Rural Americans: USDA is announcing $145 million in funding for 700 loan and grant awards through the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) to help agricultural producers and rural small business owners make energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy investments to lower energy costs, generate new income, and strengthen the resiliency of their operations. This funding is made possible in part by President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act – the nation’s largest-ever investment in combatting the climate crisis.\nThese announcements build on billions of dollars in investments the Biden-Harris Administration has already made to support rural America, including through expanding access to markets and increasing competition for farmers and producers. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA has committed $1 billion to expand independent meat and poultry processing capacity to give farmers more market options and fairer prices, and reduce reliance on a small handful of large meat and poultry corporations. USDA has also made available $900 million to spur the production of independent, American-made fertilizer, create jobs in rural America, and give farmers more options. These investments were funded in part by the President’s American Rescue Plan and USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation.\nTo learn more about the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic investments in rural America, visit the Fact Sheet.\n#\nUSDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer, and lender.",

        "content": "Administrator, National Agricultural Statistics Service in\n Research and Science\n Aug 13, \n This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. \nOne of the most exciting aspects of my job as the head of USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and an advocate for statistical literacy is to see students coming into the profession of statistics. We are fortunate, according to Bob Rodriguez, past-president of the American Statistical Association (ASA) in a column published in ASA’s AMSTATNEWS, “that the number of students majoring or minoring in statistics is soaring because of positive experiences in AP Statistics courses. The word is out that statistics is a ‘must’.”\nEngaging students even earlier than high school is important not only for developing future statisticians but also so that they understand the importance of responding to surveys.  Both private and government statistics, including those about agriculture from my agency, are dependent on voluntary survey response.\nThis is why we are working with other organizations to bring science and statistics to the classroom.  Some time ago, I worked with colleagues in other countries to develop a Census at School classroom activity.  It brings statistics to students in an interesting and fun way. Students complete a brief online survey, analyze their class’s census results, and compare their class with random samples from students in the United States and other countries.\nNASS recently partnered with ASA and the National Agriculture in the Classroom organization to create a food preference lesson plan that uses the Census at School questions about students’ favorite foods, making an agricultural connection.  The lesson introduces real-life ways to use statistics and addresses numerous common core standards for grades 5-8.\nEarly exposure to statistics was not something available to me when I was a student. I found statistics quite by accident as a graduate student in mathematics. I was looking for a field in which I could use my math background and found the Statistics Department at Iowa State University.\nMaking statistics interesting to students is critical and should not be hard.  A quick scan of recent titles in Significance, a joint magazine of ASA and the British Royal Statistical Society, shows statistics-based articles on whether slams in tennis matches convert to wins; the cost of preserving biodiversity on Earth; precision agriculture; using statistics for disaster relief in Haiti; renewable energy and climate change; breast implants; Hitchcock, statistics and film; and combinations of policies that would win votes, to name just a few.\nOf particular interest to students (and their parents) should be the projected demand for good jobs for statisticians.  Analysts from the research firm PayScale used its compensation database along with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ job growth projections through to determine the most valuable college majors according to a Forbes magazine article. The story stated that statistics was among the top 15 majors for its value in terms of salary and career prospects.\nWe know we will continue to need statisticians in government to provide accurate, useful and timely public for policy, personal and business decisions of all kinds.  We are working hard to see that educational opportunities at all levels encourage students to enter scientific fields, including statistics.\nNext generation of farmers learned all about the Census of Agriculture and agricultural statistics at last year’s Future Farmers of America convention in Indianapolis.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Back to School\n Biodiversity\n Bureau of Labor Statistics\n census\n Climate Change\n disaster\n Iowa\n Iowa State University\n NASS\n Renewable Energy\n Science Tuesday",

        "content": "Release & Contact Info\n Fact Sheet\n Release No. .24\n Contact: USDA Press\nEmail: press@usda.gov\n WASHINGTON, June 25, – The pandemic revealed how bottlenecks in the food and agriculture supply chain threatened consumers with higher costs and reduced access to key products, while producers faced collapsed markets and unfair prices. Meanwhile, marketplace abuses in concentrated markets have been longstanding concerns in key sectors such as meat and poultry.\nUnder President Biden’s historic Executive Order on Promoting Competition in America’s Economy and as set out in our competition report, USDA has led a whole-of-USDA and partaken in a whole-of-government initiative to improve the competitive landscape in food and agricultural markets. With landmark investments, new rules and enforcement, and a wide-ranging realignment of policies, the Biden-Harris USDA has brought meaningful, lasting change and delivered on its commitment to fair and competitive markets that serve the interests of working family consumers and the American farmer alike.\nHighlights of USDA’s efforts include:\nDelivering on unprecedented multibillion dollar investment plan to sustainably lower costs for consumers and boost choice for producers, by directly incentivizing competition in food processing and fertilizer.\nUSDA is delivering on its commitment to invest $1 billion to expand independent meat and poultry processing capacity across the country as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Action Plan for a Fairer, More Competitive, and More Resilient Meat and Poultry Supply Chain.\nTo enable sustained success, USDA has supported a range of critical needs:\n Direct processing capacity expansion. USDA is expanding processing capacity for farmers in 26 states by investing $208 million in 35 small and mid-sized businesses, through the Meat and Poultry Processing Expansion Program (MPPEP).\n Local processing options. $9.5 million to 42 projects through the Local Meat Capacity Grant program is building resilience in the meat and poultry supply chain by modernizing, increasing, diversifying, and decentralizing meat and poultry processing capacity. This initial set of awards covers 27 states and Puerto Rico. An additional round of awards will be announced soon.\n Enhanced financing options. The USDA RD Rural Business and Cooperative Service (RBCS) has awarded $275 million in grants to 29 eligible lenders in the Meat and Poultry Intermediary Lending Program (MPILP) to date. Awards established revolving loan funds to increase access to capital for processors who want to start or expand processing capacity for meat and poultry.\n Workforce Training. USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is awarding specified universities grants of up to $15 million to support agricultural workforce training for historically underserved communities. Work in these programs supports development of meat and poultry processing training and educational materials for place-based needs, particularly relevant to small or mid-sized farms and ranches.\n Food safety compliance, especially at smaller facilities. AMS awarded $53 million through 237 grants in 45 states through the Meat and Poultry Inspection Readiness Grant Program (MPIRG) to help currently operational meat and poultry slaughter and processing facilities obtain a Federal Grant of Inspection or operate as a State-inspected facility under a Cooperative Interstate Shipment (CIS) program.\n Management Technical Assistant. USDA is investing up to $25 million through the Meat and Poultry Processing Capacity - Technical Assistance Program (MPPTA) to ensure that participants in USDA’s Meat and Poultry Supply Chain initiatives have access full-range technical assistance to support their project development and success. Six organizations are serving as technical assistance providers, and since its launch in , the program has helped over 1,ates.\n Tribal Capacity. USDA has invested nearly $50 million in the Indigenous Animals Harvesting and Meat Processing Grant Program that will improve tribal nations’ food and agricultural supply chain resiliency by developing and expanding value-added infrastructure related to meat from indigenous animals like bison, reindeer or salmon.\n Research and Innovation. In March , the University of Arkansas was awarded a $5 million grant from the AFRI Center of Excellence for Meat and Poultry Processing and Food Safety Research and Innovation (MPPFSRI). In addition, $13.9 million in grants from the Meat and Poultry Processing Research and Innovation – Small Business Innovation Research Phase III – program were awarded to 14 small and mid-sized meat and poultry processors who will trial food safety and quality assurance technologies. These grants are administered by USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture.\nMaking innovative investments in fertilizer production that will deliver independent, made-in-America, innovative, sustainable and farmer-focused new capacity.\nUSDA has also stood up and dedicated $900 million for the Fertilizer Production Expansion Program. USDA has announced 57 projects in 29 states for a total amount of $251 million under the program. Examples of recipients include a business in Washington state that uses patented technology to manufacture and process raw manure and fish waste into fertilizer, and another in Alabama that uses slow-release technology to improve nutrient efficiency.\nReinvigorating USDA’s century-old fair and competitive market laws with new rules and enforcement to counter unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive practices and empower producers and growers.\nUSDA has put forth a suite of critical new rules under the Packers and Stockyards Act of (P&S Act) to promote transparency in poultry contracting and tournaments, address unfairness and deception in broiler grower payments, poultry grower ranking systems, and capital improvement systems, prohibit discrimination, retaliation, and deception in a range of circumstances, and provide better clarity around unfair practices and competitive injury. With two final rules and two more proposed rules, USDA is delivering on its commitment to make lasting change that works.\nThe “Transparency in Poultry Contracting and Tournaments” final rule gives broiler chicken growers better insight into the opportunities and risks before making key financial decisions, such as entering a poultry growing arrangement or making an additional capital investment. And to help growers be better growers and to protect growers against potential deceptive practices, the rule requires integrators to give growers key information about the inputs they receive under tournament-specific input disclosures.\nThe “Inclusive Competition and Market Integrity” final rule prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, sexual orientation, religious affiliation and certain other basic characteristics; bans retaliatory practices to protect activities such as communicating with government agencies, joining producer or grower associations, being a witness in a proceeding against a packer or live poultry dealer, and asserting legal and contractual rights; and offers protection against deceptive contracting that are false, misleading, and result in harm to producers.\nThe “Poultry Grower Payment Systems and Capital Improvement Systems” proposed rule would prohibit deductions from the base price in contracts for broiler chicken growers, permitting only bonuses for performance. The rule would also establish a duty of fair comparison to ensure grower comparisons (tournaments) are conducted in a reasonable and equitable way that does not disadvantage specific growers. It would also provide critical information to enable growers to better identify risks that may arise on capital improvement practices and enhance the ability for USDA to enforce existing prohibitions on unfair capital improvement practices.\nThe “Fair and Competitive Livestock and Poultry Markets” proposed rule provides clarity regarding the prohibition on unfair practices under the Packers Stockyards Act and the relationship to competitive injury, including harms to market participants and harms to markets. This proposed rule seeks to provide a workable guideline on how the prohibitions on unfair practices will operate and be enforced.\nAMS will also be releasing later this summer a report on access to retail markets and is working on a rule to improve transparency and price discovery in cattle markets.\nIn addition, AMS has enhanced its enforcement partnership with the U.S. Department of Justice, including establishing a new joint tips and complaints portal at farmerfairness.gov. Further examples of this robust enforcement partnership include a case against a poultry company to halt their use of termination fees to penalize broiler chicken growers from switching processors and a landmark case against the third largest poultry processor addressing deception in tournaments.\nUSDA has established an innovative partnership with the State Attorneys General to share resources and enhance enforcement of unfair and anticompetitive practices in food and agriculture.\nSupporting transparency.\nIn February , USDA finalized a new rule that only permits the voluntary “Product of USA” or “Made in the USA” claim to be applied to those FSIS-regulated meat and poultry products that are derived from animals born, raised, slaughtered and processed in the United States, which better aligns with consumer understanding of what the label means.\nFSIS is also engaged in a review of animal-raising claims for labels of FSIS-regulated products, such as “no antibiotics ever” and “pasture-raised.” High quality standards and verification on labels are important to prevent consumer confusion and ensure that the market reflects those choices with the consumer’s hard-earned dollar.\nLaunched in , USDA’s pilot Cattle Contracts Library, provides new disclosure to the industry and public regarding the key terms, conditions, and volumes under which cattle are contracted, bringing sunshine to practices in what is now the largest part of the cattle market. USDA continues to work with Congress to enable this pilot program to deliver meaningful and lasting value to producers.\nUSDA is also launching a new visualization tool, the Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) Live Cattle Dashboard, providing users the ability to view and access LMR live cattle market information in a manner that is easy to use and understand. AMS also will begin publishing additional information on the actual net premiums and discounts paid to cattle producers by packers under formula marketing arrangements and detailed quality grade price distribution information. The enhanced insight gained from these powerful tools places producers on a more equal footing with large volume users and fosters a fairer and more competitive marketplace. Public access to this dashboard will be available this summer.\nCreating a fairer market for seeds, other agricultural inputs.\nIn March , USDA released a report, titled “More and Better Choices for Farmers: Promoting Fair Competition and Innovation in Seeds and Other Agricultural Inputs,” that includes recommendations for improving market fairness. USDA took immediate action on three of these recommendations:\n USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) stood up a new Farmer Seed Liaison that is working to boost transparency and reduce confusion in a complex seed system by helping facilitate communication between farmers and plant breeders and the patent system. Ensuring the patent system gets the best information regarding seed science and practices enables patents to serve their appropriate function in rewarding genuine innovation, and prevent the inappropriate use of patents as government-granted monopolies.\n AMS released a Notice to Trade regarding compliance with disclosing the kind and variety of seeds under the Federal Seed Act. USDA has also made it easier for farmers and seed businesses to report tips and complaints related to competition and consumer protection in the seed markets through enhanced links at its FarmerFairness.gov portal.\n USDA and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) formed a Working Group on IP & Competition in Seeds and Other Agricultural Inputs, where USDA and USPTO, together with DOJ and Federal Trade Commission (FTC), will work to promote fair competition in the seed market.\nEnhancing value-added market access.\nAs part of its work to transform the nation’s food system, USDA is investing in more and better markets across the food system. These efforts are designed to strengthen our local and regional food systems, create new market opportunities, add value for agricultural producers and consumers, and spur economic activity locally — helping communities that have been left behind by the current agricultural models and supporting good-paying jobs throughout the supply chain. Programs through which USDA is accomplishing these goals include the Organic Transition Initiative, Healthy Meals Incentives, Regional Food Business Centers, Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure Program, Local Agricultural Marketing Program (LAMP), Dairy Business Innovation (DBI) Initiatives, and Specialty Crop Block Grant Program (SCBGP).\nIncreasing transportation network resilience.\nAs part of Secretary Vilsack’s work as co-chair of both the Biden-Harris Administration’s Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force and Council on Supply Chain Resilience, USDA has supported whole-of-government efforts to build enduring supply chain resilience. In May , Secretary Vilsack sent a letter to the Surface Transportation Board (STB) requesting urgent action to improve rail service for agricultural commodities by moving forward on open proceedings, such as a shipper petition on private railcar use, emergency service orders, and reciprocal switching. In addition, Secretary Vilsack urged STB to provide clarity on the railroads’ common carrier obligation and collect additional first-mile/last-mile service .\n#\nUSDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer and lender.",

(Photo courtesy of Greensgrow Farms)\nEvery day, thousands of local farmers and ranchers work hard to ensure that their communities have access to a diverse range of fresh, healthy affordable foods.  While nutritious food is a cornerstone of society’s physical health, a vibrant community also includes sustainable economic opportunities.  By funding projects that support these goals, USDA’s Farmers Market Promotion Program continues to make a difference for farmers at the local level.\nThe Farmers Market Promotion Program provides grants to eligible entities through a competitive application process (grants.gov).  This year, nearly $10 million is available for farmers markets, community supported agriculture, road-side stands and other direct marketing operations to assist in expanding and promoting market opportunities for local farmers and ranchers.  At the same time, efforts supported by these funds will help make nutritious, local foods more available in communities across the United States.\nThe Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) administers these grants.  In , we funded nearly 150 projects, including a grant to Greensgrow Farms Neighborhood Markets in Camden, N.J.  Because of organizations like Greensgrow Farms, Farmers Market Promotion Program funds are being used to make a difference.  They are using the support from USDA to develop neighborhood farmers markets and establish a mobile food delivery system in low income areas of the city.  Participating markets will accept electronic benefit transfer (EBT) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) transactions.  They are also creating a food hub that will utilize refrigeration and processing equipment to keep foods fresh.  Food hubs are innovative business models that bring farmers, distributors, aggregators, buyers and others in the supply chain together to ensure that the regional small and midsize producers get access to the infrastructure they need to grow their business.\nThis year, we’re looking for projects that will continue to expand healthy food choices for all Americans - especially in food deserts or low-income areas.  Producer associations, nonprofit corporations, agricultural cooperatives, local governments, economic development corporations, regional farmers market authorities, public benefit corporations and tribal governments committed to promoting the goals of the Farmers Market Promotion Program are encouraged  to apply during this   grant season.\nVisit our website for program information and to find out more about previously funded projects.  You can also visit grants.gov to learn about the application process or to apply for a grant.  Your electronic application must be received by May 21, .\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n AMS\n Farmers Market Promotion Program\n food access\n food desert\n Food Hubs\n Grants\n KYF2",

NRCS photo.\nThe headwaters of O’Dell Creek in Madison Valley, Mont. serve as a perfect example of the benefits of implementing good conservation practices. Considered one of the largest wetland areas in Montana, O’Dell Creek was drained in the s for land to raise livestock.  But now, ranchers, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and other partners are restoring the wetland.\nHistorically grazed all year, the O’Dell Creek and Madison River floodplain provided abundant forage, flowing water and refuge from harsh weather. Over the years, the draining and livestock uses took a toll.\n“I could see the degradation,” said Jeff Laszlo, one of the owners of Granger Ranches LP — where the creek is located.  “There was a decline in both the grass production of our river bottoms and the overall health of our riparian area. Although I really didn’t know what to do about it, I felt that there had to be a better way of managing and taking care of one of the ranch’s most important assets.”\nThat’s when he started working with NRCS and other conservation partners.\n“Our only prior experience with NRCS was on more ranching-intensive projects, such as windbreaks, upgrading irrigation systems and reseeding fields,” Laszlo said.  “We had never undertaken anything this resource-oriented as what was being proposed to restore O’Dell Creek and its associated wetlands.”\nIn , Granger Ranches enrolled in NRCS’ Wetlands Reserve Enhancement Program. As a part of the conservation easement, the agency financed 75 percent of the stream and wetland work, which included 5,000 feet of stream restoration, nearly 80 acres of wetland restoration and more than 9,000 feet of fencing.  While the Farm Bill did change conservation easement programs, technical and financial assistance for wetlands restorations is still available through the wetland reserve easement component of the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program.\nIn addition to providing financial assistance for the restoration, NRCS established a site-specific management plan for the easement. The goals were to increase plant diversity, improve water quality and provide better habitat for fisheries and wetland-dependent wildlife species.\nAfter years of work with NRCS and other conservation partners — including private, nonprofit and government entities — Laszlo is seeing results.\n“The O’Dell restoration has been a tremendous success, even beyond what was initially hoped for,” he said.  “The fish and wildlife response has been incredible. Bird species have increased 10 fold. Trumpeter swans have been introduced and are thriving. The fishery is healthier. Water quality has improved, and over 200 plant species have been identified including some very rare ones.\n“These benefits flow with the water downstream. O’Dell Creek is an important tributary to the Madison River, and now it’s providing colder and cleaner water, an important resource that so many depend on or enjoy for recreation.”\nLaszlo admits this project forced him to look at ranching differently.  He now sees that in any agricultural operation, there must be a balance between agricultural operations and protecting and enhancing natural resources.\n“As a rancher, I’ve learned that conservation and ranching are not mutually exclusive pursuits.  In fact, to do either well you’d have to do them together,” he said. “I never anticipated how complex this project would be or how rewarding. I am thankful for all the great partners who have contributed so much, including the Natural Resources Conservation Service.”\nThis May, NRCS is celebrating American Wetlands Month by sharing the stories of landowners, like the Nelsons, who are working to restore wetlands.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Agricultural Conservation Easement Program\n Conservation\n Farm Bill\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n Montana\n NRCS\n Ranchers\n wetlands\n Wetlands Reserve Program",

This competition empowers students to have a voice about school meals and nutrition. On top of that, it’s a lot of fun for everyone involved!\nThe day of the competition I prepared by reviewing the rules, reading meal requirements, and skipping lunch. When I arrived at the event, I was impressed to see how many fellow judges there were and the wide range of food experts sitting around me. The competition got started and teams from fourteen schools started presenting their meals to us. The students brought in three or four cafeteria trays and gave each judge a sample. Judging was based on visual appearance, taste, presentation, and originality. Some students set themselves apart by being very well-polished when explaining the dishes, or by adding some creativity with music and costumes that reflected the meal’s ethic background. The competition was really tough, and ranking thee dishes was no easy task.

This photo series features USDA programs and services, Then and Now, and shows the impact of creative and innovative investments for a brighter future for rural Americans.\nFood Stamps to SNAP: Converting from paper coupons to Electronic Benefit Transfer has allowed USDA to increase access to fresh healthy food, including farmers markets, while reducing fraud, waste and abuse within the SNAP program.\nRural Infrastructure: Rural broadband creates educational, health and economic benefits for rural America, and provides access to new opportunities that may not have been available before.\nOn the Farm Technology: Modern technology allows agriculture to be more productive than ever before, leading to the strongest 5 years of agriculture exports in our history. Modern tractors and farm equipment often utilize GPS for precision planting or harvesting, and are able to perform tasks like measuring moisture content and weight in real time, and can update yield per acres on the fly during harvest time.\nConservation: Conservation and risk management practices have helped to bring us into a 21st century of land stewardship, promoting soil health and healthy land management that help to ensure that the dust bowl of the 's is history. Making reliable, effective risk management tools available for producers to make sound decisions that benefit the land is just one way USDA helps farmers and ranchers help the land.\nThese are the first of many Then and Now images we'll share, but we'd love to hear from you.

Photo credit: Robert Barker, Cornell University.\nThis post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research profile.\nBill Gates, once simply of Microsoft fame, is now as famous for his dedication to reducing hunger in Sub-Saharan Africa and other goals that drive the work of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.  He recently visited Agricultural Research Service’s (ARS) Plant, Soil and Nutrition Research Unit in Ithaca, NY, to learn what two geneticists are doing to improve crop breeding decisions that could be used in that part of the world.\nAt the research unit, ARS geneticist Edward Buckler is turning the encyclopedic amount of genetic information he has developed about corn into helping the crop yield the kind of improvements in Africa that have been made in North America. Varieties bred for North American climates simply do not work in Africa where they currently produce only about one-fifth the harvest they do in this country. Millions of hungry and extremely poor people can’t afford the hundred years it would take for conventional breeding that was once the path taken in the United States.\nBut today, Buckler can pinpoint the exact genes that control a trait like resistance to a disease or drought tolerance, so there is no need to grow a generation of offspring out and test them before selecting parents for the next generation. With this knowledge and genetic selection tools that Jannink has created, the time to develop a precise new corn variety may be cut from 15 years to as little as 5 years.\nBuckler and his team have already succeeded by finding genes within the corn genome for higher levels of carotenoid (pro-vitamin A) to help solve vitamin A deficiencies that cause childhood blindness and immune problems in sub-Saharan Africa. From these key genes, breeders have developed corn varieties that naturally have 15 times more pro-Vitamin A.\nARS geneticist Jean-Luc Jannink is similarly spring boarding improvements in cassava, one of sub-Saharan Africa’s indispensable crops, using \"genomic selection,\" a statistical method combining genetic with measurements of traits in a training population to predict the outcome of crossing two particular parent plants. Then he only makes the crosses that give offspring with the desired traits.\nHe and a team of graduate students collaborate with national cassava breeding programs of Nigeria, Uganda and the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture. They do the DNA sequencing and the predictions in Ithaca. Then the programs in Africa do the crosses based on Jannink’s predictions side by side with their own crosses based on more conventional breeding. In another year or two, there should be enough progress to compare the methods.\nAfter spending a few hours at the ARS lab, learning about faster plant breeding, Bill Gates wrote in his blog: “Ed Buckler and his colleagues aren’t just experts in their field—they’re also deeply passionate about their work. I can see why: The advances they’re working on will change people’s lives by dramatically accelerating a process that is now slow and laborious.”\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Africa\n ARS\n genetics\n New York\n Science Tuesday\n wheat",
