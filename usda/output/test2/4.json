Some young farmers, like Hank Huffman – a 25-year-old farmer from rural eastern North Carolina – have gleaned great experiences from the generations of farmers before them. Hank, bolstered by the experience and wisdom imparted to him by his father, grandfather, and great grandfather, is now making his mark on the field of agriculture. He is a fourth-generation farmer growing corn and soybeans, and producing poultry and cattle on 130 acres.

Following a 13-year hiatus, the first shipment of U.S. fresh beef has arrived in Brazil, ushering in promising long-term market opportunities for the U.S. beef industry. In , the United States exported $6.3 billion in beef and beef products globally. With Brazil’s large market reopened to the United States, U.S. beef exports are poised for new growth.\nBrazil closed its market to imports of U.S. fresh beef in over concerns about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Since then, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service worked continuously with Brazilian officials to regain market access. Additionally, USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has provided documentation and information on the U.S. food safety requirements and standards for beef. Following numerous technical discussions and meetings, Brazil officially reopened the market in August based on the United States’ classification by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as a negligible risk country for BSE.\nAs the U.S. agriculture industry witnesses this first shipment of fresh beef arriving in Brazil, it’s the ideal time for U.S. exporters to re-engage in marketing efforts in the country. Currently, Brazil’s main suppliers of fresh/chilled beef are Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina – both because of their proximity to Brazil and because they enjoy duty-free access as a result of the Mercosur customs union. From -, Brazil imported an average of $296 million of fresh/frozen beef, or 50,000 metric tons, annually. Despite the competition from Mercosur countries and a 10-percent tariff differential for countries outside the customs union, the United States is in a great position to compete in the Brazilian market thanks to the ability to target high-end consumers.\nThe FAS Agricultural Trade Office in Sao Paulo recently launched the – a market promotion campaign to support the branding and promotion of U.S. food and beverage products in Brazil, including U.S. beef.  Brazil boasts a population of more than 206 million people, with more than 40 percent of the population in the middle class and 16 million high-end consumers.  Despite the country’s current economic crisis, it is a promising market for U.S. high-value products, like fresh beef. Brazilians are familiar with the quality and diversity of U.S. food products and there is a demand for high-quality cuts of beef in both the foodservice and high-end retail sectors.\nSince Brazil first announced the reopening of its market to U.S. fresh beef, USDA has worked with Brazil’s Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Food Supply on the food safety protocols and label approval process for U.S. firms wanting to ship to Brazil. An agreement was reached in December that met Brazil’s product labelling approval requirements. Visit the FSIS Export Library for updated information on Brazil’s export requirements for U.S. meat, poultry and processed egg products, including detailed instructions for shipping U.S. fresh beef and beef products to Brazil.\nConsul General Ricardo Zuniga with the boxes of U.S. beef as they clear customs in Brazil, ready to hit the market.\n Category/Topic:\n Trade\n Tags:\n beef\n Brazil\n agricultural exports\n Exports\n Foreign Agricultural Service\n Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service\n Food Safety and Inspection Service",

(Courtesy of Dexter Lane, Nature Explore)\nMothers sit and laugh together, shaded by newly planted trees. They look on while their children play and explore in dirt and grass at the new Outdoor Nature Explore Classroom of Warren Village in the heart of Denver, Colorado.\nA U.S. Forest Service grant of $100,000 and a partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation made the outdoor classroom possible.\nThis new outdoor space is un-paving the way to outdoor education opportunities for urban children in Denver, planting the seeds of inspired outdoor learning through the use of nature play spaces. In contrast to the previous hardened playground with sticky asphalt and hot metal slides, children of Warren Village are now immersed in a nature play zone of trees, shade, dirt, flowers, plants, stumps, stones and water.\nHere, getting your hands dirty is encouraged and part of the first-hand learning process that goes along with exploring natural surroundings.\n“The gift of hope and possibility is what you have set course to do with this great Nature Explore Outdoor Classroom,” said Forest Service Associate Chief Mary Wagner, who cut the ribbon with children from the Village earlier this summer. “And so for the teachers and the parents who are going to back and support students in this experience – thank you – because you are changing lives and you may possibly be changing the world.”\nDuring the ceremony, Wagner announced an additional $55,000 in funding from the Forest Service, Colorado Parks and Wildlife, the Colorado State Forest Service and the Arbor Day Foundation. These resources will transform the remaining hardened landscape, creating an expanded certified Nature Explore Outdoor Classroom this fall.\nWarren Village provides transitional housing for refugees and previously homeless, single-parent families, helping them to achieve personal and economic self-sufficiency. Warren Village supports programs that move families from public assistance to personal and economic self-sufficiency through subsidized housing, on-site child care, educational guidance and career development.\nMany of these families have not been exposed to natural settings, nor had the opportunity to connect to nature in any real way. This space fosters that connection to the natural world in a safe and inviting environment.\nCultivating this connection to nature between urban families and the outdoors will have lasting effects for a child’s development. Experts from Nature Explore, a collaborative program of the Arbor Day Foundation and Dimensions Educational Research Foundation, designed the outdoor classroom for creative exploration.\n“We think that this program will help to nurture creativity more than anything we could have done before with a playground made of plastic and metal. As cute as it was, we think this will be so much better,” said Sharon Knight, chief executive officer and executive director of Warren Village.\nChildren will learn about ecosystems and food systems by helping to plant and grow flowers and vegetables, explore native critters and bugs within seasonal cycles, and explore the importance of natural places to the health of communities.\n“These are truly transformational spaces for children,” said John Rosenow, founder and executive director of the Arbor Day Foundation. We need to have a lot of people who have a connection and a love of nature in their heart to become the future generation of environmental stewards.”\nA short video about Warren Village’s new Nature Outdoor Explore Classroom offers more information about how it works.\n Category/Topic:\n Initiatives\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Arbor Day Foundation\n children\n Colorado\n Education\n forest\n Forestry\n FS\n nature\n Nature Explore\n play\n Rocky Mountain Region\n Warren Village",

This financing is an example of the commitment by the Obama Administration to leverage public and private resources to increase economic opportunities and improve the quality of life for rural Missourians\nWe were very pleased to have the support of our federal elected officials represented by: Rachel McCombs with Senator “Kit” Bond; Jerryl Christmas with Senator Claire McCaskill; and Dan Engeman with Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer.\nMissouri’s RD multi-family housing (MFH) portfolio of about 750 complexes and 18,000 units has been the largest or next to the largest in the nation for many years.   Approximately 40 percent of this caseload was loans made to volunteer, non- profit boards that provided housing for the elderly and disabled.  Since many of these complexes were built in the early 70’s the need for repairs and rehabilitation was becoming critical.  There was also a sincere desire to keep the rental rates low and reasonable since many of the elderly and disabled tenants had very limited income, typically below $8,000.  Since federal funds were limited we here in Missouri found a “white knight” in the FHLB-Des Moines Affordable Housing Program. \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines is a wholesale cooperative bank that provides low-cost short and long term funding and community lending to more than 1,200 member banks. It devotes 10 percent of its net income each year to affordable housing.\nThrough my relationship with Curt Heidt, FHLB-Des Moines Vice President and Community Investment Officer, we were able to brainstorm and mold a plan to help our Missouri RD Section 515 MFH properties using their Affordable Housing Program (AHP).  The AHP was designed to help FHLB-Des Moines member financial institutions and their community partners develop affordable housing for low-to moderate-income households.   Some of the improvements have included new roofs, new energy efficient exterior doors and windows, new carpet, new appliances, new cabinets and upgrading to a more energy efficient heating and air conditioning systems.\nMy sincere thanks to Curt Heidt and the FHLB-Des Moines leadership team, the FHLB-Des Moines Board of Directors and the Affordable Housing Advisory Council for their commitment and funding support of this tremendously valuable program for rehabilitation of our MFH senior properties.  It was a big step for them to enter the realm of our rental program but without their help, Missouri residents would have lost many of these properties.  Now, not only are the properties available, but they also have a “face-lift”  with things such as central heating and air, which most of us take for granted and they can remain affordable for our residents.\nSome of the other partners in this process have been grant writers such as the staff of Regional Planning Commissions (RPC) or Community Action Agencies who have done an outstanding job with the grant writing process.  Also, without a doubt a big thank you on the success of this program has been the volunteer boards that have dedicated countless hours with the ultimate goal of providing high quality affordable living options for the elderly and disabled in the many rural communities across Missouri.  Finally, these grants would not have been available were it not for the involvement, participation, and sponsorship of FHLB local member banks and their commitment to this program and the benefit to their elderly in their communities.\nClifford Crawford, a resident of Leasburg Senior Citizens Home, one of the grant recipients, spoke on behalf of many residents by providing inspiring comments regarding how grateful they were to Federal Home Loan Bank and USDA Rural Development for the repairs and rehabilitation of their apartments.\nI also want to recognize our RD national leadership for its help.  The MFH program is a labor intensive program but through a “labor of love” the Missouri RD staff have partnered with FHLB, the grant writers, contractors, owners and volunteers and been truly committed to providing affordable housing to our senior citizens and for that I am very proud and thankful.\nClifford Crawford, resident of Leasburg Senior Citizens Home, speaking on behalf of the many residents that benefited with the FHLB grant funds to repair and rehab the RD MFH properties.

Her research is leading to new ways to combat the disease. \nThe potato is the world’s fourth largest food crop and is the largest vegetable crop in the United States. The crop originated in the Andes Mountains in South America, and in the ensuing 7,000 years, has spread across the globe. Potatoes have played an important role in saving populations of people around the world from starvation. However, the potato has had a tumultuous history, suffering from late blight disease, which caused the Irish potato famine and a severe outbreak in in the United States.\nDespite all this, the 7,000 varieties of potatoes have made their mark on agriculture as well as many cultures throughout the world. With funding from USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Jean Ristaino, professor of plant pathology at North Carolina State University, contributed to the Spuds Unearthed! exhibit at the U.S. Botanic Garden in Washington, D.C., which focuses on the history of the potato, its diversity and its mark on pop culture. A whole genome sequence of the pathogen that causes late blight disease also resulted from the funded project. That sequence provided the basic knowledge that has enabled Ristaino and her colleagues to develop new methods of combating this challenging disease. Ristaino’s display, “CSI Dublin: The Hunt for the Irish Potato Killer,” details her research on identifying the strain of P. infestans that caused the Irish potato famine.\nShe is continuing her research with scientists from Cornell University and the University of California to study the strain of the pathogen that caused the late blight disease outbreak. The team hopes to begin nationwide tracking of the pathogen and develop a more stable resistance to the disease.\nAnd she’s not done with museums yet, the group hopes to take their exhibit on a national science museum road tour and educate the public about the importance of potatoes and the role plant pathology and genomics research plays in improving global food security.

Photo courtesy of G20 host Saudi Arabia\nAs the new decade unfolds, a remarkable trend is evident in the world. In , the global community and the media have been focused on the surge of a novel virus, the spread of African swine fever, wildfires, outbreak of desert locust, and debates on the safe use of agricultural technology. These challenges have similar characteristics – they span borders, have significant economic outcomes, and require global scientific collaboration to effectively address them. Public policy makers look to researchers to advance critical knowledge and offer solutions, and this research requires international collaboration. For success, however, efforts must be grounded in foundational principles and values that support international science.\nCore research values include openness, transparency, reciprocity, and merit-based competition. Openness and transparency are critical because they support reproducibility of results, promote accurate interpretation of findings, and help ensure appropriate disclosure of conflicts of commitment or interest (which is vital for fairly awarding research investments). Reciprocity ensures all parties mutually benefit from contributing to the research, meaning the contribution of each party needs to be proportionally aligned with what they receive, as perceived by each collaborator. Merit-based competition provides support to the best ideas. Together, these values provide the pillars for engagement. Yet, in a dynamic global research landscape with changing actors, shifting influence, and novel ways of working, we can’t take these values for granted. Foundational values need to be actively supported and promoted by all sectors, including agriculture.\nIn February, USDA had the opportunity to promote these core research values during the G20 Meeting of the Agricultural Chief Scientists (G20 MACS) in Saudi Arabia. USDA’s delegation, led by the Office of the Chief Scientist and the Mission Area for Research, Education, and Economics, worked with counterparts to capture the roles of openness, transparency, and reciprocity in the G20 MACS communique. The values were also discussed in the plenary and during informal engagement.\nIn addition to the G20 MACS, USDA looks forward to advancing the conversation on core research values and principles through our strong network of international collaborations.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Office of the Chief Scientist\n OCS\n USDA Science",

Recovery Act funding provided by USDA gave King an economic leg-up in hard times.\nPhotos by: Steve Ritter, Idaho Farm Bureau Federation\nTanner King spends Mondays at the Caldwell Livestock Auction in Idaho, decked out in a dark blue hoody sweatshirt and black cowboy hat, blending in with the other bidders. The young rancher might look as though he’s new to shaving but at buying cattle he’s an old hand.\nThe young rancher wants to build up his herd, buying 500-weight cattle and then selling them in the fall for profit.\n“Right now I have 25 acres that’s pasture under pivot and I lease another 20 acres in Melba under pivot for pasture. I run five-weight calves through the grass season and try to get them up to 850 and sell them at the end of the year,” said King.\nHe stumbled onto a good thing last spring, using Farm Service Agency (FSA) Recovery Act money for low interest loans. He says it’s an economic leg-up in these hard times that’s allowing him to chase the American dream.

This is my second loan and I paid off my first. The terms were real easy and it wasn’t stressful for me at all.

(iStock image)\nThis post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nA solid education is crucial to those seeking careers in animal science. However, many student loans can be burdensome. But a student loan payment the size of a mortgage couldn’t stop someone who has wanted to be a veterinarian since they learned to talk. Dr. Annie Bowes is one of those people.\nAfter acquiring the knowledge to begin her dream career, Dr. Bowes was left with overwhelming debt.  Luckily for this Idaho-based veterinarian, she wasn’t left alone to repay it. In , she received assistance through the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program (VMLRP) a program funded by USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).\nThrough VMLRP, NIFA may repay up to $25,000 each year of student loan debt to eligible veterinarians.  In return, qualified veterinarians must agree to provide food animal medical care for three years in certain high-priority veterinary shortage situations.  VMLRP has helped 245 veterinarians since the program’s inception in .\n“I am thankful for this assistance,” Bowes said. “It allowed me to establish myself in a rural area where it’s difficult to be successful. I am now able to treat animals at six to eight different farms per day and have more than 600 repeat clients.”\nVeterinarians are critical to America’s food safety, food security, and to the health and well-being of both animals and humans. Studies indicate there are significant shortages of food animal veterinarians in certain areas of the country. A leading cause for the scarcity in this profession is the heavy price tag that four years of professional veterinary medical training carries, which leaves current graduates of veterinary colleges with an average debt of $162,000.\nBowes owns Aspen Veterinary Service, a mobile service treating large animals, as well as an Emergency Clinic with a staff of 15 and more than 10,000 repeat customers.\nDr. Tim VanDerPloeg is another veterinarian using USDA’s assistance to expand rural veterinary services. VanDerPloeg will open Veterinary Center of Somerset, in Kentucky, soon. Pulaski County, where the clinic will be located, is the third largest cattle county in the state of Kentucky.  The clinic will have a 2,300-square-foot large animal facility in addition to the 3,400-square-foot small animal facility.\n“Although recipients of the loan repayment assistance are only to commit to three years of veterinary service in a designated shortage area, veterinarians like Bowes and VanDerPloeg suggest that the impacts from this funding and connections to their service areas go well beyond three years,” said Gary Sherman, VMLRP national program leader with NIFA.\nThrough federal funding and leadership for research, education, and extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

In , Walt Disney had a hit with the movie, “Bambi,” and in Disney allowed the fawn to be used on a forest fire prevention poster for one year. So a search was on to find an animal that would forever be the nation’s No. 1 firefighter.\nIn August , Smokey’s “birth certificate” set in motion a promotion that would become the Ad Council’s longest running public service campaign. In , while fighting a major, human-caused fire in the Capitan Mountains in the Lincoln National Forest in New Mexico, firefighters spotted a badly burned bear cub. The cub was flown to safety and cared for until he was moved to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., becoming the living symbol of Smokey Bear. He even “married” while at the zoo.\nSmokey Bear was recently rated as one of the top five most recognizable alongside Mickey Mouse and Santa Claus. Smokey Bear is identified by 97 percent of adults, and 3 out of 4 adults are able to recall his simple yet effective message: Only you can prevent wildfires.\nToday, Smokey’s message is more important than ever given changing climates, droughts, pests and disease plaguing forests and grasslands across the country. In the past three years alone, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas and Colorado have experienced the worst fire seasons in their respective state histories.\n“Unfortunately, our forests and grasslands are facing longer and more severe wildfire seasons with each coming year,” said Tom Harbour, head of the Forest Service’s fire program. We need a rejuvenated, fresh Smokey to be back on the job when we all move back into the Yates Building later this year.”\nWhile the Forest Service regrets having to close down the center for six months, the timing will allow for a nice face (and fur) lift just in time for Smokey’s milestone birthday next year.\nWe’re not sure, however, whether there will be candles on his cake.\n“He’s kind of a stickler on these things,” Woodsy Owl explains.\nThe Forest Service Information Center is housed in the Sidney Yates Building near the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. The center is patterned after the Rudy Wendelin painting “Smokey’s Fan Mail.” Wendelin, who lived in Arlington, Va., also designed the Smokey Bear postage stamp and the Forest Conservation stamp.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Arizona\n Colorado\n FS\n Lincoln National Forest\n New Mexico\n Smokey Bear\n Texas\n Washington DC\n Woodsy Owl",

It is down from 11.8 percent in and a high of 14.9 percent in . USDA’s Economic Research Service recently released its Household Food Security in the United States in on the incidence and severity of food insecurity in U.S. households. In , 14.3 million households had difficulty at some time during the year providing enough food for all their members because of a lack of financial or other resources.\nThis year’s report, using from December , shows that 88.9 percent of American households were food secure throughout the entire year, meaning that all household members had access at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.\nFood insecurity increased substantially in with the onset of the Great Recession and has been declining since when food insecurity peaked. Returning to the prevalence has been a point of interest for many that follow trends in food insecurity. Compared with other measures of hardship, like unemployment and poverty, food insecurity took longer to return to pre-recession levels.\nVery low food security is the severe range of food insecurity characterized by reductions in food intake and disrupted eating patterns due to limited resources. In , 4.3 percent of American households experienced very low food security. This was not significantly different from 4.5 percent in . Before the Great Recession, very low food security was 4.1 percent in and then increased to 5.7 percent in . In , very low food security had nearly reached the pre-recession level.\nDespite recent improvements in the national food insecurity prevalence, some groups continue to face higher than average food insecurity rates. In , 35.3 percent of households with incomes below the Federal poverty level were food insecure. Among single mother households with children, 27.8 percent were food insecure in , and among single father households with children, 15.9 percent were food insecure. Food insecurity affected 21.2 percent of Black, non-Hispanic households and 16.2 percent of Hispanic households.\nFor more information about food insecurity in , including by demographic characteristics, across States, and changes over time, take a look at Household Food Security in the United States in .

(Courtesy of NARA)\nU.S. airline carriers collectively used more than 16 billion gallons of jet fuel in . Given growing concerns over energy independence and the environment, commercial airlines are looking for secure and reliable alternative jet fuels that reduce global emissions.\nTo address this problem, researchers at Washington State University formed the Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance (NARA) with biofuels company Gevo, Alaska Airlines, and several other partners across academia, industry, and government. As a result of NARA’s efforts, made possible by a $39.6 million grant from the USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), Alaska Airlines is planning to use 1,000 gallons of NARA-produced biofuel in a demonstration flight scheduled for .\nNARA’s alternative jet fuel originates from forest residuals (tree tops, branches) that are left over and must be burned after a forest harvest. Use of forest residuals for bioenergy feedstock capitalizes on the existing forestry industry and eliminates the need to establish growers and a hauling infrastructure. Once harvested, the residuals are ground, screened, and treated to isolate their desirable simple sugars. These are then fermented into an alcohol and converted into jet fuel using Gevo’s proprietary processes.\nNARA also has an education team that has successfully promoted energy literacy to approximately 32,000 students thus far through its several member organizations. “Our key objective has been to use the NARA project as a case study of problem-solving around a complex energy issue,” says Dr. Karla Eitel, associate professor at the University of Idaho College of Natural Resources and director of education at the McCall Outdoor Science School (MOSS). One of MOSS’s lessons teaches students to measure the amount of carbon in a tree, calculate the number of miles that could be flown with fuel derived from that tree, and evaluate the trade-offs of leaving the tree standing for carbon sequestration vs. harvesting the tree for wood and fuel.\nEducation resources are available online. Facing the Future (FtF), another NARA member, offers a series of hands-on, interdisciplinary units targeted across all ages entitled “Fueling Our Future (FoF): Exploring Sustainable Energy Use.” When FtF partnered with the Sustainability in Prisons Project to teach inmates about bioenergy issues, FoF helped students realize their broader role in the global ecosystem. “I learned that I too am energy,” one woman remarked. “I have so much to give.”\nNARA combines a diversity of perspectives and works at the intersection of research, education, and extension to address a complex problem. “USDA’s investment in this area has shown tremendous insight and leadership,” says Dr. Mike Wolcott, NARA project co-director, “and we are honored by their trust in our team.”\nNIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Alaska Airlines\n alternative jet fuel\n bioenergy\n Facing the Future\n forest residuals\n Gevo\n McCall Outdoor Science School\n NARA\n Sustainability in Prisons Project\n tribal partnerships\n University of Idaho\n Washington State University",

Back in , USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded Chicago-based Greenprint Partners a Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG). Partnering with the city and other local community groups, a long-vacant lot in downtown Peoria has been transformed into a vibrant community gathering space with green infrastructure, an urban forest, and a working farm.\nWell Farm, covering 1.5 acres, was engineered and contoured to optimize stormwater management. Vegetables and flowers are grown in raised beds and later sold at the Peoria farmers market. The planted trees are hybrid poplars, a fast-growing species that take up a lot of water and can ultimately be harvested for timber. Well Farm is one of the nation’s first stormwater farms, capturing stormwater runoff while growing harvestable timber and vegetables. The farm is fully instrumented to measure the site’s success in managing stormwater.\nYou may view the below video or visit the The Well Farm video about the project.\nIt is not just the citizens of Peoria that have recognized the value of this project, Greenprint Partners was awarded the prestigious U.S. Water Prize (, 222 ) in the Private Sector category for its work in advancing the way stormwater is managed for partner City of Peoria, Illinois. Greenprint Partners was recognized for its leadership as the project developer and program manager for an innovative stormwater management system and community engagement program at Well Farm. The project’s mix of green features, underground storage, and urban agriculture prevents more than a million gallons of stormwater from entering Peoria’s combined sewer each year.\nGreenprint Partners process engaged a team of more than 20 community stakeholders to ensure alignment, positive neighborhood impacts, and ongoing project success. The project transformed the property, and also delivers $1.50 in economic activity for every $1 invested. It has created nearly 30 full-time jobs.\nThrough the Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) program, NRCS funds projects that develop innovative approaches and technologies for natural resource conservation on agricultural lands. These grants have funded more than 60 environmental markets projects, including a number of the nation’s leading market efforts.\nFind out more about NRCS Conservation Innovation Grants.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Natural Resources Conservation Service\n NRCS\n Conservation\n Illinois\n Conservation Innovation Grant",

The college stopped operating several years ago.  On the campus are two facilities, a student center and a day care center, funded through USDA Rural Development’s Community Facilities program. With the college closure, its board of trustees elected to transfer the entire remaining campus over to popular and growing fine arts nonprofit – Alaska Arts Southeast, Inc.\nWorking with all parties, USDA staff helped find a path to transfer the two USDA-funded buildings to the arts group and a non-profit day care provider.\nTo that end, with all parties working together, Administrator Treviño was able to sign authorizing documents for this transaction such that Alaska Arts Southeast was able to pay off the negotiated debt that the college owed for the student center and then also assume the responsibilities of the grant agreement.  Now, the government’s interests have been satisfied and Alaska Arts Southeast has cornerstone building for delivery of education in the fine arts to kids and adults from Alaska and across the country.\nThe other facility was a daycare operation that was, in part, used with the Elementary Education program offered at the former four year college.  On an island community of residents, this daycare is one of the largest and most highly regarded facilities of its type.  Its closure would have been a challenge for many families and their employers.  With the assistance of USDA’s Alaska staff, the parents helped the daycare manager form a nonprofit group that then applied for financing to take ownership of and is now running the facility as an independent operation.\nIn assuming ownership, they ensured that quality and needed daycare facilities remained available to those thirty seven Sitka families as the daycare never closed.  Three years later, the Sheldon Jackson Childcare Center is operating successfully and is financially stable.  This is considered a success story within the Servicing Division for the agency.  Ms. Treviño enjoyed her facility tour with Lolly Miller, Daycare Manager on a Saturday morning.\nThis is a fine example of effort by USDA and a local community to protect taxpayer interests while also working to keep those two facilities in good hands, and for their intended community and public uses.\nTo find out more about USDA Rural Development programs click here.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Alaska\n Community Facilities\n National Homeownership Month\n RD\n Rural Housing\n StrikeForce\n Tammye Trevino",

It is a Puerto Rican parrot with a broken leg, a serious injury for one of the world's most endangered bird species.\nIn the past, the prognosis would have been grim. \"That probably would have been a dead bird,\" said Jafet Velez, a biologist who manages the Puerto Rican parrot breeding center in the El Yunque National Forest, one of two such facilities on the island.\nThe injured bird, a 2-month-old known only as Number 05, faces an extended stay in the avian equivalent of intensive care and may need surgery. But it is likely to survive. The outlook is increasingly positive as well for the entire species, which has hovered near extinction for decades, with slightly more than a dozen left in the wild at one point.\nThere are now about 150 birds each in the two captive breeding centers, in El Yunque and in Rio Abajo. Both breeding centers report a record year for new chicks, about 40 each.\nPuerto Rican parrots are one of about 34 species of Amazon parrots found in the Americas. They’re known for the bright red shock of feathers at their forehead, white rings around their eyes and the shimmering blue feathers under their wings, usually visible when they dart overhead.\nThe parrots, which grow to about a foot in length and mate for life, are secretive and considered exceptionally sensitive to any disturbance to their environment, which may be why their numbers plummeted in the wild.\nIn pre-colonial times, there were an estimated 1 million of the birds spread across Puerto Rico. Intensive agriculture, particularly the massive clearing of forests for sugar cane, coffee and citrus, and a series of devastating hurricanes destroyed most of their prime habitat. By the late s, they had disappeared from the entire island, except a few dozen in El Yunque, a mountainous tropical rain forest east of San Juan. In , a census found just 13 birds left in the wild.\nThe captive breeding program began in , but there wasn't much hope for a recovery.\n\"They thought the species is going to be extinct, so we need to keep in captivity a representation of what was a Puerto Rican parrot,\" said Velez, who has worked for the program for 21 years. \"But the species really showed resilience.\"\nThe breeding efforts picked up as they learned more about the species and reduced turnover among biologists and technicians, which enabled them to become more skillful in handling the birds.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n El Yunque National Forest\n Forestry\n FS\n Puerto Rico",

ERS was established on April 3, during the Kennedy Administration, when USDA combined the Department’s economic research functions into one agency. The functions of our predecessor agency, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE, dating from ), had been dispersed in to other USDA offices, and many former BAE economists found a home in the new ERS.\nThis week, ERS is marking the occasion with a day-long symposium in USDA’s Jefferson Auditorium, featuring speakers from government and the research community who will focus on the agency’s contributions to public policy and the social sciences. USDA employees and the public are invited to the symposium.\nERS: 50 Years of Excellence\nERS’s current status as a primary source of economic research and information in USDA, has been earned over  years of sound, objective analysis that has enhanced food and agricultural policy as well as the field of agricultural research. The and analysis on our website cover the range of topics paralleling USDA’s mission:  the food system, diet and nutrition, the farm economy, commodity production and trade, domestic and global food security, rural development and demographics, and agriculture-related environmental issues.\nIn the s, the young ERS pioneered the development of econometric models of national and international commodity markets, enabling projections used in USDA’s annual baseline. The models we develop are the gears that help drive the machinery of much of our analysis.\nPolicymakers, advocacy organizations, other decisionmakers, researchers and the media are among those who rely on ERS information. Examples of highly anticipated ERS work are the farm income forecasts and food CPI forecasts regularly posted on our website. Our annual report on household food security is another. The agency also publishes an annual report on the level of food insecurity of developing countries and regions.  on current policy topics have a long history of meeting the need for analysis.  Recent have informed debates on food deserts, the future of the Conservation Reserve Program, federal investments in rural broadband, and the effect of regional trade agreements on U.S. agriculture.\nAmong the most popular items on our website is the interactive series on per capita food consumption which we redesigned last year to make it more user-friendly. In recent years ERS has developed geospatial mapping tools to integrate and map research results online. Last year, the agency unveiled its Food Environment Atlas – a broad set of statistics on communities’ food options and health outcomes. In January this year, we produced an online atlas of socioeconomic on rural and small-town America.\nAnd just this week, we introduced the Food Desert Locator, an online mapping tool for pinpointing and accessing on communities where people lack easy access to large grocery outlets.\nI invite you to visit our website, where you can find details on the May 5 symposium , including registration information.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n ERS\n ERS 50th Anniversary\n Food Desert Locator\n Food Environment Atlas",

Do you want to learn more about how to conserve as much as possible, while cultivating a thriving garden?\nThe Peoples' Garden at USDA was conceptualized to help Americans learn more about all things gardening -- and this summer, we're putting on weekly Healthy Garden Workshops to help everyone learn the ins and outs of a great garden.\nJuly 3 Kickoff Workshop\nAt the July 3 Healthy Garden Workshop, “Watering Your Lawn and Garden,” USDA experts offered a few of the scientific tricks to ensure that your plants and lawn get enough water, but not too much as well as how much water plants “drink” from the soil every week.\nFor example:\nIt helps to create a weekly watering plan, and to monitor the rainfall in your lawn/garden and subtract that amount of water from your weekly watering plan.\nPlants use approximately one inch of water from the soil each week during the summer growing season. Therefore, this amount needs to be replenished for plants to continue to grow and thrive. Depending on where we live, nature takes care of this for us by providing rain and we supplement with additional water as needed. Watering is a delicate balance for gardens. Too little water causes plants to wilt and die. Too much water means the plant cannot breathe; this can cause rotting and make the plant susceptible diseases.\nAnd that's just a sample. For more information about these tips, and to learn more about gardening, visit the the Peoples' Garden page.\nUpcoming Events\nAt tomorrow's Healthy Garden Workshop, you can learn about gardening in containers and window boxes (especially helpful for Americans living in cities and urban areas). The workshop will include discussion on finding the right container for the job, getting good soil, and nursing the container garden over time. Next week, on July 24, we'll show you techniques for weeding and removing invasive plants.\nAt both of these activities, a \"Sprouts\" workshop for kids will focus on a series of activities for children that demonstrate how the food system works, from farm to fork.\nIf you can't make a workshop, consider a garden tour -- they're held every Tuesday and Thursday at 1 p.m. at the Garden.

On December 12, , he announced $325 million would be invested in an additional 71 projects under the second funding pool.\nUSDA is updating the project dashboard periodically as we finalize the scope and funding levels of grant agreements. These projects will:\n Provide technical and financial assistance to producers to implement climate-smart production practices on a voluntary basis on working lands;\n Pilot innovative and cost-effective methods for quantification, monitoring, reporting and verification of greenhouse gas benefits; and\n Develop markets and promote the resulting climate-smart commodities.\nUSDA anticipates that these projects will result in:\n Hundreds of expanded markets and revenue streams for farmers and ranchers and commodities across agriculture and forestry ranging from traditional corn to specialty crops.\n More than 60,000 farms reached, encompassing more than 25 million acres of working land engaged in climate-smart production practices, like cover crops, no-till and nutrient management, as well as pasture and forestry management. \n More than 60 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent sequestered over the lives of the projects. This is equivalent to removing more than 12 million gasoline-powered passenger vehicles from the road for one year.\n Involvement of nearly 100 universities, including over 30 minority serving institutions. This will bring new ideas and innovative skills in monitoring and outreach. This includes:\n 11 projects with a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) as the lead and more than 35 projects with HBCUs as major partners; and\n Six projects with a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) as the lead and nearly 20 projects with HSIs as major partners.\n Over 20 tribes and tribal groups leading and partnering on many projects and representing tribes across a wide geography.\n Proposals for the 141 selected projects include plans to match on average 50% of the federal investment with non-federal funds.\nThis infographic (, 1.3 ) includes additional metrics on projects from Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities.\n Dashboard of Finalized Projects\n Project Dashboard\n Tentatively-Selected Project Summaries\n Visit usda.gov/climate-solutions/climate-smart-commodities/projects for details on individual Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities projects grouped by approximate funding ceiling and location.\n Partner Resources\n Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities Agreement Administration Training\n Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities Grantee Training\n Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities Memo to the Field – NRCS (, 264 )\n Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities Memo to the Field – FSA (, 386 )\n NRCS Environmental Evaluation CPA-52 Worksheet Instructional Video\n NRCS Environmental Evaluation CPA-52 Worksheet, Tools and Training Website\n Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities Dictionary (, 1.7 )\n Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities Project Reporting Workbook (, 6.9 )\n Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities Supplemental Reporting Workbook (, 1.0 )\n Timeline\n Eligible Entities\n The Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities funding opportunity is currently closed.

        "content": "Research and Science\n Mar 30, \n This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA's rich science and research portfolio.\nIf you’re a gardener, you’re probably starting to think about picking up some seeds for this year’s garden.  Perhaps you’re digging out those seeds you scooped out of last year’s pumpkin, or setting up a mini-greenhouse to get a head start on planting.  Have you ever wondered where the seeds at your local garden center came from?  It probably wasn’t the side of a volcano in Far East Russia, but you never know.\nIn , USDA researchers partnered with scientists at Russia’s Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry to collect samples of a rare wild strawberry (Fragaria iturupensis) from the Atsunupuri Volcano, on the island of Iturup. Samples of the seed were sent to a USDA lab in Corvallis, OR, for study; the strawberry may provide new flavor components or pest resistance that can be bred into commercial strawberry lines.\nBut what happens if those samples get damaged or destroyed?  Seeds are an important part of our agricultural future; without a well-maintained stock of seeds, our future food supply would dry up.  Fortunately, USDA scientists thought of this long ago and have been collecting and cataloging germplasm since .   In cooperation with state agricultural experiment stations and universities, the USDA keeps hundreds of collections of plants, seeds, trees, microbes, cell cultures, and even insects. These collections protect the future of agriculture by preserving the genetic diversity necessary for a plant or animal to adapt to changing growth conditions.  If you knew that a certain type of tomato just didn’t do well in your garden, you probably wouldn’t try to grow it year after year without making some changes.  The same is true for crops grown in fields.  The collections also preserve our history; one collection in Oregon contains genetic material from the oldest living pear tree in the United States.   It’s all part of the USDA’s commitment to seed preservation.\nLast month, USDA scientists sent some 10,000 seed samples for storage in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault (SGSV) in Norway.  February’s shipment marks the third such shipment of seed lines to the vault.  SGSV stores seeds of everything from soybeans, wheat, rice, carrot, and sorghum to sunflowers, bananas and wild strawberries that only grow in Far East Russia.  Svalbard now contains about 45,000 of the USDA’s 511,000 seeds, tissue samples, and whole plants; plans are to have the majority of them backed up at Svalbard in the next 10 to 15 years.\nThink of Svalbard as agriculture’s Noah’s Ark.  About 1,400 seed banks worldwide already house the seeds that ensure our food supply, but if one of those locations suffered a natural disaster and didn’t have electricity for a month, those seeds could be lost.  Svalbard’s backup seeds could then be used to re-establish those lines.\nThe storage chambers at Svalbard are buried deep in the permafrost on the side of a mountain, on a Norwegian island 800 miles from the North Pole.  Spitsbergen Island’s subarctic location makes it a secure, if chilly, location to house the seeds.  The cold keeps the seeds in slumber mode, and the island’s location, far from any tectonic plate boundary, means that no earthquakes or volcanic activity will disturb the vault.  It’s high enough in the mountains that the vault will stay dry even if the sea level rises 400 feet.  And the polar bears will probably discourage any intruders.\nUSDA’s germplasm collections grow each year thanks to worldwide collaborations and gathering expeditions—without which, we’d never have a strawberry plucked from the side of a volcano in Russia.  With this catalog of genetic diversity at our fingertips, we can keep agriculture’s past alive and ensure its future.\nEllen Buckley, Program Analyst, Natural Resources and Sustainable Agricultural Systems, USDA Agricultural Research Service\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Norway\n Russia\n SGSV",

The bats are fitted with a radio transmitter and tracked to roosting locations throughout the life of the transmitter. (U.S. Forest Service)\nSynonymous with a superhero signal in the sky and silhouettes hanging upside down in a darkened cave, bats inspire a long-standing fascination, and with good reason: Bats are vital to healthy ecosystems and human economies world-wide.\nWith Halloween upon us and many people believing bats are creepy, the U.S. Forest Service wants to raise awareness about these mysterious and often misunderstood animals. For example, bats consume up to their body weight in insects every night, including agricultural and forest pests, thus reducing the need for chemical pesticides.\nAlmost a third of the world’s 1,200 species of bats feed on the fruit or nectar of plants. In return for their meals, these bats are vital pollinators of countless plants and essential seed dispersers with a major role in regenerating rainforests.\nA recent study indicated the economic benefit to U.S. farmers from bat predation on insects is about $23 billion per year. The 20 million bats that live in Bracken Cave north of San Antonio, Texas, eat 250,000 pounds of insects every night.\nBats also play a significant role in science and medicine. Research on bats has enabled advancement in sonar and radar as well as the development of a drug to treat stroke patients.\n“Many people fear vampire bats, but they don’t realize the drug Draculin, a blood thinner used to treat strokes, is derived from the enzyme desmodeplase, which is found in vampire bat saliva,” said Dennis Krusac, a Forest Service bat biologist.\nBats are critically important, but there is a major problem.  Global bat populations have been declining for decades due to disturbances by people, carelessly used pesticides, and habitat loss. Since , white-nose syndrome, affecting hibernating bats at alarming rates, has killed 5.7 million bats in the eastern U.S. and Canada.\nA white fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, grows on bat noses, giving the disease its name, and on other hairless parts of their bodies. The syndrome causes bats to use up their fat reserves rapidly during hibernation. Affected bats fly out of caves during winter in an attempt to find food. Since the insects that bats eat are seasonally dormant, the bats die of starvation. The most threatened are bat populations that hibernate in large colonies.\nThere are ways for you to make a difference to help bats:\nPlant a bat garden. If you live in the desert southwest plant flowers that are late day or evening bloomers.\nBuild and install a bat house to replace habitats that have disappeared.\nAdhere to cave closures; if caves are open follow caver protocols recommended by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service to decontaminate clothes, footwear, and equipment used in caves or mines.\nStay out of caves when bats are present.\nReport bats showing signs of white-nose syndrome.\nTeach your children about the benefits of bats. The Forest Service offers a distance learning adventure at BatsLIVE!\n“Our ecosystem restoration projects are extremely important to bats because bats need healthy forests, and healthy forests need bats,” Krusac said.

We need bats, and bats need us – now more than ever.\nBats occupy almost every habitat in the world. They devour tons of insects nightly, pollinate flowers, and spread seeds that grow new plants and trees. They are our most important natural predators of night-flying insects, consuming mosquitoes, moths, beetles, crickets, leafhoppers and chinch bugs, among others. Many of these insects are serious crop or forests pests, while others spread disease to humans or livestock.

For me, this summer’s Olympics is the perfect blend of things that I’m passionate about – there’s cycling, there’s an international governing body that oversees the games, and there’s fellowship between the United States and Japan.\nYou may ask, “What does any of this have to do with the USDA?” Well, as Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, it occurred to me that the Tokyo Olympics is the perfect analogy to illustrate the importance of institutions that support agricultural trade.\nLet’s start with cycling. Just like the wheels on a bike that spin around, agriculture trade flows around the world. In order for a bike to operate smoothly, the two wheels must work together and in sync, or the bike will come to a halt or even worse crash and potentially cause damage. The same concepts apply to bilateral trade agreements. In order for an agreement to be successful, the two countries must work together and be in sync on the terms of the agreement. Without cohesiveness, just like a bike, agricultural trade could come to halt and potentially cause damage, from restricting imports and limiting a food supply, to causing commercial disruptions, and economic downturn. So, whenever you wonder why agricultural trade and trade agreements are important, think of the Olympic cyclists racing on their course, how they have invested in their training and the most efficient technology, and how important it is for their wheels to work in sync.\nStory continued at: www.fas.usda.gov/newsroom/how--tokyo-olympics-demonstrate-importance-ag-trade\nBe sure to follow USDA social media for posts throughout the Tokyo Olympics about the U.S. foods and ingredients that are helping propel Team USA to victory in Japan.\n Category/Topic:\n Trade\n Tags:\n Foreign Agricultural Service\n agricultural trade\n Trade\n Japan\n Olympics\n You May Also Like\n Food Safety: Prepare for the Unexpected\n Celebrating World Trade Week - and U.S. Agriculture’s Trade Successes\n Earth Day : Sustainably Cultivating the Future",

While USDA continues to collect and make available USDA datasets to the public, we also are engaging stakeholders so that we can use that feedback to improve future submissions.\nOne year later, USDA has published over 800 sets on usda.gov/ and .gov.  Considering the vast mission of the Department, we are proud of this accomplishment, specifically:\nSafety Palooza – USDA co-hosted the second annual Safety Palooza with the Department of Transportation.  This event featured the work of innovators in the private, nonprofit and academic sectors who use freely available government to build products, services and apps that advance public safety in creative ways. Four hundred attendees had the opportunity to discuss how technology and open are addressing top public safety issues across the nation.\nOpen Executive Seminars – USDA IT professionals were connected to lead policy makers via keynote speakers and panel discussions to drive strategy. These sessions were held once a month and the three briefings on Open/Big had an average of 150 participants each time.\nOpen 500 Roundtable – On August 1, , the non-profit Governance Lab at New York University (GovLab) and USDA co-hosted an Open Roundtable in Washington, DC.  This Roundtable was coordinated with the Climate Initiative, which was launched by the Obama Administration in March to promote the use of to fight climate change.  Among other issues, the Climate Initiative has addressed the climate risk to the food supply and the ways in which could help food producers and distributors increase “food resilience.”  The August Roundtable focused on food resilience, climate and agriculture.  The USDA Roundtable approached food resilience from two perspectives: 1) government can help experts both in and outside of government plan for long-term adaptation to climate change and risk management; and 2) is needed to plan for disaster preparedness in case of acute food emergencies.  The USDA and the Climate Initiative are now working on -driven solutions to help farms operate sustainably in the face of climate change, ensure citizens’ access to high quality food, promote disaster preparedness and responsiveness, and increase the United States’ food resilience overall. GovLab just published the final report.\nThis year, we will not be any less ambitious with our open goals.  In , we plan to:\n1)      Document and institutionalize the USDA publishing and prioritization process;\n2)      Develop inter-agency partnerships to drive value for citizens — from innovation and entrepreneurial startups to cost savings, to building public trust and creating transparency. We understand the need to consolidate so it can be used for multiple purposes to help our clients achieve their goals. Combine sets that could lead to interesting, rich and meaningful analysis of programs, operations and outcomes that have not yet been conceived;\n3)      Improve the quality of USDA sets;\n4)      Work with AgGateway on standards and definitions – so “corn” or Common Land Unit (CLU) has the same definition for the producer and the users;\n5)      And lastly, identify who is using USDA and how it is being used.  This will help us to serve you better.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Technology\n Tags:\n Climate Change\n climate \n Department of Transportation\n disaster\n innovation\n Joyce Hunter\n New York University\n Open \n Washington DC",

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research portfolio.\nAn award-winning watershed assessment tool, the Automated Geospatial Watershed Assessment (AGWA), was deployed to assess potential Rim Fire threats in Yosemite National Park in California.  The park experienced a devastating fire that began on August 17, , and took several months to contain. The fire burned more than 400 square miles in and around the park, cost $125.8 million to date, and is considered one of the largest wildfires in California’s history.\nBAER (Burned Area Emergency Response) is a multi-agency group that includes USDA’s Forest Service and others, and is responsible for identifying potential threats such as downstream flooding and developing plans to rehabilitate and restore burned areas. BAER teams use AGWA to target immediate efforts to prevent threats to people, wildlife and the land.  Using AGWA combined with the burn severity map produced by BAER teams, experts can rapidly pull together information on pre- and post-fire conditions. For example, knowing where to apply mulch after a fire can reduce runoff and erosion and can help minimize downstream risks from fire induced land cover and soil changes.\nAGWA has already been successfully used for post-fire BAER team watershed assessments following fires in Arizona, New Mexico, California, Idaho and Washington.  AGWA was jointly developed by scientists with the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Southwest Watershed Research Center in Tucson, AZ, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Universities of Arizona and Wyoming.\nARS researchers and their partners originally developed the computer model as a multipurpose computer system and software tool designed for managing and analyzing water quantity and quality to help keep our Nation’s watersheds cleaner. AGWA uses nationally available sources to rapidly establish and execute results from two ARS-developed watershed models, the Kinematic Runoff and Erosion Model (KINEROS2) and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT).  It enables the user to visualize and compare model results to understand the impact of a certain practice on a given landscape.\nHow we manage activities that take place on crop production areas, rangelands, pastures, forests, meadows, and urban areas influences the quantity and quality of water available for domestic, industrial, agricultural and ecological uses.

Often land is infested with weeds, without enough forage to support a successful livestock operation.  Producers most commonly control weeds with intensive grazing, mowing, or costly herbicides.\nThrough the grant, UVM will train farmers to use livestock as a natural “biological” control for non-poisonous weeds. This foraging is a cost-efficient and environmentally friendly way to control weeds and improve Vermont’s working landscapes.\nThe project will not only benefit Vermont farmers, but will also serve as a demonstration project, giving farmers throughout the northeast an example for how to maximize their lands for livestock production by reclaiming marginal pasture and improving existing pasture, while simultaneously controlling weeds and invasive species.\nNRCS administers CIG, which uses Environmental Quality Incentives Program funds to award competitive grants to non-federal governmental or non-governmental organizations, Tribes or individuals.

From California to Cleveland, the ability of individuals to realize the multidimensional benefits of agricultural production and leverage them in an urban context has been nothing short of amazing.\nThis past week I visited a University that is heavily involved in both the research and extension aspect of urban agriculture -- right in the backyard of the Department’s Washington, D.C. headquarters. The University of the District of Columbia’s (UDC) Muirkirk Agricultural Experimentation is located about 20 minutes north of the school’s D.C. campus. Upon arrival I found everything from activists passionate about learning how to best provide their neighbors with fresh produce, to researchers developing improved hydroponics systems; and even students working with community organizations on rice varieties suitable to be grown in urban areas.\nAt the Van Ness campus in D.C., it was clear that from an agricultural perspective, the University has fully embraced its uniqueness as an entirely urban land grant University. For example, while many discussions of urban agriculture have taken place in the context of revitalizing and reclaiming urban areas on the decline, UDC describes its orientation as more “global.” The activities here have been framed by competition for already crowded space as opposed to a solution to urban decay. This has translated into an 18,000 square ft. research garden, designed to optimize rainwater harvesting, and located on a rooftop within earshot of busy Connecticut Avenue.\nAdditionally, the University hosts a farmers market, is completing a commercial kitchen, and is establishing a number of food hubs across the District to help address food insecurity. One pattern we are beginning to see in many urban areas is the increasing desire for locally grown products, intersecting with the perennial needs of access to healthy food and community development. UDC’s new kitchen will be used both for education as well as retail purposes and is located directly above the site of the University’s Farmers Market. Much like other places that I have visited, local producers are not only being connected to a marketplace to sell their products but also the tools necessary to generate value-added products.\nUDC and similar efforts only further elucidate that urban agriculture is about production and creating economic opportunities for communities that need them. This is why USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture has provided over $3 million in support to the University over the past two years. The work I witnessed during my time at UDC makes me excited for the future of how research and extension can help support urban agriculture as a safe, efficient, and healthy component of local and regional food systems.\nDr. Ellen Harris, Director of the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center observing the hydroponics research at the neighboring Muirkirk Agricultural Experimentation.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n Ann Bartuska\n California\n capacity funds\n Education\n Farmers Markets\n Food Hubs\n gardening\n KYF2\n local food\n NIFA\n Ohio\n outreach\n REE\n Research\n rooftop\n University of the District of Columbia\n urban agriculture\n urban gardening\n Washington DC\n water",

(Click for the registration link)\nFor most people, water quality markets are probably a new concept. They are not something you hear about on the news every day, even though frequently cover the need to clean up rivers and lakes. But to some—like states, utilities, and farmers—they represent an opportunity, and should be on the radar.\nWater quality markets can reduce costs of cleaning up waterways by allowing sources with high costs of meeting water quality requirements to purchase credits from sources that have lower costs of making the same water quality improvement. Agricultural producers often have lower costs of improving water quality, which makes farmers and ranchers prime candidates to supply water quality credits.\nUSDA supports the participation of farmers, ranchers and forest landowners in water quality trading as a voluntary way to put more conservation on the ground, and improve water quality. The Department develops tools to calculate water quality benefits and resources on how to structure trading programs. Furthermore, the Department provides funding to support the development of water quality trading markets through NRCS Conservation Innovation Grants.\nAnd now, in partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency, USDA is offering the public an opportunity to learn more about water quality markets. The EPA-USDA Water Quality Markets Workshop is bringing a host of experts involved in water quality trading markets together to share their experiences and provide a wealth of information to those interested in starting or participating markets. The event will take place September 15-17 in Lincoln, Nebraska, and includes regional forums where participants can learn more about trading programs in their area.\nThe Workshop will do more than provide information—it will also highlight the history of collaboration on water quality trading within the federal government. USDA and EPA signed a partnership agreement in to work together on environmental markets, including water quality markets. Tools and resources developed under the agreement will be previewed at the Workshop, and participants will learn how they can apply to water quality planning and management.\nWorkshop participants will also get a taste of the larger partnership that has developed in support of water quality markets—including a look at the National Network on Water Quality Trading. The National Network is composed of representatives from agriculture, industry, state, and environmental groups from across the country working to help others develop and participate in water markets.  The National Network recently released Building a Water Quality Trading Program, which identifies common trading issues and the options, considerations, and examples important to developing a program.\nThere are plenty of reasons to attend next month’s Workshop—it will be an excellent forum to learn more about water quality markets. Registration closes August 31st. We look forward to seeing you there!\nUSDA supports the participation of farmers, ranchers and forest landowners in water quality trading as a voluntary way to put more conservation on the ground, and improve water quality.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Conservation\n Conservation Innovation Grants\n EPA\n Nebraska\n NRCS\n U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n water\n water quality",

Photo by Annie Ceccarini, USDA.\nAll summer, visitors to the National Capitol Region have been seeing monuments, public buildings, works of art and experiencing music and theater; however, many were unexpectedly surprised by the brilliant hues of purple, red and green emanating from USDA’s People’s Garden.\nBut those didn’t just pop up on their own. USDA has a cadre of friendly and knowledgeable employee volunteers who plant, maintain and harvest as well as interact and answer questions from hundreds of people who stop by to admire the garden.\n“People need to have a connection to their food, like I did when I was growing up,” said Lee Cliburn, who works for the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) - the agency that manages the People’s Garden. Cliburn is one of several USDA Master Gardeners who harvests vegetables on Tuesdays and Fridays. “My grandmother was a talented and skillful gardener, and I learned from her.”\nMany of the homegrown and overseas folks who stop by the organic vegetable garden at the intersection of Jefferson Drive and 12th Street, SW (northeast corner of USDA Headquarters property) have previously gardened or currently have a garden at home. Some have never experienced the joy and satisfaction of growing anything.\n“Kids visit us, see the garden and the projects we’re working on, and ask questions. This is an important project because it reconnects USDA with the people it serves and gets them thinking about their food,” said Cliburn.\nYet, this People’s Garden provides much more than a learning environment for tourists and spectators. Each week, hundreds of pounds of vegetables and herbs are harvested and donated to DC Central Kitchen (DCCK), where it is prepared and provided to folks who need help putting food on their tables.\n“They’re so appreciative,” said Tanya Brown, who works for the Farm Service Agency and drives the produce to DCCK. “They get green food, healthy food and herbs like basil and sage.  When I walk in they all say ‘Here comes the herb lady.’”\nDCCK provides 5,000 meals to 100 homeless shelters, transitional homes and nonprofit organizations throughout The District. Brown said the donated vegetables are used to help prepare some of these meals and when DCCK makes its menu, they say it comes from the People’s Garden.\nBy the simple act of planting a garden and having volunteers care for it has provided an outlet that not only educates the community but provides a solution to hunger.\n“Having the benefit of fresh vegetables and the experience of gardening encourages me to promote this basic human right for everyone,” said Effie Baldwin, who works for the National Institute of Food and Agriculture and also harvests vegetables on Tuesdays and Fridays. “Spending time in USDA’s People’s Garden not only provides a service but brings back memories of Midwestern summer days spent in my grandparent’s backyard garden.”\nThat’s the sentiment of many USDA Executive Master Gardeners who volunteer with the People’s Garden. Whether it’s listening to a visitor’s gardening woes, answering questions about a vegetable or plant, or donating food to feed the homeless, gardening is more than just food — it’s a labor of love.\nWant to volunteer at your local People’s Garden? You can find a People’s Garden in your neighborhood on our interactive map. There are 2,116 gardens – located in all 50 states, three U.S. territories and twelve foreign countries – registered as People’s Garden.\nVisit the USDA People’s Garden on the National Mall every Friday from 10 am to 2 pm to ask Executive Master Gardeners who volunteer with the People’s Garden questions.

The participating producers – all two hundred of them - generate about $70,000 in monthly sales from 4,000 locally produced products.  The organization manages storage space, a warehouse and owns several trucks. It has transformed from a small buying club to a formal food hub.\nBob Waldrop, a church music director in Oklahoma City, is the visionary behind the Oklahoma Food Coop.  For years, Bob knew the demand for local food in Oklahoma was great, and that the product was out there.  But, he also knew there were great challenges to matching supply and demand.  Customers didn’t know how to purchase directly from local producers, and producers weren’t sure how to target their products to reach their customer base.  One challenge was simply communication: how could a local producer identify and directly reach customers amongst Oklahoma’s 3.6 million residents?  And, how could consumers access some of Oklahoma’s finest locally produced food if they didn’t live on or near a farm themselves?\nBut the biggest challenge was how to get products off the local farms, which were mostly smaller livestock ranches and produce operations with little distribution infrastructure, and into the hands of individual consumers spread across the state’s 68,000 square miles.\nThe answer turned out to be a member cooperative with an easy to use Internet ordering program, coupled with a choreographed distribution system involving trucks, drop off points, warehouse space and a throng of committed volunteers. Each month, producers post the products they have to sell on the Oklahoma Food Coop website for customers to peruse and order.  Once orders are calculated, producers bring their merchandise to a central warehouse in Oklahoma City where it is sorted, prepared, and organized.  OFC trucks then crisscross Oklahoma’s roads, distributing orders to nearly 50 drop off locations throughout the state.\nThe Coop strictly enforces a “made in Oklahoma” policy for all products.  Three major principles govern its business operations: financial viability for the producers, sustainable growing practices that do not waste natural resources, and the economic benefits of the business should be distributed equitably to those involved in its operation.\nOn one hand it might seems like a simple system:  local producers post what they have on-line, consumers order, and product magically arrives to market.  But there is so much more to it than that.   As OFC demonstrates, aggregation, distribution and coordination really is the backbone of building strong relationships between producers and consumers.  It’s also the essence of a successful food hub.\nOklahoma Food Co-op’s distribution range\nEgg Check-in at Oklahoma Food Cooperative Delivery Day\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n AMS\n co-op\n Food Hub\n Oklahoma\n Oklahoma City\n Oklahoma Food Coop",

When food is a part of those activities, keep in mind the old saying: Safety first!\nUSDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline is here to help you with food safety for all your summer plans. It has been assisting Americans with all types of food safety questions and concerns since . Here are just a few:\nQuestion: I fell asleep and left hot dogs and hamburgers sitting out on the counter all night. If I reheat them, they will still be safe to eat, because I’ll kill all of the bacteria, right?\nAnswer: No. Cooking these items may kill the bacteria and other organisms, but it does not get rid of the dangerous toxins formed in the “danger zone” between 40°F and 140°F. Room temperature, of course, is part of that ‘zone.’ Never leave perishable foods out any longer than two hours at room temperature, no longer than one hour when the temperature is 90°F or higher. Those hot dogs and hamburgers left out should be tossed.\nQuestion: We grilled our beef burgers to 160°F, as measured by a food thermometer, but they are still pink inside. Are they still safe to consume?\nAnswer: Yes. Ground beef can be pink inside, even after it is safely cooked. The pink color can be due to a reaction between the heat and myoglobin, which causes a red or pink color. It can also occur when vegetables containing nitrites are cooked along with the meat. Because doneness and safety cannot be judged by color, it is very important to use a food thermometer when cooking ground beef. To be sure all harmful bacteria are destroyed, cook ground beef to an internal temperature of 160°F as measured with a food thermometer. For burgers, be sure to insert the thermometer probe into the side of the burger and get close to the center for an accurate read.\nQuestion: What’s the best way to travel with perishable food items that will later be grilled at the park?\nAnswer: Pack perishable foods directly from the refrigerator or freezer into the cooler. A full cooler will maintain its cold temperatures longer than one that is partially filled. Meat and poultry items may be packed while still frozen, keeping them colder longer. Be sure to keep raw meat and poultry at the very bottom of the cooler, wrapped separately from cooked foods and foods meant to be eaten raw, such as fruits. If the cooler is only partially filled, pack the remaining space with more ice or cooling packs. For long trips, take along two coolers — one for immediate food needs, such as lunch, drinks or snacks for the car trip, and the other for perishable foods to be used later. Limit the number of times the cooler is opened. Open and close the lid quickly.\nQuestion: I’m planning ahead for my family’s trip to the beach, are there any food safety tips I should consider?\nAnswer: Good thinking in planning ahead! Take along only the amount of food that can be eaten to avoid having leftovers. To keep your cooler cool, partially bury it in the sand, cover it with blankets and shade it with a beach umbrella. Bring along disposable moist towelettes for cleaning hands. If dining along the boardwalk. The “danger zone” is between 40 and 140°F, so don't eat anything that has been sitting out in the hot sun for more than two hours (one hour when the temperature is above 90°F) — that would be an invitation for foodborne illness and a spoiled vacation.\nThe hotline helps prevent foodborne illness by answering your questions about the safe food storage, handling and preparation.

(Photo by Steven Gnam/Trust for Public Land)\nPrivately-owned forests provide water, recreational opportunities, timber and other forest products, as well as habitat for fish and wildlife. However, as forests become fragmented by roads or converted to development, the benefits they provide can be compromised or lost altogether.\nNow a new Economic Contributions of Land Conserved by the USDA Forest Service's Forest Legacy Program report (, 2 ) is asking that we take a closer look at the economic contributions of the privately-owned forests – specifically, forests conserved through the USDA Forest Service’s Forest Legacy Program (FLP). The FLP is one way that the Forest Service responds to land use changes that threaten rural communities and economies.\nResearchers from the University of Massachusetts and the Forest Service used national, regional, and statewide to estimate annual timber harvest volumes and wood utilization, the value of maple syrup production, and annual use and trip spending for fishing, hunting and snowmobiling for FLP-conserved properties in four areas of the country: the Northeast, Northern Wisconsin and Michigan, Idaho and Western Montana, and Georgia and South Carolina.\nThe numbers are compelling: the study found that $140 per acre average annual value was added to the regional economy from economic activities on FLP land in the study area and lands conserved with FLP funds support from 280 to 2,500 jobs per region. However, these findings came as no surprise to either locals or state decision-makers.\n“In Georgia, we recognize that conserving working forest landscapes provides financial benefits to our local communities and our state economy,” said Georgia State Forester Chuck Williams. “Preventing conversion to non-forest uses and managing natural resources is part of our core mission, and the Forest Legacy Program helps us meet that mission.”\nThe City of Whitefish gets more than 75 percent of its drinking water from creeks like this one in the Haskill Basin Watershed. The Forest Legacy Program conservation easement ensures that this municipal water supply is protected. (Photo by Steve Gnam/Trust for Public Land)\nFor example, on the other side of the country, a Forest Legacy Project in Montana’s Haskill Basin is part of a large complex of productive forest lands owned by F.H. Stoltze Land and Lumber Company, a family-owned business.\nThe State of Montana partnered with the community of Whitefish and Stoltze to conserve 3,000 acres through an FLP grant, ensuring that the land will remain owned and sustainably managed by Stoltze under a multi-resource management plan. The conserved property supports roughly 10 full-time workers in the wood products industry and another 33 workers in other business sectors across the state while producing about 1 million board feet of merchantable timber each year.\nThe conservation easement also ensures that the land will remain open to the public for hunting, fishing, snowmobiling, hiking, and biking. More than 40 miles of hiking and biking trails now connect the property to Whitefish, and these trails have attracted even more visitors to the area, contributing millions of dollars per year to the city’s economy through trip-related spending at hotels and restaurants.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Forest Service\n Forestry\n Forest Legacy Program",

But beware of infected citrus fruit and plants, especially if you plan to buy citrus online.\nBefore you give citrus, here are four things you should know:\nBe Aware of Quarantines. If you are thinking about giving citrus fruit, plants, or items made with citrus (such as floral arrangements, wreaths, potpourri or seasonings like kaffir lime leaves), be sure not to move them from quarantined states or territories. Not only are you risking spreading citrus diseases by transporting citrus outside of these areas, but it's also against the law. Review the quarantine map.\nCheck the Citrus Supplier. Be a savvy buyer. Gift citrus fruit sold in a regulated state must be packed in a certified packinghouse and accompanied by a USDA certificate. Commercial fruit packers, Internet shippers and roadside vendors within regulated states should be able to prove they are in compliance with the federal quarantine. Before you buy, ask the vendor if their product is in compliance. Review the quarantine map.\nKeep Homegrown Citrus at Home. Help reduce the spread of citrus diseases by not moving your homegrown citrus fruit or plants across state lines. Enjoy your fruit with friends and neighbors, but be sure to obtain a federal certificate if you're thinking of transporting your citrus outside of your state. To inquire about transporting your citrus out of state, contact your USDA State Plant Health Director's office.\nAvoid Fines and Penalties. Because citrus diseases have destroyed millions of acres of citrus around the world, they present an immediate and urgent threat to America. If you knowingly purchase citrus in violation of quarantine regulations and requirements, the penalties you could incur range from $1,100 to $60,000 per violation. If you suspect citrus is being moved improperly, report your concerns to USDA's Smuggling Interdiction and Trade Compliance toll-free hotline at 877-.\nTo learn more, follow the 12 Days of Citrus on facebook.com/saveourcitrus and twitter.com/saveourcitrus, or visit our website.\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Tags:\n APHIS\n Christmas\n Plant Protections and Quarantine",

Through her National Institute of Food and Agriculture-funded research project, Dr. Yuying Liang, with the UM College of Veterinary Medicine, developed eight vaccine candidates against highly pathogenic H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses.\nResearch has shown that avian influenzas can mutate rapidly, and Liang said that this is a challenge to creating effective vaccines. “We do not know what strain or mutation of HPAI will appear or when it will appear,” Liang said.  “Existing vaccines are unlikely to be effective in new outbreaks.”\nThe key to reducing the spread of an HPAI outbreak is to have a targeted vaccine ready to deploy. “Our approach uses a live viral vector that would cause a strong and broadly protective immune response both in antibodies and T-cells,” she said. “Both are critical in creating a robust immune response.”\nFree viruses are ready to attack new cells. Antibodies can bind to these free viruses, blocking them from infecting new cells. Once viruses infect cells, antibodies cannot reach them. T-cells are needed to recognize and kill these virus-infected cells.\nThe eight vaccine candidates are currently being tested on mice. Next research phase is to evaluate efficacy in a live animal. Supply chain issues caused by the pandemic slowed research progress. UM has patented and licensed Liang’s viral vector.\n“We were fortunate to receive NIFA funding to jump start our research,” Liang said. “This work has great potential for advances in both animal and human health.”\nUSDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service spearheads surveillance and education efforts on HPAI, while Agricultural Research Service scientists are researching effective ways to control the disease.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n National Institute of Food and Agriculture\n NIFA\n USDA Science\n avian influenza\n vaccine\n You May Also Like\n Shining a Spotlight on USDA Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area Employees\n NIFA Investment Paves the Way for Veterinary Students\n USDA Women in Science Share Advice with the Next Generation",

Photo credit: Bugwood.org\nWith more than 80 percent of the world’s flowering plants relying on pollinators, their importance to natural ecosystems and agriculture cannot be overstated. However, populations of pollinators, including bird, bat, butterfly, beetle and bee species, have been declining around the world. Recognizing the importance of pollinators, Secretary Tom Vilsack of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has proclaimed June 15 to 21, as National Pollinator Week.\nTo celebrate Pollinator Week, we are sharing some of the Forest Service’s work to conserve one iconic pollinator species and its habitat – the Monarch butterfly. Monarch butterflies complete incredible migrations of hundreds to thousands of miles each year across North America. Along their migratory paths, Monarchs rely on habitats that contain milkweed species, which is the only plant that they lay their eggs on. Monarch caterpillars feed exclusively on milkweed, which contains chemical compounds that make them poisonous to potential predators.\nSpread across central Arkansas and southeastern Oklahoma, the Ouachita National Forest has been promoting environmental education with local students and communities. As part of a Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration project, the Forest Service has partnered with Native Expeditions and Monarch Watch to teach local students about pollinators and engaged them in habitat restoration for Monarch butterflies.\nThis past fall, nine schools around the Ouachita National Forest participated in this restoration event, with more than 370 students planting milkweed at their schools and on designated sites within the national forest. More than 1,000 milkweed plants of various species were planted! Additionally, more than 1,000 students were taught within the Shortleaf-Bluestem Community Collaborative Landscape Restoration project area about the importance of local ecosystems and the tools needed to restore native landscapes. These students also assisted the Forest Service in restoration efforts, re-establishing pollinator sites on the national forest, and planted pollinator-friendly species to create habitat in their school yards.\nResearchers with Forest Service Research and Development are working hand-in-hand with land managers to better understand pollinator science. Kas Dumroese, a Research Plant Physiologist with the Rocky Mountain Research Station, is working with collaborators to investigate methods for propagating milkweeds. “Monarchs once thrived across North America but their numbers have declined dramatically, about 97 percent, during the past two decades,” said Dumroese. By making it easier to incorporate milkweed species into plantings, native plant nurseries and their clients can help create and re-establish suitable habitats for Monarchs and other pollinators.  \nThe Forest Service is committed to protecting, conserving and increasing habitat for Monarchs and other pollinators, and is an important partner for the Monarch Butterfly Conservation Fund. Established by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the fund focuses on three priority conservation needs: restoring habitat, increasing organizational capacity and coordination among stakeholders, and producing and distributing native seeds. Learn more about what you can do to help pollinators, with the Forest Service and the Pollinator Partnership.\nThis post is part of a series featuring the Forest Service’s work on restoration across the country.\nMitzi Cole of the US Forest Service working with students to plant milkweed.

Vilsack was joined by Gov. Mark Dayton and Sen. Amy Klobuchar at the event.\nVilsack shared how USDA Rural Development’s Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) helps reduce America’s dependence on foreign oil. He also highlighted how a new provision in the program finances the installation of flex fuel pumps at convenience stores and fuel filling facilities throughout rural America.\nVilsack said that America faces many challenges because of its heavy dependence on foreign oil. He also highlighted President Obama’s goal of reducing the country’s foreign oil dependence by one-third. The new flex fuel provision in the REAP program is another step in reaching that goal.\n“We need to keep working to get more E-85 pumps more conveniently located,” Vilsack said.\nPartnership and collaboration also will help us reach the President’s goal, Vilsack said. The USDA is working with several organizations, including the Department of Energy, to advance the biofuels industry in the United States.\nIncreasing the flow of private capital and improving farmers’ bottom lines is another factor that will help move the renewable fuels industry forward. Vilsack said it is essential that the USDA continue to provide loan guarantee programs to farmers and engage private industry to invest in biofuels initiatives.\n“The future of biofuels is unlimited,” Vilsack said. “There are a lot of opportunities in this country.”\nVilsack concluded the discussion by reminding attendees that investing in renewable fuels and America’s farmers will not be possible if we let our rural infrastructure decline.

This brings the total number of dead trees since to over 102 million on 7.7 million acres of California's drought stricken forests. In alone, 62 million trees have died, representing more than a 100 percent increase in dead trees across the state from . Millions of additional trees are weakened and expected to die in the coming months and years.With public safety as its most pressing concern, the U.S. Forest Service has committed significant resources to help impacted forests, including reprioritizing $43 million in California in fiscal year to conduct safety-focused restoration along roads, trails and recreation sites. However, limited resources and a changing climate hamper the Forest Service's ability to address tree mortality in California. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Forest Service officials are seriously hampered not only by short-term budgets passed by Congress, but also a broken budget for the Forest Service that sees an increasing amount of resources going to firefighting while less is invested in restoration and forest health, said Vilsack.\"These dead and dying trees continue to elevate the risk of wildfire, complicate our efforts to respond safely and effectively to fires when they do occur, and pose a host of threats to life and property across California,\" said Vilsack. \"USDA has made restoration work and the removal of excess fuels a top priority, but until Congress passes a permanent fix to the fire budget, we can't break this cycle of diverting funds away from restoration work to fight the immediate threat of the large unpredictable fires caused by the fuel buildups themselves.\"The majority of the 102 million dead trees are located in ten counties in the southern and central Sierra Nevada region. The Forest Service also identified increasing mortality in the northern part of the state, including Siskiyou, Modoc, Plumas and Lassen counties. Five consecutive years of severe drought in California, a dramatic rise in bark beetle infestation and warmer temperatures are leading to these historic levels of tree die-off. As a result, in October California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency on the unprecedented tree die-off and formed a Tree Mortality Task Force to help mobilize additional resources for the safe removal of dead and dying trees.This year, California had a record setting wildfire season, with the Blue Cut fire alone scorching over 30,000 acres and triggering the evacuation of 80,000 people. In the southeastern United States wildfires have burned more than 120,000 acres this fall. The southeast region of the Forest Service is operating at the highest preparedness level, PL 5, reflecting the high level of physical resources and funding devoted to the region. Extreme drought conditions persist, and many areas have not seen rain for as many as 95 days.Longer, hotter fire seasons where extreme fire behavior has become the new norm, as well as increased development in forested areas, is dramatically driving up the cost of fighting fires and squeezing funding for the very efforts that would protect watersheds and restore forests to make them more resilient to fire. Last year fire management alone consumed 56 percent of the Forest Service's budget and is anticipated to rise to 67 percent in by .As the situation in the southeast demonstrates, the problem of shrinking budget capacity is felt across the U.S., not only in the western states. The health of our forests and landscapes are at risk across the nation, and the tree mortality crisis could be better addressed if not for the increasing percentage of the Forest Service budget going to fight wildfire. \"We must fund wildfire suppression like other natural disasters in the country,\" says Vilsack.Forest Service scientists expect to see continued elevated levels of tree mortality during in dense forest stands, stands impacted by root diseases or other stress agents and in areas with higher levels of bark beetle activity. Photos and video of the surveys are available on the Forest Service multimedia webpage.Learn more about tree mortality and the work to restore our forests in California at the Forest Service's web page Our Changing Forests. mission of the U.S. Forest Service, part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is to sustain the health, diversity and productivity of the nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations. The agency manages 193 million acres of public land, provides assistance to state and private landowners, and maintains the largest forestry research organization in the world.

NRCS photo.\nEvery winter Westerners look to the mountains and may not realize they’re peering into the future. More snow cap means more water come spring and summer. Many lives and livelihoods depend on nature’s uneven hand.\nThanks to USDA’s National Water and Climate Center, what used to be speculation is now science. Through a network of high-elevation weather stations across the West, the center accurately forecasts how much water Western states will receive from snowmelt.\nThe benefits everyone in the path of the streamflow. The center’s water supply forecasts empower states to take action to prevent flooding or prepare for drought. Some farmers look to the water supply forecast when deciding what crops to grow. It’s like playing chess with nature, and you can almost see nature’s next move.\nEarlier this month the center released the year’s final forecast culminating from the five before it, which shows the West divided into a wet north and dry south.\nWashington, most of Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and the northern parts of Colorado and Utah are expected to have near normal or above normal water supplies through the rest of summer, according to the forecasts. Far below normal streamflows are expected for the southern parts of Oregon and Utah, southwestern Idaho, California, Arizona, New Mexico and western Nevada.\nMany of these areas are in the nearly 500 counties across the country experiencing drought, 57 of them in California alone, according to USDA disaster designations.\nThis year saw near-record low snowfall in parts of Nevada, California, Arizona, New Mexico and the southern parts of Utah and Oregon. Even with some May precipitation, those areas remain dry.  The biggest change this season was in the Washington Cascades. At the beginning of February the snowpack was about half of normal, but it recovered and most of Washington will have a near normal water supply from snowmelt, according to the Center.\nSpring snowmelt is well underway, according to NWCC hydrologist Cara McCarthy. “A lot of our SNOTEL sites have already melted out, especially those in the southern half of the West,” McCarthy said.\nColorado had mixed weather during May. “They had winter and summer all in one month: snowmelt, snowfall, snowmelt,” said McCarthy. Heavy precipitation combined with snowmelt, causing flooding in parts of the state.\nForecasters monitor conditions all year, but June is the final forecast of the season. “These are snow-based water supply forecasts,” McCarthy said. “Typically by July there won't be enough snow left on the ground (to measure).”\nIn Western states where snowmelt accounts for the majority of seasonal water supply, information about snowpack serves as an indicator of future water availability. Streamflow in the West consists largely of accumulated mountain snow that melts and flows into streams as temperatures warm into spring and summer. USDA scientists analyze the snowpack, air temperature, soil moisture and other measurements taken from remote sites to develop the water supply forecasts.\nThe NWCC water supply forecast is part of several USDA efforts to improve public awareness and mitigate the impacts of climate change, including drought and other extreme weather events. Through the creation of the National Drought Resilience Partnership, launched as part of the President’s Climate Action Plan, federal agencies are working closely with states, tribes and local government to develop a coordinated response to drought.\nSince , USDA has conducted snow surveys and issued regular water supply forecasts.

The Academy breaks new ground, as a first-ever opportunity that will help address an identified need. You see, though SNAP E&T programs operate across America, we’ve found that there is an opportunity for further sharing of best practices and lessons learned by developing resources that spread the knowledge base throughout the country.

BASEC (named after the two counties it serves) has less than a 1 percent default rate and has made loans to all income levels with the majority being low to moderate income applicants.  Some of the borrowers have had excellent credit histories and some not so good.  Executive Director Lori Hintz feels the key to the low default rate besides the fact that great people live in the service area, is that when times get tough, they try to work out a plan that works for them, their cash flow and their situation.\nOf course not all of the businesses have been successful but the interesting thing is that even if the business doors closed; the owners still continued to pay off their loan.   This is a testament to the hardworking ethical people that live in the community.\nIn addition, to the loan programs, BASEC is committed to providing technical assistance to the service area.  Grants have been written for community projects, meetings have been facilitated, many events have been sponsored and hosted through the years.  They have tried hard to bring an awareness of new opportunities and resources available.  Encouraging leadership and volunteerism at all age levels has also been a core principal of BASEC.\nFrom the initial community grassroots meetings following the receipt of start-up government funding through USDA in the ’s, there was a sense that they needed to make the most out of this once in a lifetime opportunity and that becoming a self-sustainable organization was of high priority, thus the revolving loan fund (RLF) concept came about.  They did not want to take the place of banks and lending institutions but there certainly was the need to provide increased incentives for improvements, expansions and community development.  For many of the towns in the service area, there had not been a new home built in 20 years.  With that said, BASEC worked with the area banking representatives and other resource funding agencies to develop revolving loan programs (RLFs).\nThe RLF was diversified in to 4 major areas and those areas are continued today:\nAffordable and safe housing\nBusiness retention and development\nRural development\nFarm income development with a primary focus on livestock purchases\nThe RLF was developed in a way that BASEC could become a self-sustaining organization for far longer than the 10 year initiative.  In , BASEC’s loan fund became self-sufficient and all administrative costs were funded by using the interest rate returns from the loans made.  The principal portion of the funds that are repaid are put directly back into the revolving loan program and are reloaned.\nAccording to Executive Director Lori Hintz, the last 16 years have been both challenging and rewarding at times.  Finding solutions to funding outdated infrastructure such as roads, bridges, water and sewer lines, increasing job opportunities, keeping businesses, keeping schools, improving housing choices, and just improving the way of life in rural South Dakota keeps them working hard.  BASEC is an organization that should be around for many years.  It is one of the very few Enterprise Communities in the nation that achieved self-sustainability and continues to this day.\nUSDA Rural Development provides loan funds to organizations for re-lending.  To find out more about the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program, click here.

Many groups, including women, veterans, minorities and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, are shaping an agricultural future that is looking to be more diverse than ever before and we want to share their stories. Every day this week, we will be sharing a story from a woman in agriculture that represents the past, present and future of our industry.\nToday, we feature Katy Coba, Director of the Oregon Department of Agriculture. Katy was raised on her family’s wheat ranch in Eastern Oregon. She has a deep appreciation for the land and the hard work Oregon’s farmers and ranchers do every day. Katy has a long career in state government and shares her perspective on the current and future landscape of American agriculture (and how not to be left behind on a trade mission).\nHow do you start your day?\nI always start my day with a quick perusal of the news going on in Oregon, in the U.S. and around the world.  I think it’s imperative to make sure I have at least a bit of knowledge about what is happening in the world that could impact my job.  Oregon agriculture is local, domestic and international.  There are so many factors that impact the success of the industry from weather, to currency, to the latest hot “thing” such as food carts, to trade negotiations, etc.  Knowing what has the potential to impact the industry hopefully means we can be more prepared to respond.  Then I pet my cat and have a latte with my husband!\nWhat are some of the biggest challenges facing agriculture today?\nThe good news is that agriculture continues to be a very viable part of Oregon’s economy and the U.S. economy.  With the projections in growth for the global population, agriculture will need to continue to use innovation and technology to meet world food needs.  Agriculture will also need to continue to use its scarce resources wisely.  This includes land and water.  Oregon agriculture is extremely diverse.  This is a strength and it can sometimes pose challenges.  We continue to consistently stress the need for farmers of different shapes and sizes to work together as neighbors and co-exist with their different production practices.  And finally, consumer’s interest in how their food is grown and handled has added a new complexity to how farmers and ranchers do their job.  Agriculture will need to continue to be responsible to consumer’s passion around food and be able to demonstrate safe and compassionate practices.\nWhat do you think is missing from the conversation when we don’t have women at the table and in leadership roles?\nWomen involved in agriculture certainly bring a perspective and a voice that is important to a well-rounded industry.  I think about the key role my grandmother played in our family farming operation when I was growing up.  She was certainly a role model for me.  I find the more diversity in thinking about how to deal with the opportunities and challenges in the agriculture industry, the better the result of that thought process.  Women certainly bring critical diversity.\nWhat has been your most memorable experience as Oregon Director of Agriculture?\nThat’s a tough one.  I have certainly had amazing experiences in my job, from being left behind on a trade mission (!) to being recognized for my contributions to Oregon agriculture.  I will change the question a bit to what will be one of the best memories I will take from this job.  That is the fact that I have been blessed to represent an industry that is my heritage.  When I think about my ancestors and the hard work they have put into our own ranch, I feel humbled to be in the position I am in.  When I think about my role models, my mom and dad, who raised me to be proud of my heritage and to be a contributor to society through public service, I know I am indeed a very lucky lady.\nIn seven words or less, what is some advice you would offer your fellow women in agriculture?\nBe passionate about what you do.\nKaty Coba, Director of the Oregon Department of Agriculture, was raised on her family’s wheat ranch in Eastern Oregon.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n Krysta Harden\n Oregon\n women\n Women in Agriculture",

This training opportunity exposed members of FAS’s Junior Professional Advisory Committee (JPAC) to a broad range of U.S. agriculture in Minnesota and Iowa. The trip also helped maintain and build direct relationships with the U.S. agricultural industry, reinforcing the Agency’s connection to its primary constituents.\nIn Austin, MN, we toured Hormel’s meat processing facilities. Afterwards, we learned more about the company during a presentation and tour of the SPAM Museum. SPAM is by far the biggest product for Hormel, with strong export potential due to high demand from foreign markets. South Korea is currently the biggest overseas market for SPAM, but Hormel is also focusing its marketing on mainland Japan and China. One of the biggest challenges in its export market is SPAM education – teaching potential customers how to cook and prepare SPAM. In its effort to export to foreign markets, Hormel uses different flavors of SPAM, and its marketing campaigns vary to improve brand status within the respective export destinations.\nAnother highlight of the trip was a visit to Absolute Energy, LLC, a locally owned company with offices in Minnesota and Iowa that seeks to increase economic development in the local area, add value to corn production, provide a return on investments for investors, and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. We learned a lot about the ethanol process and toured the grounds of the facility, which produces 120 million gallons of ethanol each year.\nThis geographical region presented a unique opportunity for our staff to observe the development, harvesting, processing, and marketing of major commodity crops, processed products meat, and horticultural products as well as operations at an ethanol plant, milling facility, port, and the Minneapolis Grain Exchange. Participants had the opportunity to learn more about the various types of agricultural businesses, from large companies like Cargill and Hormel, to family farms who are active participants in Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) shares and farmers markets.\nOur visit to the Midwest allowed us to personally witness how public and private partnerships are being utilized to increase U.S. exports and promote sustainable development in the agriculture industry both domestically and abroad. It was extremely beneficial to hear directly from those affected and the impact this has on their goals, both domestically and in the export market.\nTrip participants paid a visit to Hormel where they learned about meat processing and about the impact of exports on the company.\n Category/Topic:\n Trade\n Tags:\n Austin\n Community-Supported Agriculture\n Exports\n FAS\n Iowa\n Junior Professional Advisory Committee\n Midwest\n Minnesota\n USDA",

        "content": "in\n Conservation\n USDA Results\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Rural\n Initiatives\n Apr 29, \n In the four years I’ve served as Deputy Secretary, I’ve talked with thousands of women in agriculture – from young women thinking about entering farming to older women who have been tilling the soil for decades.  Each of their stories is powerful on its own.  But taken together, they have been an inspiration to the entire country. And today, we know that there are nearly one million of these stories around the country – nearly one million women farming and ranching on America’s working lands.\nA study released today by USDA’s Economic Research Service, Characteristics of Women Farm Operators and Their Farms found that the number of women-operated farms more than doubled between and . When all women involved with farming are added up – including primary and secondary operators – they are nearly one million strong and account for 30% of U.S. farmers.\nThe study also found that the number of women-operated farms increased in all sales classes, suggesting that size does not matter when it comes to agricultural opportunity for women.\nThis puts real numbers to a trend that many of us have seen firsthand: there is serious momentum behind women in agriculture.  This is personally gratifying for me – supporting women in agriculture has long been one of my passions. And it is a sign of the growing importance of USDA efforts to reach women farmers and ranchers.\nWhile at USDA, I’ve made this a priority. For instance, in the last four years, USDA’s Farm Service Agency has made significant modifications to its County committee structure to ensure fair representation of minority and women producers.\nWe are also highlighting the accomplishments of women in agriculture, even as we work to ensure that USDA programs serve them better. Through the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative, we’ve seen how women are driving the development of local and regional food systems across the country.  Last fall, I penned an op-ed with another women leader in agriculture, New Hampshire Agricultural Commissioner Lorraine Stuart Merrill, about the contributions women are making in the Granite State’s economy through local food.\nThe ERS study also finds that women are leaders in livestock production.  Nearly half of our country’s women-operated farms—those for which a woman is primarily responsible for making the business decisions—specialize in livestock. During a White House Google+ Hangout about women in agriculture, I talked with Cory Carman, a fourth-generation rancher from eastern Oregon who left farming for another career only to follow her heart back to Carman Ranch to raise cattle.  Now she is the operator of a thriving direct-marketing beef business.\nFor me, one of the most exciting findings of the ERS report is that younger women are entering farming faster than older women are leaving. Women also have a higher land ownership rate than their male counterparts, with 85% of women owning all of the land they farm, compared to 66% of their male counterparts.\nBut women farmers and ranchers still have a ways to go. More women than men rely on off-farm income, suggesting that farming cannot support them full-time. Only 5% of women-operated farms have sales of $100,000 or more.\nTonight, I will be traveling to LaCrosse, WI to join WomenShare , an event focused on women in the food system. This will be my last official travel as Deputy Secretary of USDA. As I prepare to leave my post as the highest ranking woman at the Department, know that I will continue to work on advancing women’s opportunities in agriculture. One million women is only the beginning.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n USDA Results\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Rural\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n ERS\n FSA\n Google+\n Kathleen Merrigan\n KYF2\n Livestock\n Oregon\n White House\n Wisconsin\n Women Farmers",

Its founder, Adam Burke, an Iraq combat veteran and Purple Heart recipient, is utilizing his skills to create a unique environment where veterans can develop agriculture skills that can help them become effective farmers or ranchers.  USDA is partnering with Veterans Farm to conduct workshops to connect these veterans to key departmental resources that can plant the seeds for their new agricultural careers.\nI recently attended one of these workshops to introduce our veterans to my agency – the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). In particular, I talked about opportunities to strengthen the local food sector via AMS’ Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program (which includes the Local Food Promotion Program and the Farmers Market Promotion Program) as well as the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. I also talked about our recent partnership with the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to begin a series of grant-writing workshops to help potential grant applicants write successful grant applications.\nOur goal is for Veterans Farm to add USDA resources to its already impressive list of offerings for the veteran community. Currently, the organization provides training workshops in land acquisition, planning, resource management, mentoring, case management, agro-business, and a fellowship program.  Burke hopes to help veterans create solid agricultural businesses that will thrive by expanding their markets thus allowing returning veterans to integrate honorably and effectively into local communities.  The effective approaches used by Veterans Farm earned recognition from the White House.  In , Burke received the Presidential Citizens Medal – recognized as the second highest civilian award of our government.\nVeterans Farm founder Adam Burke receives the Presidential Citizens Medal from President Obama.

We go in each year with teams of volunteers and clean up “hot spots” identified by the Forest Service, Leon County Sheriff’s Department, and forest user groups,” said community volunteer Sharon Gray.\nOver the years, several organizations have signed on to help sponsor the event including Southern Trail Riders, Tallahassee Off Road Club, Capital City Jeepers and Forest Edge Neighborhood, Leon County Public Works, Solid Waste Division and Recycling, and the Leon County Sheriff’s Department.\nThe volunteers bagged trash, in addition to collecting everything from tires to electronics.  Leon County Solid Waste Division, another sponsor of the event, hauled away tons of debris.\n“In previous years we have designated a roll-off container specifically for metal. Anything metal retrieved from the forest is sold. This year, very little metal was picked up.

They are proudly promoting their new “Salad Jewels“ product line, which was introduced at the Canadian Produce Marketing Association (CPMA) trade show.\nWhat does a pomegranate need to do to get from an orchard in California to a dining table in Canada? The pomegranate doesn’t have to do anything, but U.S. growers must prepare the ground for their products in more ways than one. It takes knowledge and resources to bring U.S. food and agricultural products to the global marketplace – a daunting challenge for many farmers and small businesses.\nBut help is available. USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) supports four non-profit trade organizations, called State Regional Trade Groups (SRTGs), that provide hands-on support and assistance to U.S. small-and medium-size companies seeking to build a global business. SRTGs, working in conjunction with the state departments of agriculture in their respective regions, can help beginning exporters with everything from learning the fundamentals of exporting to identifying overseas opportunities and finding potential distributors. With support from FAS’ Market Access Program, SRTGs also help fund international marketing campaigns and promote U.S. farm and food products overseas.\nGetting back to pomegranates, consider the ones grown on the Oro Loma Ranch, a small family-owned business in rural Firebaugh, Calif. The ranch teamed up with an SRTG – the Western United States Agricultural Trade Association, or WUSATA – in the spring of to increase markets for its fresh and packaged pomegranate products. Oro Loma Ranch participated in WUSATA’s branded program, which provides cost-share funding for eligible international marketing and promotional activities. After just one year in the program, the company’s exports of fresh pomegranates to Canada are up 33 percent, and sales of packaged pomegranate seeds are up 66 percent.\nJason Hall, president of Oro Loma Ranch said, “We’re very pleased with this first-year performance, and we are continuing to see growth. Participating in WUSATA’s branded program has definitely helped our brand awareness.”\nWUSATA’s support enabled the company to develop marketing materials aimed at the Canadian market and to exhibit at the Canadian Produce Marketing Association trade show.\nHall continued, “The growth we’ve experienced has given us the confidence to invest more in advertising and promoting. The more you put into it, the better results you get.”\nFor more information on how FAS and STRGs can help new exporters build their global businesses, visit www.fas.usda.gov/topics/exporting/getting-started.\n Category/Topic:\n Trade\n Tags:\n agricultural exports\n California\n Canada\n FAS\n Market Access Program\n State Regional Trade Groups\n Trade",

Design credit: Mary Horning, US Forest Service (Click to view a larger version)\nRecreational drones or Unmanned Aircraft Systems sometimes called UAS have become increasingly popular in the past few years. While this is an interesting hobby and can allow you to get beautiful aerial photography, some activities pose a significant hazard.\nThe use of these drones to capture video footage of wildfires is one of those hazardous activities.\nThe US Forest Service wants you to know that unauthorized drone flights near a wildfire have the very real potential to cause serious injury or even death to firefighters and pilots who are in the air, as well as firefighters and public citizens on the ground. This is because aerial firefighting aircraft, such as airtankers and helicopters, fly at very low altitudes, the same as drones flown by the general public, creating an environment for mid-air collisions.\nAdding to this disastrous mix of unauthorized drone flights and fire is the fact that firefighting aircraft typical fly in smoky, windy and turbulent conditions. Safety depends on knowing what other aircraft are operating in the airspace and where they are at all times. Consequently, their safety is compromised by the presence of a drone.\nSuspending air operations because of drone use, which has happened several times already on major fires, could decrease the effectiveness of wildfire suppression operations. This year alone there have been at least 13 instances of unauthorized flights of drones over or near wildfires in at least seven states including California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Alaska, Minnesota, and Montana.\nThe effects of lost aircraft airtime could be compounded by potential flames moving into untreated terrain. This type of delay can allow wildfires to grow larger with the potential to threaten lives and property. Suspended air operations can also delay transportation of firefighters to different locations and add to costs of fighting the fire.\nThose who fly drones without authorization over wildfires may be violating federal, state, or local laws, regulations, and ordinances, whether a Temporary Flight Restriction is in place or not.\nAll unauthorized drone flights over wildfires on National Forest System lands will be reported to the Federal Aviation Administration and law enforcement agencies. Individuals who have been determined to have endangered manned aircraft or people on the ground with a drone or interfered with wildfire suppression may be subject to civil penalties, including fines of up to $25,000, and potentially criminal prosecution.\nSo please be smart about where and when you choose to fly your drone.  If you fly, we can’t. And if we can’t we are unable to do our jobs to protect you, your family, or your neighbors from a wildfire.\nFirefighting aircraft, like drones, fly at low altitudes creating a high probability of collisions.

Nichols Dam, a flood retention structure owned by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). This project was made possible with nearly $2 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of (the Recovery Act) funds. The Recovery Act was created by the Obama Administration to boost the nation’s economy, in part by developing and improving infrastructure like dams.\nA spillway acts like a safety valve to prevent water from flowing over the top of the dam in a storm, which can damage the dam and compromise its structural integrity. With the new spillway excavated, the dam was in danger of breaching if the eight inches of rain that were forecast for the following 12 hours actually occurred. The potential for major flooding and property damage was significant.\nI immediately contacted the contractor and asked that they begin preparations for the storm, including the construction of an earthen berm in the new auxiliary spillway to protect the dam from breaching. I also called the city’s Conservation Commission for permission to lower the water level in the reservoir to increase its capacity.\nOn Saturday, the day of the storm, my work began at 4 a.m. I coordinated with local emergency management officials and state dam safety personnel, and ensured that the contractor completed the work.\nContractors consult with federal, state and local officials on preparations to help the Nichols Dam weather Tropical Storm Irene\nThe rain started at 1 p.m.; construction continued until 9 p.m. I went home at 11 that night. By 3 a.m. I was back on site to monitor precipitation and the impoundment level. I left to get some sleep but was back again by 6 a.m.\nBy this time, the rain and wind intensity had increased. Throughout the morning, I measured precipitation and reservoir levels and forwarded the to engineering consultants who were revising various mathematical models of potential flood impact based on the forecasted rainfall. Ultimately, the reservoir crested at 2 inches below the existing auxiliary spillway.\nBy the time Irene was done with us, many trees were down and most of the area was without power, including the construction trailer. The weekend was certainly long and exhausting, but it was rewarding, too: the dam weathered the storm with only minor damage.\nLearn more about NRCS Recovery Act Programs.\nCheck out more conservation stories on the USDA blog.\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\nContractors build an earthen berm to shore up the George H.

        "content": "Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development in\n Rural\n Oct 30, \n NOTE: This week on the USDA Blog, we’ve been featuring the stories of America’s Harvest Heroes who, like farmers across the nation, are working this harvest season to secure the bounty of healthy food American agriculture is renowned for. From laying the foundation for the next generation of farmers putting down roots in rural America, supporting the fruit and vegetable growers who are helping to build healthier communities, bolstering new markets for the products of agricultural innovation, to harvesting renewable energy that is made in Rural America, with USDA’s support our farmers are yielding strong results for every American. This blog focuses on two heroes of a different kind of harvest – clean, renewable energy that is .\nI spent some time in Montana earlier this month to attend the Harvesting Clean Energy conference in Billings. We talked about options for continuing to support clean energy development, whether it's bio-based, geothermal, solar, or wind – and how rural America fits in to the picture of clean energy development.\nOur Rural Energy for America Program was, unsurprisingly, a key focus by the participants. Having been reauthorized by the recent Farm Bill, Congress put REAP in a position to have very real impact on clean energy development in our rural communities. If properly leveraged with other programs, both private and public, and investment from the private sector – the funding made available by Congress could conceivably have a billion-dollar impact on clean energy development in our nation.\nRed Lodge Ales owner Sam Hoffmann (middle) explains his brewery’s thermal solar heating system to Montana State Director Janelle Gustafson (l) and Deputy Under Secretary Lillian Salerno (r). Hoffmann used the Rural Energy for America Program to purchase and install the thermal system.\nWhat strikes me the most is, how many of the projects to this point have been implemented. Rather than just the large complexes – which certainly have their place in the overall picture – rural America has responded by implementing small-scale projects, often at an individual business level, that have had noteworthy impact on the energy structure in their communities.\nWhile in Montana, I was able to see first-hand how these small scale projects have made a positive change on not just the carbon footprint and energy consumption of rural small businesses, but on their operational bottom line. I visited Red Lodge, Montana, a small community southwest of Billings that acts as a gateway in to Yellowstone National Park via the Beartooth Highway.\nTwo particular businesses stood out for me, the Yodeler Motel, and Red Lodge Ales. Both companies had made investments in their businesses through the Rural Energy for America Program, and done so on a relatively small scale – yet had seen a direct and positive impact on their operations due to the cost savings from the renewable energy sources. Harnessing the sun's radiant thermal energy to heat water, both the Yodeler and Red Lodge Ales have utilized the water in different ways to benefit their businesses. The Yodeler uses the heated water in their boiler to heat the rooms and common areas of the historic motel on the south end of Red Lodge.\nMac Dean of the Yodeler Motel in Red Lodge, Mont. explains the thermal transfer system that supplies the motel's boiler with heated water, providing warmth to the Yodeler's rooms and common areas.\nRed Lodge Ales takes the pre-heated water, and superheats it to clean their brewing tanks, as well as maintain the necessary heat to brew their beer.\nIt's a prime example of two different businesses using similar technology to harvest the abundant, clean, and free energy around us to benefit not only the businesses themselves – and their bottom line – but to benefit their community and the environment as a whole. I'm proud that USDA Rural Development could play a role in that.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n harvest heroes\n Rural Development\n Rural Energy for America Program",

As the vice president for Farm Credit of New Mexico and a board director for the Sorghum Checkoff, the sorghum producer from New Mexico is making strides in the agriculture industry.\nUlibarri, a fifth-generation farmer, said she always wanted to be a farmer. She and her husband, Anthony, started their own farming operation in . They grow sorghum and wheat and run stocker cattle on approximately 1,700 acres of land.\n“I grew up driving tractors and working cattle,” said Ulibarri. “I’ve always had a liking for it and a desire to do that.  It is my goal to keep propagating the family-farm lifestyle because I think that it is important for kids to grow up with strong family values. It will make them strong contributors to society.”\nAs a board director for the Sorghum Checkoff, Ulibarri is excited about the opportunity to educate other producers about the benefits of growing sorghum. With the drought and current water situation in New Mexico, she has been having a lot of conversations with farmers about considering grain sorghum, a crop that typically requires less water while providing a satisfactory return on investment.\nThis industry leader said she promotes the crop in other ways, as well, encouraging individuals to include more sorghum-based foods in their diets and informing them about the many products currently available.\nAgriculture has become more progressive in order to keep up with the increasing demand, Ulibarri said, and she contributes her personal success within the sorghum industry to her upbringing.\n“My parents raised me to be pretty independent, competitive, and to strive to do my best no matter what,” she said. “That is probably the biggest reason I am where I am today. It really has nothing to do with the fact that I am male or female, but that I have the ability and drive to do a good job.”\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n AMS\n Farm Credit of New Mexico\n Farmers\n New Mexico\n Producers\n research and promotion programs\n sorghum\n Sorghum Checkoff",

The students choreographed a dance routine and each student offered a statistic that outlined the scope of the obesity challenge (for example, childhood obesity is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease) and proposed solutions to tackling it. Like the students at USDA, they proposed more rigorous physical education in schools, with a focus on physical activities that provide students the “skills to better themselves.” They also spoke about the value of reading nutritional labels, as well as the importance of social activities like town dances that provide exercise and help build a sense of community.\n4-H students present their work on implementing Let’s Move! in schools at the White House Conference Center.\nStudents in both groups also detailed how they plan to support Let’s Move! in their local communities by promoting and leading initiatives aimed at improving nutrition education and increasing physical activity.

(Click for a larger version)\nOver 50 years ago, a visionary Congress established an innovative program to bring communities together to invest in open spaces and recreational opportunities that are an essential part of our nation’s heritage and economy. Since then, the highly successful Land and Water Conservation Fund has helped to protect working forests and ranches, preserve our public lands -- parks, refuges,  forests, rivers, lakes and wildlife habitats -- and provide access to outdoor recreation across the nation for use and enjoyment by all Americans.\nPresident Obama is committed to passing on America’s public lands and waters to future generations in better shape than we found them. That’s why he is proposing full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund in the Fiscal Year budget, and pursuing permanent authorization in annual mandatory funding for the Fund’s programs beginning in .\nIn , the budget will invest $900 million in conservation and recreation projects – a  portion of the revenues from offshore oil and gas drilling that are deposited in the fund each year –through a combination of discretionary ($475 million) and mandatory ($425 million) funding. This culminates a multi-year strategy leading to full permanent funding for the Fund in .\nThese investments – using voluntary conservation tools like easements and purchases from willing sellers – respond to local communities’ priorities. They will conserve public lands in or near national parks, refuges, and forests, including landscapes identified for collaborative, strategic conservation; increase access for hunting and fishing; protect historic battlefields; and provide grants to states for close-to-home recreation and conservation projects on non-federal lands.\nThis is great news for all Americans – from hunters and anglers, to outdoor enthusiasts and history buffs, to communities large and small across the nation who benefit from the Land and Water Conservation Fund investments. In fact, the program has supported more than 42,000 national, state and local parks and outdoor recreation projects in all 50 states.\nThis year’s budget proposes to fund projects across the country - from expanding access to outdoor recreation opportunities in the High Divide in Idaho and Montana, to protecting endangered wildlife and watersheds in the headwaters of the Everglades in Florida - that will help strengthen local economies and enhance our public lands and waters.  Other projects will preserve the wetlands and grasslands popular with hunters and fishermen in North Dakota and South Dakota.  In Maryland and Virginia, the budget proposes to protect wildlife habitats as well as significant archaeological sites in American history by enhancing the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail, and the Nanjemoy National Resource Management Area.  A full list of the proposed projects is available here.\nWhen we talk about investing in our future, the Land and Water Conservation Fund is one of the most effective programs there is, with conservation and recreation projects serving as a big boon to local economies, bolstering tourism and supporting jobs. For every $1 invested through the Land and Water Conservation Fund, there is an estimated return of $4 in local economic activity.  This is not only good for our nation, environment and people, it’s also a good return on investment.\nCongress recently took an important initial step to reauthorize and support the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but we need to do more. By fully and permanently funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund – as millions of Americans are urging – we can do our part to help sustain our nation’s public lands and waters for present and future generations.\nSince , USDA has invested more than $29 billion to help producers make conservation improvements, working with as many as 500,000 farmers, ranchers and landowners to protect over 400 million acres nationwide, boosting soil and air quality, cleaning and conserving water and enhancing wildlife habitat.

For example, the National Park Service focuses on protecting ecosystems, while the Fish and Wildlife Service is concerned about the effects of a warming climate on salmon. The Department of Defense has as a focus of protecting coastal facilities so they are not damaged by sea-level rise.\n“We want to make sure that coordination is occurring in climate change programs across all federal agencies,” said Emily Seyller of the Global Change Research Program. “This new report gives us a baseline for coordinating responses to climate change in the years ahead.\"\nAlthough some have called for greater certainty about climate change effects before taking action, the report documents that at the local level, agency resource managers are moving forward with climate change assessments and adaptation strategies. For example, the Forest Service has already completed assessments for a third of its national forests.\n“We’re drowning in and scientific publications,” said Forest Service scientist Dave Peterson. “We need to take the information we have, assess the risk of climate change on natural resources, and manage that risk as part of agency business.”\nThe report’s authors are optimistic that federal agencies can make progress in climate change adaptation in the years ahead, but emphasize that implementation needs to be accelerated. “We’re not in crisis mode, but the clock is ticking as the climate continues to warm,” said Peterson. “If we don’t pick up the pace in responding, we may preclude options that would maintain the sustainability of resources on federal lands.”\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Climate Change Adaptation in United States Federal Natural Resource Science and Management Agencies: A Synthesis\n Fish and Wildlife Service\n National Park Service\n University of Washington\n US Forest Service '\n US Global Change Research Program",

        "content": "JUMP TO:\nWriting Style\nPlain Language\nMy Signature Block\nGender Inclusive Communications Guidance\nAccessibility\nProgram-Specific \nFurther Agency Specific Guidance\nOverview\nUSDA uses two styles for publications and printing. Materials developed primarily for the mass-media are written using the latest Associated Press Stylebook. All other materials are written using the latest Government Printing Office Style Manual in accordance with Title 44 U.S.C. § . Form and style of work for departments. Ensure your writing meets accessibility standards.\nWriting Style\nAssociated Press [AP] or Government Printing Office Style (GPO): Which style manual do I use?\n Why the differentiation?\n Using the media prevalent style for the mass media audience increases the likelihood that our preferred USDA language appears in narratives as it was originally written.\n The following lists USDA outreach products with for their production and the designated style. Also noted are exceptions to the style as deemed necessary by the Department.\n These style are supplemental information to support the current department directives: DR-001 Publications Review/Clearance Policy; DR-002 Printing Policy; DR-002 Use of Logos/Marks at the United States Department of Agriculture; DR-002 Press Operations.\n Press Releases\n USDA press releases must adhere to the Associated Press Stylebook except where this document points to exceptions.\n A press release is written to encourage media to report on a newsworthy USDA policy, action, or announcement. The department and our agencies’ public affairs directors and OC coordinators are responsible for determining whether a press release is an appropriate form of outreach.\n Guidance for writing press releases\n Use strong active verbs. Use plain language. In general, a news release shouldn't be longer than one page and no more than two pages. Keep it brief.\n According to Cornell University, research suggests the ideal sentence length is 15 to 20 words, with 85 percent of the words one or two syllables long.\n Don't resort to run-on sentences; instead, use punctuation. Always remember your audience are media professionals. Use plain language, since releases may be used verbatim in media outlets. Always read what you write and have a lay coworker read what you write. If they don’t understand it, chances are your audience won’t either.\n Note: the media has significantly changed over the past fifteen years. Today, reporters are likely to be generalists without a strong agricultural or food policy background.\n With rare exception, quotes should be 25 – 50 word maximum.\n The purpose of the quote is to encourage the reporter to include the most important talking point using USDA’s exact words.\n Reporter’s stories are bound by the newspaper/magazine/broadcast editors’ word/time limits. If you provide too much, you encourage the reporter to paraphrase or pick and choose what part of the quote to include in the story.\n The reporter can be provided a press-background brief to educate them on the details of the program or policy announcement, it doesn’t need to be in the quote.\n Quotes from outside principals, partners, or organizations are generally not used unless approved by the deputy director of communications for press operations. Key partnerships can be referenced in the release. Other federal agency quotes are acceptable with approval of the press secretary or their designee.\n Jargon\n Don't use jargon. If you absolutely must use a jargon word, explain it.\n Web addresses/Internet\n Say: \"More information is at www.usda.gov.\" There is no need to use a colon before at. If an Internet address falls at the end of a sentence, use a period. Do not capitalize the \"e\" in email. Do not say “click here.”\n Ending the Release\n End news releases with three # symbols, centered, two lines below the last line of the release.\n Place this short EEO statement two lines below the three # symbols: “USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer, and lender.”\n A short note after the text of a news release can be used to provide additional information to the media, such as the availability of photographs, publications or sound bites. Any \"Note to Reporters,\" if needed, should be single-spaced, not exceed 1/3 of a page in length, and start two lines below the #.\n Following are some specifics to keep in mind when preparing materials. These include some USDA specific directions for formatting the press release.\n Acronyms\n Spell out U.S. Department of Agriculture and names of agencies and programs in the first reference. If an abbreviation or acronym would not be clear on second reference, do not use it. Often a generic word such as the agency or the program is more appropriate and less jarring to the reader. At other times, you may need to repeat the full name for clarity.\n *Note: AP doesn't follow a term with an abbreviation in parentheses, though a well-known abbreviation may be used in follow-ups.\n Attribution\n Use said. It is a good, clean, four-letter word. Do not use: stated, noted, pointed out, commented, explained, or any other similar word. Use said.\n In the first reference to the Secretary: “Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack”\n Second reference and beyond: “Secretary Vilsack”\n Conjunctions\n Follow AP style. When a conjunction such as and, but or for links two clauses that could stand alone as separate sentences, use a comma before the conjunction in most cases: “She was glad she had looked, for a man was approaching the house.”\n Commas in a series\n Use commas to separate elements in a series, but do not put a comma before the conjunction in most simple series: The flag is red, white and blue. He would nominate Tom, Dick, Harry or Jeannette.\n Press release contact information\n When the Secretary of Agriculture or subcabinet officials are quoted, list the Office of Communications at press@usda.gov (the general OC email address) as the first contact with the appropriate agency contact listed second. Do not put a comma between names and phone numbers.\n Datelines\n Datelines should be bold, and include city, month (use AP abbreviation), day and year. Datelines on stories should contain the place name, followed in most cases by the name of the state, country or territory where the city is located. AP allows for large cities to stand alone without a state name. See the AP stylebook for a complete list of exempted cities.\n If an announcement is made by a USDA official when he or she is away from Washington, use the city where the official is that day as the dateline.\n Capitalize the names of months in all uses.\n Example\n USE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7, —\n DO NOT USE: (Washington, D.C., January 7, )\n Formats\n Single space news releases and other press materials. Justify them left, with 1-inch margins and half-inch indents. Skip one line between paragraphs. Use only Times New Roman 12-point typeface. Use MSWord software, Drupal or another USDA Chief Information Officer- approved content management system.\n Headlines\n Center headlines and boldface them. Do not use all caps. Capitalize the first letter in words except for conjunctions (but), prepositions (of) and articles (a). Follow the same rules for subheads, and put subheads in italics centered below the headline. Headlines and subheads are active tense.\n With headlines that include the Secretary of Agriculture, this is the proper form: “Secretary Vilsack announces…”\n Do not use the principal’s first name in the headline.\n Stakeholders\n Don't use the word stakeholders. Instead, describe who you mean, such as farmers, ranchers, commodities groups, members of Congress, private sector partners, public sector partners, or federal agencies.\n AP Styleguide Exceptions\n In the first reference to the Secretary: “Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack”\n Secretary quote should be followed by: “said Secretary Vilsack.”\n Media Advisory\n Media advisories are used to announce a media call or press event where a principal USDA representative will make a significant newsworthy announcement. The primary audience is media.\n USDA media advisories are to adhere to the Associated Press Stylebook, and should include the date, time, location, and RSVP information for the event along with other pertinent event information. Media Advisories use the same formatting/layout as a press release and have the same style exceptions.\n Media Background Brief\n Media background briefs are flyers and factsheets developed specifically to provide the media with additional detailed information that is not included in a press release or response to query. The audience is primarily media, and the information is attributable to USDA versus a specific person.\n USDA media background brief text are to adhere to the Associated Press Stylebook, and the USDA style guide which outlines the use of graphics, EEO statements and other visual elements. Media background briefs may be uploaded to the web in the agency’s pressroom along with the corresponding press release or media advisory.\n Official Public Statements\n USDA statements released to the media are to adhere to the Associated Press Stylebook.\n Occasionally USDA Office of Communications, the Secretary, or an Agency Administrator will issue a short public statement to the media to highlight a significant initiative or policy position. Unlike a quote found in a press release, these statements may run as long as 125 words in length.\n The statements are formatted the same as a press release.\n Responses to Query\n Responses to query are to adhere to the Associated Press Stylebook.\n Responses to query are often used in lieu of a press release when the Department takes a significant policy action or other legal action that is not in the best interest of the department to promote. These short statements are provided to the media or other audiences upon request only. Word limit – 25-50 word maximum. In some cases, responses to query may include a corresponding media background brief.\n USDA Web Content\n With the exception of pages that specifically target the news media community (AP), web content should adhere to GPO style.\n Blogs\n USDA blogs are to adhere to the Associated Press Stylebook.\n The primary purpose of USDA blog stories is to drive media interest in a specific program or policy; however, blogs also provide a direct to customer narrative that promotes USDA and are shared on USDA social media platforms and between individual stakeholders.

USDA blog length: maximum 400 words.\n AP Styleguide Exceptions\n In the first reference to the Secretary: “Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack”\n Secretary quote should be followed by: “said Secretary Vilsack.”\n Stakeholder Notifications/Notice to Trade\n USDA stakeholder notifications and notices to trade are to adhere to the Associated Press Stylebook.\n Stakeholder notifications and Notices to Trade are communications to stakeholder groups announcing policy deadlines, board appointments, minor policy changes and the like that are not significant national newsworthy events. These notices may be posted on an agency website but they are typically communicated through direct email distribution.\n The primary audience is not the media. Despite this, in many instances, stakeholder announcements may be posted on the web in agency newsrooms and are often picked up by trade press and other targeted distribution outlets. For this reason, they are written using the AP style.\n Use the same USDA style exceptions and format as used for a press release.\n Fact Sheets and Information Booklets\n Fact sheets and information booklets and flyers are to adhere to the Government Printing Office Manual and the USDA style guide which outlines the use of graphics, EEO statements and layouts.\n These communications are developed by agency and department program implementers in cooperation with their public affairs officers-- to inform the policy makers, the general public and program participants.\n of research progress or of special program results that are in the public interest are to adhere to the Government Printing Office Manual and the USDA style guide which outlines the use of graphics, EEO statements and layouts.\nPlain Language\nThe Plain Writing Act of (, 123 ) requires that all federal agencies write \"clear Government communication that the public can understand and use.\" Public service means we must think of our readers first as they demand information that is accessible, logically organized, and readable. As USDA employees, we pledge to provide our constituents with information that is clear, understandable, and useful in every paper or electronic letter, publication, form, notice, or instruction we publish.\nFor more information about what the Department is doing to improve plain language usage throughout the Department, and for guidance, e-mail plainlanguage@usda.gov or visit the Department’s Plain Language website.\nMy Signature Block\nSignature blocks are intended to be used as a method of providing sender contact information to message recipients. When sending either internal or external emails, USDA employees are acting as representatives of their Agency and the United States Government. Email signature blocks must accurately reflect the position and culture of the U.S. Government and Federal workforce. The Department provides the following for email signature blocks:\nA signature block is typically located at the end of an e-mail message. The signature block is the part of an e-mail message that contains the sender's contact information. This information usually consists of at least the sender's name and phone number. A signature block might also include additional information, such as job title, department/organization, mailing/office address, e-mail address, fax or cell phone numbers, and the Department or Agency web site address. USDA employees have the option to include their pronouns in the first line of their signature block (i.e., he/him/his). Use of graphics in the signature block should be limited and is restricted to USDA and USDA business-related logos, such as the USDA logo. The USDA seal is reserved for use by the Secretary, the Secretary’s Senior Advisors, and the Mission Area Office staff.\nAcademic titles are allowed in USDA Signature blocks with the following stipulations:\n Only include the degree and credentials that you have earned that directly relate to your USDA subject matter expertise.\n Examples:\n If you received a Juris Doctorate degree and you work in the Office of General Counsel, your degree supports your credibility within your role and may be used.\n If you have a PhD in English Literature, but you work as a Commodity Grader; your degree does not directly relate to your proficiency in your USDA role, and you should not include your academic title in your signature block.\nFamous quotations or inspirational messages should not be included if they have the potential to be construed by the recipient as representing a government policy or position. As a standard practice, USDA strongly discourages their use.\nWhen in doubt about what to include, less is generally more.\nDownload Signature Template (, 32.1 )\nGender Inclusive Communications Guidance\nThe use of inclusive language in communication symbolizes USDA’s commitment to the values of equity and equal opportunity for employees and those we serve. This guidance may be applied to any type of communication, whether it is oral or written, formal or informal, or addressed to an internal or external audience.\nDownload Gender Inclusive Communications (, 550 )\n Discussion\n Purpose\n The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recognizes the need for a skilled, workforce that can provide equitable and high-quality service in all it does. Every USDA employee should have the opportunity to thrive in an inclusive environment that gives them a sense of belonging and develops them so they can make their unique contributions to USDA’s mission. This includes employing a workforce that represents the diversity of people served by USDA and supporting capabilities within every employee to provide excellent customer service to all, especially to individuals who have been unable to benefit from USDA programs and opportunities to improve their lives.\n The words we use can make the difference between forging positive connections or creating distance in our personal and professional lives. As we build and provide services throughout USDA, we want to ensure the services are accessible and welcoming to all customers, employees, and stakeholders. Gender inclusive language or terms are those that are gender neutral and gender equitable. Such inclusive language helps us be more accurate and build trust with each other and our customers.\n This Gender Inclusive Communications Guidebook (guidebook) serves as a resource of commonly used and preferred inclusive language for all internal and external USDA communication. Upon publication, this guidebook should be used as the primary guidance document for the standardization and use of gender inclusive language and terminology for USDA internal and external communications going forward.\n This guidebook supplements the USDA Style Guide and the following Departmental Directives:\n DR-001, Publications Review and Clearance Policy (01/14/21)\n DR-002, Printing Policy (09/08/16)\n DR-002, Use of Logos/Marks at the United States Department of Agriculture (01/08/)\n DR-002, Press Operations (09/07/16)\n DR-001, Photography Policy (02/07/03)\n DR-002, Creative, Media and Broadcast Policy (08/04/11)\n DR-001, New Media Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities (05/23/11)\n DR-001, Governance (11/21/12)\n DR-001, Approval of Communications/Information Products and Services (10/29/14)\n This guidebook serves as a reference document and should be used in conjunction with training and technical assistance [e.g. assistance from employee resource groups and additional guidance documents] provided by USDA. This guidebook is a living document and will be periodically updated as USDA adopts more updated language, or as changes occur to Departmental directives, clearance processes, and other guidance documents and materials.\n Background\n In June , the U.S. Supreme Court held in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. , 590 U.S. ___ , that employment discrimination based on transgender status or sexual orientation constitutes prohibited discrimination based on sex under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of . Accordingly, the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock prohibits discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation in programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance. The Bostock decision is a demonstration of the changing views at federal and state levels toward strengthening and improving the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex (LGBTQI+) or other diverse gender identities represented by “plus,” including Two-Spirit, LGBTQI+ people in the areas of employment, health, education, housing and other fields.\n U.S. demographic trends demonstrate a shifting perception of gender identity and expression. For instance, research indicates that about 1 in 5 U.S. adults know someone who goes by a gender-neutral pronoun. By utilizing inclusive language practices, we build upon an organizational culture of respect and belonging for those in the LGBTQI+) community, but also for anyone who in some way challenges the traditional model of gender identity and expression. This is particularly important when demonstrates that LGBTQI+ Americans face elevated levels of discrimination and mistreatment in education, employment, housing, health care, in places of public accommodations, or from law enforcement. In particular, transgender Americans also experience higher rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts that are four times and six times higher than the entire U.S. population.\n USDA is committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where individuals are respected, trusted, valued, and work together collaboratively to achieve Departmental goals. This also means promoting an equitable environment that embraces the differences of not just its employees, but also of customers and stakeholders. USDA promotes a culture that uses inclusive language in written and oral forms of communication to internal and external audiences. This entails adjusting communications to use terms that do not refer to gender, rather than defaulting to gender-specific terms such as he, she, her and his without awareness of an individual’s preferences. Once an individual makes their preferences known, this should be respected in further interactions. In practice, this allows the individual an opportunity to share how they would like to be identified. For example, sharing one’s pronouns should be a voluntary activity, but using a person’s pronouns is a sign of respect. USDA is committed to the values of diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility, and equal opportunity for employees and those we serve. This guidebook provides practical direction to achieve this standard the Department.\n Use of Pronouns in USDA Communications\n Using an individual's correct pronouns is a powerful affirmation of self for transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals. It validates one's identity, encourages authenticity and builds inclusive and supportive cultures. USDA's correspondence and communication should aim to adopt the use of gender-inclusive pronouns; and normalize clarifying pronouns in communication to eliminate the possibility of misgendering individuals. As a default, the pronouns “they/them/their” should be used in USDA sponsored communications, outreach, and correspondence rather than \"he/she pronouns, unless Program guidance specifically directs otherwise.\n An individual communicates their pronouns. For example, “Hi my name is John Doe and my pronouns are he/him/his” instead of “Hi my name is John Doe.” A good practice is to inquire into an individual's preferred greeting.  If they share, we must respect an individual's request. This also applies to non-written communication such as when interacting in person, via phone, and video calls.\n General Communication\n Gender Inclusive Greetings\n The USDA's correspondence with the public may include people with gender-ambiguous names, which can place employees in the awkward position of conducting research on the individual’s gender without knowing their actual preferred prefixes and potentially using incorrect salutations. However, there are simple steps we can take to use gender-inclusive language. Using gender-neutral salutations in correspondences is the first step towards full gender inclusivity by eliminating the possibility of misgendering correspondence to recipients. It is encouraged to inquire into an individual's correct greeting. If they share, we must respect an individual's preferred greeting.\n General Correspondence\n General correspondence refers to written communication, typically sent and received by the public, including program participants and other informal entities. For the purpose of this guidebook, general correspondence refers to all forms of USDA communication not sent on official letterhead, such as emails, Microsoft Teams chats, text messages, and Ask USDA communications. These communications are still subject to records retention requirements as they remain official USDA communication. Examples of gender-inclusive greetings for general correspondence may include:\n Using the recipient's full name: Dear [First Name] [Last Name] (e.g., Dear Simon Miller). This would be used in correspondence in Ask USDA and other Departmental and Mission Area, agency, and staff office emails with the public. First and last name would also be used for program applicants as we are contacting them as private individuals;\n If no name is provided, addressing the recipient by \"To Whom it May Concern\" or using their email address; or\n If only a first name is provided, using their first name.\n Official Correspondence\n Official correspondence refers to written communication received or sent on the organization's letterhead. For the purpose of this guidebook, official correspondence refers to, but is not limited to, all forms of USDA communication on official letterhead, such as communications with the White House, Congress, Recipients, and Government entities,\n Examples of gender-inclusive greetings for official correspondence include:\n Using addressee's title and last name for correspondence with official titles:\n Dear [Title] [Last Name] (e.g. \"Dear Director Miller\" or \"Dear Representative Miller”); or\n If unknown, address \"To Whom it May Concern\" or use their email address.\n Correspondence Formatting\n Individual Salutations\n Avoid using Sir or Madam since the recipient may not identify with either gender.\n If you do not know the person’s pronouns, use the format Dear [First name] [last name] such as Dear John Doe or Dear Jane Doe. You can also address them by their first name if the message is less formal.\n When writing to an unknown receiver, use a generic salutation such as Dear [Customer], Dear [Stakeholder] or Dear [insert email address here]. Avoid addressing someone by gender-specific titles such as Mr., Ms. and Mrs., unless otherwise noted.\n Group Salutations\n When writing to a group of people, avoid using gender-specific words like Ladies, Guys, Girls, and Gentlemen. Instead use words like All, Teammates, Employees, Colleagues, and Staff when addressing employees.\n Body\n Use gender-neutral terms or gender-inclusive pronouns instead of gender-specific pronouns.\n Avoid using phrases like “his” or “her” if you do not know the person’s pronouns.\n If you are addressing a person, use your/them/their. For example, “please send me a copy of their resume” instead of “please send me a copy of his or her resume.”\n If you’re not addressing a person, use grammatical articles such as “the” or “a.”\n Closing\n Choose standard closings such as Regards, Yours Truly, and Sincerely.\n Signature Line\n Whether sending either internal or external correspondence, USDA employees are acting as representatives of their Agency and the United States Government. Signature blocks must accurately reflect the position and culture of the U.S. Government and Federal workforce.\n USDA employees are encouraged to include their pronouns in the first line of their email signature block (e.g. he/him/his). Signature blocks are a simple and effective way for individuals to communicate their identified pronouns to colleagues, stakeholders, and customers. For example, adding pronouns to signature blocks also has the benefit of indicating to the recipient that you will respect their gender identity and choice of pronouns. USDA employees are encouraged to review the USDA Style Guide regarding the use of specific graphics, quotes, or logos.\n External and Internal Outreach\n USDA Mission Areas, agencies, and staff offices are encouraged to engage with employees, customers, and stakeholders by sharing important USDA policies, actions, or announcements. Employees throughout the Department regularly communicate to the public in a multitude of ways and for several purposes. Communications may come from Mission Area or agency Public Affairs Directors; partnership and public engagement liaisons; External Affairs officials, and other teams and program offices across the Department., liaisons in Office of Partnerships & Public Engagement, External Affairs, Internal Government Affairs, Office of Communications (OC) and many others throughout the Department.\n Videos and Press Media refers to visual and written communication. Within this guidance, press material refers to all forms of official USDA communication typically in the forms of press releases, videos from USDA senior leadership and communication memos. When communicating with employees, customers and stakeholders, we must ensure that the messages engage a wide range of audience members when possible.\n Incorporating inclusive language and genders in USDA press releases, blogs, videos, and speeches must be respectfully considered. For example, when speaking of federal wildland firefighters, one should refer to them as “brave wildland firefighters,” instead of “brave men and women.” Likewise, visuals for press materials should not only represent cisgender people, but also reflect same sex couples and genders that are not normally associated with a particular program or circumstance.\n For the purpose of this guidance, multimedia refers to visual aids and graphics such as pictures, fact sheets, infographics, and other types of visual outreach material. USDA Mission Areas, agencies, and staff offices are permitted to establish a presence online to share content and engage with stakeholders through social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, and YouTube. Guidance for the use and clearance of information to be used on these media types can be found in the USDA Style Guide and the Departmental Directives listed in the Purpose section at the beginning of this document. These Directives also outline the clearance processes for publications, print and video outreach.\n When developing materials, we must be purposeful creating and sourcing images of diverse people in a wide range of roles. In this way, the images we use should represent multiple voices and perspectives. For example, visuals also reflect same-sex couples or genders that are not normally associated with a particular program. This also means providing alternate (alt) text or alt descriptions to convey the context of images as they appear in printed materials or on online platforms. For platforms that do not offer alt text options, alt text should be included within the post itself. For example: [Image description: alt text]. Keep in mind that when using stock images, it is important to use gender, race, age, or other keywords that have been given in the context of the photo. Do not assume the race or gender of an individual based on the image if that information is not included in the image description. If using images of people who have identified their pronouns, this should also be included in alt text.\n The use of emojis, pictograms, or graphic designs, are often used in text and written messages to convey additional ideas or emotions. Social media managers should be cautious when using specific emojis to convey additional meanings. When using emojis, practice using non-gendered faces or if a gendered emoji is used, try to include various genders. More commonly, emojis have been used as a visual representation of the LGBTQI+ community through various including the use of rainbows, hearts, and multiple to represent skin color, to name a few iterations. Emojis are a valuable communication tool, but they can have multiple meanings that are not appropriate for government use.\n Hashtags are a way to connect social media content to a specific topic, event, theme, or conversation. They also make it easier to discover posts around those specific topics, because hashtags aggregate all social media content with that same hashtag. Social media managers should always search hashtags before using them to make sure the conversation surrounding the hashtag is relevant and appropriate to your messaging. Social media managers should research hashtags carefully to be sure they are not being widely used in conjunction with inappropriate posts. Media managers should be sure that the conversation and the meaning of the hashtag has not changed from the intended purpose.\n Social media managers should be cautious when using acronyms as part of a hashtag, as the acronym on its own can convey various meanings. Social media managers should consider that many social media platforms will index all terms in a post for discovery in search and trends, regardless if a hashtag is present.\n Posting \n The USDA encourages the use of various multimedia outlets to foster a more open and transparent relationship with our audiences. These audiences include but are not limited to employees, customers, stakeholders, and members of the public. USDA Mission Areas, agencies, and staff offices use social media to reach audiences quickly and easily, delivering information through a variety of platforms and formats as part of their integrated communication strategy. Because of this relationship, audiences engage with our content by expressing their thoughts, opinions and ideas through comments, reactions, and direct messages on social media. Social media managers should use best judgment when responding to an individual’s comments and direct messages.\n When posting content, social media managers should adhere to the listed in the USDA Social Media Style Guide. Additionally, social media managers should use gender-inclusive language. When posting about USDA employees, social media managers should verify the employee’s pronouns.\n The USDA does not agree with or endorse every comment that individuals post on our social media. Hate speech and harassment toward LGBTQI+ and other underrepresented communities is prevalent in online platforms and needs meaningful content moderation.\n Social Media Manager Responsibilities\n In addition to the following guidance, additional social media guidance on governance may be found in DR -001, New Media Roles, Responsibilities and Authorities. It is the social media manager’s responsibility to assess if a comment is harmful or makes a threat toward an individual or group of people. The social media manager is responsible for communicating any potential and legitimate threat to their Agency. Social media managers should take substantive and meaningful action to prioritize the safety of USDA employees, our customers, underrepresented community members and protected classes. If a social media manager encounters an inappropriate comment or a direct message, such as a negative opinion about LGBQTI+ individuals, then the social media manager may take the following actions:\n If the comment does not warrant a response and is not harmful, then social media managers may ignore the comment. For the benefit of a robust and constructive conversation, USDA will allow comments that relate to the topic discussed within the corresponding post. USDA expects users to show respect, civility, and consideration to all posts and other users.\n If the comment includes false information about the USDA and the social media manager feels that clarification of accurate information is important for the public, then the social media manager may respond to the comment.\n Social media managers should keep in mind the following when responding to comments:\n Be polite when responding;\n Correct the message, rather than the individuals who spread it;\n Use facts and when pointing out generalizations and inaccuracies; and\n Aim to show a different perspective and share positive stories;\n If the comment includes the following content, social managers may hide the comment:\n Hate speech, including targeted slurs, intended to dehumanize, degrade or reinforce negative or harmful stereotypes about a protected group. This includes targeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals;\n Profanity, obscenity or vulgarity;\n Nudity in profile pictures; such as material that contains sexual content, which is overly graphic, disturbing, obscene, or offensive or material that would otherwise violate the law if published;\n Defamation to a person or people, such as comments that are discriminatory, racist, offensive, obscene, inflammatory, unlawful or otherwise objectionable statements, language or content;\n Name-calling and/or personal attacks;\n Comments whose main purpose are to sell a product;\n Comments that infringe on copyrights;\n Spam comments, such as the same comment posted repeatedly on a profile; and\n Advertisements for inappropriate websites or social media accounts;\n If an individual repeatedly makes inappropriate comments that warrant hiding, then social media managers can block the user from the social media page. In these circumstances, it might be best to mute the account that is provoking the harm, and then take actions to block and report the user. Much the same, if the social media manager sees that another user is being attacked, then it is a best practice to report the profile to the appropriate social media platform.\n Social media managers are encouraged to confer with subject matter experts, such as LGBTQI+ Special Emphasis Program Managers (SEPMs), Out and Equal, Equality USDA, and their respective Civil Rights Offices for additional guidance.\n General USDA Examples\n (a) For those who don’t fall neatly into either category, references to the binary male and female groupings can be alienating. According to the United Nations’ on gender-inclusive language, “Using gender-inclusive language means speaking and writing in a way that does not discriminate against a particular sex, social gender or gender identity, and does not perpetuate gender stereotypes. Given the key role of language in shaping cultural and social attitudes, using gender-inclusive language is a powerful way to promote gender equality and eradicate gender bias.”\n (b) In an effort to eliminate the possibility of misgendering correspondence recipients, it is suggested that the following nouns and pronouns be used through the body of any USDA correspondence, guidance and regulations. Please note that this section is not an exhaustive list of examples that may occur at USDA. It is encouraged that each Agency create their own internal guidebook or implementation plan for use.\n They/them instead of he/she;\n Spouse or partner instead of husband/wife to spouse;\n Folks or everybody instead of guys or ladies/gentleman;\n Humankind instead of mankind;\n People instead of men or women;\n Parent instead of mother or father;\n Sibling instead of brother/sister;\n Child instead of son or daughter;\n Members of Congress instead of Congressmen;\n Councilperson instead of Councilman/Councilwoman;\n First-year student instead of freshman;\n Chair or Chairperson instead of Chairman;\n Artificial or synthetic instead of man-made;\n Workforce instead of manpower; and\n Firefighters instead of firemen.\n (c) Although well-meaning, the use of particular terms may act in completely altering and discrediting a particular group of people or culture. For example, in some communities, the use of the term “Latinx” in place of Latino or Latina is intended to promote gender language inclusivity. However, in the Spanish language, masculine and feminine nouns are engrained in the language itself and in an attempt to make terms gender inclusive, one may essentially alter the meaning of the language. For these reasons, it is important to know the audience to which you are directing your message.\n Summary\n This guidebook is a living document under the authority of the Office of Communications with support from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights and the Office of the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer.

The three veterans are part of the Warrior Hike. While in Plumas County, they took part in the Mohawk Valley Independence Day celebration. The local Portola Rotary Club and employees from the Plumas National Forest supported the veterans during their stay. (U.S. Forest Service)\nU.S. Army veterans Shawn White and Tom Bielecki, along with U.S. Marine Corps veteran Kevin Black, set off to hike the entire Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail on April 12 as part of the Warrior Hike’s Walk Off the War program.\nAlong the 2,650-mile journey, they will hike through 25 national forests.\nThey recently passed through Plumas National Forest and stopped in Plumas County, California, where they were welcomed by the local community and invited to participate in the Mohawk Valley Independence Day festivities. The warrior hikers attended all of the weekend’s festivities, including a special recognition ceremony honoring all veterans that followed the Independence Day parade, appropriately themed “Honoring Our Veterans.”\n“The warrior hikers rode in golf carts with (more than 50 local) veterans from World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam War, and recent conflicts,” said Ann Taylor, a realty specialist for the Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest Region and member of the Portola Rotary Club that hosted the hikers. “The thing that impressed me was the great respect (the community) showed these veterans. They each seemed so moved by the ceremony offered after the parade, and it made me proud that I was a part of their experience and their journey home.”\nPlumas National Forest employees volunteered their time to shuttle the warrior hikers to and from the trail.\nThe veterans’ six-month trek is part of the Walk Off the War program sponsored by the Warrior Hike in partnership with the Pacific Crest Trail Association. This is the first year participants hiked the trail. The program focuses on outdoor therapy supporting combat veterans transitioning from their military service back to civilian life.\n“The thing that I think is really exciting is that the Pacific Coast Trail provides a platform for transition and life-changing experiences and an opportunity for healing and growth,” said Beth Boyst, trail coordinator for the Forest Service. “It is wonderful that the association and the Forest Service have been able to support activities for the Warrior Hike.”\nThe Warrior Hike provides participating combat veterans with the equipment and supplies to complete a thru-hike of the trail; coordinates support in the form of transportation, food, and lodging with veteran organizations and community groups located along the trail; and assists veterans with future employment opportunities through the program's numerous partners and sponsors.\nThe Walk off the War program was started in honor of Earl Shaffer who, in , told a friend he was going to “walk off the war” to work out the sights, sounds and losses of World War II. Four months later, Shaffer became the first person to hike the entire length of the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n California\n Forestry\n Fourth of July\n FS\n Georgia\n Independence Day\n Maine\n national forests\n Pacific Southwest Region\n Plumas National Forest\n U.S. Army\n U.S. Marine Corps\n veterans\n Warrior Hike",

While there, they received a tour and briefing on the upcoming wildfire season and signed a memorandum (, 64.7 ) that was sent to wildland fire leadership highlighting the importance of inter-departmental collaboration in protecting communities and managing public lands.\nCollaboration is the name of the game at NIFC, which isn’t an organization, but is rather a place where the U.S. Forest Service and eight other federal, tribal, state, and local agencies work together to coordinate national wildland fire management planning and operations to ensure effectiveness and efficiency.\nThe agencies represented at NIFC share assets (firefighters, aircraft and equipment) and work together to set priorities to allocate these assets. Effectiveness and efficiency are especially critical because no wildland fire management agency has enough assets including firefighters, fire engines, aircraft, or other equipment and machinery to respond to all the wildfires that occur on land under their jurisdiction.\nAdditionally, the National Interagency Coordination Center or NICC based at NIFC, plays a key role in ensuring that wildland fire managers receive as many of the assets mentioned above that they request as possible.\nFor strategic purposes, wildland fire managers divided the U.S. into ten geographic areas. All of the agencies located within these geographic areas have assets that they can mobilize to respond to wildfires, but during periods of high fire activity, they typically require more. The geographic areas place orders for additional assets to the NICC which obtains them from other geographic areas, the military, and even from other countries.\n“We mobilize and allocate assets based on the principles of closest forces and total mobility,” said Susie Stingley, NICC Manager. “That means that we try to mobilize assets from as close to where they are being requested as possible, but if needed we can get them from anywhere they’re available.”\nStaff stock the Great Basin Area Incident Support Cache in preparation for western fire season. Forest Service photo.\nIn addition to the NICC, NIFC is home to many other vital national wildland fire management programs, facilities, and functions, including the National Interagency Incident Communications Division, the largest civilian radio cache in the world that can provide enough radios and repeaters (a device that extends radio coverage) to support more than 50 major disasters at a time; the Great Basin Area Incident Support Cache, which issues about $ations Program, which maintains about 1,800 permanent and 75 portable weather stations that provide critical local weather to fire managers.\nNIFC is the envy of wildland fire and emergency management experts around the world because of its seamless interagency cooperation. Each year, wildland fire and emergency management experts from countries such as Greece, Norway, and Morocco, visit NIFC to learn how it operates to improve their operations.\nBut the highly successful structure of NIFC was not mandated by law, regulation, or policy. What motivates government agencies to work together to ensure that wildfires in the U.S. are managed as effectively and efficiently as possible is simply that this type of cooperation has been proved, time and again, to be a best practice that delivers the benefits of good government and works for all Americans.\nThe National Interagency Fire Center is also home to the Boise Bureau of Land Management Smokejumpers.

        "content": "U.S. Forest Service in\n Forestry\n Oct 30, \nWolf spiders are robust and agile hunters with excellent eyesight. They live mostly solitary and hunt alone. (Bugwood.org/Joseph Berger)\nThey squirm, crawl, scurry and swarm … and they’re all around us.\nMore than 900,000 species of insects and arachnids are found around the world, and some people would rather not come into contact with even one of the often misunderstood critters.\nThe fear for me came when I was 7 years old during the summer of .\nMom worked the third-shift, so one night dad decided a night at the drive-in theater with his six kids would be the better than us destroying the house. The movie? Jeff Daniels and John Goodman in “Arachnophobia.”\nThe premise of the now classic comedy-horror movie is simple: poisonous spiders wreak havoc on a small town leaving a trail of dead townsfolk in their wake. The movie did not win any Academy Awards … but it should have: Best Comedy-Horror Movie for Instilling Irrational Fear of Arachnids in Second-graders.\nI still haven’t forgiven dad.\nSo with the scary Halloween season upon us, I decided to talk to one of the U.S. Forest Service’s entomologists to get a better idea how these creepy crawlers benefit our environment and why I shouldn’t scream like a 5–year old when an eight-legged web-slinger crosses my path.\nStone centipedes are about 2 to 5 centimeters (0.8–2.0 in.) long and brownish in color. The adult's body has 18 segments, and 15 pairs of legs. (Bugwood.org/Joseph Berger)\n“Insects play a very important role in our forests,” said Robert J. Rabaglia, acting deputy director, Forest Health Protection. “Many are important sources of food for other animals and are important in the food web. In our streams, ponds and lakes, aquatic insects are important food for fish and eat vegetation that would otherwise grow uncontrolled. Insects that feed on trees also are important to the health of the forest. Not only do they serve as food for birds, reptiles and mammals but are important recyclers of nutrients in the forests.”\nBut this newfound knowledge doesn’t change the fact that they’re still creepy. Which ones really make the skin crawl?\n“Creepy may be in the eye of the beholder, but many people are creeped out by roaches, spiders, centipedes and scorpions,” Rabaglia said. “Stink bugs are quickly becoming a creepy insect.”\nFear by humans is the least of the problems. As good as insects are some can be devastating to forest when they run amok.\n“Some of the insects we consider most damaging, such as defoliators like budworms and gypsy moth or bark beetles, are important parts of a healthy forest,” said Rabaglia. “It’s only when populations of these insects are at damaging levels that we need to control them.”\nThis is where spiders become an essential part of many eco-systems because they are a predator of insects and help keep populations regulated.\nIt is true, though, that some bugs are more dangerous than they look.\nA parasitoid wasp sits on a piece of wood. Many of these wasps are considered beneficial to humans because they control populations of agricultural pests. (Bugwood.org/Sturgis McKeever, Georgia Southern University)\n“The most notorious poisonous insects are wasps, bees and ants, but other groups also have poisonous species,” said Rabaglia. “There are some caterpillars that have poisonous spines and some true bugs, such as the assassin bug, that have venomous bites.”\nWhile most people like me don’t like bugs, not as many have true phobias such as arachnophobia, a fear of arachnids, and entomophobia, a fear of insects. So after speaking to one entomologist, I still wasn’t convinced that their benefits outweighed their creepiness. I went for a second opinion.\n“It is unfair to ask an entomologist if insects are creepy, but I guess there are some insects out there that cause some to squirm,” said Michael Bohne, forest group health leader.  “Carrion, or burying beetles, feed on dead birds and animals. They lay eggs under carcasses, which hatch into wormy larvae that feed on the dead animals. Forensic specialists also use these beetles to help establish the time of death when a human corpse is found outside.”\nNone of this made me feel any better. But Bohne pointed out more reasons insects and arachnids are crucial to our forests.\n“Even vampire-like mosquitoes serve an important role in our environment,” Bohne said. “Mosquito larvae are a food source for many aquatic organisms.”\nThen the entomologist, who seemed to be having a little too much fun with this interview, even likened a Forest Service initiative to control the devastating ash borer beetle to another horror movie classic.\n“Recently, forest entomologists from around the country have been using a native parasitoid wasp to monitor for the exotic emerald ash borer, a system called biosurveillance,” Bohne said. “The wasp works a lot like the xenomorph from the movie “Alien.” The female wasp stuns, collects, and buries the emerald ash borers in underground egg chambers. The wasp larvae emerge from the eggs and eat the stunned beetles alive and complete development. I don’t think the beetles scream, but in the ground nobody can hear them scream.”\nAll joking aside, Bohne added that “insects are important bio-indicators of strong, healthy forests. A healthy forest will have a large, diverse population of insects.”\nWriting this has not cured my irrational fear of spiders. But the next time I get hit in the face with a web while walking, I’ll try not to smack at my face like it is on fire. Instead, I’ll thank little Charlotte for all she does for our forests.\nA group of carrion beetles feed on a dead animal.

The new FAS management system will help U.S. exporters and other stakeholders to more effectively monitor, evaluate and comment on the measures, keep track of comment deadlines and locate archived information.\n“The development of this system provides users with one-stop shopping,” said Michael Francom, the FAS International Regulations and Standards Division deputy director. “Using the system, industry members can access the WTO notification and the underlying measure and submit feedback for us to consider as we draft our official U.S. government comments. They can also query the system for measures from different countries or those dealing with a specific commodity.”\nPreviously, stakeholders were unable to access this information in one place. Often times, some industry members were unaware of the measures U.S. trading partners proposed because of the challenges of tracking down the different pieces of information, Francom explained.\nAfter a successful public pilot program in early , FAS officials debuted the system during the U.S. Agricultural Export Development Council (USAEDC) workshop in November and at meetings of USDA’s trade advisory committees.\n“So far feedback has been very positive. U.S. exporters and other stakeholders believe the system will be an important tool in their trade policy tool kit,” Francom said.\nCurrently, more than 40 organizations are signed up for to use the system. They include trade associations, industry groups and private companies. Before accessing the system, users need to register for a USDA eAuthentication account here.

The info graphic is based on from the USDA Economic Research Service's analysis of retail food prices and the food dollar, or all the factors that affect what we pay for food. (Click to enlarge)\nIn relation to the current drought, many people ask: What does this mean for food prices? Here we try to provide a response and the necessary context on food price inflation. The info graphic is based on from the USDA Economic Research Service's analysis of retail food prices and the food dollar, or all the factors that affect what we pay for food. The graphic helps to demonstrate how the current drought, or any event that affects prices for raw farm commodities, ultimately has a marginal effect on what we pay at the grocery or restaurant. Primarily, the graphic demonstrates two important pieces of information:\n1. In the bar chart, food price inflation is expected to be close to the historical average this year and just slightly above that next year. As you can see, recent spikes from and , especially, outpace current forecasts.\n2. In the grocery cart model, you see that raw farm commodity prices (the price of things like a bushel of corn or soybeans) are just one of many factors affecting retail food prices. In fact, commodities make up about 14% of the average retail food purchase, so even if all commodity prices doubled, retail food prices would increase by about 14%. Together, factors such as energy and transportation costs, labor costs, processing and marketing costs all play a much more significant role.\nOn July 25th, ERS forecast that we will likely see impacts on retail food prices within two months for beef, pork, poultry and dairy. Yet the full effects of the increase in corn prices for packaged and processed foods (cereal, corn flour, etc.) will likely take 10-12 months to move through to retail food prices, and should have little to no effect until that time.\nFor additional information, see USDA ERS resources: A Revised and Expanded Food Dollar Series A Better Understanding of Our Food Costs () and Food Price Outlook web page.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n drought\n ERS\n food prices\n Infographic",

They have been working with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) for years to improve conservation on their farm.\nIn , the couple’s non-profit organization, United Farmers USA―dedicated to helping small farmers succeed through a wide range of outreach and technical assistance, educational programs and resources―received an NRCS Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG). These grants help NRCS support public and private entities to accelerate technology transfer and adoption of promising technologies and approaches to address some of the Nation's most pressing natural resource concerns.\nThrough their CIG project, the Gibsons have implemented a silvopasture demonstration area on their farm, and have educated other farmers on the benefits.\nSilvopasture―the practice of combining forestry and the grazing of livestock―benefits timber, forage, and livestock production by allowing both practices on the same acreage, at the same time. It not only improves the appearance of the landowner’s property, it helps the livestock and environment too.\nDuring the summer months, tree canopies provide shelter to livestock from heat and inclement weather. The Gibsons say silvopasture helps their livestock maintain body weight in the hotter months by continuing to graze during the day in the shade, as opposed to grazing only at night in open pasture when it’s cooler.\n“Silvopasture is a win-win situation, as you can have value added attributes, such as baling and selling hay, or cutting trees for timber,” said Hezekiah.\nSilvopasture is not new to the Gibsons. They have been using this conservation practice for years and have 120 acres in silvopasture. When managed properly silvopasture can help farming operations become more sustainable by increasing annual revenues and providing better use of forest lands.\nThey have also implemented several conservation practices on their farm, including fencing and cross-fencing 300 acres of pasture, which allows them to practice rotational grazing for their livestock. By using rotational grazing―moving cows to different pastures before it can be overgrazed―herd health is increased, soil erosion is reduced, and soil and forage health is greatly improved.\nThrough CIG funding, the Gibsons have hosted many two-hour classes, educational workshops, and demonstration tours for historically underserved landowners. Additional demonstration sites will be established in the Low country, Savannah, Pee Dee, and Coastal Plain areas to reach more farmers in USDA StrikeForce areas.\nUSDA StrikeForce teams operate in 880 counties in 21 states and Puerto Rico and provide opportunities for NRCS to work with underserved landowners to determine how best to leverage available financial assistance and address natural resource concerns—with an emphasis on historically underserved communities in rural counties that have consistently high poverty.\nFarmers interested in learning more about Conservation Innovation Grants or land management practices should visit www.nrcs.usda.gov/GetStarted or a local USDA service center.\nNOTE: For an interactive look at USDA's work in conservation and forestry over the course of this Administration, visit \nThe Gibsons have practiced silvopasture for years, and have found that it helps their livestock maintain their body weight by continuing to graze under trees during the day, rather than in open pasture at night when it’s cooler.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n CIG\n Conservation\n Conservation Innovation Grant\n Farmers\n Forestry\n NRCS\n rotational grazing\n silvopasture\n South Carolina\n StrikeForce",

USDA-ARS photo.\nThis post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nIndigenous people of the Andes Mountains in South America have farmed the nuña bean (a.k.a. “Peruvian Popping bean”) as a staple crop for centuries. Its colorful, nutty-flavored seed is especially prized for its tendency to pop open when roasted—a cooking method that requires less firewood than boiling in fuel-scarce regions.\nAt the Agricultural Research Service’s Western Regional Plant Introduction Station in Pullman, Washington, plant geneticist Ted Kisha curates an edible dry bean collection that includes 91 accessions of high-altitude nuña beans grown by Andean farmers in Peru, the origin for this legume member of the Phaseolus vulgaris family.\nOver the past year, Kisha and his collaborators at Washington State University (WSU) have been evaluating the accessions with an eye towards using them to breed new varieties adapted to production in Washington state.  \nKisha thinks the humble nuña has “the right stuff” as a niche crop for small-scale growers and a healthy snack food for consumers—namely, high protein content, dietary fiber, minerals, vitamins, and assorted phytonutrients.   \nLong term, “Our goal is to create the ‘Power Popper’—a popping bean jam-packed with nutrition as a snack food for kids and adults,” says Kisha.\nToward that end, he and colleagues are working to eliminate a nuña bean trait called “photoperiod sensitivity,” which would prevent potential varieties from flowering and producing seed in temperate regions like the Pacific Northwest. They’ve also begun selecting plants that grow more upright and less vine-like for easier harvest.\nLast summer under Kisha’s guidance, Karolina Kodin—a student from the University of Idaho’s Research Experience for Undergraduates program—conducted a 10-week analysis of the accessions’ nutrient content and genetic characteristics compared to those of eight common bean varieties. Her work sets the stage for developing molecular markers to rapidly identify genes associated with particular traits of interest, such as high protein and popping ability.\nKodin presented results of her comparisons at the American Society for Horticultural Science’s annual meeting held in New Orleans, Louisiana earlier this month.\nThe work is timely, given the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization has dubbed as the “International Year of the Pulse.”\nVarieties, molecular markers, and other knowledge resulting from continued research will be made readily available to plant breeders and researchers worldwide, benefiting not only consumers of nuña beans, but other edible dry bean species as well.\nKarolina Kodin, a student from the University of Idaho's Research Experience for Undergraduates program, analyzing bean varieties.

The thorns alone demanded attention,” said ecologist Barry Hart with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service. He made the discovery on a routine ecological site survey in Obion County, Tennessee.\nVerifying the Discovery\nAfter finding two hearty plants one mile apart on private lands, Hart began “keying-out” the plant. This “key” is a series of questions or statements capturing an organism's specific characteristics.\n“There was no way it could be anything else. I was blown away!” said Hart.\nMultiple runs through the key repeatedly landed on the same species that had not been seen in West Tennessee since : Crataegus harbisonii. Snippets sent to universities and botanical authorities confirmed this was a newly discovered population.\nThe population discovered by Hart is now recorded as the largest known.\nConservation Efforts\nLimited research exists on this tree species. Even today, the species mainly exists in cultivation. The tree is on the State of Tennessee’s endangered species list but does not have federal protections under the Endangered Species Act.\nHart is working with NRCS staff in Tennessee and several conservation groups to propagate and establish new populations on protected lands.\n“All native species warrant our attention,” Hart said.\nAbout the Harbison's Hawthorn\nThe Harbison’s hawthorn is a small tree or shrub that grows to 25 feet. It typically flowers in mid-April and produces clusters of reddish fruit in early fall. Their flowers look similar to the apple blossom.\nOpinions vary on the number of hawthorn species, but a reasonable estimate for North America is between 100 to 200 species.\nMichelle Banks Tice is a Public Affairs Specialist with the FPAC Business Center.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Natural Resources Conservation Service\n NRCS\n Conservation\n trees\n endangered\n Tennessee\n endangered species\n Endangered Species Act\n You May Also Like\n Hands-on Experience Helps USDA National Scholar Secure Permanent Position\n Informing Conservation Decisions and Policies through 20 Years of USDA's Conservation Effects Assessment Project\n USDA Offers Many Resources for Veterans",

However, nutria have protruding orange teeth as well as thin tails and are smaller than beaver.\nWord has it that legendary actress Greta Garbo could be seen wearing nutria fur coats back in the day, and nutria fur coats can still be found in vintage clothing stores around the world. Nutria, sometimes called swamp rats, were first introduced into the United States in the s to be used in the fur trade. However, when the fur trade collapsed in the mid ’s thousands of nutria were released by ranchers who could no longer afford to feed and care for them. This invasive rodent, about half the size of a beaver, damages wetland ecosystems by eating away at their delicate vegetation. Nutria have since been found in at least 20 states.\nMaryland’s eastern shore has seen thousands of acres of protective marshland impacted by their destructive feeding habits. To protect the valuable resources of Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay, The Chesapeake Bay Nutria Eradication Project (CBNEP) began in to permanently remove invasive nutria from the marshes of the Delmarva Peninsula and to protect, enhance, and restore the aquatic and river ecosystems they damaged.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Nutria Eradication Project Team members as of May .\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services’ (USFWS) Chesapeake Bay Field Office Coastal Program and Chesapeake Marshlands National Wildlife Refuge Complex administer the project, which is funded through the USFWS’ Partners for Fish and Wildlife and Refuge programs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Wildlife Services program performs the nutria eradication work through an interagency agreement with the USFWS. Other partners in the project include the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, Delaware Division of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, and Tudor Farms. CBNEP’s work has led to the removal of nearly 14,000 nutria, almost half from private lands.\nWith the voluntary cooperation of both public and private landowners, the CBNEP employs multiple techniques as they work through the stages of eradication: conducting surveys to understand the extent of the population; removing the invasive rodents; verifying that that the nutria are gone; and finally, conducting long-term monitoring to prevent re-infestation. Eradication tools include ground surveys, shoreline or boat surveys, trail cameras, monitoring platforms, hair snares, and from the public.\nWildlife Services also looks to innovative and new ways to search for this rodent – trained detector dogs sniff out nutria scat or excrement. Since the start of this innovative program, 6 nutria dogs have been trained – the most recent one, Bradie, completed training with her instructor, Wildlife Biologist Trevor Michaels, in May.\nNutria haven’t been detected in the Delmarva Peninsula in 3 years and the program is now in the verification phase. This phase is critical as most eradication efforts fail when they end before the task is fully complete. Long term monitoring should begin by .\nWhile this is good news for Delmarva, other parts of the country have recently discovered nutria thought long eradicated. Nutria have been discovered in the wetlands, rivers, canals and other fresh water habitats in six counties in California. Wildlife Services is working closely with the state’s lead agency, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, to respond to this emerging issue with best practices learned from our experience on Maryland’s Eastern shore.\nThis nutria is one of the nutria kept with the Chesapeake Bay Nutria Eradication Project. The scat collected from the captive nutria is used to train the nutria dogs to find any wild nutria that may be present.\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Tags:\n Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service\n APHIS\n nutria\n ecosystems\n wetlands\n invasive pests\n Wildlife\n Wildlife Services",

USDA Photo by Lance Cheung.\nEarlier this week, USDA, U.S. Forest Service and partners took a major step to improve forest management, create rural jobs, prevent wildfires, and expand promising renewable energy opportunities.\nDeputy Secretary Krysta Harden joined leaders from the Alliance for Green Heat, the Biomass Power Association, the Biomass Thermal Energy Council, and the Pellet Fuels Institute here in Washington for the announcement of a new partnership agreement. Acting as master of ceremonies for the signing event was Acting USDA Rural Development Under Secretary Doug O’Brien.  Through the Rural Energy for America program and other programs, Rural Development has been a leader in promoting deployment of wood-to-energy projects.\nThis agreement focuses on promoting wood energy nationwide to reduce fire risk, bolster rural economic development, improve air quality and help meet the Obama Administration's “All of the Above” renewable energy and energy efficiency goals. The organizations support the use of wood energy across the scale of users – from residential users, to commercial and institutional facilities, to industrial production of heat and/or electricity to drive businesses and feed the electrical grid.\nFor more than a decade, USDA has supported wood energy as part of a forest restoration economy. Since USDA has invested over $956 million (nearly $1 billion) through grants, loans, and loan guarantees to support over 200 wood energy projects across the country.\nLed by the Forest Service, this work helps to restore the health of forests and watersheds, provide rural areas with cost-effective energy alternatives, and create new income and employment opportunities in sectors ranging from engineering and construction, to manufacturing and forestry. It also provides an economical alternative to fuel oil heating in areas where natural gas supplies are limited. USDA’s Rural Development mission area and the Farm Services Agency also support wood energy through a variety of grants, loans, and loan guarantees. All told, USDA agencies contributed over $500 million last year to support wood energy.\nThe Deputy Secretary also announced the award of over $1 million dollars in grants to develop wood energy teams with Alaska, California, Idaho, Minnesota and New Hampshire. These cooperative agreements signal that successful wood energy projects and forest restoration efforts demand partnership at all levels as well as the sustained commitment of many and diverse forest users.  The federal funds will leverage $1.8 million in non-federal investments.\nGrant recipients are:\nIdaho Governor's Office of Energy Resources, Boise\nThe Watershed Research & Training Center, Hayfork, Calif.\nMinnesota Department of Natural Resources, Saint Paul\nNorth Country Resource Conservation & Development Council, Gilford, N.H.\nThe Alaska Energy Authority, Anchorage\nFor more information on the cooperative agreement program, visit For more information on USDA’s renewable energy programs click here.\nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Deputy Secretary Krysta Harden hosts the signing of the USDA Bioenergy Memorandum of Understanding and was joined by leaders for the announcement of the new partnership agreement at the USDA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. on September 11, .

Within 72 hours, 27,790 acres were scorched in New Mexico and Colorado. Luckily, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) was able to begin the restoration of the Lake Maloya watershed area almost immediately through its Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program.\nThe Track Fire severely damaged nearby Lake Maloya, burning nearly 75 percent of the watershed at what firefighters call “high” and “moderate intensity levels.” This watershed is part of Sugarite Canyon State Park and provides habitat for many species of wildlife. It also serves as Raton’s primary water supply.\nThe fire incinerated almost all of the vegetation surrounding Lake Maloya, leaving a thick layer of ash that easily washed downhill when it rained, clouding the waters of the lake. Raton’s water processing plant struggled to sufficiently filter drinking water.\nRaton and Colfax County immediately contacted NRCS for assistance, and an EWP team formed to assess the damage and prescribe treatments. NRCS implemented plans to restore the land in July.\nThrough EWP, NRCS applies conservation practices that provide protection against further damages after natural disasters occur on private, tribal and state lands.\nTo protect the water quality of Lake Maloya—and preserve Raton’s water supply—NRCS implemented erosion control measures, such as the building of several small dams, the erection of catchment fences, grass seeding and mulching.\nPost-Track Fire seeding takes hold: aerial seeding of one of the slopes scarred by the Track Fire proves successful as vegetation sprouts days after the aerial seeding.\nNRCS also strategically felled trees, which were laid perpendicular to the hill slope. Those areas were then seeded with quick-growing vegetation to slow down water flowing to low-lying areas, allowing the water to drain into the ground.\nIn addition, Lake Dorothey, a smaller lake upstream of Lake Maloya, was drained into Lake Maloya and converted into a sediment basin.\nThe City of Raton and Colfax County provided 25 percent of the cost of the land restoration efforts, with NRCS providing the rest.\nIt will take years to restore the land to its pre-Track Fire state. But NRCS’ restoration efforts will accelerate the recovery process of the watersheds, wildlife habitat and recreational sites. \nFind out more about the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program.\nCheck out more conservation stories on the USDA blog.\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Conservation\n EWP\n New Mexico\n NRCS",

        "content": "in\n Conservation\n Food and Nutrition\n Jul 06, \n Understanding a community’s food environment is key to understanding a community’s identity.  But what can a “food environment” tell us?\nA community’s food environment is a technical term for assessing information about the who, what, where, and how of food availability in a given community: Who are the people in the community?\nWhat kinds of food outlets are available in their area? How accessible are grocery stores and supermarkets? What are some of the health statistics?\nThese are a lot of questions to ask, and a lot of information to process. That’s where the USDA’s Food Environment Atlas comes in.  In , USDA first released the Food Environment Atlas, an online mapping tool that compares the food environment at the county level across the country. There were 90 indicators to choose from in the version, including the number and types of food stores and restaurants, price for food, and information about participation rates for nutrition benefits like SNAP.  These sets could be sorted and mapped to get a more comprehensive understanding of a county’s food environment. Users could pull the Atlas and build their own custom food environment maps, or compare the food environments across different counties.\nLike communities, food environments are ever evolving.  That’s why we have updated the Atlas annually.\nToday, I’m delighted to announce that the version of the Food Environment Atlas is now available and offers even more insight into sources of food in communities.  There are now 168 searchable factors, including new on numbers of vegetable farms, fruit orchards, and greenhouses growing vegetables or herbs.  You can also see how many farmers markets are in each county (including the number per 1,000 residents), which counties have food hubs, how many farms are participating in agri-tourism and how many farmers sell their products directly to consumers.  Merge this with about the availability of food stores and restaurants, food prices and taxes, use of food assistance programs, and other socioeconomic and demographic statistics, and suddenly you have a deeper understanding of how Americans experience food environments county by county in map form.\nSince , there were over 125,000 visitors to the Food Environment Atlas. What will you discover about the food environment in your county?\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n ERS\n Food Environment Atlas\n Food Hubs\n Kathleen Merrigan\n SNAP",

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nThe USDA National Agricultural Library’s (NAL) Food and Nutrition Information Center (FNIC) today launched its mobile application, or “app,” which calculates Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).  The “USDA Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) Calculator for Healthcare Professionals” app allows users to keep track of nutrient calculations and recommendations that are based on the DRI values in a more convenient and user-friendly format. Through this new app, healthcare professionals can save time in the nutrition care process for patients and clients, while having access to credible nutrition guidance.\nThe National Academy of Science’s Institute of Medicine first developed the DRIs in the mid-s. DRIs are recommended amounts of each nutrient a healthy person should consume to prevent deficiency or harmful health effects. Initially presented in tables, this information allows healthcare professionals to use the DRIs to assess and plan diets for groups or individuals. For example, if you are a female between 19 and 50, your registered dietitian or doctor may recommend that you increase your dairy consumption to meet the 1,000mg/day calcium recommendation outlined in the DRIs. The DRIs are also used in policy-making such as setting calorie and sodium for healthy school lunches.\n Food and Nutrition Information Center Staff, National Agricultural Library\n Posted in\n Food and Nutrition\n Research and Science\n Jan 20, \n 2 Responses",

But instead of providing electric service to an outbuilding or an adjacent housing development, Brown’s hard work is aimed at improving the forest’s dove field.\nBlue Ridge Electric Co-op is partnering with the forest to install “dummy” power lines at the dove field to make the area more attractive to doves, creating conditions for hunters to be more successful at bagging their game.\n“The installation of these lines will provide perching areas in close proximity to food sources for the birds,” said Chris Holcomb, U.S. Forest Service wildlife technician. Holcomb explained that the Long Creek dove field, located on the Andrew Pickens Ranger District in Oconee County South Carolina, is open only to youth and mobility-impaired hunters.  Thus, the new power lines help make the doves more visible to young hunters who are just getting involved in the sport and to men and women who may have limited mobility in the field.\nBlue Ridge Electric Co-op employees spend the morning placing “dummy” power lines at a dove field on the Sumter National Forest, Friday, April 13, .

Among those in attendance was USDA Rural Development Business Programs Administrator Judy Canales.\nThe event began with a luncheon presentation from Greg Krissek, ICM, Director of Government Affairs and Jim Imbler, ZeaChem, Chief Executive Officer.  Krissek’s presentation to the group focused on the ethanol and biofuels industry.  Krissek has been in the business for 11 years and currently oversees 102 plants with 6.5 billion gallons of ethanol production per year.    He noted that America needs to take what we have learned from first generation biofuels and build on it through adding cellulosic changes to the process.  Imbler focused his discussion on new technology in biorefinery development and in particular a cellulose-based biorefinery platform that could be capable of producing advanced ethanol, fuels and chemicals.  The company is headquartered in Lakewood, Colorado.  They currently operate a research and development laboratory facility in Menlo Park, California and have a 250,000 gallon per year cellulosic biorefinery under construction in Boardman, Oregon.\nAfter the conference, Administrator Canales met with Bruce Bredickas, Executive Vice President and Robyn Kullas, Project Manager, from NexGen Energy Partners, LLP.  NexGen Energy is an owner and operator of distributed renewable energy systems sited at customers’ facilities. The company works with governments, schools, businesses and utilities across the nation to deliver its customers the benefits of clean energy without the capital investment and technical risk.\nCanales joined Colorado Rural Development State Director Jim Isgar at the Eldorado Springs Bottling Company in Louisville, CO to tour the facility and discuss a previous awarding of a Rural Energy for America Loan and Grant in Fiscal Year to Eldorado Springs, LLC.  The entity utilized the funding to install solar panels on the roof of the bottling facility.  The 100 kilowatt project was installed by Namaste Solar and will produce 132,000 kilowatt hours per year.  The energy savings from this project is the equivalent to planting over 10,000 trees or driving approximately 300,000 miles in an average passenger car.  The project is increasing economic activity for the community and providing long term professional jobs.\nTo find out more about USDA energy programs click here. \n Category/Topic:\n Energy\n Rural\n Tags:\n Building a Sustainable Renewable Energy Program for the 21st Century\n Colorado\n Denver\n Energy\n REAP\n Renewable Energy\n Rural Development",

Myron’s life was saved by rural volunteer first responders after an accident nearly killed him in early November . Photo by Michael Stepien, U.S. Department of Agriculture\nNorth Dakota is a remarkable agricultural state and very rural. Farms and ranches dominate hundreds of miles of roads, and distances between services can be great. With so much wide-open space, our first responders and medical facilities play critical roles in ensuring the health and safety of our agricultural producers. Recently, their expertise and professionalism saved the life of a coworker and good friend.\nOn National Rural Health Day, it’s important we take the time to recognize the people in our lives working diligently to care for our family and friends. Their dedication to healthcare has a profound impact on all of us, and we are fortunate to have such amazing people living and working in our rural communities.\nAs the state director for USDA Rural Development, two of my main responsibilities are ensuring the safety of our agency’s employees, and working with our rural communities to provide access to funding to help improve the quality of life in rural North Dakota. Rural Development has several programs, and one of the largest is our Community Facilities Direct Loans and Grants program. We can help communities build and improve critical infrastructure, such as hospitals and fire departments. We can also assist with purchasing vehicles for first responders to ensure they are adequately prepared to respond to emergencies even in the harshest conditions.\nEarlier this month, one of our employees, Myron Lepp, Associate Director, was helping a family member in a rural area close out the long farming season. While attempting to cover a grain cart, a gust of wind caught the tarp and knocked Myron off the cart into the tractor’s three-point hitch. The fall broke his tailbone, and a broken bone was pushed into an artery. He was unaware at the time, but the punctured artery was causing internal bleeding. Knowing he needed someone to take him to the emergency room, Myron drove seven miles to his nephew’s house, where he eventually collapsed from the loss of blood.\nHis 24-year-old son Jason, a farmer for five years, was at the house and dialed 911. After the ambulance arrived and assessed his injuries, they determined he needed to be driven 120 miles to the Bismarck hospital. Throughout the drive, the first responders communicated with the hospital to provide details of the injury. When they arrived at the hospital, seven doctors were prepared to begin working on his life-threatening injury. The emergency room repaired the artery and replaced four pints of blood, saving his life.\nI would like to thank all the first responders in North Dakota and across America. Often, they are members of our communities that wear other hats. Their dedication goes unnoticed, and because of their skills, we take their hard work for granted. Rarely do we need them to respond to a fire at our home or a personal medical emergency, but they are out there daily taking care of our rural neighbors.\nOur farmers and ranchers provide food to the country and ensure that when rural America thrives, all America thrives. They depend on first responders to get them care when it is needed, and this experience confirmed they are dedicated and prepared to save lives in the most challenging circumstances. In North Dakota, we are fortunate to have a robust, extensive communications infrastructure. The ability to communicate played a critical role in saving Myron’s life, from the initial 911 call all the way to his arrival at the hospital.\nI am grateful to everyone involved in this emergency and thankful for the positive outcome. Unfortunately, we are witnessing a crisis developing in rural healthcare, which includes a shortage of emergency facilities. If Rural Development can assist your community with healthcare through our Community Facilities Direct Loans and Grants program, please do not hesitate to contact your local office. Our agency is committed to increasing opportunities in rural areas because together, America prospers, and Rural Development can be that catalyst to prosperity.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Rural Development\n National Rural Health Day\n North Dakota\n Rural America",

        "content": "Regional Conservation Partnership Program - New Partners, New Resources, New Ideas\n Last week, I visited with local communities in northern New Mexico. Many of these communities rely on irrigation ditches, called acequias, as their primary water source in an otherwise arid region. These are ditches that were used by their parents, and their grandparents, and their great-grand parents. Some acequias in the area date back more than 400 years.\nThrough the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), NRCS is working with acequia communities and partners across the state of New Mexico to improve water quality, water quantity, and boost the overall health of these local irrigation ditches that so many rural American communities depend on. The Acequia San Rafael del Guique, for example, provides water for roughly 150 people in the Ohkay Owengeh and El Guique communities – it’s being revitalized as part of our RCPP project in the state.\n Chief Jason Weller, Natural Resources Conservation Service\n Posted in\n Conservation\n May 12, \n 1 Response",

        "content": "MS, Senior Technical Information Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA in\n Health and Safety\n Dec 06, \nHoliday table setting – Time management: Key to a food safe holiday.\nThe holiday season is a prized time; it’s that festive season that seems to be here before you know it, and you wonder how you will find the time to do everything you need to do to celebrate properly with family and friends. The holidays are also when we share favorite, treasured foods with our loved ones.\nWhether you are making a favorite recipe for a party, holiday dinners, or mailing goodies to a lucky friend or family member, follow these food safety tips to make the most of your time when preparing your special holiday treats.\nMake space\nThis is a good time to clean your refrigerator so that you have room for holiday foods. You’ll also want to clean and clear off your kitchen counter so that you have room to work. Cooking can be a messy business and you don’t want to splash or spill juices from raw meat or poultry, or mixtures that contain raw eggs on clean dishes, kitchen towels, your children’s homework or decorations.\nMake a plan\nMany holiday dishes and treats contain perishable foods such as meat, poultry, eggs and dairy products. If you are preparing a complicated food that takes some time to make (e.g., egg rolls, lumpia, pasteles, alcapurrias and ravioli), make sure that the perishable foods stay hot or cold until needed. It may be helpful to divide up the different stages of the recipe. For example, if you are making lumpia, you can prepare the filling one day, and keep it in the refrigerator until you roll and package the lumpia.\nIf you are making a large batch of a favorite food (such as jams or jellies, pickled vegetables, sofrito) make sure you have all the ingredients and equipment you need before you get started so the food doesn’t sit at an unsafe temperature and allow bacteria to multiply.\nPack it Up and Hand it Out for Gift Giving\nOnce your goodies are prepared it’s time to pack them up for gift giving. Label with the name of the product, how it should be stored, and a ‘best by’ date if needed. (e.g., “Grandma’s Ravioli. Keep Frozen. Use by April ”). Not sure how long your item will last in the pantry, refrigerator or freezer? Download our FoodKeeper app to find out.\nStore your goodies in a safe place (a cool, dry place for baked goods, the refrigerator or freezer for perishable foods), until time to deliver or serve. If you are presenting perishable foods be sure to tell the lucky recipient that the item must be kept in the refrigerator or freezer. Avoid leaving perishable gifts on a doorstep or handing them out at a workplace if there is no refrigeration.\nServe it Up\nIf you are preparing your family favorite for a dinner or party you can make it up to 4 days in advance. If you are making a large quantity of food, store it in several small or shallow containers, which will cool down faster than a large container. When it is time to serve, rather than having a large amount of food sit out on the serving table, put out one portion and keep a batch warm in the oven or cold in the refrigerator until you need it.\nTaking it on the Road\nIf you are delivering your special treat or traveling to an event, remember to keep it out of the “Danger Zone,” the temperature range between 40 and 140°F. Pack perishables in a cooler on ice to keep them safe while you travel. If you are mailing perishables, see Mail Order Food Safety for tips on mailing food.\nConsumers with questions about food safety can call the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline or chat live with a food safety specialist in English or Spanish at AskKaren.gov, available from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n Tags:\n Food Safety and Inspection Service\n FSIS\n Food Safety\n Holidays\n FoodKeeper\n AskKaren\n Meat and Poultry Hotline",

(Illustration credit: Jody Shuart, ARS).\nSuccess in any part of agriculture today means being able to successfully navigate local, state and federal laws and regulations — from water rights to food safety regulations, from crop insurance to organic certification.\nTo help people find such legal information, the National Agricultural Library (NAL) has recently developed the Agricultural Law Information Partnership website. This partnership is a collaboration between NAL, the National Agricultural Law Center at the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture (NALC), and the Center for Agriculture and Food Systems (CAFS) at the Vermont Law School.\nFor each subject area, the Agricultural Law Information Partnership website provides an overview and a portal to a wide range of resources for farmers, producers, consumers, researchers and legal professionals. The initial topics include animal welfare, organic food, food production and sales regulations, new farmer, veterans farming, and water quality and quantity laws. More areas will be added as new material becomes available.\nWhile users cannot consider the information on the website to be legal advice, all content is reviewed before it is added by law librarian Kirstin Nelson, who coordinates the new program for NAL.\nThe partnership not only gathers links to legal resources but also funds research projects that fill gaps in available information and the development of new tools.\nThe first two of these are already completed and available online: the National Gleaning Project and the Farmland Tenure Resource Project, both initiatives of the Center for Agriculture and Food Systems.\nInformation about the U.S. Farm Bill and other resources can be found on the USDA National Agricultural Library’s new Agricultural Law Information Partnership website. (Photo credit: Architect of the Capitol).\nThe National Gleaning Project is a clearinghouse for food recovery-related information, connecting organizations with opportunities to collaborate at all levels, and a guide to national and state laws and regulations pertaining to gleaning and food donation.\nThe Farmland Tenure Resource Project is an online legal resource aimed at helping farmers, landowners and farmer/landowner-advocates to understand and navigate the various legal issues related to transferring farmland in New England. This includes financing, taxation, acquisition and insurance.\nAnother resource within the partnership has been developed by the Agricultural & Food Law Consortium, a four-university alliance led by the NALC. The consortium has done extensive research and outreach, including a year-round webinar series and a multi-state annual legal conference addressing topics such as the Endangered Species Act, animal welfare standards in aquaculture, use of drones in agriculture, environmental regulations, and shale oil and gas development.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n Tags:\n Agricultural Law Information Partnership\n ARS\n National Agricultural Library",

But that was not enough to keep the ranch viable.\n“In we had to sell most of the cattle due to the drought, and I knew I had to do something because the back part of the ranch was not grazable,” Maples said.\nThese 28 acres were covered in invasive brush that was too thick to penetrate. She had seen work completed on neighboring ranches and new that the land would benefit from some form of brush management, but Maples was unsure of her first land stewardship move and wanted to guarantee is was in the right direction.\nLuckily, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) was there to help. Together, the agency and Maples came up with a conservation plan to rid the unproductive land of invasive brush and transform it into rangeland.\nMaples could not be happier with the results. The steep slope is covered in green grass and also provides some of the best quail hunting around.\nNow, when the daylight hours do not lend themselves to hunting, the hunting lessee stacks the hand-cut brush at the back of the ranch, which is utilized as an area for wildlife habitat and grass germination.\nAfter working with the Natural Resources Conservation Service to rid part of her ranch of invasive brush, Pat Maples is now able to use the land for grazing her cattle.\nMaples is part of the Buffalo Knob Wildlife Association, which helps ranches of 250 acres or less by providing suggestions on how to manage lands for maximum benefit to wildlife, under the guidance of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.\nMaples has continued managing the ranch herself since her husband passed away in , and says she will continue to work with NRCS and work through the goals established in her conservation plan.\n“My conservation plan is a tool that lets me see where I need to go and how I can get there in reference to my place,” Maples said, “I have plans to install a trough and pipeline, and in the future, I will rely on the technical assistance of the NRCS to help me make those calls.”\nAfter working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to rid part of her ranch of invasive brush, Pat Maples is now able to use the land for grazing her cattle in San Saba, TX on Sept. 28, .\nWith the luxuries of a bigger city being 45 miles away, there are days that Maples finds herself not leaving the ranch, and she is perfectly content with her rustic home setting.\n“I will be fine right where I am at, this is home, and I will take care of it,” Maples smiles.\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\nCheck out other conservation-related stories on the USDA blog.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Conservation\n NRCS\n San Saba\n Texas\n Texas Parks and Wildlife Department",

The shamrock bowl was delivered to the White House earlier in the week and presented to President Biden virtually. The tradition of this annual gift from the people of Ireland started in the early s when Ireland’s first Ambassador, John J. Hearne, sent a small box of shamrocks to President Harry Truman.\n“The International Year of Plant Health has been widely celebrated in Ireland. This year serves to remind people here and all over the world of the importance of plants and the recognition that plants make up 80% of the food we eat and produce 98% of the oxygen we breathe,” said Daniel Mulhall, Ambassador of Ireland to the United States of America. “Although most Irish people live in towns and cities, we still see the countryside as our spiritual home. We have a very close relationship with the land,” said Ambassador Mulhall.\nBowl of Shamrock presented to President Joe Biden by Ireland Prime Minister Micheál Martin.\nTo meet U.S. import requirements, the shamrock arrived in the United States with a phytosanitary certificate from Ireland’s national plant protection organization, the Department of Agriculture, Food & the Marine, indicating a status of pest-free. The certificate reaffirms the United States and Ireland’s shared commitment to protecting plant health across our borders.\n“Every day our employees protect America’s crops and forests.

        "content": "Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in\n Food and Nutrition\n Apr 25, \n A perfect pie crust is often the measure of a top quality baker.  The “blue ribbon” pie crust is light and flaky.  Even the best baker’s skills, however, depend on the quality of the ingredients.  The quality of flour is based on the quality of the wheat – and measuring the quality of the wheat is a key responsibility of the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS).\nFGIS and the Official Service Providers it supervises conduct Falling Number tests as a measure of wheat quality.  Scientists and technicians at FGIS’s National Grain Center will soon begin a quality assurance program to monitor these tests and verify the original results to ensure that any procedural issues that could possibly impact the results of these important tests are quickly\naddressed.  FGIS will monitor a percentage of all tests performed throughout the Official testing system.  Last year, over 25,000 Falling Number tests were performed on wheat targeted for sale domestically and abroad.\nJoshua Liang, Physical Scientist, performs a Falling Number test at GIPSA’s National Grain Center in Kansas City, MO.\nThe Falling Number test is used to determine the pre-harvest quality of wheat.  Wheat that begins to germinate or sprout in the field or during storage because of elevated moisture levels can greatly affect the quality of the end product.  Sprouting unleashes an enzyme called alpha amylase that breaks down starch in the wheat kernel.  The level and quality of the starch in wheat is an important factor in how the end product of wheat functions during the cooking process.  Too much sprouting can cause sticky dough, which any baker knows leads to tough pie crusts.  It can cause bread, cakes, muffins and other baked products to lose their volume and fall flat.  The impact of sprouting is not limited to pies and bread, however, as pasta products with high levels of alpha amylase take longer to cook and produce a cooked pasta product that is too soft – not at all the ‘al dente’ quality preferred by most consumers.\nFalling Number is a method used to measure the effect and severity of alpha amylase in wheat before it is milled and used for an end product.  An instrument like the one being used in the picture on the left measures the time it takes for a plunger to fall to the bottom of a precision bore glass tube filled with a heated paste of wheat-meal and water.  Whole ground wheat or flour and water is added to test tubes and shaken to form a slurry.  Stirring rods are inserted into the test tubes, which are then placed in a boiling water bath in the Falling Number apparatus.  They are automatically stirred for 60 seconds, which causes the starch-water slurry to thicken.  After mixing and heating, the stirrers are released at the top of the slurry.  The number of seconds it takes for the plunger to fall to the bottom through the slurry is a measure of the enzyme activity in the wheat – hence the term “Falling Number.”  The test requires a specific instrument to run, but can be run virtually anywhere there is good quality water and electricity.\nGenerally, a Falling Number value of 350 seconds or longer indicates low enzyme activity and very sound wheat.  As the amount of enzyme activity increases, the Falling Number decreases.  Values below 200 seconds indicate high levels of enzyme activity.\nThe Falling Number test is recognized around the world as a key measure of wheat quality.  Minimum tolerance levels are often in purchase contracts, especially for wheat targeted for export.   FGIS’s Quality Assurance Programs ensure the accuracy of the Falling Number test by standardizing official testing locations across the nation.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n FGIS\n GIPSA\n National Grain Center",

VA Farmers, take a BOW! Check back next week for another in-depth state focus from the Census of Agriculture.\nThe Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture.\nNothing can compare to the economic impact agriculture has in Virginia. Census of Agriculture counted more than 46,000 farms, which cover more than 8.3 million acres of farmland in the commonwealth. That’s nearly a third of our entire state! In fact, according to Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, agriculture is our state’s largest industry.\nIn the most recent census, Virginia farmers reported selling more than $3.7 billion worth of agricultural products. Of these, most came from the livestock sector. Broiler chickens were the top commodity sold in , the year of the latest Census of Agriculture. That year, growers sold $638.3 million worth of broiler hens.\nCattle is another big commodity in Virginia. In our farmers and rancher sold more than $430 million worth of cattle and calves. And, as can be expected, with livestock you also get livestock products, such as milk. In , farmers sold nearly $347.2 million worth of cow milk in Virginia.\nOur crop sales, which amounted to nearly $1.4 billion in are also nothing to sneeze at. In Virginia, soybeans are our top crop. Nearly 580,000 acres of farmland are dedicated to this crop, with Virginia farmers selling more than $300 million worth of soybeans in .\nNot surprisingly, tobacco is a major crop in Virginia. While this industry is not as big as it once was, Virginia still ranks as one of the top 5 states for tobacco. In , our farmers sold $109 million worth of leaf tobacco from their farms.\nVirginia farmers also grow plenty of edible fruits and vegetables. According to the Census, our farmers harvested more than 5,000 acres of potatoes and more than 3,000 acres of tomatoes, which are key vegetable crops in the commonwealth. On the fruit side, apples are the largest commodity in Virginia. Our growers harvested nearly 12,000 acres of apples in . And, largely in thanks to our growing wine industry, grapes are now one of the top agricultural commodities in Virginia. Our farmers dedicated more than 4,300 acres to grape production in .\nThere are plenty of other facts about Virginia agriculture that I could mention here, but I’ll let you check them out yourself.

(U.S. Forest Service photo)\nMost people don’t conjure up images of the U.S. Forest Service when they think of the Smithsonian’s Air and Space Museum. But every fire season the work of the Forest Service’s planes and helicopters, carrying smokejumpers, are vitally important to controlling the spread of wildland fires.\nThis is why the Smithsonian recently honored the legacy of 17 of some of the most lionized smokejumpers in Forest Service history. Known as the Triple Nickles, these smokejumpers were the first all-African American crew in American firefighting.\n“It was World War II. You have to remember this was a time when segregation was still a part of everyday life. But 17 black men stood up to serve their country and become the first African-American paratrooper unit,” said Deidra McGee, a Forest Service employee who has been promoting the Triple Nickles since . McGee met these valiant men that year in Washington, D.C. at the Ellipse near the White House, during a ceremony commemorating Smokey Bear’s 50th birthday.\nThe men wanted to join the fight in Europe during World War II, but their dreams were shattered when military leaders in America and Europe feared racial tensions would disrupt war time operations. At about the same time, the Forest Service asked the military for help to minimize damage caused by balloon bombs launched by the Japanese across the Pacific Ocean with the intent to start forest fires in the western U.S..\n“In the end, few of the incendiary devices reached U.S. soil, but the Triple Nickles were instrumental in helping the Forest Service fight naturally-caused fires,” said McGee. “They became history’s first military smokejumpers who answered 36 fire calls and made more than 1,200 jumps that summer of .”\nSadly, the event at the Smithsonian saw none of the original Triple Nickles as only platoon member Clarence Beavers remains alive and he is physically unable to leave his bed for any extended period of time.

Yet today, with Tom Tidwell filling that role in a very different era, some of the same issues persist, along with others Pinchot might not have imagined.\n“We’re fortunate that we have an organization that can handle complex issues, like our Research and Development branch of the Forest Service (efforts) to sustain private and international Forest systems,” said Tidwell.\nPinchot headed the Division of Forestry under the Department of Interior for seven years before the agency became the Forest Service under the Department of Agriculture. At the time, the nation’s forests were seen as inexhaustible, but Pinchot did not see it that way.\n“Without natural resources, life itself is impossible. From birth to death, natural resources, transformed for human use, feed, clothe, shelter, and transport us,” Pinchot said. “Upon them we depend for every material necessity, comfort, convenience, and protection in our lives. Without abundant resources prosperity is out of reach.”\nPinchot, often referred to as the father of American conservation, increased the 56 million acres of public land under the Division of Forestry to Forest Service holdings of 150 national forests covering 172 million acres by .\nToday, Tidwell oversees more than 193 million acres of national forests and grasslands with similar yet disparate issues. The impacts of climate change – longer, hotter fire seasons and infestations of pests that have killed millions of trees – are among the important issues facing the agency today. Also, putting more demand on the land is a growing population that is not as connected to the land as in previous generations.\nTidwell recently presented the Pinchot Distinguished Lecture at the Pinchot Institute to help mark the 50th anniversary of the Pinchot Institute for Conservation Studies.  The Mildford, Pa., institute is in Grey Towers, originally the summer estate of the James Pinchot, Gifford’s father, and later the primary home of Gifford Pinchot.\n“We are so fortunate in this country to have the conservation legacy that people like Gifford Pinchot and Theodore Roosevelt really helped to establish for this country,” Tidwell said. “And today we have the honor and the responsibility to make sure we carry that out so that the next generations have that same range of opportunities and decision space about how to use these incredible resources.”\nTidwell said his top priorities include restoring healthy, resilient forest and grassland eco-systems, eco-systems that can sustain plentiful supplies of clean water, abundant habitat for fish and wildlife, renewable supplies of wood and energy and abundant recreational opportunities for all Americans.\nAfter the lecture, guests were invited to ask the chief questions.  Most questions were about climate change, policy and mission. \n“Climate change is going to affect us and we need to have a better understanding of what the impacts are socially and economically,” said Tidwell.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Conservation\n ecosystems\n Forestry\n FS\n Grey Towers\n Pinchot Institute\n Tom Tidwell",

Farmers across the country are making local foods available to their communities. USDA photo courtesy of Peter Wood, AMS.\nSpring is upon us and many local farmers markets are opening with displays of brilliant and vibrant . The fresh air has more people talking about and buying local foods. In fact, from the USDA Economic Research Service suggests that farmers across the country sold an estimated $6.1 billion in locally marketed foods in . My agency, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), plays a role in increasing these numbers by creating marketing opportunities for American farmers and local food businesses through the combination of applied research, technical services, and grant support.\nAs the demand for local food increases, food hubs are one way farmers can deliver more fresh food to retailers, schools, hospitals and restaurants. That’s why expanding local food efforts have focused on creating more food hubs. A food hub is an enterprise that helps farmers collect and gather local and regional agricultural products for distribution and marketing to wholesale, retail, and institutional customers.\nAMS offers food hub operators technical assistance for food warehouse design, facility management and physical volume capacities. Organizations and businesses involved in local food systems can use AMS publications, research and presentations to better understand and strengthen the local food infrastructure. \nFor example, one recent resource that AMS published is Building a Food Hub From the Ground Up: A Facility Design Case Study of Tuscarora Organic Growers. This detailed examination of a food hub’s growth gives local food supporters on-the-ground examples of how food hubs manage distribution infrastructure, solutions to warehouse design and how to gain the space capacity for handling a variety of products.\nOther valuable AMS local food resources include the USDA’s Local Food Directories. These directories are for farmers markets, food hubs, community-supported agriculture (CSA) operations and on-farm markets. The directories are valuable online tools that connect local food consumers and producers. Searching for a local food business is easy when using this one-stop resource that provides convenient access to directions, operating times, product offerings and more information about various sources of local foods. \nProviding technical assistance is just one of the ways that AMS supports the local food sector. For instance, we also offer grants to expand access to healthy food. AMS currently has over $90 million in grant funding available for this key sector. Through our Specialty Crop Block Grant Program and Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program (comprised of the Farmers Market Promotion Program and the Local Food Promotion Program), AMS supports producers, local food entrepreneurs, and rural and urban communities across the country. Grant applications must be submitted electronically through Grants.gov by May 14, . Applicants are encouraged to start the registration process as soon as possible to ensure that they meet the deadline.\nUSDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food (KYF2) initiative coordinates our work as the local food market sector continues to grow. In the past two years alone, USDA has made over 500 investments in food hubs, local processing facilities and distribution networks. The local food movement is alive and well. All of us here at AMS and USDA as a whole are committed to strengthening the local food sector, making sure it is a healthy, established part of the broader marketplace.\nAs the demand for local food increases, food hubs are one way farmers can deliver more fresh food - like Irv & Shelly's Fresh Picks who recently exhibit at the Good Food Festival in Chicago. They started their food hub to support small independent farmers and make healthy food deliveries to homes and businesses all year-round.

(Illustration credit: Jody Shuart, ARS).\nSuccess in any part of agriculture today means being able to successfully navigate local, state and federal laws and regulations — from water rights to food safety regulations, from crop insurance to organic certification.\nTo help people find such legal information, the National Agricultural Library (NAL) has recently developed the Agricultural Law Information Partnership website. This partnership is a collaboration between NAL, the National Agricultural Law Center at the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture (NALC), and the Center for Agriculture and Food Systems (CAFS) at the Vermont Law School.\nFor each subject area, the Agricultural Law Information Partnership website provides an overview and a portal to a wide range of resources for farmers, producers, consumers, researchers and legal professionals.

Para agregar a la multitud de recomendaciones para regalos de cocina que muchas páginas cibernéticas han creado durante este mes, la Línea de Información sobre Carnes y Aves del USDA ha copilado una lista de productos de cocina que podrían ser my prácticos y esenciales, y muchos de ellos son lo suficientemente pequeños como para rellenar  medias festivas o canastas de regalo. Lo mejor es que estos aparatos aseguran que la persona le pueda devolver el detalle al cocinar esos asados (ahumados o merengues) adecuadamente durante las fiestas o por todo el año.\nAquí los 5 regalos de cocina recomendados:\n Termómetro(s) para alimentos. Existe un termómetro para alimentos para cada presupuesto, método preferido de cocción, o conocimientos en tecnología, y cada experto en la cocina debería tener al menos uno de estos. Usando un termómetro para alimentos es la única manera de saber si el alimento ha sido cocido hasta una temperatura lo suficientemente alta como para destruir bacterias causantes de enfermedades, lo cual es muy apreciado por los invitados. Los termómetros se pueden comprar en el supermercado, ferreterías o tiendas especializadas en productos de cocina. Esta hoja informativa sobre Termómetro de cocina puede ayudarle a seleccionar el que mejor vaya con su regalo.\n Reloj o marcador de tiempo. El tiempo y temperatura son un dúo dinámico cuando se trata de controlar el crecimiento de bacterias al preparar exitosamente comidas inocuas. No solo le alerta al cocinero cuándo estará listo el alimento, para así verificar la temperatura con su nuevo termómetro de alimentos, pero también le ayuda a llevar cuenta de cuánto tiempo los alimentos perecederos han permanecido a temperatura ambiente. Las bacterias crecen rápidamente a temperaturas entre 40 y 140 ˚F (4.4 y 60 ˚C), conocido como la “Zona de peligro”, y los alimentos perecederos deben ser refrigerados, recalentados o descartados dentro de dos horas de permanecer a esta temperatura.\n Tablas de cortar. Estas podrían no caber en las medias festivas o pequeñas canastas, a menos que sean del tipo flexible, pero las tablas de cortar coloridas pueden ser útiles y al mismo tiempo servir de decoración en la cocina. Para evitar la propagación de bacterias, le recomendamos usar una tabla de cortar para preparar las carnes, aves y pescados crudos y otra diferente para cortar los ingredientes de ensalada o alimentos que no se van a cocinar. Al usar tablas de cortar con diferentes colores usted puede ayudarles a los cocineros a recordar cuál tabla de cortar usar con cada alimento. Lea mas: Tablas de cortar y la inocuidad de alimentos\n Termómetros para aparatos electrodomésticos. Los ajustes para el horno, refrigerador y congelador pueden variar y con los años, pueden fallar los componentes para enfriar o calentar bien. Los termómetros para electrodomésticos pueden indicarle si el horno está calentando hasta la temperatura correcta, o si tanto el refrigerador como el congelador están manteniendo las temperaturas adecuadas, a 40 ˚F (4.4 ˚C) o 0 ˚F (-17.7 ˚C) respectivamente. ¡Importante para mantener esos sobrantes de comidas festivas, sanos por más tiempo!\n ¡Otros detallitos! La Línea de Información sobre Carnes y Aves del USDA y GobiernoUSA.gov trabajan juntos para ofrecer una colección de publicaciones con “Consejos para las fiestas” que puede ordenar por la red electrónica (web) hasta el 2 de enero del . Las publicaciones podrían tardarse un poco, por lo que si tiene un intercambio de regalos pronto, puede ser que no reciba a tiempo las publicaciones por correo. Pero le sirven para futuras festividades. También están disponible en formato para imprimir.\nLos expertos de la Línea de Información sobre Carnes y Aves están disponibles para contestar sus preguntas sobre la preparación adecuada de comidas festivas, en inglés o español, durante los días de la semana de 10 a.m. hasta 4 p.m. hora del este, por PregunteleaKaren.gov (o m.pregunteleakaren.gov por su celular).

Yet, too many of our nation’s families still live in poverty, despite doing their best to make ends meet. Rural families and children have additional challenges as schools, healthcare services, healthy food choices, jobs, and other opportunities are often miles away in a different town, county or even state. The Obama Administration is committed to these families, and believes that all children -- no matter where they live --  should have an opportunity to succeed.\nToday, President Obama and I met with eight members of the National 4-H community in the Oval Office. Each one of them had an inspiring story about how they are opening up new doors for kids in their hometowns, and how this work is building stronger communities where they can learn, play and grow.\nWe wanted to take a moment to introduce you to these young leaders and tell you about the projects that encouraged President Obama to invite them to the White House to say “thank you”.  Investing in kids like these is an investment in America’s future.\n Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack\n Posted in\n USDA Results\n Initiatives\n Rural\n Apr 13, \n 3 Responses",

As the Census of Agriculture showed us, even today, nearly 5 million acres of our state’s land is dedicated to farming, that’s almost a quarter of all land in South Carolina.\nThe latest agriculture census also showed that the number of farms in South Carolina has remained steady for the past 15 years at roughly 25,000. The Palmetto State farmers sold more than $3 billion worth of agricultural products. That’s a whopping 29.2 percent increase in sales in just five years.

This week I had the pleasure of holding such a meeting with our headquarters staff in Washington.\nI began the town hall meeting by asking a question: How many people in this country get sick every year from the food they eat? The answer is 48 million people – 1 in every 6 people. Of those, 128,000 will be hospitalized and 3,000 will die from something as basic as the food they eat. That’s a major public health issue, and the work we do is all about bringing those numbers down.\nAs the public health regulatory agency within USDA, our reach spans the globe. In fact, most of the nearly 10,000 employees who work for us are scattered throughout the country, working in slaughterhouses, processing facilities, laboratories, or conducting surveillance. Each job is critical to public health. Through their inspection, testing or surveillance duties, our staff make sure America’s meat, poultry and processed egg products are safe, wholesome, and correctly labeled.\nMy team and I are also working to make FSIS a 21st century public health agency focused on prevention of foodborne illness. As we do so, getting input from our field personnel, from the people who carry out our policies, is so important. And although they may not be doing inspections at the plants around the country, the food safety staff in Washington are nonetheless critical to ensuring that the food parents put on their tables is safe.\nThis is what our people do every day. Whether inspecting on the line, computer programming, running samples at a lab, helping to develop policy, or educating consumers, we all share a common mission to protect the public from foodborne illness. President Obama, Secretary Vilsack, I and everyone at FSIS are committed to this mission every day.\nTo see some of the work our headquarters employees are doing, visit our website, Ask Karen a food safety question, or join us on Twitter and YouTube.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n Tags:\n Al Almanza\n Ask Karen\n Dr. Elisabeth Hagen\n FSIS",

These declarations allow small businesses, small agricultural cooperatives and non-farm small businesses that are economically affected by the drought in their community to apply for SBA’s Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL).\nTo find out if your county has been declared a drought disaster area, view SBA's current disaster declarations page. And to learn more about how to apply for a disaster loan, go to the SBA Disaster Assistance section of the SBA Web site.\nYou can also contact SBA’s Disaster Assistance Customer Service Center by e-mail at disastercustomerservice@sba.gov, or by calling 659-. The USDA’s Disaster and Drought Assistance site also is a good resource. It includes links to maps of current disaster declaration areas and a weekly weather and drought blog.\nIn addition to our disaster loan program, the SBA, the USDA and the Department of Commerce through its Economic Development Administration (EDA) will be hosting forums in communities impacted by drought conditions. The goal of these forums will be to provide comprehensive information on the federal resources that are available to assist your farm, ranch or small business.\nAt these forums, we will have SBA disaster assistance staff, our field staff and counselors from our resource partner network on hand to ensure you have all the tools and information you need to help your business.\nFor those not able to attend these forums, we will be setting up shop at State and County Fairs across the country to make sure all of your questions are answered and that you are getting the assistance you need. We also will be hosting a series of online webinars and conference calls to provide real-time information and updates over the coming months.\nRural America is critical to our nation’s economy. And a key to the long-term success of rural communities is access and opportunity for small businesses and entrepreneurs in these regions. We are focused on making sure that more small businesses in rural communities have the access to capital, counseling and contracting opportunities they need to grow and create good jobs.\nWe know how important credit unions are to rural communities. That’s why the National Credit Union Administration will be announcing that an additional 1,000 credit unions are eligible for low-income designation, which exempts them from the statutory cap on small business lending. This allows unlimited lending to small business owners, including farmers. Of the 1,000 credit unions that will be receiving this designation, nearly half are located in a severely drought-stricken state.\nI travel all over the country meeting with small business owners and entrepreneurs.   Some of the most innovative and exciting small businesses being built today are in Rural America. And we are going to make certain that rural businesses not only have the resources they need to endure these difficult drought conditions, but we are going to ensure that they have the tools to emerge stronger and more competitive than before.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Disaster Assistance\n drought\n Karen Mills\n SBA\n White House Rural Council",

USDA Photo. \nWOW! The word “wow” only moderately conveys the historic events that unfolded this summer during the Department of Navy’s Rim of the Pacific Exercises (RIMPAC) Great Green Fleet (GGF) demonstration. The might and power of the United States Navy coupled with that of scores of other Pacific Rim counties was impressive, but moreover a number of the great ships and aircraft were fueled by a mix of algae and animal fats.\nYes, advanced biofuels produced from American grown algae and waste animal fats powering the all-powerful military platforms! The man with the vision behind this innovation, Secretary of Navy Ray Mabus, would proudly note the Navy’s continuing global leadership as an innovator – having led maritime vessels from sails to coal-fired steam, from coal to oil and nuclear; and now the transition to advanced biofuels. Tom Vilsack, Secretary of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) would later expounded upon that message of innovation, “We can, as a nation, change the fuel production and distribution paradigm in the world, if we are consistent in our efforts to increase our production and use of domestic biofuels which are important to our energy and national security as well as create jobs.”\nFor nearly four years, Secretaries Mabus and Vilsack have made a coordinated and concerted effort to support the development and stand-up of a domestic biofuels sector. The USDA has lent support to furthering research and business start-ups for biomass production and waste stream diversion, and the Navy has sought to test, demonstrate and accelerate investments in advanced biofuels for use in its many platforms. Both secretaries have identified the importance of establishing geographically diverse supply sources of biomass and biofuels and noted that the State of Hawaii has a strategic role to play; hence, the RIMPAC exercises off-shore from Honolulu Hawaii was a perfect match to demonstrate the capacity advanced biofuels in the GGF.\nOn the designated day for the GGF demonstration, I represented the USDA and traveled with navy and congressional staff and representatives of the several airlines; assembling before daybreak for briefings and preparations for transport on a propeller-driven aircraft out to the USS Nimitz, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. We donned military issue life jackets, goggles and cranial helmets with ear muffs; yet, the ear protection only afforded limited attenuation of the excessive noise throughout much of the day.\nWe headed out onto tarmac of Hickam Air Force Base and took seats facing the back of the no-frills plane. Squinting to see in the suddenly dark space as the back hatch closed, a mixture of 50 percent biofuels and fossil fuels raced through the aircraft’s engines, and the roar became deafening. The engines, gorged with the algae and animal fat mix; and the plane roared down the runway and into the sky.\nTraveling 45 miles due north of Honolulu, through the aircraft’s single viewing pane, naval vessels could be seen dotting the sea and the horizon. Cruisers, destroyers and then the USS Nimitz came into view.\nShips and planes off the coast of Hawaii, participating in the Great Green Fleet demonstration.\nAfter we landed on the Nimitz and scrambled out of the aircraft, we were hit by the full might of steel upon the sea – the carrier’s deck 1,100 feet in length and 250 feet wide with a 10-story high bridge for observation and traffic control. Jets everywhere, attended to by squadrons of seamen grabbed in Navy Working Uniforms, colored light-weight turtle necks defining each squad’s role in the GGF demonstration.\nKeeping to an aggressive schedule, we viewed various operations including radar and navigation rooms; a tactical operation room for RIMPAC led this year by the Chilean Navy; and anchors the size of an office.\nSecretary Mabus heralded the multi-day GGF demonstration, which was supported with the purchase of 450,000 gallons of non-food waste (used cooking oil) from Louisiana-based Dynamic Fuels LLC, included algae produced by Solazyme. Meeting the Navy’s criteria, the fuel was: 1) “drop-in” and compatible with existing technology; 2) derived from non-food sources; and 3) its combustion would not increase the carbon footprint.\nBack at the Flag Deck, the GGF demonstrations ramped up with a dozen jets in high idle, rocking and trembling with a deafening roar of engines each waiting to be catapulted from the deck of the USS Nimitz. Once air-born, the 50/50 biofuel blend kicked in and the jets soared and flashed by the carrier at great speed and in tight formation. Flying the world’s most advanced aircraft with precise precision, the pilots accomplished mid-air refueling and touch and go maneuvers. The crew on deck and the spectators were enveloped fumes from fuel, oils and metallic dust; combined with heat emanating from the engines and the thunderous rumble, and everyone agreed that this was as Secretary Mabus stated, “A historic day.”\nFor more about the Navy’s Great Green Fleet visit the Green Fleet website, or to read or listen to secretaries Mabus and Vilsack debrief on the Great Green Fleet visit the USDA website.\n Category/Topic:\n Energy\n Tags:\n biofuels\n Clarence W.

They come in a variety of sizes, shapes, , textures, and flavors and can be worked into every meal. On their own, mushrooms are pretty healthful – very low in calories, free of cholesterol and (almost) free of fat. They are also naturally low in sodium, high in potassium, and are generally high in vitamins and minerals.\nStuffing mushrooms just makes something wonderful ever better!  But what you stuff in these tasty little vegetables can make or break the dish. Typically, mushrooms are stuffed with foods containing saturated fats and sodium. So, if you’re trying to watch one or both of these in the New Year, consider various herbs and spices!\nHerbs and spices do a nice job of seasoning many of my favorite foods. When I decided long ago to reduce my intake of saturated fats, I knew that my taste buds would miss the flavors of these fats and the foods that contain them, but I didn’t want to settle for a bland diet. So, I invested in several healthy cookbooks and read (and reread) the chapters on herbs and spices. The results have been quite impressive.\nThey say that “variety is the spice of life,” but I like to think that “spices add variety to life.” Along with the spices came exciting and unlimited flavor combinations. Now, I choose whatever suits my mood. (Is there anything more inviting than a kitchen that smells of sautéed fresh rosemary?)\nStart adding more flavor to your plate in and you’ll see what I mean.

The agricultores - or farm workers - work hard year-round to produce coffee, bananas, root vegetables and citrus fruits that are then sold in local markets and to area restaurants.\nBefore coming to the community of Alturas de Castañer, many families lived in cramped conditions, sometimes with two or three other families.  Conditions were unsanitary and children were constantly sick.  Some homes did not even have roofs, and residents suffered dangerous exposure to the natural elements, including torrential rains during hurricane season.\nAlturas de Castañer resident Maria Rodriguez and her husband recall renting a house that they could barely afford. The home was in disrepair, they had to use a ladder as a makeshift set of front steps to their home, and finding snakes and rats in their living space was commonplace.\nWith the help of USDA Rural Development's Farm Labor Housing Program, the Municipality of Lares was able to build an affordable 24-home rental community, Alturas de Castañer, dedicated solely to farm workers and their families.\nAfter moving into this community, living conditions improved dramatically for many residents. Residents like Jomar, an agricultor who uses a wheelchair for mobility; the closets and kitchen in his Alturas de Castañer home were built for wheelchair accessibility.\nThe community is quiet and clean, the children of the farm workers have a safe place to play, and the homes are well maintained by an experienced management company. It's affordable, too; farm workers living in this community are only to pay 30 percent of their income towards rent.\nBuilt in , Alturas de Castañer was a product of a partnership between USDA Rural Development, Rural Opportunities Puerto Rico, Inc. (ROPRI), an affiliate of PathStone, the Puerto Rico Department of Housing, and the Federal Home Loan Bank.\nUSDA and ROPRI have realized the success of the investment despite the significant challenges in planning and building a community in rural Puerto Rico. USDA and its partners are now looking forward to the development of self-sustaining community gardens which will also support a summer food program for children.\nAn investment like Alturas de Castañer, the only one of its kind in Puerto Rico, helps us realize that a better future is possible for rural Puerto Ricans.  USDA Rural Development is working with community developers and affordable housing advocates to create more communities dedicated to the essential agricultores of Puerto Rico.\nThe new playground for the children of the Alturas de Castañer complex.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Housing\n Puerto Rico\n RD",

(USDA photo)\nA year ago this week, Misty Allen and her daughter Deanna came home to the American Dream they thought would forever be out of reach.\n“It was magical!” said Allen. “This house is more than I could ever have asked for. I never imagined I could have a three-bedroom house for less than I was paying in rent.”\nFlooded out of their most recent apartment and facing a significant rent increase to offset repairs, Allen learned about Rural Development’s 502 Direct Home Loan Program through her local Realtor. Just before Christmas, she and Deanna settled into their picturesque Athens, Pa., neighborhood, their new puppy Odysseus joining Loki, the mischievous German Shepherd, in the mix.\nAllen says she wants other rural folks – especially women – to know about USDA’s Housing programs. Not just because she, Deanna and their fur family have a roof over their heads, but also because to her, the house truly is the ‘gift that keeps on giving.’\n“Just like the Grinch, my heart swelled three times bigger when we got this house!” the single mom laughed. “When my daughter was younger, I worked three jobs. Finally having a place to call our own made my self-confidence go through the roof. This is my dream come true: to have my own house and a house for my daughter and grandchildren to come to in the future. Our home is large enough to host family gatherings now. That means the world to me.”\nRecently announced changes to the Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program will increase the availability of rural home loans. Beginning in September , many currently ineligible lenders, including small community banks and credit unions, will be able to underwrite loans guaranteed by Rural Development.\nUSDA’s Rural Housing Service has helped rural residents purchase homes since . Since the start of the Obama Administration, we have helped more than 750,000 rural Americans buy homes with Direct and Guaranteed loans.  Additionally, we help nearly a half million others with affordable rental housing each year.

USDA Photo Courtesy of Miles McEvoy.\nLast week, we celebrated another victory for the global organic community – the announcement of an organic equivalency agreement between the U.S. and the Republic of Korea. We are thrilled with the outcome!\nBeginning July 1, , processed organic products certified in Korea or in the U.S. may be sold as organic in either country, eliminating significant barriers and creating opportunities for American businesses across the organic supply chain as well as setting the foundation for additional organic agricultural trade agreements. Consumers in Korea will now be able to enjoy a wide range of U.S. organic exports including condiments, cereal, baby food, frozen meals, milk, and other processed products.\nUnder this Administration, the United States has also established organic trade arrangements with Canada, the European Union, and Japan. The Korean arrangement will streamline access to the growing Korean organic market for American producers and businesses, benefiting the thriving organic sector and supporting jobs and businesses on a global scale.\nThe new arrangement also reflects the strength of the USDA organic standards – the U.S. organic program sets the gold standard, which is one reason that Korea chose to work with the U.S. on its “first” organic equivalency arrangement.  It also serves as an example of how closely the U.S. and Korea are working together to address emerging issues and strengthen our trade relationship. In , Korea was the 6th largest market for U.S. agricultural exports—providing about one quarter of Korea’s agricultural imports and purchasing more than $5 billion of U.S. food and agricultural products.\nAccording to U.S. industry estimates, the U.S. exported around $35 million of processed organic products to Korea in .  These exports came to a virtual standstill in January , when Korea implemented mandatory organic certification requirements that U.S. organic exports to be certified to Korean standards.  U.S. operations wanting to access the Korean organic market were faced with a double set of fees, inspections, and paperwork. The U.S. negotiating team – led by representatives from the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), and the Agricultural Marketing Service’s (AMS) National Organic Program (NOP) led by Deputy Administrator Miles McEvoy – worked expeditiously to reestablish access to Korea’s organic market while protecting the integrity of USDA’s organic standards.\nNegotiations encompassed a side-by-side comparison of the USDA organic regulations and the Korean organic standards to determine if an equivalency arrangement would work. We also sent an audit team to Korea to evaluate their organic certification and enforcement provisions.  After the thorough review, U.S. and Korean officials finalized the organic equivalency arrangement. Both the U.S. and Korea are committed to ensuring that all traded products retain their organic integrity from farm to market.\nThrough the NOP, USDA has helped organic farmers and businesses achieve $35 billion annually in U.S. retail sales.  The organic community includes over 25,000 organic businesses in more than 120 different countries around the world, and the combined organic markets of the countries with which we have equivalency arrangements are valued at more than $50 billion.  AMS and NOP are proud of USDA organic integrity, which helps propel strong growth in consumer demand for certified organic products and creates opportunities worldwide for American organic businesses.\n Category/Topic:\n Trade\n Tags:\n agricultural exports\n AMS\n Canada\n Certification\n European Union\n Farmers\n FAS\n Japan\n jobs\n Korea\n National Organic Program\n NOP\n organic\n Organic 101\n Partnerships\n Ranchers\n rural communities\n Trade\n USTR",

The focus of this summit was USDA’s Summer Food Service Program, as efforts are ramping up to ensure that all eligible children have access to healthy meals this summer.\nIn Ohio, over 630,000 children receive free or reduced-price school meals (based on family income) through the National School Lunch Program during the school year. Yet, only about 60,000—less than one in ten--participate in the Summer Food Service Program.

One of the ways culture is expressed is through the foods we eat. Our nation’s school meals should be no exception. More than 30 million children receive at least one nutritious meal every school day through the USDA’s National School Lunch and School Breakfast programs.\nMy commitment is to make sure these children have access to healthy, nutritious meals while they learn. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) has helped raise the nutritional value of the foods our children eat with meal standards that promote health during the years most critical for growing kids. The meal standards have been developed to not only offer healthy meal options, but to allow schools the flexibility to prepare meals that are familiar to kids from culturally diverse backgrounds.\nRecently, I learned of several examples of this while participating in one of the Team Up for School Nutrition Success workshops that USDA provides to assist school food authorities. The goal of this training is to help schools find simple ways to meet the updated meal standards while increasing the number of children enjoying healthy and flavorful school meals. It’s no secret that children and adolescents can be finicky eaters, but there are creative ways school nutrition professionals can prepare meals to be tastier and more appealing for this tough audience.\nFor instance, I learned that in Puerto Rico it is common for children to eat arroz con habichuelas y carne de cerdo (rice and beans with pork). Schools are finding ways to prepare this same meal in a healthy way that satisfies the palates of children who are used to eating it at home.\nHigh school students enjoy their locally sourced chicken tacos.\nIn the same way, school children in the Southwest region of the United States enjoy burritos and refried beans that are similar to what they might have at home. In West Virginia, schools have found ways to offer healthy versions of Southern-style cooking like sausage gravy and a long-time favorite in the state—the pepperoni roll.\nOur goal at USDA is to ensure children have access to nutritious food that nourishes their growing bodies—all while embracing diverse cultural customs and cuisines. I’m confident that through cultural inclusion and nutritious choices, schools across America will pave the way for a healthier next generation.\nSchool chef preparing healthy and delicious chicken tacos.\nFind new ways to make your favorite cultural dishes healthier and don’t be afraid to get creative.

He has also transformed the Ben Logan’s “Seldom Seen Farm” into an oasis for honey bees and other pollinators.\nWhen USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) launched a new coordinated effort to improve honey bee habitat in , Fitton was one of the first to participate. He works closely with NRCS to make improvements to the land that provide better forage for his cattle, improve existing hayfields and convert former corn fields into healthy pasture.\nFitton knows June to September is a critical time for bees to forage and store food for winter. This is especially true in Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin, which together are home to about ates.\nTo attract honey bees and other pollinators, an area must have adequate sources of food, shelter and nesting sites. A variety of wildflowers and grasses – like the ones in Fitton’s pastures – provide pollinators with food.\nProtecting clover blossoms enhances pollinator habitat and cattle, so Fitton prevents his livestock from grazing the plants below four inches in height.\n“I’ve found letting the pasture go a little longer has been helpful for the pollinators and minimizes bloat in my herd because the lush clover has time to ripen up,” Fitton said. “Leaving the plants growing higher than the minimum really seemed to help in reference to the number of pollinators I see around.”\nAnd what he’s doing works. “Due to my conservation efforts and through technical and financial assistance provided by NRCS, I’ve seen more pollinators this year than I ever have before.”\nFitton and his partner, Amanda Rubasch, have six active beehives. “Our beehives look healthy, I’ve got more bees and pollinators around, and honey production is up. There are bees all over the place now, which is rewarding to see,” Fitton said.\nKaryl Fritsche, NRCS District Conservationist, worked with Fitton to develop and implement a conservation plan and plant seed mixes to help him reach his goals.\n“Reed has been very proactive both in communicating his long-term goals and taking into consideration the effects on the ecosystem around him. That made integrating the prescribed grazing a great fit for this pollinator effort,” Fritsche said.\nFritsche said she hopes more private landowners like Fitton, take advantage of technical and financial assistance available from NRCS. This year, the agency is making available $4 million to landowners in Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin to make bee-friendly conservation improvements to their land, such as planting cover crops, wildflowers or native grasses and improving management of grazing lands. Landowners interested in participating should contact their local USDA service center to learn more.\nLearn more about NRCS’ efforts to help honey bees and other pollinators.

Check back next week as we look at another state and the results of the Census of Agriculture.\nThe Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture.\nAgriculture is probably not the first thing that pops into your head when you think of New Hampshire. As the Census of Agriculture results show, however, farming is a major component of our state’s economy. In , our farmers sold nearly $200 million worth of agricultural products.\nMilk production has been one of New Hampshire’s leading agricultural products for decades. In , our milk cows produced more than 3 million gallons of milk, which was worth nearly $55 million. Recently, egg production has been increasing. There were also more than 320,000 chickens in New Hampshire in . As a result, New Hampshire had nearly $13.5 million of poultry and egg sales in .\nSince we have cooler winters than many other parts of the country, many New Hampshire growers use greenhouses to raise vegetables, flowers, and other plants. Greenhouse sales alone reached almost $2.4 million in . In fact, nursery, greenhouse, and sod production is one of our leading sectors of agriculture, with nearly $50 million in sales.\nOur key fruit crop is apples. In , New Hampshire farmers harvested more than 24.5 million pounds of apples. That’s more than $6 million worth of apples! And while our state may not have the most farmland in the United States, we have nearly 4,000 acres dedicated to vegetable production, so our residents can get those important vitamins. To top it off, our maple syrup production continue to grow. In , our farmers produced more than 82,574 gallons of syrup, worth almost $3.6 million.\nNew Hampshire leads the nation in the percent of farms selling products directly to the public for human consumption at 10.6 percent. These direct sales make up more than 30 percent of total agricultural sales. This includes the 4.9 percent of all farms selling through community supported agriculture arrangements (CSAs). Also, 13.7 percent of our farms sold wholesale directly to retailers such as grocery stores, restaurants, schools, and other institutions-the 5th highest in the nation.\nWhile these are all important aspects of our state’s agriculture, what is especially of note is that we continued to buck the national trend of decreasing farm numbers. While the number of farms around the country dropped by 4 percent since the last census, our farm numbers grew 5 percent since . Our farmland acreage also grew by 4 percent since the Census of Agriculture. This increase continues the increase that emerged in New Hampshire in the census.\nTogether, these statistics show that agriculture has a major presence in our state. It has been so exciting to see the results of the Census that I’m already looking forward to Census of Agriculture to see if we continue growing this crucial sector.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Apples\n Census of Agriculture\n dairy\n Eggs\n Farmers\n greenhouse\n maple syrup\n NASS\n New Hampshire\n Poultry",

Our farmers, ranchers, rural businesses and families are committed to the value of hard work.  They agree that we owe today’s young people the opportunity to get ahead. They know that we must continue working to alleviate rural poverty to build up the middle class across our nation.\nThe President’s first priority is to make America a magnet for jobs – and when it comes to job creation, there’s no place like rural America.\nOur farmers and ranchers support one in 12 American jobs today, with unlimited potential in the years ahead as we grow and export more. Exports of quality U.S. agricultural products already support more than a million jobs here at home, and USDA will continue working with the President to open new markets for U.S. agriculture in Europe, Asia and around the world.\nHomegrown energy already supports hundreds of thousands of rural jobs. We’ll need rural America to lead the way in meeting the President’s goal to further cut reliance on foreign oil, while doubling renewable energy production in America once again. President Obama has proposed a new “Energy Security Trust” that will enable additional research of advanced technologies, including homegrown biofuels, to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\nThe manufacturing jobs of the future aren’t just in our cities.  Rural companies are leading the way to produce thousands of amazing new biobased products.  There is unlimited opportunity for rural America to produce even more of these products from homegrown sources, creating millions of jobs in the process.\nAnd if we are to undertake a unified effort to rebuild the nation’s aging infrastructure, which President Obama proposed this week, we’ll need folks across rural America to help get the job done.\nAll of us are blessed to call this nation home, and President Obama knows that together we can achieve even more.  Rural America can lead the way, making sure that America leads the world in job creation, while building up new ladders of opportunity for the next generation.\nFor an audio version of this message, click here. \n Category/Topic:\n Energy\n Conservation\n Trade\n Tags:\n biofuels\n Energy\n Exports\n jobs\n President Obama\n Rural America\n Secretary's Column\n State of the Union\n Tom Vilsack\n Trade",

To embrace the 9th African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Forum’s theme, “New Strategies for a Changing World,” the organizers made some innovative changes, splitting the forum between Washington DC and Kansas City, Mo. Why Kansas City?\nAs a major agricultural hub, Kansas City was ideal for bringing American and African agribusinesses and investors together. It also took the forum beyond policy discussions and into the field, literally. It was the perfect place to demonstrate the close relationship between American farmers and “the people’s department,” as USDA was originally named by Abraham Lincoln.\nTom and Karla Waters explained how they plant, harvest, store, and sell crops in their seventh generation farm operation. USDA Farm Service Agency’s county director and an extension agent discussed how the Department supports smallholder farmers and large scale operations such as the Waters’ 5,000 acres through research and training at land-grant universities, and marketing and credit programs. In the Foreign Agricultural Service, I oversee capacity building and development programs, many in Africa. I talked about how our technical assistance programs help give farmers in Africa the same knowledge and tools available to farmers in the United States, through partnerships and coordination with farm groups, governments, and other public and private organizations.\nThe ministers and delegates asked questions about purchasing seeds, planting cycles, irrigation, value-added end products, how prices are determined, and how to make a profit. On the policy side, they gained valuable insight about the Farm Service Agency’s network of service centers where farm loan managers, rural development officers, and extension agents serve the agricultural needs of communities throughout the United States. By seeing the producer-government relationship in action at the farm, I hope the ministers and delegates will take some new ideas and practices to use back home.\nPat Sheikh- Deputy Administrator for Capacity Building and Development.

Sixty-five projects were chosen nationwide.\n“Increasing the amount of local foods in America’s schools is a win-win for everyone,” said Cindy Long, Deputy Administrator for Child Nutrition Programs at USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service, which administers the Department’s school meals programs. “Farm to school projects foster healthy eating habits among America’s school-age children, and local economies are nourished, as well, when schools buy the food they provide from local producers.”\nAccording to the USDA Farm to School Census, schools with strong farm to school programs report higher school meal participation, reduced food waste, and increased willingness of the students to try new foods, such as fruits and vegetables. In addition, in school year - alone, schools purchased more than $789 million in local food from farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and food processors and manufacturers. Nearly half of these districts plan to purchase even more local foods in future school years.\nGrants range from $14,500 to $100,000, awarding a total of $5 million to schools, state agencies, tribal groups, and nonprofit organizations for farm to school planning, implementation, or training. Projects selected are located in urban, suburban and rural areas in 42 states and Puerto Rico, and they are estimated to serve more than 5,500 schools and 2 million students.\nThis money will support a wide range of activities from training, planning, and developing partnerships to creating new menu items, establishing supply chains for local foods, offering taste tests to children, buying equipment, planting school gardens and organizing field trips to agricultural operations, Long said. State and local agency interest and engagement in community food systems is growing. Having received 44 applications from state or local agencies, 17 state agencies will receive funding.\nGrantees include the Nebraska Department of Education, which will refine and expand the “Nebraska Thursdays” program, which will focus on increasing locally sourced meals throughout Nebraska schools, and the Virginia Department of Education, which will focus on network building to ensure stakeholders from all different sectors are leveraged. Both the South Dakota Department of Education and the Arkansas Agriculture Department will use training grants to build capacity and knowledge about the relationship between Community Food Systems and Child Nutrition Programs. More information on individual projects can be found on the USDA Office of Community Food Systems’ website at www.fns.usda.gov/cfs/grant-awards.\nUSDA's Food and Nutrition Service administers 15 nutrition assistance programs that include the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and the Summer Food Service Program. Together, these programs comprise America's nutrition safety net. Farm to school is one of many ways USDA supports locally-produced food and the Local Food Compass Map showcases the federal investments in these efforts.  For more information, visit www.fns.usda.gov.\n#\nUSDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer and lender.",

At the ribbon cutting celebration for the completed road, Tribal, state and federal officials all noted the obvious benefit of the paving: The trip for the thousands of visitors every year to Grand Canyon West would be smoother and faster. Hualapai Tribal member Rory Majenty, who emceed the road celebration, pointed out another benefit for tribal members, “We probably won’t have to buy a new truck every few years like we used to have to do because of the rough road!” Tribal members weren’t the only ones dogged by the undulating washboard road. Visitors and tour buses were plagued by flat tires, bent oil pans and hubcaps that flew off into the desert.\nThe Hualapai Tribe operates the popular Grand Canyon Skywalk over Grand Canyon West. The glass platform juts out in a horseshoe 70 feet over the canyon and is an attraction that draws over 700,000 visitors from around the world annually.\nThe paving of Diamond Bar Road had been a dream of the tribe for many years. As the Tribe began to develop Grand Canyon West into a captivating tourist destination, they realized that the many visitors would need a more comfortable ride to the destination.\nUSDA Rural Development and the Hualapai Tribe have had a long and productive relationship. In , USDA RD funded a water system to serve tribal members who were living and working at the developing Grand Canyon West. The $13 million loan/grant combination through our Water & Environmental Program allowed the Tribe to use other resources to begin the costly work of reconstructing and paving the Diamond Bar Road—a primary goal of the Tribe’s long term community economic development plan.

(Photo by Jerry Jay Johnson)\nRinged by miles of abandoned coal mines, the Wayne National Forest is surrounded by some of the most economically distressed communities in southern Ohio. A unique partnership with private investors, local leaders, a university, and nonprofit partners is helping to change that.\nThe Forest Service is working with the National Forest Foundation and Quantified Ventures to explore how an innovative finance mechanism can support an 88-mile multiuse trail on 9,000 acres of national forest land in Athens County.\nDubbed the Baileys Trail System, the project will serve as a case study for the Forest Service to assess the potential for funding deferred maintenance and new infrastructure projects by linking funding to measurable accomplishments through a system called Pay for Success. With this funding system investors provide up-front capital for work to be done, with repayment tied to the successful achievement of agreed-upon outcomes.\nThe Baileys Trail System was selected to pilot this model by the Forest Service, National Forest Foundation, and Quantified Ventures through a competitive process. Seth Brown from Quantified Ventures said that the Wayne National Forest was selected based upon the size and type of project, its potential impact, and progress in the planning process.\n“We could not have selected a better pilot site,” he said. “The level of community support, the passion of the team, the relationship with Ohio University, the indomitable spirit of the Appalachian communities, and the phenomenal leadership of the Wayne National Forest staff have been key drivers in the project’s success so far.”\nConnecting adjacent state and community trails, the Baileys Trail System could become the premier mountain biking destination east of the Mississippi. (Photo by Jared M. Dort/Wayne National Forest)\nConnecting adjacent state and community trails, the Baileys Trail System is within driving distance of about 15 percent of the US population. It is expected to become a premier mountain biking destination east of the Mississippi – an evolution that will enable Athens County to diversify the regional economy through outdoor recreation and tourism.\nAccording to Dawn McCarthy, partnership and community engagement coordinator on the Wayne National Forest, the trail is expected to attract users who will be eager to explore other aspects of nearby communities, including shops and restaurants.\nResearch and market analysis conducted by Quantified Ventures determined that the Baileys Trail System will draw more than 181,000 visitors per year. In 10 years, these visitors will result in $6.9 million in higher wages, $7.3 million in increased tax revenue, and $20.1 million in increased spending.\nPay for Success can unlock the upfront investment capital to build the trail system, estimated to be $5.4 million. Beneficiaries of increases in visitation such as local cities, counties, and villages can repay the investment based on the successful achievement of the economic outcomes produced from the influx of new visitors. Research partners such as local Ohio University will evaluate and validate the outcomes to ensure transparency around , government spending, and National Forest and recreational infrastructure usage.\n“One of the greatest challenges for our region is to improve the health and economic wellbeing of the residents of our communities,” said Athens City Council member Peter Kotses. “With this project, we are utilizing the resources of the national forest to elevate these points in the right direction.”\nThe Baileys Trail System is expected to attract more than 181,000 visitors per year – a potential boon to local communities like Athens, Ohio, shown here.

USDA photo.\nEvery single student in Santa Fe County Schools in New Mexico received a juicy, locally-grown organic peach for lunch on the first day of school last year from Freshies Farm.\nOn only a little more than three acres of land, Christopher Bassett and Taylor Dale were able to grow the peaches for the schools and still find time to support two young children of their own.\nFor this young couple, their land and the food they grow is their life. After working on farms for 10 years in everywhere from California to Colorado, Bassett and Dale finally bought their own. They settled at Freshies Farm, a slice of a larger orchard near Velarde, N.M. near the Rio Grande.\nWhen they arrived, the land was tightly packed with blackberry vines and peach and apple trees. But Bassett and Dale wanted to grow more than just fruit. They worked to clear just enough space to start growing other foods – tomatoes, cucumbers, asparagus, basil and oyster mushrooms.\nIn their five years on Freshies Farm, they have dedicated themselves to understanding how temperature, water and the health of the micro-organisms in the soil play a critical role in creating flavor.\nThey wait until their produce is perfectly ripe before handpicking it and selling it to the Santa Fe Farmer’s Market and in local restaurants.\n“When I was training to be a chef, I realized that the flavor is really coming from the field,” Bassett said. “Everything you’re growing is a product of the soil, the sun and the micro-organisms.”\nAnd their focus on flavor is apparent—their cherry tomatoes and blackberries have a taste as rich as their color.\nIn their quest for flavor, Thomas Gonzales, district conservationist from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service has been at their side from the beginning.\nGonzales worked with Bassett and Dale using financial and technical assistance from NRCS to help diversify Freshies Farm and install a hoop house on their property in order to help grow tomatoes and other vegetables during cooler seasons to sell in local markets.\nA hoop house, also called a seasonal high tunnel, acts like a greenhouse to help grow crops earlier in the spring and later into the fall without fear of frost.\nWith their hoop house and a separate mushroom growing operation, Bassett and Dale are now able to stay in business even in years where an early frost drastically cut their fruit production.\nBassett and Dale have also worked with Gonzales to put in other conservation measures that have helped them remain a growing and profitable farm including using native grasses to cover their orchard and increasing habitat for their orchard’s pollinators.\nTwo USDA strategic efforts helped make this conservation work possible. USDA’s StrikeForce for Rural Growth and Opportunity initiative addresses high-priority funding needs in rural communities in 16 states, including New Mexico. The Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative coordinates USDA’s efforts to support local and regional food systems.\n“We hope that younger farmers will connect with the older generations to learn from them and keep these lands in agriculture when they’re gone,” Bassett said. “We really enjoy farming and having that connection with our customers. Every day, we get to live in a little strip of paradise.”\nFruit trees on Freshies Farm.

Trading is based on the fact that sources in a watershed can face very different costs to control the same pollutant. Trading programs allow facilities facing higher pollution control costs to meet their regulatory obligations by purchasing environmentally equivalent (or superior) pollution reductions from another source at lower cost, thus achieving the same water quality improvement at lower overall cost.USDA and EPA signed a partnership agreement in to advance water quality trading and other market-based approaches that provide benefits to the environment and economy. The workshop attracted over 200 participants involved in water quality trading from across the nation.\"Conservation practices that improve soil health and conserve nutrients also produce real water quality benefits. With support from USDA and our Federal partners, water quality markets can create incentives to increase these environmental benefits and boost investment in rural America. The actions we are announcing today will help us get there,\" said Ann Mills, USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment.Among the new water quality trading resources announced:EPA-USDA Water Quality Trading Roadmap The Water Quality Trading Roadmap is a decision support tool for those designing and participating in water quality trading programs. The Roadmap is a searchable database that consolidates policy guidance from EPA, information from State programs, and examples and supporting materials from across the U.S.EPA-USDA partnership on EnviroAtlas to support environmental markets USDA and EPA will incorporate environmental markets layers into the Federal ecosystem service decision support tool, EnviroAtlas. The layers will show where markets for water, carbon, wetlands, and habitats occur on the U.S. landscape, provide information about these markets, and allow this information to be displayed in the context of existing environmental from Federal agencies.Nutrient Tracking Tool (NTT) USDA will release this fall the next version of NTT, ready for use in the Pacific Northwest and Ohio River Basin. The new version of NTT is a USDA hosted, user-friendly, web-based tool that calculates edge of field nutrient and sediment loads for use in conservation planning and environmental market credit calculation. NTT will be made available in additional regions in .USDA Environmental Markets Website USDA released the Department-level environmental markets website. The site integrates information, tools and resources on environmental markets from across the Department, allowing users to easily gain a snapshot of environmental market activities at USDA.These new resources were announced days after the Natural Resources Conservation Service awarded over $2 million in Conservation Innovation Grants to support water quality trading markets. The Water Quality Trading Conservation Innovation Grant Awardees are:Conservation Marketplace Midwest ($243,933)-proposes to develop and pilot a Field Stewards program, an innovative conservation credit system designed to allow companies in the food industry to buy \"offsets\" for water quality and agricultural conservation. Through the purchase of certification credits, food companies can demonstrate sustainability to their customers without having to create a new chain-of-custody supply chain for agricultural commodities, keeping costs low for retailers and the consumer. (MN)Electric Power Research Institute ($300,000)-proposes to develop and execute, for the first time, trades of \"stacked\" ecosystem services-both water quality and greenhouse gas emissions reduction credits. EPRI administers the Ohio River Basin nutrient trading program, the only multi-state trading program in the country. (IN, KY, OH)Great Lakes Commission ($400,000)-substantial water quality issues plague the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB), leading to harmful algal blooms each summer in Lake Erie. The Great Lakes Commission proposes to develop a framework for water quality trading in the WLEB. (IN, MI, OH)Iowa League of Cities ($700,000)-proposes to develop a framework for water quality trading in Iowa to support the State's Nutrient Reduction Strategy. (IA)National Association of Conservation Districts($116,725)-proposes to develop guidance materials and engage in outreach and training to increase participation of soil and water conservation districts in nutrient trading programs. In many water quality trading programs, district employees are the conservation experts interacting with agricultural producers generating credits from the installation of conservation practices. (Nationwide)Virginia Tech University ($285,729)-proposes to develop the information and tools to incorporate agroforestry into Virginia's nutrient trading program, which currently largely depends on the retirement of marginal agricultural lands for credit generation. In December , USDA, EPA and the State of Virginia celebrated a first-of-its-kind transaction when the Virginia Dept. of Transportation purchased phosphorous credits generated by a Virginia farmer.

Accompanied by Kitty LaBounty, assistant professor of natural sciences at University of Alaska Southeast, Deidra LaBounty, a geology student volunteer, and Jay Kinsman, a Forest Service geologist, we examined the site.\nWe carefully documented what we found, sending samples of the wood from the embedded tree to a lab for radiocarbon dating and to the University of Oregon for identification. First, we learned that the tree was indeed ancient – dating back 13,180 years. Then, Jamie Dexter from the University of Oregon confirmed the tree as Picea sitchensis, or Sitka spruce, making this one of the oldest records of Sitka spruce in Southeastern Alaska.\nAfter I gave Blake the news on the age and identification of his find, I explained how the tree came to be there.\nSouthern Kruzof Island consists of more than a dozen volcanic vents and domes referred to as the Mount Edgecumbe Volcanic Field. Mount Edgecumbe dominates the landscape rising to more than 3,200 feet.  Its symmetric cone and crater create a striking image. The field first erupted approximately 600,000 years ago, with volcanic activity continuing until 5,000 to 6,000 years ago.\nU.S. Forest Service geologist Jim Baichtal congratulates 11-year-old Blake LaPerriere for his discovery Sept. 9, , of an ancient Sitka spruce tree buried by an eruption from Mount Edgecumbe volcano about 13,200 years ago. (Courtesy of Zach LaPerriere)\nAbout 13,180 years ago, a violent eruption on Crater Ridge just north of Mount Edgecumbe resulted in deep deposits of rhyolitic airfall, what we know as pumice and ash, and pyroclastic flows or fluidized rock fragments and hot gases. These fast moving flows swept down from the saddle between Crater Ridge and Mount Edgecumbe, rapidly burying the forest and vegetation on the lower slopes.\nBlake had discovered one of these trees.\nKnowing the tree’s age helps scientists establish the age of the simultaneous eruptions which spread ash across much of Southeast Alaska.\nInterestingly, at the time of the eruption that encased the Kruzof tree, global sea levels were about 174 feet lower than today. The lands west of Sitka were a coastal plane with fresh water lakes.\nThe Kruzof tree is a record of an established forest in what was likely a refugium – a place where plants and animals persisted during the last ice age. This preserved relic gives us a small snapshot into the timing and extent of glaciation, the prehistoric climate, and the possibility of refugia where other plant and animals persisted and early migrants to North America may have passed. About 250 years after the eruption that trapped the tree, rising sea levels inundated the coastal plane and fresh water lakes creating Sitka Sound.\nMy plan is to return to the area in the future to see if other trees emerge as waves erode the bank. I’ll be looking for evidence of the soil and vegetation, which must be buried beneath the pumice flow.\nRead more on the area’s geologic history and the Alaska Volcano Observatory at these links.\nThe blackened area is the base of a 13,180-year-old Sitka spruce tree on Kruzof Island near Sitka, Alaska Sept. 10, .

It seemed fitting for me to begin my trip in Selma, Alabama given the historical significance of the location. The march from Selma, led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., embodied our most human desires: to be treated fairly, to be heard, to be treated with decency-to not be denied access and opportunities due to the color of our skin, our gender identity, our gender expression or our political identity.\nI was raised in Oregon by my father, an immigrant from Ghana and my mother, an Iowa farm girl. Standing there in Selma, the sacrifices made by those before me came into focus. As an African-American woman, I'm now very honored to be at an agency that plays an important role in bringing new investments to rural America.\nHere at USDA, we play a role in rebuilding communities when we provide help to a first-time homebuyer, or provide safe and sanitary housing for a renter. When a revolving loan fund helps expand a business and bring new jobs to town, or critical water and wastewater systems are installed, or high-speed internet connection comes online to a remote community. This is how we build on a continued pursuit of equality-striving for inclusion of all Americans.\nI was heartened to have a tour of the Southern Classic Food Group, a condiment manufacturer in Brundidge, Alabama that is expanding their business and their market share with support from Rural Development. The Economic Development Center in Pike County, Alabama works in partnership with us to invest in local small businesses and create jobs.\nIn Winona, Mississippi I announced our investment of $600,000 to seed a revolving loan fund for north central Mississippi small businesses, and I learned about a mental health center in Greenwood, Mississippi funded by our Community Facilities program that is touching thousands of lives every year. Improvements that strengthen and enhance the quality of life in rural communities often subject to great poverty.\nAs I stood on the edge of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, I was struck by the fear and bravery it took for those marchers to cross it on that day in . Though our nation is faced with challenges of the past and more subtle discrimination today, those who marched over the bridge made it possible for us to be the bridge-to rebuild trust and to challenge practices of exclusivity that have limited the extent to which we serve communities across our nation. Now, fifty years later, I know that we stand on the shoulders of giants who came before us as we work to develop and sustain our rural communities.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Africa\n Alabama\n Civil Rights\n Community Facilities\n Iowa\n Lisa Mensah\n Mississippi\n Oregon\n RD\n rural communities",

One way we are doing that is a new program that we recently piloted in Mississippi that provides free training through a partnership with the National Food Service Management Institute (NFSMI). The Team Up For School Nutrition Success Training (Team Up) is tailored to schools and covers topics like menu planning, financial management, procurement, meal presentation and appeal, as well as youth engagement tactics, and strategies to reduce plate waste.  \nAnother partner in this initiative is First Lady Michelle Obama. Mrs. Obama is grateful for the hard work being done in our country’s school cafeterias, but also recognizes that some may need a little help. When she heard about our initiative, she took the time to make a video to not only thank and encourage the dedicated school food service professional around the country, but to encourage them to take advantage of Team Up. Hear with the First Lady had to say about Team Up: \nThe name Team Up really says it all. This unique learning experience provides not only professional training and resources, but peer-to-peer mentoring. Schools have the opportunity to learn from each other, in order to make positive strides toward providing healthy school environments with financial stability and strong student participation. It isn’t a one-off experience. The peer-to-peer mentoring will continue after trainees return to their districts, and NFSMI will conduct 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups to gauge the success of the plans the schools developed after the training.  If additional training is needed, NFSMI will recommend options based on the schools progress.  The state agencies and USDA Food and Nutrition Services will also provide support and feedback. \nI couldn’t be more pleased with what I have heard about the how the first training class went, which was attended by 53 participants and 27 mentors. Participants told us that it was helpful to have a chance to discuss their individual challenges, as well as those that participants had in common. They said that hearing their colleagues and mentors talk about how they have handled some of these challenges in their schools was especially helpful.  Some participants even said that it was the best training they had ever attended!  The Kentucky Department of Education staff was so inspired that they created a video to say what a great experience they had.\nWe look forward to continuing our relationship with the White House and all the trainees. Together we can ensure that America’s students are getting and eating the healthiest food possible during the school day.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Child Nutrition\n Food and Nutrition\n HHFKA\n NSLP\n Nutrition\n Partnerships\n SBP\n School Lunch\n schools\n training",

In addition to fiber, fruits contain many essential nutrients that are typically under consumed, including potassium, vitamin C, and folate (folic acid). Healthy ways to add fruit to your day:\nWhen choosing canned fruits, select fruit canned in 100% fruit juice or water rather than syrup.\nFor a boost of vitamin C, add winter citrus fruits, like lemons, limes, oranges, and grapefruits to recipes or enjoy on their own.\nTry main dishes that incorporate fruit, such as fish with pears or chicken salad with apple.\nThis week we want you to focus on Fruit by starting with small changes at breakfast. You don’t need to overall your entire meal, just think about small adjustments you can make to include more fruit. Some options include:\nTop cereal with bananas or raisins, or mix fruit into low-fat yogurt.\nAdd frozen berries to pancakes or oatmeal.\nWhip up a batch of fruit smoothies and freeze in ice cube trays.

        "content": "Natural Resources Conservation Service in\n Conservation\n Nov 06, \nOnly the dock remains from a Bay Point, New Jersey residence after Hurricane Sandy hit.\nAbout two years ago, Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc on several states in the Northeast, causing $68 billion dollars’ worth of damage to critical infrastructure, businesses, homes and landscapes. Since , multiple agencies, including the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), have remained committed to helping the region build back stronger and better prepared for future storms.\nTo help the victims recover from Sandy and prevent future devastation in vulnerable flood areas, NRCS has invested about $120 million in Emergency Watershed Floodplain Easement Program, a program that helps restore and protect lands vulnerable to flooding.\n“This program will ensure long-term stability and help relieve the stress these landowners have been enduring for more than two years now,” said Andrew James, the program’s manager.\nThe easement program complements traditional disaster recovery funding and allows NRCS to purchase a permanent easement on lands within floodplains that sustained damage from Sandy. Through the program, easements were placed on more than 1,000 acres in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.\nRestoration of floodplains improves the natural functions of the plain while establishing the flow of water back into the area. It protects properties downstream, and it enhances fish and wildlife habitat. It also improves water quality and ground water recharge. \nHere are a few examples of how this easement program is working:\nWest Haven, New Haven County, Connecticut: The neighborhoods near Beach Street were hit especially hard as homes were irreparably damaged and families had to be evacuated. NRCS will provide more than $7 million for the restoration and permanent protection of 31 properties, 15 funded through the first sign-up and 16 funded through the second sign-up. These properties cover 71 acres of vulnerable floodplain lands, including 11 acres of residential lots. Floodplain restoration and removal of structures will benefit both landowners and the surrounding community.\nCumberland County, New Jersey: The Cumberland County application is the largest submitted to NRCS during the Hurricane Sandy recovery effort, consisting of more than 450 acres of marshy, flood prone property currently used to produce salt hay. The southern end of the area is adjacent to a large tract of state-owned open space land and the northern end is by a large NRCS wetlands easement. By linking these two properties together, the Cumberland County application serves to greatly increase the footprint of protected land in the area. This will allow for comprehensive restoration of the properties’ floodplain functions and values.\nMastic/Shirley Area, Suffolk County, New York: Numerous small parcels of land, some with houses, located in this low-lying, 100-year floodplain on Long Island were severely impacted by Hurricane Sandy. NRCS’ investment of about $5.6 million on 45 acres will provide permanent protection and will provide a critical buffer to a densely developed residential area to the north of the enrolled lands. The Mastic/Shirley area is adjacent to the natural shoreline of the William Floyd Estate, a significant environmental area of 600 acres to the east owned by the U.S National Park Service and part of the Fire Island National Seashore.\nThese easements will be complete in the coming months, providing places for floodwaters to go during times of heavy rains and other natural disasters like Sandy.\n“Just like we work with farmers to invest in the health of their soil, which will lead to bigger harvest down the road – this program enables us to work with landowners to help prevent damage from flooding in the future,” James said.\nThe remains of an individual home show exposed septic tank, among other devastation on Bay Point Peninsula, N.J.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Connecticut\n Conservation\n disasters\n Emergency Watershed Protection Program\n Hurricane Sandy\n New Jersey\n New York\n NRCS",

An isolated village only accessible by plane or boat, or an ice road in the winter, Lower Kalskag's 300 residents have no running water or toilets and pay four and five times the price for goods you and I take for granted. A third of the population lives below the poverty level and over half of the population lacks year-round employment. Located past the southwest end of the snow-capped Portage Mountains on an icy bend of the Kuskokwim River, I was fortunate enough to visit Lower Kalskag and see first-hand the critical role USDA Rural Development plays in our most remote communities.\nWith assistance from our partner, the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, USDA Rural Development is providing investment through our Rural Alaska Village Grant program to construct water and wastewater treatment facilities, as well as connect the residents of Lower Kalskag to the system. By , this nearly century-old settlement will have indoor plumbing for the very first time.\nPrior to arriving in Lower Kalskag, I purchased fresh fruit to bring as a gift, since produce is a luxury that is prohibitively expensive for this community. We were welcomed with open arms to their community center where we were given a project update by the engineering staff, followed by a community meal. Opening with a beautifully sung Russian Orthodox prayer, we shared in a meal of sandwiches and fresh fruit, along with baked fish and beaver stew. It was delicious.\nI talked with Crim Evan, the Mayor of Lower Kalskag, who proudly proclaimed how much he was looking forward to banishing the 5-gallon buckets they'd been using for toilet facilities. The so-called 'honeybucket' will be a thing of the past once the facilities are finished, and Crim was genuinely grateful for our USDA Rural Development staff in Alaska who have worked so hard to finance this important project.\nBridging the historical subsistence culture of this Yup'ik village with modern sanitation takes large steps toward providing the underpinnings of economic stability. This infrastructure improves the economic viability of the village and improves the health and sanitation for the villagers. Really, that's the gossamer thread that unifies Lower Kalskag with other rural communities we serve – in Alaska and across our great nation – the need for access to clean water, safe and sanitary housing, and economic stability that allows rural residents to remain in the communities of their birth if they so choose. Through USDA Rural Development, Lower Kalskag is providing for that need.\nMarcus Lake and his mother, Carrie, will have fresh running water and indoor plumbing for the first time once the project is complete.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Alaska\n RD\n Rural Alaska Village Grant program\n rural communities\n sanitation",

USDA inspectors at slaughter facilities also prevent cattle that are nonambulatory or are displaying signs of neurological disease or central nervous system disorders from entering the human food supply.\nA strong feed ban protects cattle from the disease.  In , the FDA implemented regulations that prohibit the feeding of most mammalian proteins to ruminants, including cattle.  This feed ban is the most important measure to prevent the transmission of BSE to cattle.\nScientific evidence shows that the safeguards we and many countries around the world have in place against BSE are highly effective.  Last year, only 29 cases of BSE were detected worldwide.  This is a greater than 99 percent reduction in the number of cases since the height of the disease in .\nWe found this particular case through our ongoing BSE surveillance program.  The surveillance program allows USDA to detect the disease if it exists at very low levels in the U.S. cattle population and provides assurances to consumers and our international trading partners that the interlocking system of safeguards in place to prevent BSE are working.\nWe test for BSE at levels ten times greater than World Animal Health Organization standards.  We take samples from approximately 40,000 animals each year, focusing on groups where the disease is more likely to be found.  The targeted population for ongoing surveillance includes cattle exhibiting signs of central nervous disorders or signs associated with BSE, nonambulatory animals, and dead cattle. The samples come from locations like farms, veterinary diagnostic laboratories, public health laboratories, slaughter facilities, veterinary clinics, and livestock markets.\nIn this case, the samples came from a rendering facility in California.  The samples were initially sent to the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory, then on to USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa for further testing.  USDA confirmed the animal was positive for atypical BSE, a very rare form of the disease not generally associated with an animal consuming infected feed.  We are reaching out to international laboratories with more experience with this atypical form of BSE to assist us with our investigation.\nOur investigation is ongoing.  But here are a few things that we do know for a fact.  It is perfectly safe to eat beef and drink milk without concern for BSE.\nThe carcass of the animal is being held at a rendering facility in California and will be destroyed. It was never presented for processing for human consumption.  At no time did it present a risk to the food supply.  And scientific research indicates that BSE cannot be transmitted in cow’s milk, even if the milk comes from a cow with BSE.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that tests on milk from BSE- infected animals have not shown any BSE infectivity. Milk and milk products, are, therefore considered safe.\nAs our investigation progresses and we learn more, we will provide updates.  You can visit our BSE information center at www.usda.gov/BSE to learn the latest and get more details about BSE in general.\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Tags:\n APHIS\n BSE\n Dr. Besser\n video",

Researchers found that by soaking roasted peanuts that have been shelled and skinned in a solution containing food-grade enzymes; they can virtually reduce or eliminate two key allergens, without affecting the flavor. Read more about this on page 198. \nThe creation of a portable method for identifying harmful bacteria in food that prevents foodborne illness and safeguards public health. This new instrument rapidly detects pathogenic bacteria with extremely accurate results. Details are on page 76.\nA new soil nitrogen test that rapidly and inexpensively determines the total amount of nitrogen in the soil that is available to a plant. The use of this test reduces fertilizer application amounts, reduces costs for farmers, and benefits the environment. You can learn more on page 89.\nA new process for pasteurizing shelled eggs that uses radio frequency energy that is 1.5 times faster than the current pasteurization process and that does not affect the eggs’ appearance. This fast new technology should increase the number of pasteurized eggs and reduce the threat of illness from uncooked and undercooked shelled eggs.  The details are on pages 74-75.\nUSDA has a proven track record of performing research that has tangible benefits for the American public, and studies have found every dollar invested in agricultural research returns $20 to our economy.

USDA photo by Lance Cheung.\nSpring has sprung and April is National Garden Month! It’s time to pick up your trowel and get gardening.\nUSDA launched the new People’s Garden website that provides tools and resources gardeners can use to start or expand a home, school or community garden. Unveiled during today’s annual Easter Egg Roll at the White House, here are just some of the new features:\nThose new to gardening can download community garden and school garden checklists created in partnership with Let’s Move or watch short videos about how-to raise tomato seedlings indoors or the benefits of installing a rain barrel.\nGrowing your own food is a great way to build a healthier plate. USDA’s MyPlate recommends that everyone fill half their plate with fruits and vegetables. With the new People’s Garden database, gardeners can now itemize the amount and type of fruits and vegetables picked from their People’s Garden. Each product is automatically converted to cups using SuperTracker, which helps gardeners better understand how their yield will feed them and others.\nFor the experienced gardeners who want to explore selling their produce, the new People’s Garden map connects them to nearby farmers markets and CSAs.\nAnd that’s not all. Another exciting addition is the Plant a Window Box for Pollinators online game that has been a big hit at the White House Easter Egg Roll, created in cooperation with the Pollinator Partnership. It’s a fun, interactive tool that shows you how planting native species can increase the quality and amount of food available to neighborhood bees and other pollinators. Check it out.\nOnce you lay the groundwork and get growing, don’t forget to register your food, wildlife, conservation, beautification, education, or training garden with us as a People’s Garden. Since , more than 1,300 partners have volunteered over 200,000 hours in 2,226 gardens resulting in donations of 3.9 million pounds of food.\nFollow us throughout National Garden Month this April on Twitter @PeoplesGarden and share your garden stories using .\nUSDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service, Transportation and Marketing Program oversees the People’s Garden Initiative for the Department.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n AMS\n ARS\n CNPP\n FNS\n garden\n gardening\n KYF2\n Let's Move\n Local and Regional Foods\n local food\n MyPlate\n National Garden Month\n People's Garden\n pollinators\n regional food\n SuperTracker\n Tom Vilsack\n White House",

Tribal elder Cecilia Fire Thunder facilitated.\nRecently USDA Rural Development staff in South Dakota spent two days at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, home of the Oglala Sioux, where they met with Tribal leaders, educators and other Federal partners.  They made this trip as part of a broader administration effort to change the way the federal government works with communities. This approach values residents’ knowledge of their communities’ strengths and needs; it also includes local leaders as essential partners and collaborators.\nJennifer Irving, Director of Regional Equity for Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation, a local non-profit intimately involved in one-such effort at Pine Ridge said, “It is important to coordinate engagement of the Promise Zone stakeholders to ensure that Tribal Leadership’s vision and priorities are being met while optimizing Tribal commitment of time and resources.”\nPine Ridge was designated a Promise Zone last April and in July a Presidential Disaster Declaration was received following severe summer storms. Since then the federal government, the Oglala Sioux Tribal government, and local organizations, such as Thunder Valley and other key partners have been working collaboratively to ensure activities, investments, and projects of the many entities across the reservation have broad-based community support and coordinated, and likely to yield results for residents.\nDr. Richard Zephier provided an overview of the CEDS process and long term vision to develop a stronger economy for Pine Ridge.\nVisiting Rural Development staff were given an overview of the wide array of work underway including the Tribe’s work on a proposed Tribal Planning Office and a Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) that will lay out a long term vision for developing a stronger economy for Pine Ridge.  Other topics covered included recovery efforts underway in partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recovery efforts and an overview of the work two local organizations, Mazaska and Lakota Funds, are doing to identify housing and other finance-related needs.\nAt Oglala Lakota College we met with President Shortbull who talked about work underway to develop an Ag Expo Center that would be instrumental in making local food a path for economic development. The College has already raised a substantial amount toward the expected total project need.\nA representative from each of the round table break-out sessions provided the entire group a synopsis of the top issues that were drawn out of the round table discussion at their respective table.\nThis project will create educational opportunities in the community by increasing training and hands on experience for producers of all types of agricultural production on Pine Ridge. It will expand their economic opportunities by providing a place where producers can work in a commercial kitchen or work with large animals in a modern facility. This project has broad public support and holds significant potential for the Tribe and people living at Pine Ridge.\nWhile at Pine Ridge we also heard directly from Oglala Sioux youth at a roundtable with high school students at Little Wound School.  Of all of the meetings over the course of the two days, this opportunity to connect with the students at Little Wound that really hit home. The stories of hope, struggle and the students’ passion inspired us even more with the work ahead.\nPersistent poverty and lack of infrastructure investment have taken their toll at Pine Ridge. Now, these placed–based efforts aims to leverage investments, increase economic activity, improve educational opportunities and improve the quality of life in the area through focused work on the six goals the community has identified as instrumental to improve the economic health of the area, increase the quality of life and accelerate the work to create comprehensive community revitalization.\nFirst, accelerate job creation by building the foundation for new businesses including implementation of workforce development programs to ensure people are trained with the skills to fill new positions.\nSecond, increase economic activity by addressing economic issues at the systemic level—like expanding increasing banking options and affordable housing for the workforce on the Reservation.\nThird, improve educational opportunities on the Reservation from primary school through the post-secondary level by offering Lakota immersion education, charter school options and opportunities at the Oglala Lakota College.\nFourth, improve public safety Reservation by addressing substance abuse issues and strengthening the justice system.\nFifth, provide affordable, low maintenance, energy efficient housing for residents of the Reservation, focusing on key issues like affordable rent, homeownership and middle income housing by developing the real estate market and increasing access to capital.\nSixth, systematically develop infrastructure by providing the Tribal government with the ability to operate, maintain, and replace current infrastructure and facilitate future development.\nA representative from each of the round table break-out sessions provided the entire group a synopsis of the top issues that were drawn out of the round table discussion at their respective table.\nThe Promise Zone Initiative is part of the President’s plan to partner with local communities, businesses and Tribes to create jobs, increase economic security, expand educational opportunities, increase access to quality, affordable housing and improve public safety.  To date, thirteen Promise Zones have been designated across the country; Pine Ridge is one of only two Tribal Promise Zones.  Seven more Promise Zones will be designated in and applications are currently being accepted.\nWe know that increasingly, the community where a child grows up in impacts her odds of graduating high school, her health outcomes, and her lifetime economic opportunities. The Administration has been steadily embarking on a different approach to working with communities to ensure where a child is born never determines her destiny.\nThe Promise Zone Initiative is one of the Administration’s community-based initiatives in action across the country.  In these places federal experts are working side by side with residents and local leaders to create customized solutions; bolstering coordination across agencies and improving how we interact with communities as a ‘one Government’ partner; and relying on valuable to help inform solutions and evaluate what’s working and what’s not.\nThe Promise Zone designation enables USDA to work more collaboratively with other federal agencies in partnership with the Oglala Sioux and others across the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation on efforts to increase economic mobility and create opportunities across the entire region.  To view all active community-based initiatives in your community, visit www.whitehouse.gov/omb/place.\nUSDA leadership was able to connect with high school students from Little Wound School.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Pine Ridge\n Promise Zone Initiative\n Promise Zones\n RD\n South Dakota\n StrikeForce\n Tribal",

After issuing a solicitation and competitive bids from domestic suppliers, the Agricultural Marketing Service awarded the first contract for two truckloads—that’s 80,000 pounds —of raw chicken leg quarters for shipment to Chicago’s schools.\nNext the Midwest Food and Nutrition Staff worked with Rachael Ray ’s Yum-o! non-profit to create a healthy, tasty meal. “I had so much fun creating this recipe with Chicago Public Schools,” said Ray. “I tried to create a recipe that would capture the cultural diversity of Chicago and most importantly, that the kids would love to eat.”\nThe result: Windy City Chicken -- a savory meal of chicken, sweet and spicy baked beans, brown rice and orange-glazed carrots. Prepared by food service staff, the new menu itesm were served to thrilled Second City students in more than 450 schools as part of National School Lunch Week on October 13th.  NBC-Chicago, which covered the event, captured the reaction of a number of children who raved about the meal. “It tastes like heaven,” said one student.\nStudents enjoyed the new lunch menu items made possible by a unique collaboration USDA agencies, a celebrity chef, and the Chicago Schools system.\nOctober was National Farm to School Month, which promotes locally-sourced foods in school meal programs, so the menu also featured locally grown food. Chicago Public Schools, through its primary food provider, Chartwells-Thompson, has the largest farm to school program in the Midwest, with more than $2.5 million in fruits and vegetables purchased from regional growers and producers. The carrots used for the special menu are one of the items in CPS’s well-known frozen local program. They were grown within 250 miles of the city, picked at their peak ripeness and flash frozen to preserve their fresh-tasting flavor—and nutrients.\nThe special menu entrée will be served again in the future. In fact, the Agricultural Marketing Service has already awarded additional contracts for more of the chicken.\n Category/Topic:\n Initiatives\n Food and Nutrition\n Health and Safety\n Farming\n Tags:\n AMS\n Chicago\n Farm to School\n FNS\n Illinois\n National Farm to School Month\n National School Lunch Week",

Senator Patrick Leahy (right) and Rep. Peter Welch look on.\nLake Champlain has been plagued by blue-green algae blooms caused by a large amount of phosphorous and other nutrients in the New England lake. Recently, USDA launched a special initiative in the Lake Champlain basin, which is composed of New York and Vermont, to invest $45 million in protecting and improving soil and water quality over the next five years.\n“Our work helps farmers prevent phosphorus laden runoff which leads to the blue green algae blooms,” said Vicky Drew, the state conservationist for USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service in Vermont. “NRCS conservationists work with farmers to ensure that manure is properly stored, and we provide assistance in the application of manure to their fields according to a nutrient management plan.” \nFunding for this program comes from the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, one of the conservation programs offered by the Farm Bill. This program will help Vermont farmers put into place conservation practices that help farmers keep water clean and soil in place, such as cover cropping, tillage systems, vegetative buffers and others.\nThe funding is targeted to areas where blue-green algae blooms are frequent, including Missisquoi Bay, St. Albans Bay and the South Lake — areas of Lake Champlain where blue-green algae blooms are frequent.\nPhosphorus can affect water quality by enabling excessive aquatic plant and algae growth, which contributes to fish die offs and other environmental impacts. The algae blooms are the result of degraded water quality caused partially by runoff of phosphorous.\nAgriculture is one contributor of phosphorous, but municipalities and industries also contribute to the problem.\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack recently visited Vermont to announce this funding and meet with local farmers and leaders.\n“This is the sixth largest freshwater body in the country. And there’s no question it needs help,” Vilsack said “We are dedicated to protecting and improving this beautiful and unique natural resource.”\nAdded Rep. Peter Welch at the announcement: “The future of our lake will depend on effective conservation measures, which these funds will support.”\nLake Champlain was formed about 200 million years ago when the continents stretched, causing massive bedrock to fall between two faults. This incredible natural resource contains 435 square miles of surface water and is 120 miles long, and is nestled between the Green Mountains of Vermont and the Adirondack Mountains of New York. At its widest point, the lake spans 12 miles with an average depth of 64 feet, and it is adorned with 600 miles of shoreline and over 70 islands.\nThe lake holds 6.8 trillion gallons of water and provides drinking water for over 200,000 people, habitat for over 300 bird species, and brims with 81 fish species.\nThis September, USDA is celebrating the many opportunities and benefits provided by conservation by highlighting stories like this one.

Photo credit: US Forest Service\nThis blog post was co-authored with Aaron Reuben (International Union for Conservation of Nature) and Kathleen Buckingham (World Resources Institute).\nFour billion acres of degraded and deforested land world-wide—an area the size of South America—could benefit from restoration. Restoration addresses our most pressing global challenges—from protecting biodiversity to providing food, energy and water, to offering security and economic opportunity for millions of people.\nIn the United States, a multitude of partners from all sectors, from the local to national level, initiated restoration on millions of acres of degraded land, but the United States cannot do it alone. Degradation is a global issue that requires a global response. This summer, landscape restoration professionals from 16 countries, representing government ministries, non-governmental organizations and private companies, gathered in Oregon to learn from the United States’ experience.\nThe U.S. Forest Service’s International Programs’ International Seminar on Forest Landscape Restoration brought together practitioners from Armenia, Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia, Israel, Malawi, Rwanda, Turkey and Zambia, among many other countries, for a three-week shared learning event. Through technical presentations, exercises and field visits to restoration sites across the state of Oregon (including in the Mt. Hood National Forest, the Deschutes National Forest, and the Malheur National Forest) participants learned the full variety of techniques for restoration employed in the western United States. The seminar covered topics such as restoration planning and opportunity assessment, technical implementation and stewardship. Restoration activities in the field included thinning and burning to restore natural forest structures, use of native seeds and plants and river and meadow restoration. Additionally, the history of conflict, collaboration and scientific achievement that marks the advancement of forest management and restoration in the United States was shared as important context with participants.\nThe seminar also allowed participants to share their own experience in forest landscape restoration and identify common opportunities and constraints. Many seminar sessions focused on developing leadership skills to help the practitioners move restoration forward in their home countries. Some participants committed to join with members of their cohort working in nearby countries to build expertise in their region. All were heartened to join the growing global network of restoration professionals. “I hope this spirit of teamwork will continue to hold us together,” said Samuel Kofi Nyame, a Project Coordinator for the International Union for Conservation of Nature in Ghana. “We can continue to learn from one another and be an inspiration to those to yet come.”\nSome key lessons emerged from the seminar:\nRestoration comes in many forms. Understanding the limiting factors for restoration is a key element that is relevant to all landscapes globally. In Oregon, a history of fire suppression has led to overstocking in many of the state’s forests, increasing the threat of a catastrophic wildfire in a landscape that has historically been adapted to frequent, less-severe fires. In order to protect water resources and promote more fire-resilient landscapes, experts conduct restoration interventions—such as thinning and prescribed fire. This approach seemed counterintuitive at first to participants who come from landscapes with different limiting factors and restoration needs—primarily bringing back trees and vegetation to degraded areas.\nTo go fast, go alone. To go far, go together. Effective forest landscape restoration integrates different uses and needs from the land for multiple long-term objectives. While participatory approaches allow for effective prioritizing, planning, implementing and monitoring successes, balancing different needs can be challenging—especially in areas with a history of contention. After years of gridlock over differing priorities, diverse forest users in Oregon, like the members of the Southern Blues Restoration Coalition, are now working towards common goals together. Through conversations with collaborative members, seminar participants learned that building community relationships is possible and critical. Hanqian (Sophie) Zhang, Water Resources Protection Manager for Danone Waters in China, was particularly impressed with the history of collaboration in forest management in the United States. “I have taken to heart that one should always keep the spirit of collaboration going in order to achieve something greater,” Zhang shared.\nIt’s all connected. Another key takeaway of the seminar centered on the connections between ecological, social and economic contexts and objectives. Sandeep Kandicuppa with the Foundation for Ecological Security in India observed that, as forest landscape restoration professionals, “we must work with others to find the interconnections” between different land uses and across land ownership boundaries. For his home landscape and many others, local communities rely on forest products for food and fiber. To Kandicuppa, restoration that does not consider economic development and alternative livelihoods will not be successful.\nThe seminar concluded on a rainy day in Portland, with presentations of forest landscape restoration action plans developed by each participant for use in their home landscape. Mary Wagner, Associate Chief of the U.S. Forest Service, was on hand for the final presentations. Given the urgency of the task facing land managers around the world, who need restored and resilient landscapes to meet the demands of the next generation, “it can be easy to get overwhelmed,” she told her international audience. Addressing the gathered professionals, members of a new community of practice spanning 16 countries, she smiled, “Isn’t it nice to know that we don’t have to do this alone?”\nThe International Seminar on Forest Landscape Restoration was co-hosted by the U.S. Forest Service, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and the World Resources Institute.

Check back next Thursday for another fascinating look at another state and the Census of Agriculture!\nThe Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture.\nWhen you think of Montana agriculture, wheat and cattle come to mind. And why shouldn’t they? After all, our state ranks third in wheat production and tenth in cattle and calves inventory, according to the Census of Agriculture. That year, the combined market value of ag products sold for grains, oilseeds, dry beans, and dry peas was $1,787,162,000 and cattle and calves was $1,783,908,000. Montana’s total market value of agricultural products sold per farm was $151,031; which was up 59 percent from the previous Census of Agriculture in , while the U.S. average was up 39 percent.\nWe have 28,008 farms and ranches in our state with an average size of 2,134 acres, which is down 5 percent from .  Female principal operators of farms and ranches account for 15 percent of the total principal operators in the state while American Indians account for just 5 percent. Like most other states, the average age of our producers continues to increase to 58.9 years, climbing 1.1 years from .\nMontana ranked second in barley production according the census. Our farmers produce both malt and feed barley. Most of the larger brewers have a presence in Montana, contracting many acres of the finest malt barley available.\nIrrigation is important in the western states and Montana is no different with 9,451 operations irrigating 1.9 million acres in down 10 percent from 5 years ago. Our growers produce many irrigated crops. Among irrigated crops, our growers harvested 45,807 acres of sugar beets in , ranking sixth in the nation.\nOrganic producers also take advantage of Montana’s growing climate and seasons. The 148 organic operations reporting organic production recorded $16.5 million in total value of sales during .\nPulse crop production in Montana continues to grow in importance as Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acreage comes back into production and producers switch to continuous cropping programs.\nAnd last, but definitely not least, Montana also produces honey. The value of Montana’s honey production in was $13.4 million. Producers reported 119,002 bee colonies in the state up 8 percent from 5 years ago.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Bees\n cattle\n Census of Agriculture\n Conservation\n Farmers\n Irrigation\n Montana\n NASS\n Producers\n wheat",

        "content": "USDA Economic Research Service in\n Research and Science\n Jun 10, \nBook cover: \"Rural Wealth Creation\" edited by John Pender, Bruce A. Weber, Thomas G. Johnson, J. Matthew Fannin \nThis post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nEconomic Research Service (ERS) economists may not wear trench coats and fedoras, but we are investigating significant developments affecting rural America.  In a new book, Rural Wealth Creation, which I co-edited with Bruce Weber, Tom Johnson, and Matt Fannin, we examined the role of wealth, which includes physical, financial, human, natural, social and other forms of assets, in achieving sustainable rural prosperity.\nStrong communities depend upon strong local and regional economies, and prosperous local and regional economies depend on the creation, retention, and distribution of wealth, broadly defined. Wealth contributes to people’s well-being in many ways beyond increasing income. For example, many forms of wealth can provide resilience in tough economic times or enhance the ability of rural people to pursue innovative new opportunities.\nRural communities across the United States lose wealth due to a variety of factors. For example, when people leave their communities to pursue opportunities in metropolitan regions, they take with them knowledge, skills, and labor resources that might have otherwise been reinvested in the rural setting. Research shows that creating and retaining wealth in rural areas is essential for achieving sustainable and broadly shared rural prosperity; one of USDA’s strategic goals. So how do communities retain and grow their wealth?\nWe don’t have all the answers yet, but we are working towards solutions. Creating and maintaining a broad portfolio of wealth may be central to sustainable rural prosperity. Physical infrastructure, natural amenities, and human and social capital can attract people and businesses to rural areas. As reported in Amber Waves, communities are developing wealth creation plans to match their own needs and resource requirements.\nUSDA administers wealth creation strategies such as providing small business loans and housing assistance and managing rural conservation programs to promote rural prosperity. Since wealth is an important gauge of rural economic well-being, understanding how wealth is changing and is distributed helps community leaders and federal policymakers manage and evaluate these programs and their alternatives. We still don’t fully understand how to achieve wealth creation or how to measure it in all rural contexts, but ERS researchers and their university-based colleagues are working to fill the information gaps.\nNo wealth creation strategy will work in every situation. Rural regions and communities benefit from being able to identify strategies best suited to their own means and priorities. Rural Wealth Creation proposes a new framework for measuring wealth and for understanding and classifying different rural wealth creation strategies, the factors affecting them, and their implications.\nRural Wealth Creation is an outgrowth of the National Conference on Rural Wealth Creation and Livelihoods, co-convened by ERS and the Ford Foundation, and supported financially by a grant from the National Institute for Food and Agriculture and by the Ford Foundation. The related ERS report, Rural Wealth Creation: Concepts, Strategies, and Measures, was released in March on the ERS website.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Amber Waves\n ERS\n NIFA\n Rural America\n rural communities\n Science Tuesday",

        "content": "Timothy Conner, Parag Chitnis, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in\n Research and Science\n Feb 25, \nSecretary Sonny Perdue launches the USDA Agriculture Innovation Agenda to align research and programs between the public and private sectors.\nNational Innovation Day was February 16th this year. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) directly contributes to America’s agriculture research and innovation, ultimately benefiting our farmers, ranchers, and foresters. Through an integrated approach of research, education, and Cooperative Extension (extension) – and strong collaboration with our grantees, partners, stakeholders, other Federal agencies, and Congress – NIFA ensures that groundbreaking discoveries in agriculture-related sciences and technologies reach the people who can put them into practice. Most of NIFA’s programs contribute to America’s agricultural research and innovation, including NIFA’s flagship competitive grants program, the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI), and the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant program.\nAFRI was created by the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of , and subsequently funded by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. NIFA provides AFRI grants to support research, education, and extension activities in six priority areas, originally established by the Farm Bill: 1.) Plant Health and Production and Plant Products; 2.) Animal Health and Production and Animal Products; 3.) Food Safety, Nutrition, and Health; 4.) Bioenergy, Natural resources, and Environment; 5.) Agriculture Systems and Technology; and 6.) Agriculture Economics and Rural Communities. AFRI-funded science is vital to meeting food, fiber, and fuel demands as the world’s population races to nearly 10 billion people by in the face of diminishing natural resources and increasingly variable climatic conditions.\nA few AFRI-funded projects to highlight are the International Wheat Yield Partnership coordinated agricultural projects (CAP) and its predecessor Triticeae CAP (T-CAP) that focused on improving wheat and barley for climate adaptation. Like many of NIFA’s CAPs, the wheat CAPs bridge the gap across the academic research, industry, and the farming communities to produce higher yielding crops and support sustainable farming. More than 100 commercial varieties developed through the wheat CAPs have a $1.8 billion production value. This work resulted in the TCAP team, led by the University of California, Davis, which utilized markers to identify the gene variants that control the most desirable of the plant’s traits, and which subsequently created the Triticeae Toolbox that provides this information to plant breeders so they can develop improved wheat and barley lines. Learn more on this NIFA Funding Accelerates Wheat & Barley Plant Breeding infographic.\nAnother AFRI funded innovation project led Iowa State University researchers to develop a sensor using nanotechnology that can detect organophosphates at levels 40 times smaller than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommendations. Organophosphates are certain classes of insecticides used on crops throughout the world to control insects. NIFA supports this research through a pair of AFRI grants totaling $573,000. More on this AFRI funded project explained by this New Nanosensor Detects Microscopic Contaminants in Water blog.\nThe SBIR program, established by the Small Business Innovation Research Act of , offers competitively awarded grants to qualified small businesses to support high quality research related to important scientific problems and opportunities in agriculture that could lead to significant public benefits. Administered by NIFA for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the program stimulates technological innovations in the private sector and strengthens the role of federal research, development, and translation of research and development in support of small businesses. The program has awarded over 2,000 research and development projects since .\nThrough SBIR funding, NECi Superior Enzymes (previously \"The Nitrate Elimination Company, Inc.) developed kits that allow farm managers to determine nitrate accumulation levels on their farms, which helps them manage nitrate concentration, reduce costly nitrogen fertilizer use, and reduce pollutants. This product is approved by the EPA as an alternative test method for nitrate testing under the Safe Water Drinking Act and the Clean Water Act, and is used as the standard test method within all U.S. Geological Survey soil labs. NECi Superior Enzymes is a woman-owned small business located in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.\nTo learn more about NIFA funded impacts, or success stories, that contribute to America’s agriculture research and innovation, visit this NIFA Impacts webpage.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n National Institute of Food and Agriculture\n NIFA\n USDA Science\n innovation\n Agriculture and Food Research Initiative\n Small Business Innovation Research\n Nanotechnology",

Farming is no longer the hard, manual labor venture of the past, but it’s a technical and managerial occupation. We started the New and Beginning Farmers Training Program at Florida A&M University Cooperative Extension Program (FAMU) to bring awareness to the fact that farming can be a viable, profitable business venture for new and beginning African-American entrants.\nIn , we received a grant from USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) through the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program (BFRDP).  BFRDP was established by the Farm Bill to offer education, outreach, mentoring and internships for beginning farmers and ranchers with 10 years of farming experience or less.  NIFA expects to begin accepting applications for the BFRDP in summer , with proposals due in the fall of .\nThe goal of our project is to use the basic business development model and apply it to agriculture operations; thus, tying business and marketing skills to agriculture, making it a seamless endeavor and increase the likelihood of economic profitability. Project emphasis is placed on new and beginning farmers who are less than 25 years of age and/or are African-American. The project takes three approaches to providing educational support and assistance for this vulnerable audience:\nA web-based training program, which is soon to be launched, provides self-directed training and assistance specifically for new and beginning farmers to help them access the resources based on their goals, skills and progress in beginning a farm operation.\nThe Young Farmer Entrepreneur Incubator targets new and beginning farmers under the age of 25, and is an intensive, hands-on approach working with small groups of young agricultural entrepreneurs to establish core business plans and practices that will enable them to start successful agricultural business ventures.\n The Beginning Farmer Demonstration Training Site provides hands-on training activities to demonstrate the viability of alternative market opportunities including institutions, retail, and direct-to-consumer outlets.\nWe saw much success in our first year with more than 40 training sessions conducted with new and beginning farmers in north Florida. These efforts enable participants to obtain real-world, hands-on experiences that will help them begin their own farming operations and contribute to the agricultural economy in north Florida.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program\n Florida\n Florida A&M University Cooperative Extension Program\n New and Beginning Farmers Training Program\n NIFA",

Here at the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), our inspectors and procurement specialists work hard to make sure that quality, domestically-produced foods are delivered to students and other recipients for our federal food purchasing programs. As students are getting used to their new schedules, we would like to highlight how our own little field trip shed some light on a typical day for some of our employees.\nA team of AMS employees recently traveled to Knouse Foods, a grower-owned cooperative that supplies apple and cranberry products for federal food purchasing programs. The employees saw first-hand how USDA inspectors help Knouse and other companies verify the quality of their products. As the apple sauce traveled through the facility, USDA inspectors pulled random samples to make sure that they met product quality and condition requirements. All USDA Foods are to be inspected, and in this case, inspectors pulled samples of apple sauce to evaluate traits like its color, flavor, and consistency. As an independent third-party, the inspections help suppliers meet USDA Foods requirements but they also can help them meet requirements from other buyers.\nThe tour also covered another important part of the procurement process – the delivery. In addition to the food inspection requirement, all contracts for federal food purchasing programs require delivery trucks to be inspected. The team got a chance to see this process, called check-loading. USDA inspectors checked the condition of the trailers, making sure that the trailer is clean, doesn’t contain any holes, and has updated inspection codes. \nFor the Commodity Procurement Program specialists, the trip gave them a chance to see how some of the contract provisions are carried out by both the suppliers and USDA inspectors.\nWhether it’s telling them about the procurement process or product specifications and requirements, the procurement specialists are always in constant contact with their vendors. The recent trip helped the specialists see how the vendors incorporate inspections and check-loading into their business plans. They saw how long it takes for trucks to be inspected and the impact it has on their deliveries.\nAll of us here at AMS are proud to play a role in supporting American ag businesses by ensuring that they can provide quality, wholesome foods to our students and other federal food purchase program recipients. We wish all of our students a successful school year. We encourage businesses to learn more about how our Specialty Crops Inspection Division and our Commodity Procurement Program can support their business.\n“Ensuring the product quality of our USDA Foods is extremely important,” said USDA Specialty Crops Inspection (SCI) Division employee Michael Harutinian. “Our employees pull random samples, helping our suppliers increase their confidence in the quality of their products,” said Harutinian. \n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n AMS\n Back to School\n Commodity Procurement Program\n Inspections\n Knouse Foods\n procurement\n quality\n SCI\n Specialty Crops Inspection Division\n USDA Foods",

        "content": "in\n Initiatives\n Rural\n Nov 09, \n Americans will soon come together on Veterans Day to honor our nation’s returned service members, including more than 22 million living American veterans.\nFor generations, American service members across every branch of our military have made tremendous sacrifices to defend our freedom and liberty.   This weekend, it’s important that all of us take time to remember their service.\nIn particular, earlier this year, President Obama honored our Vietnam-era veterans when he proclaimed a 13-year period – May 28, , through Nov. 11, – as the “Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War.”  This gives all of us a special opportunity to recognize these veterans, who too often were not properly thanked when they came home.\nToday, more than 6 million veterans live in our small towns and rural communities, a higher concentration than any other part of the country. That is not a surprise to me. Our veterans embody the values that stand at the heart of rural America: hard work, a love of their country, and a sense of duty to give back to a nation that has done so much for us all.\nI share the President’s belief that when our veterans return home, we don’t just owe them a debt of gratitude. We owe them a good job, secure housing, a quality education, and dependable health care. That’s why USDA has worked hard to ensure our veterans have tools to succeed.\nWe’ve stepped up hiring of veterans at USDA, and helped offer new work experiences to prepare veterans for the job market.  USDA has participated in a wide variety of veterans’ hiring efforts coordinated by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense.  And through the USDA Veterans Employment Program office, any veteran who contacts us has access to counseling, career help, and consideration for employment.\nWe’ve helped veterans learn more about opportunities in farming and ranching – providing support for organizations to train more than 40,000 new producers, including veterans.\nWe’ve invested in projects that bring more opportunity to rural veterans. Since USDA has supported more than 1,000 rural health clinics. We’ve supported more than 5,700 distance learning and telemedicine projects. We have made record loans and grants that help veterans start a farm, buy a home, or run a small business.\nAnd in February, USDA signed an historic memorandum of understanding with the American Legion. Working with the Legion at posts across the country, our aim is to help more rural veterans connect with employers, get a good job, and access useful information about USDA programs.\nOur efforts are just one piece in America’s shared responsibility to support our veterans. Together, we can be sure that after a veteran fights for America, they don’t have to fight for good opportunity when they come home. I encourage all Americans to join me in thanking our veterans, along with our active duty service members, as we recognize their service to our nation this Veterans Day.\nFor an audio version of this column, please click here. \n Category/Topic:\n Initiatives\n Rural\n Tags:\n DOD\n jobs\n President Obama\n Secretary's Column\n Tom Vilsack\n Veterans Day\n Veterans Employment Program",

The USDA-supported facility is scheduled for completion in August, with families moving in shortly thereafter. Vasquez was joined by Oregon Rural Development State Director  Vicki Walker.\nThe community of Madras in Central Oregon is surrounded by numerous farming and ranching operations that provide fresh foods and products for regional markets. Many of these operations, including irrigated seed crops, potatoes and mint as well as the numerous hay and livestock operations, can be labor intensive, and rely on an infusion of farm workers.

(USDA photo by Debbie Smoot).\nI recently had the pleasure of visiting North Beach Elementary School in Miami to recognize 177 schools in the Miami-Dade County Public Schools District for their efforts to promote good nutrition and physical activity to their students. All 177 schools achieved Bronze Awards in the HealthierUS School Challenge (HUSSC). Miami-Dade now has the honor of having the second largest number of HUSSC awards in any one school district in the entire nation.\nHUSSC is a key part of the First Lady’s Let’s Move! initiative to end childhood obesity in a generation. The Challenge is a voluntary commitment to meet USDA’s rigorous standards for physical activity, nutritious meals and nutrition education. Schools such as the ones in Miami-Dade that meet the requirements should be very proud of their achievement.\nWhile at North Beach Elementary, I had the honor of serving lunch to the students, alongside Alberto Carvalho, Miami-Dade County Public School District Superintendent. It’s very rewarding to me to see the children enthusiastically select an abundance of fruits and vegetables. Several told me that they liked eating healthy foods. Their enthusiasm was pretty infectious.  I was also impressed with the students who formed a student wellness council to support their peers in making healthier choices.\nUS Kevin Concannon and Miami-Dade County School Superintendent Alberto Carvalho serve lunch to students from North Beach Elementary School, Miami, FL, on August 23, . (USDA photo by Debbie Smoot).\nThese kinds of activities should help schools in the county quickly adjust to the new meal standards that go into effect this fall. USDA has made major improvements to school meals and those changes are already showing up in school cafeterias.  The improvements were made possible by provisions in the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act which gave us the ability to bring school meals in line with the Dietary for Americans.\nThis is an exciting time because schools play such a critical role in the lives of our children and can be instrumental in helping kids develop healthy habits. Many students eat two meals a day at school, making the quality of these meals all the more important.  It’s vital that we provide our youngsters with healthy food choices that enable them to learn, grow, and thrive.\nImprovements to school meals add up to a substantial investment in the future of our children—and our nation.  That’s why I’m proud of the role USDA has in making the school day healthier. And I’m also proud of Miami-Dade County Public Schools for going the extra mile for the sake of their students.\nFor more information on how USDA is supporting schools in implementing the new standards—and how you can pitch in—please visit our Healthier School Day web site.\nUS Kevin Concannon presents a certificate of appreciation to Miami-Dade County School Superintendent Alberto Carvalho at North Beach Elementary School, Miami, FL, on August 23, .

This program, started at the Oregon City Farmers Market, invites children to learn more about some of their favorite foods. Participating in events like planting sunflower seeds or making jam gives the youngsters a chance to better understand where their food comes from. By receiving $2 to spend on fresh produce every time they visit the market to keeping a log of what they buy, the children become immersed in a world of healthy eating.  Last year, 1,781 children aged 5 to 12 years old joined, resulting in 5,180 shopping trips.\n Luanne Lohr, AMS Transportation and Marketing Program Associate Deputy Administrator\n Posted in\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Initiatives\n Aug 08, \n 1 Response",

Pero, cuando se acerca el día del Super Bowl, la saco y empiezo a cocinar chili con carne, albóndigas u otras comidas calientes de fiesta. Lo que me más gusta de mi olla es que puede cocinar los alimentos inocuamente y a la misma vez me permite ahorrar tiempo cuando me ocupo preparándome para el gran juego.\nDurante esta época del año, La Línea de Carnes y Aves del USDA recibe muchas preguntas acerca de las ollas de cocción lenta. A veces escuchamos historias de errores espantosos que cometen personas cuando están preparando alimentos por cocción lenta. Para asegurar que usted y sus invitados estén fuera del riesgo de intoxicación de alimentos, aquí tienen algunas preguntas comunes con las respuestas correspondientes.\nPuse la carne dentro de mi olla de cocción lenta pero se me olvidó prenderla. Estuvo apagada por seis horas antes de que lo noté. ¿Si cocino la carne, matará la bacteria y va a esto hacer que sea inocua?\nDesafortunadamente, la carne no es inocua aun si usted lo cocina. Alimentos perecederos almacenados en la zona de peligro (las temperaturas entre 40 °F y 140 °F) por más de dos horas se deben tirar a la basura aunque no tenga indicaciones por olor o vista de que se echaron a perder.\nDespués de que cociné chili con carne en mi olla, lo almacené en un tazón grande y lo puse en el refrigerador para enfriarlo durante la noche. Cuando lo comprobé esta mañana, noté que todavía estaba tibio en el centro. ¿Es ello inocuo?\nEsta persona quien llamó estuvo muy decepcionada en cuanto vio que el chili con carne ya no era inocuo. Si usted hace una olla grande de sopa, chili o guisado, almacénalo en contenedores playos que permiten al alimento enfriarse rápidamente en la nevera. Siempre refrigere el alimento cocinado dentro de dos horas después de que la cocción sea terminada. No deje que se enfríe en el contador.\n¿Es inocuo recalentar alimentos como el cerdo a la barbacoa en la olla de cocción lenta?\nNo se recomienda recalentar los sobres en una olla de cocción lenta. En cambio, aconsejamos a personas que nos llamen a que recalienten alimentos hasta cocer al vapor en la cumbre de estufa o en un horno de microondas. Entonces, puede ponerlo en una olla de cocción lenta precalentada para guardarlo y servirlo caliente. Use un termómetro de alimento para asegurar que la comida permanezca a temperaturas más altas que 140 ° F.\nPor lo general, yo pongo las albóndigas congeladas directamente en mi olla de cocción lenta para empezar cocinándolas  pero mi mejor amigo dice que mi método no es inocuo. ¿Quién tiene la razón?\nEstas de suerte tener un amigo tan listo quien sabe cómo manejar los alimentos inocuamente. Su amigo tiene la razón. Todos los ingredientes los cuales se ponen en la olla de cocción lenta deben ser descongelados primero. Almacene comidas descongeladas y otros alimentos perecederos en la nevera hasta que esté listo para empezar a cocinar.\nSi le queda cualquier incertidumbre sobre el uso de la olla de cocción lenta, visite a la representante virtual, Pregúntele a Karen.

If salmon are thriving in a river or stream, the surrounding land is typically considered by scientists to be productive and healthy.\nThat’s why the nonprofit Salmon-Safe was established in Oregon in . Salmon-Safe works with landowners, farmers and local conservation organizations in Washington, Oregon, California and British Columbia to promote conservation practices and habitat restoration. Over 65,000 acres of farmland have been deemed “salmon safe.”\n“Salmon safe” farm operations adopt conservation practices that protect water quality and help restore wildlife habitat in salmon watersheds. These practices include efficient water use, integrated pest management (IPM) and soil conservation.\nSalmon-Safe is a third-party certification program that utilizes professional inspectors with experience in both habitat conservation and sustainable agriculture. The Salmon-Safe label provides credibility, visibility and marketing opportunities for participating farms\nIn , the Washington Water Project of Trout Unlimited (TU-WWP) received a Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) from NRCS to expand Salmon-Safe certification into eastern Washington. CIG-funded projects use innovative technologies and approaches to address natural resources issues.\nMichael Simon, of Applecart Fruit, inspects his crop for quality and potential pests in Tonasket, WA.\nWith the grant, 15 farms transitioned over 6,000 acres to Salmon-Safe management practices.  On these farms, Salmon-Safe has worked to eliminate or reduce the use of pesticides and implement other water quality practices, such as fencing, to keep pollutants out of the river. In exchange, these farms have earned the use of the Salmon-Safe label and are able to tap into the existing comprehensive marketing campaign in western Washington.\nDue to the huge success of the first year of Salmon-Safe implementation in eastern Washington, In , TU-WWP received another CIG. This will allow the program to continue its momentum and multiply certification throughout a broader region—helping to ensure that salmon will continue to thrive in northwest watersheds and beyond.\nFind out more about Conservation Innovation Grants\nCheck out more conservation stories on the USDA blog\nFollow NRCS on Twitter\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Conservation\n Conservation Innovation Grants Program\n NRCS\n Washington",

Agronomist Edgar E. Hartwig has devoted half a century to soybeans research, developing productive plants with built-in resistance to insects, nematodes, and diseases. He is best known for commercial varieties that include Bragg, Lee, Forrest, Lamar, Sharkey, and most recently, Vernal. (USDA ARS photo by Keith Weller.)\nSeeing President Obama’s fiscal year budget proposal and the strong commitment it makes to agricultural research reminds me of Dr. Consuelo De Moraes.\nAs a university researcher and panel manager of the National Research Initiative (NRI) competitive grants program, I called Dr. De Moraes in to inform her that USDA was going to fund her research proposal on determining how plants defend themselves against insects, so farmers could exploit the same as a means to control pests. She screamed with happiness. Later I learned that people heard the scream throughout the building at Pennsylvania State University. After that, Dr. De Moraes went on to great acclaim as one of the leading insect researchers.\nIn , only 24 percent of the proposals submitted to the NRI program were funded. Today, the funding rate for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI), which replaced the NRI program, that number has dipped to barely 10 percent.\nIndeed, during , NIFA received 3,875 proposals for funding by the AFRI program, of which 1,640 were recommended for funding, and, unfortunately, NIFA could only fund 390 proposals with the resources available.\nIn this highly competitive environment, many talented scientists and researchers are unable to get funding and, as a result, are leaving agricultural sciences at a time when the need for their innovation is greatest or taking their expertise to other countries that are more supportive of public sector research. A growing population, climate change, diminishing land and water resources, and the need to ensure food security are becoming ever more urgent. Funding shortfalls become even more daunting when one considers the urgency of new and invasive species of pests, antimicrobial resistance, pollinator health, sustainability, poor public health and nutritional outcomes, and the need for innovations for advanced manufacturing and economic enterprises. Funding research to respond to these challenges should be considered as an investment in our Nation’s future, an investment that will pay big dividends in the years to come.\nUSDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, or NIFA, and its flagship competitive grants program, AFRI, were created as part of the Farm Bill. At that time, AFRI was authorized by Congress to be funded at $700 million per year.\nSince its authorization, Congressional appropriations for AFRI have gone as high as $350 million for this fiscal year. While every increase during the last few years has been helpful and has catalyzed many more Dr. De Moraeses to make transformative discoveries, there is so much more untapped potential waiting to be discovered and used.\nHere are a few recent examples of outcomes resulting from research investments in the AFRI program: new ways to deal with the influenza virus in pigs; increased milk production with fewer resources; innovative and effective ways to manage pests; innovations in irrigation technologies resulting in water savings and improved  nitrogen use efficiency; significant boosts in wheat, corn, and beef cattle productivity despite droughts and increasing temperatures; increased profitability of farmers and livestock producers; conversion of biomass into fuel for commercial and military jets; stronger biomaterials from woody and other biomass; development of new sensors to detect and to deal with pathogens of food safety importance without relying on antibiotics; protection of pollinators; significant improvement in children’s nutritional health; and last, but not least, new economic enterprises and jobs.\nImagine the many, many more discoveries, innovations, and solutions that could be catalyzed if AFRI is funded at its full authorized level?\nMany, recognizing that our nation’s food security is tied directly to our national security, have called with urgency to increase this funding: the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, members of Congress, the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, farm groups, commodity organizations, Nobel Laureates and other scientists, universities, and young people engaged in 4-H and FFA.\nThat is why I applaud the President’s request for $700 million for AFRI in his Budget. The AFRI budget proposal includes $375 million provided in the discretionary request, and a legislative action to make available $325 million in mandatory funding as part of a government-wide investment in research and development.\nMy colleagues and I look forward to working with Congress so that our best and brightest scientists can find solutions to our most pressing societal and global challenges.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n agricultural research\n Agriculture and Food Research Initiative\n Farm Bill\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n NIFA\n President Obama\n Research\n White House",

Usually the only sign you see of them is their burrows or ravaged foliage.\nBut recently a Mobile, Ala., tortoise allowed Marshall Colburn, a Soil Conservation Technician with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), a rare, up-close-and-personal moment as she laid her eggs in a freshly cultivated field.\n“I was on a landowner’s property doing a site assessment for the Working Lands for Wildlife program, when I observed a gopher tortoise laying eggs,” Colburn says. “She had dug a nest about 20 yards away from her burrow in soft soil where the landowner had planted chufas [a type of nut-grass typically planted for wildlife] the day before. I was able to stand and take photos about two feet from the apron of the nest…It was pretty cool!”\nThe gopher tortoise is known as a keystone species in the longleaf pine ecosystem of the Southeast because it digs burrows that provide shelter and habitat for many other animal species.  It is also considered an indicator of longleaf pine ecosystem health. Gopher tortoises contribute to biological diversity by dispersing seeds found in the fruits and berries they eat.\nUnfortunately, as the once–vast longleaf forests disappear, so does the gopher tortoise’s habitat. The population has been reduced to the extent that the tortoise is listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act throughout the western part of its range.\nWorking Lands for Wildlife is a partnership between NRCS and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that offers landowners voluntary, incentive-based conservation assistance to restore habitat for seven targeted wildlife species in decline in 36 states, including the gopher tortoise in Alabama.\nIt is hoped that through the success of the Working Lands for Wildlife program, gopher tortoise habitat will improve to allow many tortoises to lay their eggs—whether a conservationist is watching or not.\nFind out more about Working Lands for Wildlife.\nCheck out more conservation stories on the USDA blog.\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Alabama\n Conservation\n mobile\n NRCS\n U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\n Working Lands for Wildlife",

But before I tell you what makes it new, I want to invite you to join us live at 3pm EDT to hear about it directly from me, from the White House, and from some of the many people whose stories are featured in the Compass guide and map.\nAt 3pm EDT, join us on a Google + Hangout broadcast at whitehouse.gov/live and on the White House Google + page. When you join, you’ll hear from women around the country who are working to build strong regional food systems. Theirs are just some of the many stories that we profile in the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass.\nToday’s updates include new case studies on the Compass website and, perhaps most exciting, an improved map. The original version of the map showed USDA-supported projects related to local and regional food systems around the country. To that , we have added additional projects. We’ve also added our databases of farmers markets, food hubs, meat processing facilities inspected by USDA, GreenSchools! school garden projects supported by the Forest Service, and state-level numbers on the use of nutrition program benefits like SNAP (food stamps) at farmers markets. As before, all of the is downloadable.\nYou can now search the map by keyword or zip code radius to focus in on the issues that are most interesting to you. Are you working to develop a farm to school initiative? Click on the search tab, select “KYF projects,” and enter “farm to school” in the search box. You will see a list of projects that have received USDA support over the last few years. Clicking on a project will take you to their spot on the map, where you can read more about what they’re doing, which USDA program they applied to for funding, and how to find their contact information.\nAs I’ve explored the many stories in the Compass and on the map, I have noticed that women are playing a prominent role in many aspects of regional food systems. The number of women running farms in the U.S. has gone up by 30 percent since ; a full third of farm operators today are women, and many of them are engaged in regional sales. Women are also creating small food businesses, solving the challenge of getting local food into schools, buying local food for their children, and working with their communities to increase local, healthy food in people’s diets.\nWith that backdrop, today’s event highlights women leaders who are making a difference in local and regional foods. This issue is also an important component of the Obama Administration’s jobs agenda; regional food systems are helping drive job creation in many communities around the country. The White House is partnering with us on this event.\nThe women you will meet through the Google+ Hangout are innovative local food leaders in their communities. They include Cory Carman, a 4th-generation farmer in eastern Oregon; Chris Kirby, director of Oklahoma’s Farm to School initiative; Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Mayor of Baltimore City and co-chair of the U.S. Conference of Mayors Food Policy Council; Valerie Segrest of the Muckleshoot Tribe and the Muckleshoot Food Sovereignty Project in Washington State; Pam Roy of Farm to Table and the New Mexico Food and Agriculture Policy Council; and Sue Noble of the Vernon Economic Development Association in Wisconsin.  These women will inspire you to use the Compass, dive into the map and use local food to make your community stronger.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n Jon Carson\n Kathleen Merrigan\n KYF2\n KYF2 Compass\n White House",

Photo: Jennifer Cole.\n“Nothing motivates me quite like being told I can’t do something. They told me no-till doesn’t work here, and you’re not supposed to be able to grow any type of canola. Well, look around. Here we are.”\nWhen Douglas Poole speaks, you can hear the passion in his voice for healthy soil and how it has helped his farm. Poole wasn’t always a soil health proponent; he used to be an accountant.\nPoole is a dryland farmer of winter wheat in Mansfield, one of the driest parts of Washington State. The area receives seven to nine inches of rain per year, and with so little water, Poole needed to find a system more efficient than conventional farming for his crops to flourish.  He decided no-till was the way to go.\n“In the beginning, it was more of an opportunity to see if I could save labor, overhead and everything else. The more I researched it, the more I saw that it wasn’t so much no-till as it was soil. That was really the driver,” said Poole.\nBut support for no-till in Poole’s community was lacking.\nIn the future, Poole’s vision is for his land to be completely covered at all times. Currently his land is roughly two-thirds of that. He plans to have no fallow land within ten years. Photo: Jennifer Cole.\nTo get started with no-till and other soil health practices, Poole went to USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). In , he was awarded one of the first Energy Initiative contracts through NRCS’ Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). This contract allowed him to partially convert his operation to no-till, implement cover crops and crop rotations. He was able to convert the remainder of his farm to no-till practices through the EQIP Air Quality Initiative in .\nPoole has implemented no-till practices, and now has crop rotations including canola, sunflowers and spring crops.\n“To me it’s all related – no-till needs cover crops and cover crops need no-till.”\nHowever, it’s still a conservation practice combination that many conventional growers are hesitant to try, especially in 10-inch precipitation zones.\nPoole’s soil health approach isn’t faith-based. He’s constantly researching soil health practices that improve his soil, and he has participated in several cover crop studies with his local conservation district, as well as some of his own.\nPoole recently decided to let his last cover crop grow throughout the year, rather than terminating it.\n“We found that if we could have that diversity of root growth in soil, we could actually gain moisture. Almost like we are farming moisture. And obviously, that enhances the soil.”\nIn the future, Poole’s vision is for his land to be completely covered at all times. Currently his land is roughly two-thirds of that. He plans to have no fallow land within ten years.\n“I can’t even imagine being a conventional farmer and looking to the future. I feel like those of us that have made the conversion have a future.”\nHe’s an evangelist who saved his own soil. Now he wants to help others save others’.\nTo learn about the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and how NRCS can help you install conservation practices on your land, including information on soil health and conservation assistance, contact your local USDA service center or learn how to get started with NRCS online.\nPoole needed to find a system more efficient than conventional farming for his crops to flourish.

        "content": "USDA Office of Communications and Charlie Anderson, Senior Adviser to the Director of the National Economic Council in\n USDA Results\n Dec 14, \n Cross-posted from the White House blog:\nToday, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is taking some major steps forward to protect farmers – including swine, beef cattle, and especially poultry growers – from unfair treatment by the often much larger processors who purchase their fully grown hogs, cattle, and chickens. These three rules are another step forward in response to the President’s Competition Initiative announced in April, which has the goal of enhancing competition to help consumers, workers, and small businesses get a fair shake in the economy.\nWhat’s the problem being addressed?\nThe poultry, pork, and beef industries include growers who raise chickens, turkeys, hogs, and cattle, and processors who buy the full-grown animals from the growers, package up the meat, and ship it to your local butcher, supermarket, or restaurant. In recent years, similar to what has been occurring across a number of other industries, processing has become increasingly concentrated, with fewer companies controlling a larger share of the market. This has inhibited farmers’ ability to get a fair deal from the processors.\nFor example, the four largest poultry processors control 51 percent of the broiler market and 57 percent of the turkey market.  In part due to this concentration, poultry growers often have limited options for processors available in their local communities: 52 percent of growers have only one or two processors in their state or region to whom they can sell.  That means processors can often wield market power over the growers, treating them unfairly, suppressing how much they are paid, or pitting them against each other.\nFor example, if a chicken grower attempts to organize other chicken growers to bargain for better pay or publicly expresses unhappiness with the way they are treated by a processor, they can suffer retaliation. Processors can require growers to make investments that are not economically justifiable for the grower or can terminate contracts with little notice. In contract growing (which has governed an increasing share of the market in recent years), the processors own the birds and provide inputs like feed, so they can choose to provide poultry growers with bad feed or sickly birds that have a higher mortality rate, which cuts deeply into a grower’s opportunity to earn income on those birds. Without much of a choice for where to sell their birds, poultry growers often have to either put up with the unfair behavior, take a pay cut, or take their case to court.\nWhat do the rules do?\nUSDA is releasing three rules – collectively known as the Farmer Fair Practices Rules – to empower farmers so they get fair treatment by the processors or get their day in court:\n Rule – the “scope” rule – means that poultry growers will no longer have to meet an impossibly high standard to get compensated when they are treated unfairly. The interim final “scope” rule makes clear to the courts – as has long been USDA’s interpretation – that farmers don’t have to demonstrate that an unfair practice by processors harms the entire industry in order to prove a violation of the Packers and Stockyards Act. This impossibly high standard had previously put small farmers at a disadvantage for decades when pursuing their rights under the law. With this new rule in place, if a farmer is being treated unfairly, they’ll now have their day in court and be able to win.\n Rule enumerates some of the specific unfair practices that violate the law. To make the rules more clear for processors and growers alike – and to help courts understand where to draw the line – the second rule being proposed today clearly outlines unfair practices for which growers can receive compensation. These practices include inaccurate or false weighing of birds, the abuse of arbitration procedures, the abrupt suspension of delivery of birds to a grower or termination of a contract without an opportunity for the farmer to get back into compliance. All of these types of activities would qualify as an unfair practice that would be compensated through a court proceeding. Processors can only treat growers differently if they have a legitimate business justification, not for arbitrary reasons. This protection is especially important to poultry growers who today often find it difficult to win in court even when they are treated unfairly.\n Rule reforms the poultry growing tournament system to make it more of a level playing field and avoid processors aiding and disadvantaging certain growers relative to others. Many poultry growers through the contract system are paid out based on a tournament how they perform against their peers; the bigger and better their birds turn out relative to other growers, the more money they make. However, because the processors own the birds, the feed, and other inputs, they can unfairly disadvantage or preference one grower over another as a way of forcing the growers to do things against their will or shut down dissent. The third rule, also proposed, will establish criteria to judge whether the processor is operating the ranking system in a manner that is fair to all growers. It will push back against the unequal bargaining power between poultry purchasers and poultry growers.\nThese rules respond to the directive USDA was given in the farm bill but were only allowed to move forward with implementing this year, once an unnecessary and harmful rider that had been in place for years was defeated in this year’s appropriations bill. By continuing to move forward with finalizing these rules, USDA will make important progress in ensuring that farmers get a fair shake and can push back on inappropriate and unfair treatment by the processors. These are a meaningful step forward to make sure that rural Americans are getting paid what they deserve for supplying the high-quality chickens, turkeys, hogs, and beef that Americans enjoy around their dinner tables and at their local restaurants every single day.\nFor more information, you can read the Frequently Asked Questions and the three rules on the USDA website.\n Category/Topic:\n USDA Results\n Tags:\n Farm Bill\n Farmers\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n GIPSA\n Poultry\n White House",

As the Administrator for USDA Rural Housing Service, listening to the voices of people in small communities and making their vision become a reality is something I strive to achieve.\nI recently took a trip to Higginsville, Missouri to join Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, Representative for Missouri's 5th District, as well as our Missouri State Director for USDA Rural Development, Janie Dunning and her excellent staff as we discussed the possibility of growth in workforce housing with several community, economic and housing development representatives in Central Missouri.\nAs part of his effort to maintain and expand rural housing opportunities across the state, Congressman Cleaver initiated this roundtable meeting to establish a conversation between a few community leaders he had in mind who would take action to develop a plan. By taking this important first step, the Congressman focused on bringing awareness to the problems at hand and identifying solutions.\nThis roundtable discussion put rural housing options to the forefront as we shared each community’s needs and what had to be done for the advancement in their areas. Knowing the infrastructure issues at hand, we deliberated the idea of collaborating with local home developers and organizations to get the gears running and make this goal of housing development happen.\nAfter gathering with the economic development representatives, we met with local lenders and realtors to not only share thoughts on future housing efforts, but to also recognize them for their tremendous contributions to housing in the region. These valuable relationships with lenders, realtors, business leaders and organizations give countless people places to call home.\nI feel quite honored to be part of Congressman Cleaver’s plan of meeting the rural development needs in Central Missouri. The establishment of workforce housing in this region will generate more options for growth and economic advancement. Moving forward, the Congressman’s efforts are resulting in further meetings on workforce housing development and USDA Rural Development will continue to be involved with this initiative.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Housing\n Missouri\n RD\n Rural Housing\n Rural Housing Service\n Tony Hernandez",

        "content": "New Fund, Established as Part of White House Rural Council's \"Made in Rural America\" Export and Investment Initiative, Now Allows USDA to Facilitate Private Equity Investments in Agriculture-related Businesses\n Release & Contact Info\n Press Release\n Release No. .14\n Contact:Office of Communications 720-\n Cedar Rapids, Iowa, April 21, – As part of the Obama Administration's new \"Made in Rural America\" export and investment initiative, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced the creation of a new investment fund that will help propel the growth of small businesses across rural America. The new Rural Business Investment Company (RBIC) will now allow USDA to facilitate private equity investments in agriculture-related businesses. Currently, USDA programs exist to help provide loans or loan guarantees to help rural businesses grow, but many small cutting-edge businesses also need equity support in addition to or instead of borrowed funds.Advantage Capital Partners, which will manage the new fund, and their partners from eight Farm Credit institutions have pledged to invest nearly $150 million into the new effort.\"This new fund will allow innovative small businesses throughout rural America to access the capital they need to grow and create jobs,\" Vilsack said. \"One of USDA's top priorities is to help reenergize the rural economy, and we now have a powerful new tool available to help achieve that goal. This new partnership will allow us to facilitate private investment in businesses working in bio-manufacturing, advanced energy production, local and regional food systems, improved farming technologies and other cutting-edge fields.\"The fund is being formed under the USDA's Rural Business Investment Program (RBIP). USDA utilizes RBIP to license funds to invest in enterprises that will create growth and job opportunities in rural areas, with an emphasis on smaller enterprises. Working through the USDA program enables licensed funds to raise capital from Farm Credit System banks and associations.The Farm Credit System, a nationwide network of banks and lending associations specifically chartered to serve agriculture and the U.S. rural economy, is an essential provider of credit to agriculture and rural America. This new partnership between Farm Credit institutions and Advantage Capital, a leading growth capital and small business finance firm, brings together resources and people that are focused on providing more private capital, small business investment and quality jobs to rural America. This public-private partnership will have a tangible positive impact on our rural economy and is a model of how government can serve as a catalyst for private investment in rural America.Eight Farm Credit institutions providing initial investments in the RBIC fund are: AgStar Financial Services (Mankato, Minn.); AgriBank (St. Paul, Minn.); Capital Farm Credit (Bryan, Texas); CoBank (Denver, Colo.); Farm Credit Bank of Texas (Austin, Texas); Farm Credit Services of America (Omaha, Neb.); Farm Credit Mid-America (Louisville, Ky.); and United Farm Credit Service (Willmar, Minn.).USDA also announced that it will be accepting applications for other new Rural Business Investment Companies such as the one announced today. Interested applicants have until July 29th to submit their applications for review in FY. Any application accepted after this deadline will be held for consideration next year. USDA intends to accept RBIC applications through , detailed information including application materials and instructions can be found at: addition, Secretary Vilsack said that the White House Rural Council, as part of the Made in Rural America initiative, will convene the Rural Opportunity Investment Conference later this year to attract additional investments to rural America by connecting major investors with rural business leaders, government officials, economic development experts and other partners. This conference will promote opportunities to invest in rural America by highlighting successful projects in energy, biofuels and bioproducts, infrastructure, transportation, water systems, telecommunications, health care, manufacturing, and local and regional food systems. To learn more about the conference, visit www.usda.gov/investmentconference.About the White House Rural CouncilTo address challenges in Rural America, build on the Administration's rural economic strategy, and improve the implementation of that strategy, the President signed an Executive Order establishing the White House Rural Council. The Council coordinates the Administration's efforts in rural America by streamlining and improving the effectiveness of federal programs serving rural America; engage stakeholders, including farmers, ranchers, and local citizens, on issues and solutions in rural communities; and promoting and coordinating private-sector partnerships. With the signing of the Farm Bill in early February, President Obama directed the Council to lead a new \"Made in Rural America\" export and investment initiative, charged with bringing together Federal resources to help rural businesses and leaders take advantage of new investment opportunities and access new customers and markets abroad. The work of the White House Rural Council and USDA to bring investment to rural America is an example of how the Administration is creating smart partnerships with the private sector to better support Americans in all parts of the country.About USDA's Rural Business Investment Program (RBIP)The Rural Business Investment Program promotes economic development in mostly rural areas by helping to meet the equity capital investment needs of smaller enterprises in such areas. USDA licenses newly formed for-profit investment fund entities as Rural Business Investment Companies (RBICs). RBICs use the equity raised in capitalizing their fund to make equity and equity-like investments mostly in smaller enterprises located primarily in rural areas.About the Farm Credit SystemFor nearly a century, Farm Credit has been a national provider of credit and related services to rural America through its cooperative network of customer-owned lending institutions. Farm Credit provides more than $200 billion in loans and leases to farmers, ranchers, rural homeowners, aquatic producers, timber harvesters, agribusinesses, and agricultural and rural utility cooperatives. For more information about the Farm Credit System, please visit www.farmcreditnetwork.com.About Advantage Capital Partners Advantage Capital Partners is a growth capital and small business finance firm focused on providing growth capital and other investments supporting state and local economic development efforts.

The trunk of the oak tree behind has an approximate age of 350 years. \nSeventy-five years ago, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Soil Conservation Service, now the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), was established largely because of the efforts of one determined individual—Hugh Hammond Bennett. Bennett served as the agency’s first chief for more than 15 years, tirelessly working to educate others about the seriousness of soil erosion. On Friday, October 15, nearly 20 NRCS employees and friends took time off from work and to be Earth Team volunteers, planting oak seedlings, azaleas and phlox in Hugh Hammond Bennett’s memory at his former home.\nWhile chief of NRCS, Bennett lived in McLean, Virginia, on a two-acre tract of land called “Eight Oaks” after a prominent feature of the property. His landscape also boasted magnificent flocks of rose-colored azaleas and phlox. In the years since, the landscape had changed quite a bit. For example, until Friday, only two oaks remained on the property.\nIn celebration of NRCS’ 75th anniversary, several NRCS employees initiated a project to honor the man who started it all by restoring his former home’s landscape to its former glory. Andree DuVarney, a special assistant to the chief, lives in Bennett’s former neighborhood. She learned from the current owners that a conservation easement had been placed on the property to protect it from development and that the owners welcomed the idea of a restoration project.\nA team consisting of DuVarney, Management Analyst Denise Decker, National Landscape Architect Bob Snieckus and National Plants Materials Center Manager Jeremy West brought this project to fruition. Together, they developed an impressive landscape plan to restore key elements of the landscape that existed when Bennett lived there.\nA key part of the restoration plan was for the property to once again showcase eight beautiful white, willow and scarlet oak trees. After the volunteer team had planted the other five new oaks, NRCS Chief Dave White and property co-owner Brian Symmes planted the last oak seedling together as the other volunteers observed. With that final step, the living tribute to Bennett was complete.\nGet more information on both NRCS’ 75th anniversary and Hugh Hammond Bennett here.\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\nCheck out other conservation stories on the USDA blog.\nHoward Hankin, Agricultural Economist (left), Margaret Spinelli (center), and Lyn Gillespie (right), National Construction Engineer, Natural Resources Conservation Service prune ivy away from trees at “Eight Oaks” the home of Dr. Hugh Hammond Bennett the first Chief of the Natural Resources Conservation Service then the Soil Erosion Service at Dr. Bennett’s home in McLean, Virginia on Friday, October 15, as part of the celebration for the 75th Anniversary of the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

AMS has been tracking and gathering datasets for grain transportation for over a decade. Photo by Sparktography.\nThe United States proudly touts a long history of grain production and is the top exporter of grain in the world. Half of our wheat, almost 40 percent of soybeans and almost a fifth of our corn are exported.  That’s why for over a decade the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service has been tracking and gathering datasets for grain transportation, including prices, deliveries, movements, sales and freight rates, and now, for the first time, we’ve released our historic in an excel  format.\nBecause grains are not only the cornerstone of the world’s food supply but also of global agricultural commodity exchanges, there is inherent value in being able to look at a decade’s worth of grain transportation . With this information, researchers should be able to identify trends more easily, as well as make projections based on observable or emerging patterns.\nAs part of USDA’s commitment to transparency and open government, the new dataset is available through .gov. Through the website, users can formulate, structure, and analyze raw figures to suit their unique needs. The agricultural industry can explore opportunities in the market armed with more information than ever before.\nThe Transportation and Marketing Program within AMS will continue to add to the raw set every week, building on the information to keep it up to date and accurate. It’s all a part of the weekly Grain Transportation Report the agency issues every Thursday. The Grain Transportation Report details grain transportation information, including costs of shipping grain commodities, top destinations for U.S. grain exports, topical events affecting transport, and current trends in the business.\nWe invite all stakeholders within the grain industry to take a look. Growers, shippers, distributors, and exporters will find the most immediate value in the information. However, we also anticipate that economists, statisticians, researchers, and others will find value in the raw .

As the demand for local food continues to increase, farmers markets are maturing from small stands to entertainment destinations with extended hours, live music, and a variety of local products.\nFor 20 years, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has managed the daytime USDA Farmers Market, open from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. every Friday from May through October.  This year, in addition to the daytime market, AMS staff is testing the concept of a night market from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. on the third Friday of the month (May 15, June 19, July 17, August 21, September 18, and October 16).  Each “USDA Farmers Market at Night” will feature different vendors than those at the day market as well as a different live band and educational exhibits.\nOn July 17, in keeping with the “Hot & Cold” theme, the musical act DC Choro, a Brazilian band, will heat things up by playing the best of Samba, Bossa Nova, Forro, and Choro.  Participating food trucks include Carolina Q, Dirty South Deli, Fava Pot, Greatest American Hot Dogs, Randy Radish, and Sang on Wheels. More than 10 members of Union Kitchen, a DC-based food incubator, and other local food businesses will offer delicious dinner options along with fresh fruits and vegetables, cut flowers, breads and baked goods, cheeses, and specialty items -- all perfect for an evening picnic on the National Mall.    \nJuly is the peak season for blueberries in North America and National Blueberry Month.  The U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council will be at this month’s night market to celebrate the 100th birthday of the blueberry and its journey from farm to table.  Elizabeth White, the daughter of a New Jersey farmer, teamed up with USDA botanist Frederick Coville to identify wild blueberry plants with the most desirable properties and crossbred these bushes to create new blueberry varieties. They harvested and sold the first commercial crop of blueberries out of Whitesbog, N.J., in .\nTo celebrate this achievement night market vendor Ruby Scoops will give away 100 cones of blueberry honey cheesecake ice cream. Another vendor, Spoil Me Rotten, will have frozen blueberry dog treats for sale.\nWhile the warmer weather may be ideal for outdoor picnics and barbeques, the summer months typically see a spike in of foodborne illnesses.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA's rich science and research portfolio.  \nIn , as a junior at Montana State University (MSU), Ashley Williams knew she wanted to use her geography degree to make a difference internationally. She had no idea that agriculture would ever play a role in making that dream come true.\nBut that’s what happened when Williams found herself in a small farming village of 1,000 people in Sanambele, Mali, after a chance encounter with MSU entomology professor Florence Dunkel.\n“Agriculture? I never even considered it. Now I work as a Forest Service hydrologist and collaborate with farmers on stream restoration projects to protect the environment,” Williams said.\nDunkel was the recipient of a USDA Higher Education Challenge Grant from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. She used the grant money to give her students experiential learning opportunities that would prepare them to enter the agricultural science workforce.\n“The Challenge Grant unbound my students from the narrow definitions of agricultural education,” Dunkel said.\nFrom early research efforts, Williams learned that diarrhea, mainly from poor water quality, was a major contributor to childhood death. But when she got to Sanambele, the community had other ideas about what her mission should be. Working with the Mali Agricultural Research Organization (IER), she learned through participatory, gender-based focus groups with local famers that malaria was the most feared killer of children.\nWilliams credits Sidy Ba, a professor at Mali’s agricultural college, and IER’s Assa Kante with helping her ask the right questions in a culturally sensitive way, and for helping her get permission from village chiefs to conduct her surveys. She is now working with Ba on a project relating to diarrhea and water quality in villages near Mopti, Mali, the results of which they plan to publish.\n“Florence gives you a lot of freedom,” Williams said. “Through her program, however, I developed my interest in science and learned how to conduct research that has carried me into graduate school and a future career in water quality.”\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Conservation\n Science Tuesday\n water",

Almost immediately, Perez-Delgado started assisting the Forest Service project team for Georgia with support in mapping and computerized drawings.\nThe recent Chico State University grad, from Burney, Calif., was hired by the Shasta-Trinity National Forest as a Civil Engineer less than one year after graduating college and was already involved in an important international project.\n“She did a great job with email instructions and coming up with the product that was needed in the summer of right after the landslide,” said Rene Renteria, geotechnical and dams group leader with the U.S. Forest Service. “When I had the opportunity to create a team to go over to Tbilisi, Georgia this past January through February, I wanted her civil engineering skills. I was impressed right away with her go-to attitude.”\nFor Georgia, Perez-Delgado designed the new roadway alignment and tunnel location outside the boundaries of the landslide using LIDAR, Autocad and Civil 3D.  She provided everything needed, including plan and profile drawings and calculations in metric, to begin construction for emergency response.\nAngelica provided drawings of what the roads should look like to include a retaining wall, culverts and estimates on how much the costs would be for local contractors. Oftentimes, her work included standing outside in minus 10 degree Celsius doing surveys.\nThat didn’t stop her from getting the job done, in fact, Perez-Delgado was more concerned about her colleagues in Georgia. “They have such a crazy work ethic there,” she said.  “One guy didn’t even have a warm coat or gloves, but here he was out there with me in such cold weather.

And, ahem, it’s also a win, because we’re pretty sure USDA brought in more donations per capita than any other Federal Department.  Not that we were keeping track.\nIn all seriousness though, I want to thank all the USDA employees who were generous not only with their donations but also with the time they spent volunteering with the Feds Feed Families campaign and related events.  Special thanks also to Assistant Secretary for Administration Pearlie Reed, Deputy Under Secretary Karis Gutter, and Director of the Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships, Max Finberg, for lending a helping hand at the event.

The Nine Agency Rule is designed to ensure that USDA programs of civil rights, including program delivery, compliance, and equal employment opportunity, adhere to all governing laws, rules, and regulations, including related Executive Orders and Congressional mandates.\nOn February 14, , President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., signed Executive Order 5, establishing the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, emphasizing the importance of partnering with civil society, including faith-based and secular organizations, to serve people in need while adhering to all governing laws. This Executive Order revoked Executive Order 1 and reinstated key provisions to protect religious liberty.\nKey Provisions of the Nine Agency Rule\n Equal Access for Faith-Based Organizations\n Under 7 CFR § 16, faith-based organizations are eligible to access and participate in USDA assistance programs on the same basis as any other organization. USDA and its intermediaries must not discriminate against or for an organization based on its religious character, motives, affiliation, or lack thereof.\n Non-Discrimination Against Beneficiaries\n Organizations receiving direct or indirect Federal financial assistance from USDA must not discriminate against current or prospective beneficiaries based on religion, religious belief, refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice.\n Separation of Religious Activities\n Organizations that receive USDA direct assistance must separate any explicitly religious activities in time or location from the programs or services funded by USDA direct assistance, ensuring participation in such activities is voluntary. This restriction does not apply to indirect Federal financial assistance.\n Notification Requirements\n Recipients administering USDA social service programs must notify beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries of their right to be free from religious discrimination and how to report violations.\n Alternative Providers\n If a beneficiary objects to the religious character of a faith-based provider, the USDA awarding agency must make reasonable efforts to refer the beneficiary to an alternative provider.\n Protections for Faith-Based Providers\n Faith-based providers can compete equally with secular organizations for USDA awards while retaining their religious character, provided they comply with all applicable regulations.\nExamples of Nine Agency Rule Violations\n Denied Service Based on Religious Beliefs\n A food pantry volunteer denies service to an individual wearing a religious head covering and makes derogatory remarks about their faith.\n Discriminatory Practices by Service Providers\n A service provider receiving USDA funds denies services to a homeowner based on their perceived religion, using offensive language, and failing to address the discrimination.\nHow to File a Complaint\nAny individual who believes they have been discriminated against based on religion, religious belief, refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice may file a complaint with OASCR. To file a complaint, visit www.usda.gov/oascr/filing-program-discrimination-complaint-usda-customer.\nContact Us\nIf you have any questions or would like technical assistance, please contact the USDA Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights by visiting www.usda.gov/oascr/home.\nYou may contact the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, Information Research Service, at 632- (toll-free) or send an email to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at CR-INFO@usda.gov.

Kika De La Garza Fellow Alicia Gonzalez-Quiroz in the Bod Pod – a tool that determines body composition using air measurement. Photo credit: Perry Rainosek, USDA/ARS\nThis post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nTo celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, USDA’s Research, Education, and Economics mission area will highlight those who are making significant contributions to American agriculture.\nSwimming and visiting beaches are what most of us think of as summer activities.  Although the name Bod Pod sounds like something you might find at the beach, and a swim suit and cap are the usual attire, Dr. Alicia Gonzalez-Quiroz, faculty member of Loredo Community College, never imagined this would be on her summer to-do list.  The Bod Pod is actually a research tool used to measure lean body mass at the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Body Composition Laboratory of the Children’s Nutrition Research Center in Houston, TX.\nDr. Gonzalez-Quiroz is part of an exclusive group of faculty members from Hispanic Serving Institutions, which partnered with ARS scientists from across the country to learn about agriculture research and develop tools to use with their students.  The Bod Pod is one tool that works by measuring body volume through the displacement of air in the enclosed chamber. Body volume is combined with body weight (mass) to determine the individual’s body density. The technique then estimates the percentage of body fat and lean body mass through equations for the density of fat and fat free mass.  This modern method to measure body mass replaces underwater weighing.\nWith the lab’s research focused on promoting healthy eating and physical activity in families and youth, Dr. Gonzalez-Quiroz’s participation resulted from her selection as a Fellow in the E. Kika de la Garza Science Program coordinated through the USDA Hispanic-Serving Institutions National Program.  Since , the E. Kika De La Garza Fellowship Program offers faculty from Hispanic-serving institutions the opportunity to work collaboratively with USDA to gain insight and understanding of the Federal Government, and to enhance professional growth while fostering workforce diversity.  Selected through a competitive evaluation process, Science Fellows spend a week during the summer in Washington, DC learning about USDA agencies and meeting with key administration and staff before traveling to an ARS lab to team up with USDA researchers.\nThis year, scientific disciplines varied from studying invasive pest management; to enhancing the nutritional components of plant species; to the science associated with childhood obesity issues.  Joining ARS labs from Hawaii, Florida, and Texas, Fellows became immersed in the USDA research experience. “I truly became engaged in the areas of which USDA operates,” Gonzalez-Quiroz noted at the completion of the program.  “I am now able to give insight to my students on what research and internship opportunities await them.”\nThe competitive selection process for next year’s Research Fellows begins in the spring.  If you are a member of faculty serving our Hispanic Serving Institutes and interested in this special opportunity, please contact Dan Wueste, Program Manager. He can be contacted at daniel.wueste@osec.usda.gov for more information.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n ARS\n Florida\n Hawaii\n Hispanic Serving Institutions\n National Hispanic Heritage Month\n REE\n Science Tuesday\n Texas\n Washington DC",

Festival visitors will be able to talk with pollinator experts, watch live bees and bats, and learn more about what they can do in their own backyard to help pollinators. More than 14 USDA agencies, federal departments and other partners are participating in the outdoor festival located next to USDA's Jamie L. Whitten Building at 12th and Independence Avenue, S.W., in Washington, D.C.\"Pollinators, such as bees, birds and other insects are essential partners for farmers and ranchers and help produce much of our food supply. More than three-fourths of the world's flowering plants rely on pollinators to reproduce, meaning pollinators help produce one out of every three bites of food Americans eat,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. \"The upcoming Pollinator Festival is an opportunity to interact with USDA experts and partners to learn more about these important creatures and ways we can all work together to support their declining populations.\"USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) oversees the Department's national People's Garden Initiative (PGI), which supports the Department's efforts as a member of the USDA Pollinator Working Group and the White House Pollinator Task Force. There are 2,115 registered People's Gardens across the country, including the USDA Headquarters People's Garden which is landscaped to include several pollinator gardens that support two beehives on the Whitten Building's roof. Viewers can watch activity in the beehives on a \"bee cam\" ( www.usda.gov/beewatch).This year, a new display that encourages individuals to join the national \"Plant a Window Box for Pollinators\" effort has been added to the USDA Headquarters People's Garden.\"It's so easy to help pollinators, and we need to act now,\" said AMS Administrator Anne Alonzo. \"Even a small garden, like a window box filled with native plants that bloom during the spring, summer, and fall, will make a difference for bees and other pollinators.\"During the growing season, the USDA Headquarters People's Garden and the adjacent USDA Farmers Market together help educate patrons about the wide variety of fruits, vegetables and other agricultural products available in the Chesapeake Bay region. Visitors can walk through the garden and see pollinator-friendly plantings, as well as crops such as blueberries, asparagus and okra that are pollinated by bees, and then stroll through the adjacent USDA Farmers Market to purchase these fruits and vegetables.More information about how to \"Plant a Window Box for Pollinators,\" as well as other resources, including pollinator-friendly garden blogs and videos, is available at www.usda.gov/peoplesgarden.Details about the USDA Farmers Market are at: www.usda.gov/FarmersMarket. the latest Agricultural Marketing Service news at or follow us on Twitter @USDA_AMS.

This is an important step in our shared effort to respond to climate change - and like the President's broader Climate Action Plan, it will help American agriculture mitigate and adapt to the impacts of a changing climate.\nAmerica's farmers, ranchers and landowners have long been tremendous stewards of our environment. At USDA, we have worked with a record number of producers and landowners over the course of the Obama Administration to help conserve the soil and water, and clean our air - more than half a million over the past four and a half years. Meanwhile, in support of the Climate Action Plan, USDA put forward a series of new policies in June to help agriculture develop new climate solutions in the months and years to come. We have taken steps to create seven new regional climate hubs that will aid in sharing climate information for farmers and ranchers. We released the results of the Rapid Carbon Assessment - the largest-ever survey of soil carbon to help improve research efforts. And our new COMET-Farm tool provides a way for producers to see the impacts conservation practices could have on their land.\nThis new Executive Order directs Federal agencies to engage in similar efforts across the government. Together, we'll be sure that modern Federal programs work for farmers and ranchers to mitigate the impacts of climate change. We will ensure that our risk management and conservation programs allow producers to undertake modern practices and provide new possibilities for producers and landowners to capitalize on their good stewardship. We'll continue to help producers manage land and water by increasing participation in conservation programs on farms and private forest lands. We'll build on the Rapid Carbon Assessment and COMET-Farm tools to continue providing useful and information to help prepare for climate change impacts. And USDA scientists will continue a wide range of groundbreaking research to learn more about the impacts of climate change on agriculture.\nTogether, we can ensure that our nation is prepared to deal with the impacts of climate change – and at USDA we will continue taking steps to support a strong American agriculture sector in the face of these modern challenges.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Climate Change\n Conservation\n Farmers\n Landowners\n President Obama\n Producers\n Ranchers",

They include tasks from managing the station’s nursery and field plots to modifying research equipment and collecting yield for critical projects such as the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize program.\nBut the ARS station isn’t the only beneficiary of Engstrom’s versatile contributions. His time and technical know-how have also been praised by members of Central Elementary in Nevada, Iowa, where Engstrom helped to build the raised beds and irrigation system for the school’s community garden, dubbed “Noah’s Garden.”\nThe school began the project in to provide over 350 students from 16 classrooms with a hands-on opportunity to grow their own food while simultaneously incorporating concepts in math, science, language and other academic fields. The students, together with their teachers and parents or guardians, participate in the Noah’s Garden project from seeding to harvest. What the families don’t take home—which can include tomatoes, lettuce, beets, broccoli, peppers, sweet corn, carrots, string beans, and other produce—is donated to local food-distribution centers.\n“Fred Engstrom has been an active supporter of our garden from the beginning,” says Jamie Hughet, a Central Elementary teacher and project organizer. “He was instrumental in preparing the garden and materials of the initial eight 4- by 8-foot beds and the wood-chip paths. He investigated a proper soil mixture for our area and designed the irrigation system.” In , he helped add 10 more beds, expanding the garden area to 35- by 45-feet, she added.\nThe students are assigned one raised bed per class and get to choose what they want to plant. Some have done theme gardens, including pizza and salsa gardens, as well as flower gardens displaying Iowa State University . Throughout, says Hughet, the students record and chart seed growth, conduct germination trials and keep weekly plant-observation journals.\nEngstrom is modest about his contributions to Noah’s Garden, but it’s clear he’s gotten as much out of the project as he has given working as a parent volunteer with the students and their families.\n“I feel it’s beneficial for our kids to reconnect to the land in a dirty-hands kind of way,” he says. “I also find having parents involved working with other parents and children creates a good example for the children to see and hopefully emulate.”\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n ARS\n gardens\n Iowa\n Iowa State University\n Irrigation\n volunteers",

The ten regional USDA Climate Hubs were established to synthesize and translate climate science and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers that are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA's Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate.\nYou might have noticed spring-like weather in the Northeast is arriving earlier than usual.  There is reliable evidence from many studies that conditions in the Northeast and upper Midwest have become warmer and wetter in recent decades, especially before the coming of winter and spring.  The spring-like warmth has snow melting faster and plant growth starting sooner.  On average, the last spring frost in the Northeast is about a week earlier now than it was 30 years ago.  The change is not as positive as one might expect since the start of growth for many plants has shifted even earlier than the last frost date leading to increased chances of frost damage.  This happens most often when unusually warm temperatures in March are followed within 2-5 weeks by a frost event.  In , record high March temperatures were followed by record low temperatures (for the date) at the end of April with terrible consequences for fruit growers across Michigan, Ontario, New York, Vermont, and surrounding states.  In some places losses were almost total.  In something of a repeat, unusual warmth in the Northeast this past winter was interrupted by very cold outbreaks in mid-February and early April.  This combination was particularly bad for peaches in New Jersey, Connecticut, parts of New York, and other northeastern states where greater than 90% losses have been reported.\n Dave Hollinger, Director, USDA Northeast Climate Hub\n Posted in\n May 16, \n Respond to this story",

Photo by Peggy Greb.\nAntibiotics are lifesavers. We depend on them to treat bacterial infections and diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis and strep throat, as well as ear infections and infected wounds. In response to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance, veterinarians and producers are moving toward more judicious antibiotic use in food animals, while keeping them healthy and ensuring that our food supply remains safe.\nThis is especially important because certain bacterial strains have become resistant to some of the current antibiotics used to treat infections in humans and animals, escalating the need worldwide to find and develop alternatives to antibiotics.\nThe USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is developing new technologies to address antibiotic resistance and reduce the use of antibiotics through agricultural management, which includes food, animals, crops and the environment—water, soil and climate. This research falls into USDA’s One Health approach when mitigating the problems associated with antibiotic resistance.  One Health is the concept that the health of animals, the health of people, and the viability of ecosystems are intricately linked.\nA One Health approach embraces the idea that a disease problem impacting the health of humans, animals, and the environment can only be solved through improved communication, cooperation, and collaboration across disciplines and institutions. With its partners, USDA’s objective through this multidisciplinary approach is to preserve, maintain or reduce health risks to animals, humans, the environment and society. USDA has gained in-depth knowledge about antimicrobial resistance through its work on the agricultural environment, animal health and food safety.\nOver the years, scientists have developed and patented new technologies that could help reduce the use of antibiotics. Discoveries include using natural supplements like vitamin D to treat a condition of dairy cows called “mastitis,” which affects milk quality and production of cattle. Vitamin D, as well as yeast, also has the potential to treat turkey diseases.\nIn addition, scientists have shown that non-antibiotic methods, such as essential oils in citrus, reduce foodborne pathogens found in the gut of animals; that phytochemicals—natural chemicals found in such plants as safflower, plums and peppers—enhance the immune system of chickens; and that certain natural compounds kill foodborne pathogens like Salmonella or Escherichia coli O157:H7. Other research breakthroughs include creating new, effective antimicrobials and vaccines to fight such pathogens as Salmonella and Campylobacter to lower their incidence in chickens and turkeys and help keep consumers healthy.\nFinding alternatives to antibiotics has become a global issue as the demand for animal food products increases to meet the nutritional needs of a growing population. ARS scientists continue to seek solutions by developing new methods to control and prevent animal diseases and reduce bacterial pathogens in our food supply.\nARS scientists are studying a variety of techniques to ensure our food supply remains safe.

Of course, we get the usual questions about buying, thawing and roasting a turkey. But we also get some of the same not-so-typical questions each year. You may have had these questions yourself.\nHow long will it take to cook two turkeys at the same time?\nThe cooking time is determined by the weight of one bird—not the combined weight. Use the weight of the smaller bird to determine cooking time.  Use a food thermometer to check the internal temperature of the smaller bird first and then check the second bird. A whole turkey is safe when cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 165 °F as measured with a food thermometer.  Check the internal temperature in the innermost part of the thigh and wing and the thickest part of the breast.  When cooking two turkeys at the same time make sure there is enough oven space for proper heat circulation.\nHow long will it take to cook a turkey weighing over 25 lbs?\nTo cook a large turkey use the Timetables for Turkey Roasting for an unstuffed turkey, which can be found in Turkey Basics: Safe Cooking. Add 10 minutes per pound for turkeys over 24 pounds. We don’t recommend stuffing a turkey over 24 pounds. Make sure you have a heavy pan large enough to hold the turkey. Be sure to make sure there is enough space in the oven for proper heat circulation.\nIf a turkey has a “pop-up” temperature indicator do I still need to use a thermometer?\nPop-up temperature indicators are constructed from a food-approved nylon. The indicator pops up when the food has reached the final temperature for safety and doneness. Pop-up temperature indicators have been produced since and are reliable to within 1 to 2 °F if accurately placed in the product. But it is also suggested that the temperature be checked with a conventional food thermometer in the innermost part of the thigh and wing and the thickest part of the breast to ensure safety.\nIs it safe to cook a turkey from the frozen state?\nYes, it is safe to cook a turkey from the frozen state. The cooking time will take at least 50% longer than recommended for a fully thawed turkey. Remember to remove the giblet packages during the cooking time. Remove the packages carefully with tongs or a fork.\nCan I call the Meat & Poultry Hotline on Thanksgiving Day?\nYes! The Hotline will be staffed from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern Time on Thanksgiving Day. Call us toll-free at 1-888-674-. (Our usual hours are Monday through Friday, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Eastern Time.)

As a graduate student of soil science at Virginia State and Polytechnic University, a forestry undergraduate, a student of Tom Brown, Jr.’s Tracker School and a former employee of the Virginia Department of Forestry, he also knows much of the science behind soil restoration and forestry. These experiences have given him a strong desire to turn his knowledge into action by managing land in the most beneficial way possible.\nTo make this dream a reality, he began converting a 250-acre loblolly pine plantation in Scottsville, Virginia., into a goat and sheep silvopasture system that resembles a pine savanna landscape. Silvopasture combines trees with forage and livestock production. The trees are managed for high-value sawlogs and, at the same time, provide shade and shelter for livestock and forage, reducing livestock stress and sometimes improving forage quality. Fields-Johnson and friends have spent many weekends thinning and pruning trees by hand, conducting controlled burns, fighting invasive plants and experimenting with forage establishment while they also learn how to raise goats and sheep.\n Kate MacFarland, USDA National Agroforestry Center\n Posted in\n Forestry\n Sep 17, \n Respond to this story",

These programs—from school meals to SNAP (formerly food stamps)—currently touch the lives of one in four Americans.\nDuring a whirlwind visit to Minnesota in March, I had the opportunity to meet with a variety of individuals and organizations directly or indirectly involved with one or more of our nutrition programs. For starters, I participated in a terrific roundtable at the University of Minnesota’s School of Public Health hosted by national nutrition expert Dr. Mary Story, a strong supporter of healthy school meals. Minnesota Senator Al Franken joined me to hear from local organizations and agencies that administer nutrition assistance programs, promote good nutrition or even work with farmers markets. I was impressed with the accomplishments being realized and the creative approaches employed by local partners to improve nutrition, eliminate hunger, support children and families, and connect farmers to local markets.\nCongresswoman Betty McCollum, a long-time supporter of Farm to School, joins Under Secretary Concannon and St. Paul students. The Congresswoman co-hosted the visit with St. Paul Schools Nutrition Director Jean Ronnei. \nThe next day Congresswoman Betty McCollum joined me to visit one of the largest school meals operations in the country - the St. Paul Public Schools. Nationally recognized for her success in serving from-scratch meals and sourcing from local farmers, St. Paul Public Schools nutrition director Jean Ronnei gave us a tour of a facility that cranks out 50,000 fresh, healthy meals each day that meet and often exceed USDA’s new school meal standards. Recently, the school district received a USDA Farm to School grant to expand its efforts and continue to source buffalo meat, cranberries, carrots, potatoes and a host of other food products from Minnesota farmers and food companies.\nAs part of my visit, I also had the chance to talk to farmers that provide foods for St. Paul Schools. They are great supporters of Farm to School—not only because it contributes to their bottom line, but because it connects children with the farmers that grow their food and introduces them to fresh, healthy fruits, vegetables and other locally grown farm products.\nFinally, I joined the Congresswoman for a roundtable with community partners hosted by Hunger Solutions Minnesota and the historic Neighborhood House at St. Paul’s Wellstone Center. The Center, named for late Senator Paul Wellstone, offers a food pantry (or shelf, as it’s called in Minnesota) stocked with USDA foods. The Center also offers a variety of social services and is a strong thread in St. Paul’s social fabric.\nLeft to right: Senator Al Franken joins Dr. Mary Story and Under Secretary Concannon after the nutrition roundtable at the University of Minnesota March 25. (photo credit: University of Minnesota)\nAs I often am when talking to state and local partners and viewing our programs in action, I came away impressed with how much can be accomplished by coupling USDA programs with creative and dedicated individuals and organizations that enthusiastically support our shared mission.\nThrough the leadership and hard work of community groups, social service organizations and government agencies and with the support of Senator Franken and Congresswoman McCollum, Minnesota is improving nutrition, reducing hunger, supporting local farmers and rural economies and ensuring that America’s next generation is healthy and well-nourished.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Al Franken\n Betty McCollum\n Dr. Mary Story\n Farm to School\n FNS\n Healthier School Meals\n HealthierNextGen\n Kevin Concannon\n Minnesota\n Minnesota Hunger Solutions\n Neighborhood House\n school meal standards\n St. Paul\n St. Paul Public Schools\n University of Minnesota School of Public Health\n USDA Foods\n Wellstone Center",

Ultimately, ACRSI could allow for automated reporting from a producer’s GPS monitoring equipment. Another big benefit:  Reduced USDA operating costs and improved integrity and accuracy\nNow we want more input. We believe the public, especially producers, ranchers, and the crop insurance industry may have suggestions to help further reduce the reporting burden. If you have ideas on how to streamline collection, we’d like to hear from you.\nWe are continuing the discussion on the USDA Open gov policy gateway website at:  www.usda.gov/open.  Please provide your suggestions or otherwise participate in the discussion there through the discuss tab.  Or see our recently published Federal Register Notice on the RMA website which provides a 60-day comment period for public input regarding ACRSI.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Acreage and Crop Reporting Streamlining Initiative\n FSA\n OCIO\n RMA",

High-resolution such as these are used by scientists to optimize crop performance in specific environmental conditions.\nFor nearly 400 years, Thanksgiving has been a time in North America when families come together to celebrate food and agriculture. As we reflect on yet another year, agricultural scientists at USDA continue to keep a wary eye on the future. At the end of what may be the hottest year on record, a period of drought has threatened the heart of one of the most important agricultural production zones in the United States. Water demands are increasing, and disease and pest pressures are continually evolving. This challenges our farmers’ ability to raise livestock and crops.  How are science and technology going to address the problems facing our food supply? \nTo find answers, agricultural scientists turn to —big .  Genomics, the field of science responsible for cataloging billions of DNA base pairs that encode thousands of genes in an organism, is fundamentally changing our understanding of plants and animals.  USDA has already helped to fund and collect genomes for 25 crop plant species, important livestock and fish species, and numerous bacteria, fungi, and insect species related to agricultural production. Other USDA-supported research projects expanding these efforts are currently underway, including genome sequencing of 1,000 bulls and 5,000 insect species in the i5K initiative. But classifying and understanding DNA is only part of the story.\nEven if neighboring farmers were to raise identical varieties of tomato, small variations in the environment can reduce crop performance and/or increase pests and disease. So, scientists and farmers are increasingly using technology like satellites, drones, sensors, and laser-guided tractors to collect thousands of points about the environmental conditions in a field, such as temperature, humidity, soil composition, or slope of the land. Using these “precision agriculture” techniques, farmers could reduce their environmental footprint by matching land management practices to the unique environments on their farm.\nIn the long term, USDA researchers are hoping to combine precision agriculture and genomics in a remarkable way—to develop crops with combinations of genes that lead to the best performance in specific environments. To support this goal, USDA continues to lead the way in collecting and maintaining open access to these types of agriculture .  As a result, your local farmer’s market or grocery store may one day have even more varieties of produce to choose from on Thanksgiving, with each optimized for the farm or field on which it was grown.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n ARS\n big \n NAL\n OCS\n precision agriculture\n Research\n Science",

NOAA photo.\nI work for USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, an agency that helps farmers voluntarily implement conservation practices on their lands across the U.S.—including land on my home, Puerto Rico.\nI am extremely proud of recent NRCS efforts here to help farmers, ranchers and landowners make significant strides in conserving the Guánica Bay/Rio Loco watershed. This watershed, which is about 100 miles southwest of San Juan, is one of the most diverse and complex in Puerto Rico.\nThe water that flows through the watershed is harnessed by dams, reservoirs and hydroelectric plants. Despite these man-made interferences, the watershed drains over 151 square miles into the bay every year.\nCoffee ripens on a bush. Photo credit Edwin Mas.\nCoral reefs are a pillar of the natural beauty of Puerto Rico and the bay is home to some of the island’s most pristine reefs. But runoff from the watershed contains sediment and other contaminants that can damage or even kill the small organisms that build the sensitive structures.\nNow, to protect the coral reefs, farmers are working with NRCS to reduce runoff and improve water quality in a multi-year project to evaluate, design and install watershed restoration projects to reduce the effects of land-based sources of pollution.\nOne important conservation project on the island is the sun-to-shade coffee initiative. Managed by NRCS with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, it focuses on promoting shade-grown coffee among farmers.\nTransitioning from growing sun-grown coffee to shade-grown coffee provides many benefits.\nFor one, the shade in shade-grown coffee is provided by native nitrogen-fixing trees, which add nitrogen to the soil, helping reduce the need for fertilizer as well as the farmer’s costs.\nThe Guánica Bay/Rio Loco watershed as seen from the air. Photo credit Edwin Mas.\nShade-grown coffee helps reduce sedimentation and storm water runoff because the trees help keep the soil in place and, in turn, more water can soak into the soil, recharging the island’s aquifers. The shade and fallen leaves also reduce the need for pesticides, since both help suppress weeds and fungi.\nAll of these outcomes help protect the water quality of Puerto Rico’s streams and lakes, as well as where they ultimately drain—the bay, home of the corals.\nThere are additional benefits to shade-grown coffee. The trees provide valuable wildlife habitat and coffee grown in shade has higher yields plus farmers don’t need to apply as much water because the soil retains more water.\nOver 32,000 trees have been delivered to coffee farmers throughout the watershed since , when NRCS and FWS began partnering on this project. Over 750 acres have already been converted to shade-grown coffee. NRCS has invested over $2.5 million on conservation in the watershed since .\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\nCheck out other conservation-related stories on the USDA blog.\nA shade-grown coffee plot helps protect water quality, provides higher yields, reduces irrigation, and even provides wildlife habitat.

I’m proud of our members and the success of our food drive.” SWCS is a professional society dedicated to promoting the science and art of natural resource conservation.\nGulliford credits Bonnie Allely, an exhibitor at this year’s SWCS conference, with the idea of having the organization participate. Allely is the Earth Team national volunteer liaison with USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). “When Bonnie contacted us about participating in the NRCS F5 food drive, we jumped at the chance. We asked the 615 people attending our conference to ‘pack for two, bring food, and help “starve” hunger in St. Louis,’” Guilliford said. Allely’s Earth Team exhibit served as the food donation collection point.\nFeds, Farmers and Friends Feed Families is a national program that contributes foods to communities across the country. Allely says she handed convention attendees fliers promoting the F5 partnership. “I’m hoping this hunger-fighting effort continues when the conference-goers return home,” she said. “This is a great program.”\nWant to help?

Embargoed until 1:00 p.m. Eastern\n Release & Contact Info\n News Transcript\n Release No. .13\n Contact:USDA Office of Communications \n720-\n Watch Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack's remarks live at 12:50 pm ET at: afternoon, everyone. I want to thank the National Press Club for the opportunity to discuss a complex environmental challenge American agriculture will face in the years and decades to come.In particular today, I want to focus on America's food supply. Specifically - how we've mitigated threats to it in the past and how today we face evolving environmental threats, requiring again that we mitigate and adapt.This is an important discussion because our food supply stands at the core of our strength as a nation. Today, American agriculture is tremendously productive, largely due to the innovation embraced by our farmers and ranchers.Productivity impacts more than the farmer's bottom line. Productivity empowers America to lead the way in feeding a growing world population - enables us to maintain an agricultural trade surplus that supports over a million jobs - and allows us to enjoy an affordable, diverse, homegrown food supply - all of which makes America more secure.We achieved this productivity because American agriculture has always adapted to threats. We're flexible and responsible when disaster strikes. But we've also taken the long view. We've always asked what we'll have to deal with next week, next month or next year.Risk management and adaptation starts on the farm. Farmers and ranchers are on the front lines of identifying threats and adapting to meet them. When a crop goes south or a herd gets sick, producers don't chalk that up to luck. They find out what's wrong and they fix it.For more than a century they have had our help in fixing problems. We are people that have invested and supported our agriculture sector. From USDA, to academics, to local extension agents, experts and advisors at all levels have been there to help our farmers get the job done.Keeping agriculture strong and productive is a joint undertaking and a shared responsibility.During and after the Dust Bowl, USDA helped farmers, ranchers and foresters reestablish the soil through new management efforts - planting marginal crop land with resource-conserving cover; taking new steps to protect water sheds; regenerating trees to break the devastating wind. These steps continue today.When America's forests were racked by historic fires, we came together to develop new methods to sustain, regenerate and protect forest lands.Last year, as producers faced the worst drought in generations, groundbreaking agricultural research and smart business planning saved crops that in the past would have been destroyed.The bottom line is that in the United States, we produce an amazing amount of food because we adapt to today's threats and prepare for tomorrow's threats.Today, we face a new challenge in the form of a changing and shifting climate.I'm the Secretary of Agriculture, and I am not here today to give a scientific lecture on climate change. I'm here to tell you what we're seeing on the ground.We're seeing more severe storms. We're facing more invasive species. More intense forest fire threatens communities each year. NOAA reported that was the second most intense year in our history for extreme weather events - droughts, flooding, hurricanes, severe storms and devastating wildfire. NOAA also advised that last year was the warmest on record for the continental United States.Right now, our farmers and forest landowners continue to adapt. New technologies and advanced practices have managed to keep production steady even in the face of these new and more extreme weather patterns.But the latest science tells us that the threat of a changing climate is new and different from anything we've ever tackled.Earlier this year USDA released two comprehensive studies - one focused on crops and one on our forests - detailing the projected effects of climate change on our agriculture and forestry production.These studies found that in the short term we have the means to manage threats, but over the next fifty years we will face new and different problems.We'll face the need to adapt crop production. As temperatures increase, crop production may need to shift based on water availability and other factors. Where you're growing water-intense fruits and vegetables today, you may be growing a drought-resistant row crop in a generation.Rising temperatures will also add to our invasive species issues, bringing with them increased costs for producers. Right now, weed control alone costs us more than $11 billion a year in the U.S. - and those costs are expected to rise with increasing temperatures. When winters aren't cold enough to kill off invasive insects, we'll face a new challenge to adapt to those threats. Landowners, dealing with bark beetles, are already starting to experience this phenomenon.We will face more severe weather patterns. We'll see more events that could harm crops and livestock, which demand new strategies.In our forests, the troubling pattern of intense and destructive wildfires threatens to become the norm. The fire season is now at least 60 days longer than it was just 30 years ago. The pine beetle epidemic, which many scientists attribute to climate change, covers some 40 million acres of land across the interior west. Fires impact more acres. A recent Forest Service study forecasts a doubling of annual acreage subject to wild land fire by .We are also beginning to grasp that climate challenges will have impacts unique to each region of the country.In the Northeast, extreme precipitation events have increased faster than anywhere else in the Nation, reducing yields.Across the Midwest and Great Plains the growing season has lengthened by almost two weeks over my lifetime.In the West and Southwest - home of more than half of our nation's high-value specialty crop production - increased drought poses a particular threat to irrigation-intensive nuts, fruits and vegetables.So the fact is, across America, farmers and ranchers and forest landowners are seeing the beginning chapter of what will be a long-term challenge posed by a changing climate. This problem is not going to go away on its own.That's why America must take steps now to adapt.We know that developing modern solutions to a changing climate requires a doubling down on collaboration - between farmers, governments, researchers and industry. We have got to think outside the box, work together, and pool our resources to begin developing the next generation of climate solutions for agriculture. This is not a single, one-size-fits-all problem. We need a targeted approach geared to the particular challenge faced by each region.We already have taken steps under President Obama to begin forging critical new approaches to mitigation and adaptation.Take the livestock and dairy industries, for example. In , USDA entered into an historic agreement with the U.S. dairy industry to mitigate the environmental impact of dairy production, by supporting new energy efficiency and waste-to-energy systems.Over four years this agreement led to the creation of 184 new anaerobic digesters. Last month, we renewed our MOU with a goal of helping the dairy industry reduce greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by .We've also provided support through university research to help the livestock industry reduce its environmental footprint.USDA recently announced $19.5 million in funding - led by the University of Wisconsin and Oklahoma State University - to look at the impacts of climate variability on dairy and beef production. Ultimately, these projects aim to deliver the best new tools for ranchers to sustain productivity.This effort was the latest in our focus on Coordinated Agriculture Projects, joint efforts to best leverage America's agricultural research capacity. USDA under the Obama Administration has invested nearly $120 million in Coordinated Agriculture Project research to sustain our productivity in the face of modern environmental challenges.We've worked with UC-Davis to explore how we might adapt conifer trees to changing climates - the University of Idaho to look at changes in soil carbon and nitrogen content - and Iowa State to look at several aspects of corn production.We have made unprecedented efforts to conserve and protect America's forests which play a critical role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in trees, other vegetation and soil. The Forest Service increased the pace and scale of forest restoration on our National Forests through landscape scale projects that bring together forest industry, environmentalists and communities.Given the threats our forests face, we moved away from the timber wars of the past towards a shared vision that recognizes we must work together towards a common goal of forest restoration.In this spirit, USDA has adopted a new forest planning rule that ensures our forests will be restored and managed in a way that protects all the benefits that forests provide to Americans, including clean water, jobs, recreation and wildlife. And importantly, the planning rule allows the Forest Service to use the best available science to ensure our forests can adapt to climate change over time.We have worked with more than 500,000 farmers and ranchers on private working land conservation efforts, and carried out thousands of projects to help them embrace renewable energy and energy efficiency projects on their property.We have taken a new and committed look at the impact of climate on the future of agriculture - and how we at USDA will also need to adapt.In addition to the two climate assessments I referenced earlier, we released USDA's first Climate Change Adaptation Plan this year. The Obama Administration has taken a comprehensive - and proactive - effort to ensure the Federal government is prepared for climate challenges that lay ahead.As part of this, USDA engaged employees and agencies to address our weak points with regard to a shifting climate and modern threats from the environment. We found areas where our program delivery might be impacted by these new challenges.Working with many different USDA agencies, we laid out 83 specific recommendations to be sure we can continue delivering top-notch service in the face of climate impacts. For example, we identified common needs to increase collaboration on climate planning within the Federal government and with our partners, such as land grant universities.We laid out a need to better prepare APHIS to measure invasive species - to ensure that our scientific research helps deliver modern climate solutions - to strengthen the resilience of our Forests - and to help create new ways for producers to access information that will help them mitigate threats.We'll be issuing a follow-up to this initial report in November of this year. But taken alongside the two climate impact assessments, these efforts reflect our understanding that proactive steps will pay big dividends in the decades to come. We know we need to be ahead of the game. We must continue to build on previous action in order to better support America's adaptation to climate challenges.Today I would like to announce some new measures that we will be taking.Regional Climate Hubs:First, USDA will establish seven new \"Regional Climate Hubs\" to work in partnership with producers and foresters on new adaptation strategies.This is the next step in USDA's decades of work alongside farmers, ranchers and forest landowners to keep up production in the face of challenges. If we are to be effective in managing the risks from a shifting climate, we'll need to ensure that our managers in the field and our stakeholders have the information they need to succeed.That's why we're bringing all of that information together on a regionally-appropriate basis.You can think of these new Hubs as service centers for science-based risk management - part of our broader effort to deliver extension for the 21st Century. They will enhance coordination of the science assets of USDA. They'll encourage folks to accelerate the development and delivery of forecasts and solutions to improve risk management in ways that matter for folks on the ground.The hubs will enable us to carry out regionally-appropriate climate change risk and vulnerability assessments, and get out to the field more quickly. Practically, the hubs will deal out advice to farmers and forest owners on ways to reduce risks and manage change.They will serve as a starting point to further implement new strategies for adaptation, soil health and water protection. One very promising example is the possibility of multi-cropping production that will add additional nutrient value to the soil, better protect cropland, store more carbon and allow producers to expand income.And as we further investigate possibilities for competitive markets in carbon sequestration and water protection, these regional Hubs will play a useful role.While some of the work of these new Hubs will take place in existing USDA service centers across the nation, there is a very important collaborative aspect as well. We intend to fully leverage our relationship with the Land Grant and Public Universities, Agricultural Experiment Stations, and extension to provide new platforms for collaboration.NRCS Tools for Producers:Second, I can announce new efforts by the Natural Resources Conservation Service to move into the next generation of research and technical assistance.In particular, both of these efforts relate to carbon. We know it's important to understand the role of carbon in contributing to global warming. It's equally important to recognize the tremendous potential of American agriculture to sequester carbon from the atmosphere - helping to mitigate climate change, while improving soil health to be more resilient in the face of modern challenges.NRCS is launching today an online resource assessment database - the results of a study known as the Rapid Carbon Assessment - that will be particularly useful for researchers and scientists.This tool will allow online access to the most extensive database on soil carbon in the world. While NRCS has collected soil samples for more than a century, this rapid assessment is an ambitious project. In fact, it is the largest concentrated soil sampling effort in history. NRCS scientists collected more than 144,000 soil samples at 6,000 locations across the country to provide baseline on regional carbon stocks.This will allow outside researchers and scientists to begin taking a fresh look at carbon in soil, which ultimately will have regional benefits to crop production.Additionally, USDA NRCS and our Climate Change Office are rolling out an online tool that's intended for farmers, and ranchers themselves. We call this \"COMET-Farm\" - the Carbon Management and Evaluation Tool.This online tool is the next generation of our ongoing efforts to develop user-friendly tools to help farmers understand the greenhouse gas footprints of their operations.Producers will input information about their land and current and past management practices to establish a baseline. The tool will let them select from a list of alternative conservation practices to see how each one changes their greenhouse gas emissions and carbon capture. For example, a producer planning to implement conservation tillage could estimate how that conservation practice will increase soil carbon, and decrease emissions for the operation overall.Used in this way, COMET-Farm can help producers reach decisions that reduce energy costs, while building carbon stocks in the soil. It would also serve as a gateway for future efforts to help producers participate in voluntary carbon markets.These new NRCS tools build on a campaign for soil health at USDA - because we know that healthy soil can absorb a significant amount of carbon, and help greatly in mitigating climate threats. By improving soil health we can simultaneously improve productivity, protect water resources, improve biodiversity, reduce erosion and help put carbon back into the ground where it belongs.We also know that healthy soils are more resilient soils. Each pound of soil organic matter in the soil can hold 18-20 pounds of water - helping make farms more resilient to periods of drought and other weather extremes.That's why USDA has focused on helping our nation's farmers and ranchers through our campaign - called \"Unlock the Secrets in the Soil.\" We know that soil conservation practices help farmers - but they also help mitigate the impacts of a changing climate. Efforts like these will only be stronger as we ramp up new, regionally-focused information sharing efforts.Cover Crops:Third, USDA agencies have started working together to make new cover cropping methods available for producers, and to ensure that our agencies are working together to ensure these options are viable. For centuries, farmers have been using cover crops to prevent soil erosion, improve nutrient cycling, sustain soils and harness many other benefits.Cover crops also sequester a significant amount of carbon. However, some producers have encountered conflicting cover crop management issues when working with multiple USDA agencies.For example, there was a perception that crop insurance policies did not always allow cover crops - which conflicts with the NRCS incentives to plant cover crops. Some cover crop recommendations conflict with language in the Farm Bill for how the Farm Service Agency is to give commodity payments. That's a problem.Recently, USDA undertook an effort to ensure that farmers who plant cover crops have clarity from our Department. NRCS, RMA and FSA worked together this spring to establish a new common, science-based guidance on when cover crops should be terminated.The Administrators of these agencies engaged stakeholders, universities, and the crop insurance industry to figure out how to make cover crop straightforward and sensible.The result is new guidance - a new model that uses local climate , tillage management and soil to account for daily crop growth and use of soil moisture. With this information, experts determined the latest possible time to terminate a cover crop, to maximize carbon sequestration and at the same time minimize risk to the cash crop yield.For this new guidance, four cover crop termination zones have been established across the United States.These provide a regionally-appropriate approach to cover crops and the tools to identify the proper cover crop management in an area, taking into account local climate and cropping systems. We took the time needed to get this right - including truth-testing our recommendations with folks on the ground. Going forward - RMA, NRCS and FSA will all uniformly refer producers to these , and will use them to administer programs.With this consistent, science-based cover crop guidance, farmers will have more flexibility and a greater opportunity to utilize cover crops on their operations, while staying in compliance across all USDA agencies.They can reap the conservation and economic benefits that cover crops can provide - healthy soils and sustained food and fiber production. Producers will have a greater degree of certainty that they can use these practices, while still being eligible for crop insurance and other programs.I would note for folks that information on all of these new steps - our regional hubs, our new tools from NRCS, and these new steps with regard to cover crops - are available at our web site, www.usda.gov.These new tools and actions represent our comprehensive strategy for helping agriculture adapt to modern challenges.We'll continue to provide world-class research and tools for academic experts. Our plan reflects an understanding that farmers and ranchers have always been on the front lines of adaptation. We don't just want to tell folks there's a problem - we want to provide them with real information to create real solutions for specific threats.These efforts are also directly related to maintaining our abundant, productive agricultural sector, an effort that doesn't stop at the edge of the field.I want to share with you one more facet of this work that involves Americans from all walks of life. We spoke earlier about the tremendous productivity of American agriculture that keeps costs low for us at home, while helping us export around the world. Here's the bad news: estimates show that at least 30 percent of our food supply ends up wasted - and an estimated 133 billion pounds of food each year is not consumed.First, it's a major food security issue from the perspective that wasted food could be helping feed folks at food banks and shelters.Second, it's a natural resource issue. All of the resources that went into producing that wasted food - including the land, labor, water, pesticides, and fertilizers - could have been saved or gone to uses of higher value for society.And third, it's a climate change issue. EPA estimates that in the United States, food is the single largest component of municipal solid waste going to landfills - and that landfills are the third largest source of methane. You do the math. By reducing the amount of food we toss into the trash, we can help reduce methane emissions.Yesterday, I joined EPA Administrator Bob Perciasepe and leaders from across the U.S. food sector to announce the U.S. Food Waste Challenge. Together, we're calling on Americans across the nation to help us reduce the amount of food that ends up at the landfill, recover food that could be used to feed those in need, and recycle food waste wherever we can.Right now, we have a few founding partners onboard - and a predecessor effort by EPA has about 200 participant organizations. Our shared goal is to build momentum to fight food waste - by getting 400 partner organizations onboard the U.S. Food Waste Challenge by , and 1,000 by .At USDA, we're going to do our part. We've pledged to reduce waste in the school meals program, take new steps to educate consumers about food waste and food storage, and develop new technologies to reduce food waste. USDA will also work with industry leaders to streamline procedures for donating wholesome meat and poultry products that are misbranded. And at our food labs we will find better solutions for food waste by recycling food samples that have been inspected.By giving some extra thought to what we buy and how much we need, all of us can reduce our contributions to the nation's landfills. It's an adaptation strategy that everyone can help to create.All of this work represents the beginning stages and the first steps of an overarching focus on adaptation in the years ahead.Over the coming months and years, USDA intends to build partnerships with landowners - work with conservation groups, Tribes and local governments - and engage with ordinary Americans. We'll take more steps to mitigate and adapt to these challenges here in the United States, and around the world, and I look forward to sharing additional plans with you in the future.The bottom line today is that America's long history of innovation must continue.Our farmers and ranchers have proven over the course of generations that they're up to the task. And USDA has a strong history of support for their efforts.This will not be a short-term task, it won't be simple, but it's doable. That's why we need to prepare for the future today - to begin asking how we can work together to prepare agriculture for new challenges - and thereby put our food supply on a strong footing in the years to come.",

Support to residents includes job training, nutrition, health services, parenting and child care services and skills to move them into permanent housing. \nIt’s dark and damp November, Vermont’s least welcoming month. The brilliance of autumn is gone and the dazzle of snow is still around the corner. Brattleboro is no different than most other communities in Vermont, or just across the river in New Hampshire, where people are worried about jobs, paying for heat and groceries, or worse, finding a place to live. Just in time for winter, with help from USDA in Vermont, Morningside Shelter has completed an expansion project that will allow a 30 percent increase in residents. The homeless shelter’s Executive Director Paul Capcara noted, “We’ve been operating at full capacity year round for the last several years. We’ve been getting more calls than ever from people with children.”\nMorningside Shelter was founded by community members in with the mission to help eliminate homelessness by providing shelter, outreach, referral, intervention and transitional housing services. It’s the only homeless shelter in rural southwestern Vermont to specialize in housing placement with ongoing staff support and life skills development for both families and individuals. The shelter offers an extended stay and works collaboratively with area nonprofit and public agencies to help people connect to a wide range of services including: job training and placement; medical and mental health treatment; family and substance abuse counseling; budget management; nutrition; health education; parenting and child care services; and assistance in identifying and qualifying for subsidized housing opportunities.\nThe community involvement and support for the recent expansion was evident in the success of the fundraising campaign, which together with USDA Rural Development Community Facilities funding of $67,000, built two family-sized bedrooms, an extra bathroom, more living space, a dedicated area for children, and moved the laundry room and pantry from the basement to the first floor where they are accessible to all.\nWhile the building’s space expanded, its operating costs contracted, with the installation of a high-efficiency heating system, LED lighting, super-insulation and a passive solar design. Board member Gary Swindler noted that “Our primary goal for the expansion was to meet the growing community need for shelter space in a cost-effective, sustainable and environmentally sound manner. We’ve met that goal, and on time for winter.”\nWhile a recent resident pondered the future for her and her young family, she could relax a bit in the shelter of supporting staff, a nutritious meal that she helped prepare, and secure surroundings. “My son can play and I can keep an eye on him while I do my laundry.”\nTo find out how USDA can help your community achieve its goals click here.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Brattleboro\n Community Facilities\n Rural Development\n Vermont",

The funds were used to fix a leaking roof and plumbing, install new entry and storm doors, and build an outdoor ramp allowing Mr. Kauzlarich to come and go.\nWith the repairs completed, one of his first excursions was to resume his Memorial Day tradition last year.\nHis daughter told us, “This simple task was one that dad had done himself for well over 60 years, and it meant so much to him to again see that those soldiers were given their recognition!  This memorable ride was the first time in over three years that dad was able to leave the confines of his home.”\n“This means the world to dad and the Kauzlarich family! Knowing dad can safely get out of his house in case of an emergency eases my worries, too,” she continued.\nThis Memorial Day, USDA is proud to serve and recognize veterans like Mr. Leon Kauzlarich.

(Click to view a larger version)\nTrees do plenty of work to sequester carbon on their own, but many forests are not as healthy as they should be due to fire suppression and climate change. This can leave trees vulnerable to large scale insect damage, fire or drought, and much of the carbon stored by forests is lost to the atmosphere as trees die.\nThe U.S. Forest Service is committed to the storage of carbon using wood products through the green building and wood products strategy. This strategy involves putting people to work in rural communities, enhancing resiliency of our ecosystems, and sequestering carbon by promoting the use of wood products in large building construction.\nBy using wood instead of, or along with, concrete and steel, large amounts of carbon can be stored in the walls of homes and offices, significantly reducing emissions associated with the production of other materials. Also, using sustainable timber harvests for emerging wood product technologies like cross-laminated timber, can stimulate local economies in timber country while sequestering carbon in long-term wood products.\nCross laminated timber is a wood panel made of layers of dried lumber boards stacked in alternating directions, glued and pressed to form solid panels. These panels have extraordinary strength and are being used as walls, roofs, and floors. D.R. Johnson Mill in Riddle, Oregon announced recently that it will be the first U.S. mill certified to produce cross-laminated timber for high rise construction.\nPutting our own green building strategy to work, the Forest Service is working to increase the use of locally milled timber in all new agency buildings and facilities. Since , we have used wood to build the Angeles National Forest Supervisor’s Office, Camino Real Ranger Station, Corvallis Laboratory, Juneau Laboratory, and Enomee Ranger District Office.\nAnd in the private sector projects like the Bullitt Center in Seattle are showcasing the use of sustainable, Forest Stewardship Council certified wood products to efficiently create new buildings that will last and become testaments to sustainable forest management. The Bullitt Center sequesters 1,703 metric tons of carbon in its walls.\nThe trees in our national forests can help mitigate the effects of climate change in so many ways, and the Forest Service is committed to helping neighboring communities by promoting sustainable development with trees and wood.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Angeles National Forest\n Camino Real Ranger Station\n carbon\n carbon sequestration\n carbon storage\n Climate Change\n Corvallis Forestry Science Laboratory\n Enomee Ranger District Office\n Forestry\n Forests\n FS\n Juneau Laboratory\n Oregon\n trees\n Washington State\n wood",

According to USDA's first-ever Farm to School Census, in school year -, schools participating in farm to school activities purchased and served over $350 million in local food, with more than half of participating schools planning to purchase even more local foods in future school years.\"An investment in the health of America's students through farm to school activities is also an investment in the health of local economies,\" said Vilsack. \"We know that when students have experiences such as tending a school garden or visiting a farm they'll be more likely to make healthy choices in the cafeteria. We also know that when schools invest their food dollars in their local communities, all of agriculture benefits, including local farmers, ranchers, fishermen, food processors and manufacturers.\"Forty-three percent of public school districts across the country reported having an existing farm to school program in place, with another 13 percent of school districts surveyed committed to launching a farm to school program in the near future.Interest in local products spans the school meal tray, with fruits, vegetables, and milk topping the list of local products currently offered in schools across the country, while census respondents indicate an interest in local plant-based proteins, grains and flour, and meat and poultry in the future.Vilsack added that through these efforts, schools continue to enhance the health of the school food environment, meet the new meal standards implemented last school year and demonstrate the role local food can play in school meals.Census results can be accessed online, at www.fns.usda.gov/farmtoschool/census/. School districts that missed the opportunity earlier in the year to respond can submit information regarding farm to school practices through November 30, .USDA's Farm to School Program is part of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, which authorized USDA to assist eligible entities, through grants and technical assistance, to improve access to local foods in schools. It is also a core element of the USDA's Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative, which coordinates the Department's work on local food systems. In mid-November, USDA will announce approximately $5 million in FY Farm to School grants to help school districts across the country further develop their farm to school programming.USDA is focused on improving childhood nutrition and empowering families to make healthier food choices by providing science-based information and advice, while expanding the availability of healthy food.Collectively these policies and actions will help combat child hunger and obesity and improve the health and nutrition of the nation's children.

These Fellows are part of the Norman E. Borlaug Agricultural Science and Technology Fellows Program established by USDA in to honor Nobel Laureate Norman E. Borlaug. Grace Otitodun, a Borlaug Fellow from Nigeria, authored this blog post:\nLast month, I was honored to have the opportunity to attend the World Food Prize in Des Moines, Iowa as a fellow in the Borlaug 21st Century Leadership Program. The event saw participation from hundreds of leaders and experts in policy, industry, and research from all over the world, convened there to discuss global food security and agriculture.  Throughout the week, I encountered countless high-powered individuals who have been working tirelessly to achieve global food security by facilitating increased production among small-scale farmers.  They have made a compelling case for improving the effectiveness of U.S. investments in global food security and for addressing the troubling gap between population growth and food production.\nAn example of these investments to build long-term food security, my own research through the Borlaug Program has focused on an important aspect of the food supply: pre- and post-harvest losses.  From the time that seeds are planted to the time that farmers harvest and store their crops, good farming practices are essential to agricultural productivity.  Food security is compromised when farmers plant damaged seeds, leading to unviable crops; when poor farming practices result in a poor crop yield; or when improper storage and loss of crops prevent farmers from reaping the rewards of months of hard work.  Therefore, one clear way to help reduce global hunger is to reduce pre- and post-harvest losses.  My goal is to be able to find a lasting solution to the problem of postharvest grain storage faced by the farmers in my home country of Nigeria.\nEnvironmental and safety concerns have created a global drive toward reducing the use of synthetic pesticides for post-harvest storage, which has increased the need for safe, affordable, and easy-to-use alternatives.  With the support of USDA through the Borlaug Program, I am investigating naturally occurring materials, like botanicals and diatomaceous earth, which are readily available and locally sourced.  These materials can be used as post-harvest protection tools to prevent stored grains from being lost to insect pests.  So far, the results of my research have shown these materials to be highly effective as grain protectants. While further studies are necessary to ensure that these materials are safe for human consumption, it is encouraging to explore potential alternatives to synthetic pesticides that could help many farmers in developing countries protect their hard-earned food supply.\nAchieving global food security depends on how effectively farmers can manage all the stages of agricultural production.  Through the Feed the Future initiative and innovative research like that fostered through the Borlaug Program, we are finding ways to help farmers increase agricultural production safely and sustainably.  This kind of work has been pioneered by people such as Wangari Maathai, who strove to ensure that good stewardship of land could also lead to improved livelihoods among the most vulnerable people.  Leaders like Ms. Maathai and those I met last month in Des Moines have increased my desire and interest to deepen my research on food security through effective post-harvest practices.\nYou can also read this post on the USAID Impact Blog.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Trade\n Tags:\n APLU\n Borlaug 21st Century Leadership Program\n Borlaug Fellowship Program\n Hunger\n Norman Borlaug Fellowship\n USDAID\n World Food Prize",

As NASS’ Dairy Products point out every year, Wisconsin farmers produce more cheese than any other state, producing more than ates. That’s nearly 3 billion pounds of cheese a year!\nOf course Wisconsin farming is more than just dairy. Our farmers are also the top cranberry growers in the nation. According to the latest census, our farmers harvested more than 20,000 acres of these berries. Lesser known is that our farmers are also responsible for most of the U.S. ginseng production.\nWisconsin is also the state when it comes to corn for silage production. That’s not surprising considering the size of our livestock industry. Overall, we had nearly 3.5 million head in our cattle and calve herd in . We also have nearly 3.5 million turkeys and more than 13 million chickens.\nAll of these sides of our agriculture are tended to by just under 70,000 farmers. In , this relatively small group cared for of more than 14.5 million acres of Wisconsin land and sold more than $11.7 billion worth of agricultural products. It costs quite a bit to raise these products with production expenses surpassing $9.4 billion in . Clearly farmers love taking care of land and they love farming itself.\nThere are even more interesting sides of Wisconsin agriculture that the Census highlight, so feel free to check it out at www.agcensus.usda.gov.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Census of Agriculture\n cheese\n cranberries\n dairy\n Farmers\n Livestock\n NASS\n Wisconsin",

The model will enhance or restore habitat for at-risk, threatened and endangered species while supporting working lands in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah. The program builds on existing partnerships with landowners in the Southwest to support habitat improvement for the Southwestern willow flycatcher, along with 83 other species that depend on the same riparian ecosystem. This action will result in healthier ranges, more productive ranches, and more robust rural economies.\"By focusing on predictability on an ecosystem level, we will bring together an even larger group of agricultural producers in the Southwest to create habitat for the flycatcher and other wildlife,\" said NRCS Chief Jason Weller. \"These efforts will not only support the many species that depend on this riparian ecosystem, but also help ranchers move to more sustainable grazing systems and give them the support they need to keep their lands working.\"\"These efforts will help ensure not only the long-term health of ecosystems and countless species vital to the West, but they will assist rural landowners and provide tangible benefits to local economies,\" said FWS Director Dan Ashe. \"The Service has a long record of working with federal and state agencies and private landowners in creating holistic, long-term solutions such as this.\"These efforts are part of the Working Lands for Wildlife (WLFW) partnership between NRCS and FWS, which helps create habitat on working landscapes for seven different at-risk, threatened or endangered species, including the flycatcher. Through WLFW, producers who maintain conservation prac¬tices and systems that benefit the targeted species will be covered for any incidental take that may occur as a result of the conservation activities for up to 30 years.Over the past three years, NRCS has worked with landowners in these six states to restore or enhance more than 7,000 acres of riparian land that the Southwestern willow flycatcher relies on for nesting habitat. Expansion of this program will engage more landowners by providing incentives for six additional conservation practices. It will also expand the scale of the program by providing predictability under the Endangered Species Act for 83 species in addition to the flycatcher. Some of the other species that share riparian habitat with the flycatcher in the Southwest include the New Mexico meadow jumping mouse, yellow-billed cuckoo, Chiricahua leopard frog and the Least Bell's vireo.The six new conservation practices available through WLFW for the flycatcher include: installation of a stream crossing, pumping plant, micro-irrigation system or livestock shelter; mulching; and planting for species habitat. These are among the supporting conservation practices that NRCS offers to ranchers.This effort builds on the historic success of voluntary conservation practices on private lands that benefit wildlife while supporting working lands. Recently, due in large part to proactive steps by private landowners, FWS delisted the Oregon chub, the first fish species to be delisted due to recovery. Listing the Arctic grayling was not because of similarly successful efforts to improve aquatic habitat. Additionally, through their partnership in the Sage Grouse Initiative, the agencies have seen gains in habitat creation for the greater sage-grouse through which private landowners have restored 4.4 million acres over the past five years – an area twice the size of Yellowstone National Park.For more on technical and financial assistance available through conservation programs, visit www.nrcs.usda.gov/GetStarted or a local USDA service center. is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

        "content": "in\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Apr 18, \n The Farm Bill has already set in motion and accomplished so much for our country. With historic support for specialty crop producers across the country, the bill will touch every one of our lives through one of the most basic of human needs: food.\nSpecialty crops make up the bulk of what we eat—all of our fruits and vegetables, tree nuts and dried fruits—as well as things like cut flowers and nursery crops. They are half of MyPlate at every meal, and the daily source for most of our vitamins and nutrients. For many in rural America, these crops not only provide nutrition, they are also a primary source of income.\nFor nearly a decade, USDA supported specialty crop growers across the country through the Specialty Crop Block Grant (SCBG) program. These grants enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops, sustain the livelihood of American farmers, and strengthen rural economies.\nLast year, the program provided $55 million for 700 state-selected projects nationwide that contributed to food safety improvements, increased access to healthy food, and provided new research to help growers increase profitability and sustainability. The new farm bill expands support through the SCBG program to more than $66 million in grants for specialty crop growers—a historic high.\nWith projects focusing on everything from food safety to business planning, the block grants are designed to increase the long-term success of producers and broaden the market for specialty crops.  Many states select projects that dovetail with community needs, such as establishing farm to school programs, providing training in good agricultural handling practices (GAP), creating organic and sustainable production practices, and developing food hubs that will increase opportunities for small-scale growers.\nIn Michigan, a grant helped the state Department of Agriculture and Resource Development work with partners to increase sales opportunities for specialty crop farmers in Southeast Michigan. They were able to identify and overcome barriers that prevented schools from purchasing products directly from local farmers, and ended up increasing the sales of apples, cucumbers, peppers, red potatoes, broccoli and several other crops within their state.\nAnother grant in Idaho established a partnership between the state Department of Agriculture and Boise State University-Tech to provide workshops that helped improve food safety and implement sustainable production practices for onions, potatoes, apples, cherries, peas and lentils. The project resulted in higher audit scores, increased efficiency and sustainability for participating companies, which both improve consumer confidence and help producers’ bottom lines in the long run.\nOur dedication to strengthening rural America and increasing opportunities for specialty crop farmers will help keep our nation’s economy—and people—healthy for years to come. This week, we made the next round of SCBG funds available so that states can begin funding projects. If you’re interested in applying, I encourage you to contact your state department of agriculture.

SCEP provides work experience that is directly related to the student's academic program or career aspirations and gives students exposure to public service while enhancing their educational goals.\nThe civil engineering majors are rising seniors at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez and have a passion for engineering. Both are members of the student chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers, where they serve as treasurer and secretary, respectively.\nThe students were introduced to the Forest Service last year when they interned at the agency’s Southern Region headquarters in Atlanta, Ga. There, they were given a crash course on how engineering worked within the agency and assisted with inspections within the national forests.\nThe energetic duo took what they learned in Atlanta and put it into practice to deliver results in Asheville, N.C. this summer. They were instrumental in developing an application for a $7 million grant to repair many of the damaged roads in the Nantahala, Pisgah, Uwharrie and Croatan National Forests in North Carolina.\nThey transferred sketches made of the damaged roads to an Auto-CAD, which is used to produce more technical computerized models of the damaged areas. These models are crucial in formulating proposals needed to obtain the grant and to determine how best to repair the roads.\nVangas and Rodriguez said interning with the Forest Service has been an engaging and insightful experience. They enjoyed working in Atlanta last year and the city life that comes with it. They said it has been particularly interesting working in Asheville, N.C. because of its close proximity to the national forests. This proximity provided them with more field work experience and to see the environment that they are affecting.\n“It has been really easy to adjust here because everyone has been so welcoming,” Rodriguez said.\nRodriguez chose to intern with the Forest Service because of the diversity of opportunities.  “Working with the Forest Service provides two work scenarios – both field and office work,” she explained.\nVangas echoed these sentiments. “It’s nice using our technical skills to help improve the forests,” she said.\nAlthough they are unsure about what they want to do after graduation, both say they would like to continue working for the Forest Service in civil engineering. They enjoyed learning from and meeting a lot of new people who have been influential on paving their road to becoming civil engineers and perhaps future Forest Service employees.\nFor more information about SCEP and other Forest Service student programs, contact your local Forest Service Human Resources office.\nInterns Hanniah Rodriguez (left) and Angeliz Vangas.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA's rich science and research portfolio.University of California – BerkeleyMy mouth begins to water just thinking about all the delicious fruits and vegetables I will enjoy this coming weekend celebrating the Fourth of July. And we’re lucky here in Northern California to have a wealth of fresh produce grown locally.\nMany stores, restaurants and even schools aren’t taking advantage of this local supply. This past spring, with support from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture and in coordination with the University of California Cooperative Extension Service, I started a project to open up new markets for local growers by connecting them with new buyers. In particular, we worked with strawberry growers of Southeast Asian descent in the Sacramento and Fresno regions. This is part of a larger program to increase the economic viability of Southeast Asian farms in California's Central Valley through on-farm research and training in crop production, pest management, food safety and marketing.\nMost of the 95 strawberry farm stands in the Sacramento region are owned by Hmong and Mien refugees from Laos, who turned to farming when they immigrated to the United States after the Vietnam War. They sell most of their product at farm stands, but during peak season demand can’t keep up with production. With limited language skills, most farmers can’t access new markets and leave the fruit to rot in the field.\nIn partnership with local produce distributor, Produce Express, and several nonprofits including the Community Alliance with Family Farms, the Alchemist Community Development Corporation and Soil Born Farms Urban Agriculture and Education Project, we now bring fresh, local strawberries into children’s school lunches, restaurants and low-income neighborhoods. Some farmers deliver direct to the schools, allowing children to consume berries picked just hours before.\nWe also want to reduce “food miles” or the distance food must travel from farm to fork. We created a Google map to help residents find their closest farm stand. Sacramento-area residents are able to enjoy fresh strawberries from farms located less than 10 miles from their residences.\nThis year, twelve local strawberry farmers sold an additional 4,600 cases of berries beyond their own farm stands, earning a combined $58,000. These additional revenues are a welcome relief for these small farmers, who on average gross $15,000 in a good year. These partnerships are a win-win solution for both small farmers and residents, especially low income residents and school children, who have greater access to fresh, nutritious, local food.\nFresh, local strawberries are now available to more than 60,000 school children through a partnership between local growers, the Sacramento School District and the University of California Cooperative Extension Service.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Farms\n Food\n Fresno\n KYF2\n local\n NIFA\n Nutrition\n Sacramento\n Science",

Scientists have shown that these dietary differences can affect the development of genes in the unborn children.\nThis post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research profile. \n“High tech” isn’t always about images from outer space or a new computer technology, or even the genetic composition of a key crop.\nAgricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists are using a high-tech science called “epigenetics”—which means “above genetics”—to help achieve something even more wonderful: a healthier future for our children.\nEpigenetic mechanisms in our bodies are accepted as likely having a role in human disease, including cardiovascular disorders, type 2 diabetes, obesity and even certain kinds of cancer.\nThese epigenetic mechanisms don’t change the DNA sequence of our genes, but they do change in the way those genes function.  This includes the influence of a mother-to-be’s nutritional status on the lifelong health of her baby.\nIn an earlier laboratory study, ARS scientists tracked weight gains among baby rats whose mothers were either lean or overweight before conception and throughout pregnancy.\nAll the baby rats were of normal weight at birth and at weaning.  But when the weaned offspring were given free access to high-fat rations, the babies from the overweight mothers gained significant more weight than the babies born to the lean mothers.\nNow ARS scientists have extended their epigenetics studies to women in three villages in the West African nation of The Gambia.  They focused on an epigenetics mechanism called DNA methylation, which is important for cell development and stabilizing cell function.\nIn studies of 50 healthy children in the villages, the researchers showed that DNA methylation levels were higher at regions of five genes in children conceived during the peak rainy season months of August and September, when the Gambian mothers would have had less access to food because the previous year’s harvest would be running out.\nTwo of the five genes in which elevated DNA methylation occurred are associated with disease: Tourette’s syndrome and hypothyroidism.  Since the children were about 9 years old when tested, the researchers think the epigenetic effects will likely be permanent.\nThis study emphasizes the importance of good nutrition for a future mom, not just during pregnancy, but even in the period before she becomes pregnant, to help ensure better lifelong health for her baby.\nOn National Ag Day, USDA's Research, Education, and Economics science agencies are sharing four blogs highlighting the importance of innovation and research to food and agriculture.

We have abundant food that costs us less to produce, on a per unit basis, than almost any other country in the world. Our farmers and ranchers produce more than we need, allowing us to be a powerhouse in global exports. And our food supply is among the safest of all the world’s nations.\nAll that abundance and security has been underpinned by science and know-how.  Between the s and the s, agriculture science blossomed in what has become known as the Green Revolution. Thanks to the research done by Norman Borlaug, the “Father of the Green Revolution,” working with researchers around the world, developed high-yielding varieties and modern production practices that helped save untold numbers of people from starvation.\nToday, agriculture scientists are once again facing the need to create the kind of success through science that Dr. Borlaug achieved – this time with an even greater challenge:  increasing production by 70% by during a time of natural resource limitations and climate variability. The United Nations has projected the world population to grow to over 9 billion people by .  Today, over 800,000 people are hungry around the globe, an improvement but still unacceptable.   To meet this challenge, in President Obama launched with other G-8 Leaders the “Agriculture and Food Security Initiative”, collectively committing $22 billion in new investments in agriculture and nutrition.  The Feed the Future Initiative is the United State’s effort to support this global effort; the first Feed the Future Progress Report will be released this Thursday at the World Food Prize Foundation’s Borlaug Symposium by USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah.\nIn addition, the G-20 has played a critical role in increasing market transparency and supporting agricultural development.  I recently led the U.S. Government’s delegation to the first-ever Meeting of Agricultural Chief Scientists, convened from an initiative of the G20 and hosted by the Mexican government. For the first time, the people in charge of their countries’ food and natural resources science agencies sat together in a room and forged agreements on how to determine the most crucial priorities for our nations, working together, in the coming years so that we can meet this global food challenge.\nWe discussed “blue sky” ideas – the wish list ag researchers think may have the greatest potential to transform our ability to meet food needs while conserving precious natural resources: finding ways for plants to fix nitrogen from the air into their tissues, thus decreasing harmful run-off of fertilizers into watersheds; discovering methods to turn annual crops into perennials that don’t need replanting, to reduce soil erosion, labor costs and  fossil fuel inputs; and determining solutions to preserve our precious water supply.  We agreed upon the urgency of this fundamental research as well as coordinating our research to make the best use of limited government funds.\nPerhaps the most important development from the meeting, though, was our agreement to break down the walls between our scientific communities, and use online global platforms to share genomic and genetic , improve agricultural innovation systems, and open access to scholarly publications and other technical documentation. We recognize the common goal we share and know that none of us will reach it on our own – and we don’t have time to waste.\nScience is most successful when it’s done in a collaborative, coordinated manner. New technologies and information sharing opportunities give us the tools we need to work together and use the multiplier effect of our expertise to speed progress on this urgently needed agenda.\nLastly, we also recognized the need to support agricultural research.\nScientists around the globe are ready, willing and able to address the challenge of feeding the world. It requires the sustained commitment of stakeholders and investors around the world to meet the call to action this World Food Day represents.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Borlaug Fellowship Program\n Dr. Catherine Woteki\n Feed the Future\n Norman Borlaug Fellowship\n President Obama\n Rajiv Shah\n Science\n World Food Day",

Check back next week for another spotlight on another state and the results of the Census of Agriculture.\nThe Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture.\nKentucky and cattle have always been a perfect match, and as the most recent Census of Agriculture shows that bond remains to this day. In , the year for which we conducted the Census, Kentucky farmers sold more than $1 billion worth of cattle and calves.\nBeef cattle production has become an increasingly important sector for many farms transitioning away from tobacco production. Overall, about half of all farms in Kentucky owned cattle in . That’s not surprising, considering we have some of the best cattle pasture in the United States.\nWhile cattle have a long history in Kentucky, poultry production has emerged as a leading agriculture activity in the last 25 years. Broiler production on 826 Kentucky farms in totaled 761 billion head ranking the state 7th nationally.\nKentucky, of course, is known for horses and in horse and pony sales were $178 million. This does not count the many horses born and raised on Kentucky farms, but owned by out of state interests, most of which are the thoroughbreds that made the Kentucky Derby so famous.\nWhile livestock is an important element of our agriculture, there are plenty of other sides to Kentucky farming. After all, in , our farmers and ranchers sold more than $5 billion worth of agricultural products, with nearly $2.3 billion coming from crop sales. Expansion of the Kentucky Proud ™ brand for Kentucky's agricultural products has also increased agricultural diversification.\nIn Kentucky, soybeans and corn are the top crops.  Nearly 1.47 million acres of farmland were dedicated to soybeans, with farmers selling more than $752 million worth of the crop in . Corn was harvested from 1.53 million acres while sales totaled $694 million.\nAnd then there’s tobacco, which continues to be an important crop. Despite the continuing decrease in farms raising tobacco, Kentucky still has the largest number of tobacco farms in the United States. In , more than 4,500 of our farms grew this crop. This is a significant drop from the more than 8,000 tobacco farms the Census counted in , but we still have nearly 3 times as many farms as North Carolina, which is in distant second place in this category.\nAs you can see, Kentucky has a strong presence of all aspects of U.S. agriculture. Our livestock and our crops sectors both have something special to highlight. Agriculture keeps evolving, and as we have seen, our farmers adjust right along with the industry and continue to maintain a strong presence in the Bluegrass State. In just a few short years, we’ll conduct the Census of Agriculture to see how our agriculture continues to move forward.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nAmerican farmers have a long history of overcoming obstacles. In , they helped the country emerge from the Dust Bowl by switching to contour plowing and eradicated the boll weevil forty years later by employing integrated pest management techniques.  In both cases – and many others – USDA was there to help farmers achieve success.\nMany of the obstacles they face today are on a much larger scale, associated with climate change and seasonal weather variability. USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is helping farmers get the tools they need to meet those challenges.\nNIFA provided a $5 million Agriculture and Food Research Initiative grant in to Purdue University to lead a multi-institutional effort to provide farmers with online tools that could make their crop-related decisions easier.  Today, the resulting “Useful to Usable” (U2U) project is helping Corn Belt farmers improve their resilience and profitability amid the irregular weather conditions of a changing climate. The U2U project takes existing weather and then provides the information in formats that farmers can use to manage their crops – what, when, and where to plant; fertilizing; irrigating; and more.\nThe U2U team consisted of Purdue, Iowa State University, Michigan State University, South Dakota State University, University of Illinois, University of Michigan, University of Missouri, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and University of Wisconsin.\n“Developing solutions to the complex problems associated with agricultural production and climate change requires many skill sets and also localized knowledge,” said Melissa Widhalm, U2U project manager at Purdue. “While the entire Midwest is growing corn, specific regions have unique climate characteristics, farm management strategies, and social factors that must be considered. By bringing together a diversity of experts from across the region we can accomplish work that no single university could do alone.“\n“The goal of U2U is to develop a dashboard of tools that people can use for decision-making, not only within the season but also when looking ahead at multiple seasons,” explained Dennis Todey, South Dakota State University’s U2U program director.\nAccording to Todey, U2U contains various web-based tools, including the Corn Growing Degree Days (GDD). Most plants, including corn, develop at rates that are dependent upon how much warmth they receive each day. GDD is a mathematical formula (based on daily temperatures) that determines how many units of heat the corn accumulates over the course of the growing season. Farmers can then use that to compare how their crops are actually performing and when they may reach maturity compared to potential freeze conditions. U2U’s GDD method has proven to be helpful in both food safety and economic growth for farmers.\nFarmers select the location and time when corn is planted and determine the amount of days it will take to reach maturity. According to Todey, the program then assesses the development compared to a 30-year average to project tasseling and maturity dates.\n“The GDD tool has been particularly useful this year because of delayed planting and overall cool summer conditions.  Producers have been able to review where they are in development and how likely corn is to reach maturity.  Producers can then make decision on chopping corn for silage, changing marketing decisions, or propane purchases for corn drying needs,” said Todey.\nAnother U2U decision support tool is the Climate Patterns Viewer (CPV).  CPV gives a historic view of how El Nino weather patterns and Arctic Oscillations have influenced corn yield across the Corn Belt.  The CPV map shows how these weather events have affected temperature, precipitation, and deviations in yield from -.\n“This is very timely, since we’re looking at a pending El Nino,” Todey said. “Farmers are now able to track the potential weather month by month and better understand how oscillations effect temperature changes, precipitation and crop yielding.”\nThrough federal funding and leadership for research, education, and extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people’s daily lives and the nation’s future.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Agriculture and Food Research Initiative\n Climate Change\n Farmers\n Illinois\n Iowa State University\n Michigan State University\n Missouri\n Nebraska\n NIFA\n Science Tuesday\n South Dakota\n University of Wisconsin",

(iStock photo)\nToday’s guest blog features the USDA-NIFA Food Virology Collaborative (NoroCORE- Norovirus Collaborative for Outreach, Research, and Education), a food safety initiative with the ultimate goal to reduce the burden of foodborne disease associated with viruses, particularly noroviruses. Norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States accounting for around 5 million of the 21 million annual cases associated with contaminated foods. Cost of illness is estimated to be billions of dollars per year.\nBy Dr. Elizabeth Bradshaw, NoroCORE extension associate, and Dr. Lee-Ann Jaykus, NoroCORE scientific director\nEven if you have not experienced a norovirus infection personally (consider yourself fortunate!), you probably know someone who has or have heard of an outbreak of the “stomach flu.”  Most people know norovirus by its symptoms: a couple of memorable days of vomiting and diarrhea, sometimes with a fever and a headache.\nThese maladies are caused by 27-nanometer viruses—tiny, even by virus standards.  The norovirus “bugs” are so good at infecting us that they have been called the “Perfect Human Pathogen.”  It is so virulent that a person can become sick within a few hours of consuming as few as 20 virus particles.  There are about ates alone, with about 800 deaths.\nThe NoroCORE team has taken up the challenge to understand and control food borne virus risks.  Led by North Carolina State, NoroCORE is a multi-disciplinary collaborative of 30 researchers who are top scientists in the fields of basic, food and environmental virology from 25 universities.  Their goal is to reduce the burden of foodborne illness associated with viruses.  NIFA supports the project with a $25 million Agriculture and Food Research Initiative grant.\nNoroCORE’s six primary objectives are molecular virology, detection, epidemiology and risk analysis; prevention and control; extension and outreach; and education and capacity building. Collaborators work with each other, often across institutions and disciplines, which leads to the development of better tools and skills as well as shared resources and knowledge.\nNoroCORE also has a massive outreach component with input from more than 200 stakeholders that includes members of government and public health agencies, food production and safety groups, restaurant and cruise line industries, manufacturers of sanitation and hygiene products, testing laboratories, and a variety of commodity and trade organizations. This was an integral part of NoroCORE’s design to ensure that the research being done is immediately applicable to real-world needs. Education is also a component of NoroCORE because knowledge must be shared to be useful.\nNIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Agriculture and Food Research Initiative\n Food Safety\n foodborne illness\n NIFA\n norovirus\n North Carolina State University",

However, these areas endure chronic poverty, limited opportunities and countless other economic challenges.  For instance, most of the 1,100 residents of Boley, Oklahoma – located in the heart of Creek nation – live on less than 25 dollars per day.\nEarlier this year, I joined Leslie Wheelock, Director of USDA’s Office of Tribal Relations, on a visit to the area.\n Doug O'Brien, Acting Under Secretary, Rural Development\n Posted in\n Rural\n Jun 25, \n Respond to this story",

Both stops gave me a first-hand view of the challenges these farmers face. We discussed how USDA can further help them with available resources. While the discussion centered on concerns over water supply, I was heartened to see that the Natural Resources Conservation Service’s (NRCS) recommended conservation practices have helped them better prepare for the state’s historic water shortage.\nDuring the first stop, I visited with a distinguished dairyman and conservationist in Marin County, Bob Giacomini, and his four daughters, who operate the Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese Company. Driving over the hill towards Bob’s milking complex, I could see the pastures had little, if any, grass. In talking to Bob, he said that typically the grass would be at least two feet tall by now. He has real concerns about having enough forage for his cows. I also spoke with Paul Bianchi, who had joined us.  Paul owns a dairy operation in neighboring Sonoma County and, like Bob, is very concerned about his ability to feed his cows. Both discussed the real possibility that they may have to sell some of their herd.\nBob and his daughters have diversified their operation, turning a sustainable dairy farm into an artisan cheese company as well. They have worked with NRCS to adopt conservation practices to protect water quantity, manage their manure and work toward operating the dairy \"off the grid.\" Recently, they installed an anaerobic digester that converts methane from manure decomposition into an alternative energy source that powers nearly all of the dairy. The practice not only helps them protect the nearby lagoon, but also the Point Reyes National Seashore. And it produces fertilizer they can spread on their pastures or sell to local nurseries. The Giacomini’s operation stands as a model for sustainable conservation in the dairy industry.\nNext, I visited Giovannoni Vineyards, in nearby Napa County, run by Dave Troppy. This small family vineyard operates about 40 acres, producing high-quality grapes for Napa vintners. With the help of NRCS, the family installed a suite of conservation practices to conserve water. Dave walked me to the vineyard's reservoir, which normally this time of year is about 20 feet deep.  That day we could have walked across it. He told me he had just enough water for one more round of irrigation.\nDave and his family are constantly looking for ways to maximize their available water. They have worked with NRCS to use water management techniques to assess the appropriate amount of water to apply in the correct intervals, and the use of a permanent cover crop and mulch to increase the soil's health and water holding capacity. They also continually visit with the local Farm Bureau, wine grape growers association and others to find ways to work together to get through this dry period. Together, they have considered a number of innovative approaches, including creating a community composting site.\nEach of these farmers was clear-eyed about the challenge ahead. They recognize that droughts are part of California’s history and will be part of their future.  While they are very concerned about the effect of the state’s most severe drought on record, they haven’t given up hope and are eager to invest in conservation practices that will allow them to mitigate the effects of this and future droughts. What I saw in California underscores the importance of having the full array of tools and programs so that USDA can help meet the needs of farmers in California and across the country.  It underscores the importance of the federal government working collaboratively under President Obama’s new National Drought Resilience Partnership to help states and rural communities build their resilience now and in the future.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Ann Mills\n California\n Conservation\n cover crops\n drought\n Farmers\n NRCS\n President Obama\n rural communities",

The families, from left, are Yvonne Hernandez, Pedro and Omaira Ruiz, Mary and Silvino Castillo, Brenda McGuire and Patsy Perdue.\nThis project began several years ago when Kentucky Highlands received a Rural Development Section 523 Mutual Self Help Housing grant for $250,000 in April . That money was designated for technical assistance to help 12 families that wanted to help build new homes.\nThe selected families also were approved for Rural Development 502 Direct Loan funds, in addition to forgivable loans from FAHE, to pay for the cost of building the homes.\nThe self-help housing “sweat equity” concept is not new. Organized self-help housing started with the Quakers a number of years ago. This became a tradition of rural people, who had the determination and help of neighbors, to construct barns, homes and schools that became American’s rural communities.\nThe Section 523 program is used primarily to help very low and low-income households build their own homes and is targeted to families who are unable to buy clean, safe housing through conventional methods.\nFamilies participating in a mutual self-help project perform approximately 65 percent of the construction labor on each other’s homes under qualified supervision, and the reduced labor costs make it easier for the families to own a home. Another great advantage of this program is that mortgage payments can be “rolled into” the loan for families who can’t afford to make them while the house is being built.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n homeownership\n Kentucky\n Monticello\n Mutual Self-Help Housing grant\n Rural Development",

Leopold’s ability to communicate, by untangling the complex world around us into stories that we could easily understand and internalize, distinguishes his contribution to conservation.\nLeopold is most widely known for his collection of essays Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There originally published in .\nThe fact that Leopold is still recognized as one of conservation’s leaders serves as testimony to the clarity, credibility, and depth of experience in his work.\nLeopold based his writings upon extensive experience working the land. He spent the first twenty years of his career employed by the Forest Service, first in the southwest and later at the Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, Wis. Through hard won experience he gained an understanding of the myriad ways that elements of forest ecosystems interacted and the wisdom in forest conservation.\nAldo Leopold’s Forest Service career began in , as a ranger on the Apache National Forest in the Arizona Territory. (Photo courtesy Aldo Leopold Foundation)\n“When the pioneer hewed a path for progress through the American wilderness, there was bred into the American people the idea that civilization and forests were two mutually exclusive propositions…A stump was our symbol of progress,” he wrote in from New Mexico, where he worked on the Gila National Forest. “We have since learned, with some pains, that extensive forests are not only compatible with civilization, but absolutely essential to its highest development.”\nLeopold’s early recognition of keeping and restoring biological diversity and ecological processes became central to his evolution of thought on the environment.\nWhat Aldo Leopold teaches us today more than ever is the benefit that comes from slowing down and taking the time to listen to nature. In today’s world, being quiet is a valuable commodity; taking time to stop and listen for those minute details outdoors that weave a tapestry of stories all around us is a rewarding experience if we but stop and pay attention.\nAldo Leopold (Photo courtesy Aldo Leopold Foundation)\nLeopold could read a landscape, just as well as we can read his prose, but he did not try to keep this knowledge to himself; instead he tirelessly worked on communicating the knowledge he had accumulated to those around him.\nImparting this understanding became his way to serve the land, his motive always to promote conservation of natural resources as demonstrated in his oft quoted statement, “We love (and make intelligent use of) what we have learned to understand.”\nAs we remember the anniversary of Leopold’s birth, let us celebrate his unabashed enthusiasm and persistence in protecting and improving this land we all share.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Aldo Leopold\n Faces of the Forest\n Forest Products Laboratory\n Forestry\n FS\n Gila National Forest\n Madison\n Wisconsin",

The Obama Administration housing's policies are helping to strengthen rural communities and driving the nation's ongoing economic recovery forward.\"National Homeownership Month is celebrated every year in June. Throughout the month, USDA will hold events to highlight the ways Rural Development programs provide affordable homeownership opportunities.Rural Development has programs to help people refinance as well as buy homes. In February, Secretary Vilsack announced a 19-state pilot program for homeowners to get lower monthly mortgage payments. The refinance program is available to rural residents with mortgages issued or backed by USDA Rural Development. It is part of President Obama's ongoing efforts to help middle-class families, create jobs and strengthen the economy. It will save homeowners time and money and help ensure that hardworking, creditworthy borrowers protect their investment and remain in their homes.USDA also provides loans and grant funds to help rural homeowners repair their homes and to assist affordable rural rental property owners repair their properties. The Secretary announced last month that USDA is accepting grant applications from qualified organizations for repairs, health, safety and accessibility improvements. The application deadline is June 25. For information on how to apply, please see page 9 of the May 9, Federal Register or go to noted that Rural Development's housing portfolio is sound. It does not include subprime and exotic loans such as so-called \"no doc\" loans. USDA uses solid underwriting criteria to ensure borrowers are able to repay their loans. By doing so, we're helping to keep people in their homes.Since the start of the Obama Administration, USDA has helped more than 520,000 rural families buy a home. For example, Rural Development helped Theresa Jetland of Ilwaco, Wash., buy her first home. Jetland, a single working mother raising two teenagers, qualified to buy a home after she completed a local program that helps low- and moderate-income renters obtain employment that will lead to economic independence. Jetland bought a home guaranteed by USDA Rural Development and received payment assistance from the Longview Housing Authority.Vilsack noted that In Fiscal year , approximately 17 percent of Single Family Housing homeownership and repair opportunities were provided to individuals and families that identified themselves as members of minority groups. Over 25,500 of the home loans or home improvement grants or loans obligated (made) by USDA went to minority homeowners.Owning a home is the American Dream. For more than 60 years, USDA has helped rural residents realize this dream through guaranteed (by lender partners) and direct loans. USDA Rural Development has funds available now through the Single Family Housing Direct Loan program to help low-income rural families become homeowners.

USDA Forest Service photo by Deborah Lee Soltesz\nAmericans hit the slopes about 57 million times a year, and when they go, they spend billions of dollars.\nThe USDA Forest Service plays a role in this industry — a big one. The National Forest System is home to 122 ski resorts. That’s just a quarter of the total across the U.S. Despite this, nearly half the visits from skiers are to resorts on national forests.\nSo besides being on a national forest, how does the whole thing work?\n“The Forest Service manages the land, performs environmental analysis, and issues special use permits to operators that build and maintain facilities,” said Sean Wetterberg, Winter Sports Program Manager for the USDA Forest Service.\nThis arrangement has allowed for $5 billion in private investments on national forests. These investments might be in the form of new construction, improvement, or repairs of buildings and infrastructure. Beyond that, operating and maintaining resorts takes staffing, and that means more than 41,000 full- and part-time jobs.\nWhile many Forest Service programs, including timber, grazing, and energy production, generate revenue for the U.S. Treasury, ski areas regularly outperform them all.\nAs visitors support resorts through purchases of lift tickets, food, equipment rentals, and merchandise, the ski areas pay fees to the United States Treasury based on their revenue. This has resulted in the American people earning $45 million in fees in alone. While many Forest Service programs, including timber, grazing, and energy production, generate revenue for the U.S. Treasury, ski areas regularly outperform them all.\nSpending is not limited to the resorts, though. Many of the rural communities surrounding the forest and the resorts benefit from these visitors, and, according to Wetterberg, they can be big spenders.\n“Those coming for skiing tend to spend more than most — about $3 billion every year,” said Wetterberg.\nThe visitor numbers and economics of winter sports on national forests are impressive. More impressive still is that national forests are home to world-class winter sports events.\nSmokey Bear at the World Alpine Ski Championships on the Beaver Creek Resort, White River National Forest.

We believe that people with different backgrounds and views will make the work of these committees, and thus of USDA, more effective.\nApplicants should represent a U.S. entity with an interest in agricultural trade and have expertise and knowledge of agricultural trade as it relates to policy and commodity-specific issues. For example, Robert Anderson of Sustainable Strategies LLC has served at different points in time on both the Fruits and Vegetables ATAC and the Processed Foods ATAC. Of his experience, Anderson said, “I had the opportunity to meet directly with the highest levels of international trade leadership in the United States and globally. Most importantly, the U.S. government actually seeks our input, listens, and responds to the needs and expectations of the U.S. agricultural industry.”\nAt a time when our economy is trying to rebound from a serious recession, having a voice on one of these committees can make a significant impact on the government decisions that affect our economic future. That’s because agricultural trade plays an extremely important role in the health of our nation’s economy. U.S. agricultural exports have consistently contributed to the positive U.S. trade balance, creating jobs and boosting economic growth. In fiscal , U.S. agricultural exports were forecast to reach a record $137 billion, which supported more than one million jobs in America this year.\nWhen you serve on one of these seven committees, you receive briefings by the Secretary of Agriculture and the U.S. Trade Representative and are asked for your views on a wide range of agricultural trade issues. For example, former members of these committees served as the U.S. government’s sounding boards from the onset of negotiations on the South Korea, Colombia and Panama trade agreements currently before Congress. When fully implemented, those three agreements have the potential to add more than $2 billion per year to our exports and support job creation here at home.\nYou can play an active role in deliberations such as these, while representing U.S. agricultural interests and the rich diversity of the people who make our country great.\nMore information about submitting an application is available on the FAS website.

Currently, she and her daughter, Lee Meadors, rent a trailer in a neatly manicured mobile home park in Laurel County, Ky. Although they like where they live, Bunch says it just isn’t the same as living in a home of your own with a yard and some measure of privacy.\nShe has always been a renter and finally decided the time was right to build a home of her own close to her family’s homestead – very near the house where she was born and raised, which remains standing today. Being close to her parents’ burial site in a cemetery near the building site was one reason she opted for new construction rather than the purchase an existing home. “This was very important to me. I had a tough time finding a place where I wanted to live, so I thought it was best to build a house,” said Bunch. “I’ve already picked out the dogwood trees.”\nShe will celebrate her 95th birthday very near the time construction is finished on the new family home. Clearing of the construction site will start the week of April 5, , and the house should be finished in three to four months.\nWhen asked what she planned to do to celebrate once the house is finished, Bunch didn’t hesitate: “I told the contractor I’m going to have a dancing party!”\nBunch said it was a neighbor that told her about a housing program through Daniel Boone Community Action Agency (DBCAA), which partners with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development to provide direct housing loans to limited-income residents of rural communities.\nShe began the process two years ago, and now that her lifelong dream is about to come true, she could not be happier.\nShe said although the process has taken some time, it was very easy and worth all the effort.\n“I’m just waiting for the house to be ready and I can’t wait to move in,” said Bunch.\nHer daughter agreed, “She talks about it every day – she is so happy.”\nWritten by Katherine Belcher,  Public Information Coordinator, USDA Rural Development, Kentucky\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Direct Housing Loans\n Kentucky\n Laurel County\n Rural Development",

Of the 4,135 students who attend CPS, more than 2,000 are eligible for free and reduced price school lunch, and more than 30 percent are obese. Several years ago, realizing the need to improve child nutrition, the district began to take some modest steps to that end, including initiating a scratch cooking program and participating in a regional childhood obesity prevention initiative.\nUpon receiving a USDA Farm to School Planning Grant in November , CPS developed an eight-member team, comprised of school district officials and community partners, to lead their efforts. The group, which meets every four to six weeks, has done extensive research to determine the most effective path forward and has leveraged relationships with a range of partners to accomplish a great deal in a short period of time.\nIn just the first half of the grant period, Cheney initiated conversations with two regional produce distributors who have indicated that they are able to supply the district with Washington-grown fruits and vegetables, and a commodity retailer who can offer CPS Washington-grown lentils. Through these relationships, they were able to launch a Harvest of the Month Program and begin offering local products on their lunch line daily.\nTo complement these changes in the cafeteria, CPS has also established a robust farm to school curriculum that includes field trips to a local farm; a Harvest of the Month taste test program with a supplementary parent education piece; a planned Your State on Your Plate lunch event that will offer outreach to students, parents, community leaders and the media; a Chefs in School Food Science program at the middle schools; and integration of nutrition and agricultural reading materials into the K-12 core.\nThe district works closely with the City of Cheney and its Let’s Move Cheney Coalition to partner on a number of initiatives that promote health and nutrition in their community. They have also enlisted the help of the Washington State University Extension, the Spokane Conservation District, and the Washington Sustainable Food and Farming Network to help with various aspects of their project.\nAt USDA our goal is to create more Cheneys: more districts that have the resources, confidence, energy, and creative ideas to bring their communities together, enrich the bodies and minds of their students, and support the vital agricultural enterprises in their region.\nEditor’s Note: The USDA Farm to School website offers resources on how to start a farm to school program in your area.

They have been working with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) for years to improve conservation on their farm.\nIn , the couple’s non-profit organization, United Farmers USA―dedicated to helping small farmers succeed through a wide range of outreach and technical assistance, educational programs and resources―received an NRCS Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG). These grants help NRCS support public and private entities to accelerate technology transfer and adoption of promising technologies and approaches to address some of the Nation's most pressing natural resource concerns.\nThrough their CIG project, the Gibsons have implemented a silvopasture demonstration area on their farm, and have educated other farmers on the benefits.\nSilvopasture―the practice of combining forestry and the grazing of livestock―benefits timber, forage, and livestock production by allowing both practices on the same acreage, at the same time. It not only improves the appearance of the landowner’s property, it helps the livestock and environment too.\nDuring the summer months, tree canopies provide shelter to livestock from heat and inclement weather. The Gibsons say silvopasture helps their livestock maintain body weight in the hotter months by continuing to graze during the day in the shade, as opposed to grazing only at night in open pasture when it’s cooler.\n“Silvopasture is a win-win situation, as you can have value added attributes, such as baling and selling hay, or cutting trees for timber,” said Hezekiah.\nSilvopasture is not new to the Gibsons. They have been using this conservation practice for years and have 120 acres in silvopasture. When managed properly silvopasture can help farming operations become more sustainable by increasing annual revenues and providing better use of forest lands.\nThey have also implemented several conservation practices on their farm, including fencing and cross-fencing 300 acres of pasture, which allows them to practice rotational grazing for their livestock. By using rotational grazing―moving cows to different pastures before it can be overgrazed―herd health is increased, soil erosion is reduced, and soil and forage health is greatly improved.\nThrough CIG funding, the Gibsons have hosted many two-hour classes, educational workshops, and demonstration tours for historically underserved landowners. Additional demonstration sites will be established in the Low country, Savannah, Pee Dee, and Coastal Plain areas to reach more farmers in USDA StrikeForce areas.\nUSDA StrikeForce teams operate in 880 counties in 21 states and Puerto Rico and provide opportunities for NRCS to work with underserved landowners to determine how best to leverage available financial assistance and address natural resource concerns—with an emphasis on historically underserved communities in rural counties that have consistently high poverty.\nFarmers interested in learning more about Conservation Innovation Grants or land management practices should visit www.nrcs.usda.gov/GetStarted or a local USDA service center.\nNOTE: For an interactive look at USDA's work in conservation and forestry over the course of this Administration, visit \nThe Gibsons have practiced silvopasture for years, and have found that it helps their livestock maintain their body weight by continuing to graze under trees during the day, rather than in open pasture at night when it’s cooler.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n CIG\n Conservation\n Conservation Innovation Grant\n Farmers\n Forestry\n NRCS\n rotational grazing\n silvopasture\n South Carolina\n StrikeForce",

(U.S. Forest Service photo)\nIn calendar year , the Tusayan Ranger District of the Kaibab National Forest achieved a longtime goal of zero human-caused wildfires.\nAccording to forest wildfire records, the last time the district had zero human fires was in , exactly 50 years ago.\n“Over the last three years, we have had a specific, written goal of reducing human-caused wildfires on the district to zero for an entire calendar year,” said Quentin Johnson, fire management officer for the Tusayan Ranger District. “Given that the district receives millions of visitors each year because it is located immediately adjacent to Grand Canyon National Park, we knew this would be an incredible challenge.”\nJohnson added that while the district had been averaging about seven human-caused wildfires per year over the last 20 years, there were actually many summers during which 200 or more abandoned campfires had been found and extinguished by district fire personnel before they were declared wildfires.\nThe district’s success in was due largely to focused fire prevention efforts beginning almost 15 years ago that have chipped away at the leading cause of human fires on the district – abandoned campfires. Specifically, district fire prevention specialist Bob Blasi worked to gain compliance in dispersed camping areas and issued citations when necessary. With increased early-morning patrols, an extensive signing program, visits to local schools, Smokey Bear’s presence at local events, and a consistent prevention message for more than a decade, Blasi was able to systematically reduce the number of abandoned campfires and, therefore, the overall number of human-caused wildfires.\n“This goal seemed almost impossible,” Blasi said. “Only one careless action by a single person can have a devastating outcome, as we see every year across this country somewhere in the wildlands of America. There were a couple years in the past decade when we only had two or three human-caused fires. It was then I realized that with a little extra effort focused on specific targets with increased fire prevention patrols, it might just be obtainable.”\nBesides traditional fire prevention techniques such as patrols and signing, the Tusayan Ranger District has also been a leader in putting fire back on the landscape as frequently and broadly as conditions have allowed. Over the past 12 years, nearly 40 percent of the 327,250-acre Tusayan district has been treated with thinning and fire, which has contributed enormously to reducing human-caused wildfire.\n“Because most of the popular camping areas have already been treated with fire at appropriate times of the year, these areas are less likely to catch on fire during the hottest, driest months,” Johnson said. “To truly prevent wildfire, you have to use all of the fire prevention tools available in combination.”\nDuring the monsoon season alone, the Tusayan Ranger District managed more than 17,000 acres of fire across the landscape in order to improve forest health and reduce the likelihood of future high-severity fires resulting from sources such as abandoned campfires.\n“Because of the support of fire managers, Kaibab National Forest leadership, the community and public, we have been able to go beyond just re-introducing fire into the ecosystem, to take it to the next level and demonstrate how when fire is managed responsibly, it becomes an integral part of obtaining desired forest health,” Blasi said. “This is the proof in the pudding. The more fire treatments we are able to successfully implement, the better chance we have of reducing and ultimately eliminating unwanted human-caused fire in our part of the forest.”\nWhile focused fire prevention efforts have decreased the number of abandoned campfires in the Tusayan area, the challenge of eliminating all human-caused fires will continue. Each fire season brings a unique set of challenges including millions of new visitors to a popular tourist destination.\n“If I were to designate one goal for the future, it would be that this record never last 50 years again,” Blasi said. “Eliminating human-caused fires is attainable through education, prevention and good stewardship.”\nThe Belknap Fire was one of three large fires managed for resource benefit on the Tusayan Ranger District during the monsoon season.

But in the end, whether or not to participate in SNAP is a personal decision.  This is a core part of the SNAP regulations and a guiding factor in SNAP outreach strategies.\nToday, USDA published a proposed rule that codifies portions of the Farm Bill related to outreach that further strengthen against recruitment.  Outreach activities designed to pressure or persuade a person to apply for benefits are not allowed.  Furthermore, as directed by the Farm Bill, the proposed rule specifically prohibits radio, television or billboard advertising.  The proposed rule would also prohibit organizations receiving funds under the Food and Nutrition Act of from tying compensation for outreach workers to the number of people who apply for SNAP benefits as a result of their efforts, also part of the Farm Bill.\nStates will still be able to provide basic program information to individuals who may be eligible, such as explaining program rules and benefits. Understanding program basics helps people make an informed decision about whether to apply for SNAP benefits, based on facts rather than myths and misinformation. Providing this basic program information to vulnerable populations including the elderly, homeless and individuals with disabilities may be especially important to ensure they get the food assistance they need and for which they may be eligible. This is an important consideration, given that almost two-thirds of those participating in SNAP are children, elderly or disabled.  Organizations that receive funding for The Emergency Food Assistance Program and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations will also be subject to the proposed rule.\nMany of these practices are already in place but these rules serve to reiterate the importance of providing basic information about SNAP so that you can determine for yourself if SNAP is right for you and your family.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Farm Bill\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n National Nutrition Month\n Nutrition\n SNAP\n SNAP advertising\n SNAP outreach\n SNAP participation",

Here Asai is on the Willamette National Forest in Eugene, Ore. (U.S. Forest Service photo)\nNot many people can say that they took six months off from work to hike from one country to another. U.S. Forest Service civil engineer Alex Asai did.\nAsai, who works on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, spent almost half a year on leave without pay from the Forest Service to hike from Mexico to Canada on the Pacific Crest Trail. During the 2,650-mile excursion, Asai hiked through a variety of terrain, including desert, snow, forests, mountains, and he crossed through 25 national forests.\nAfter playing soccer for Oregon State University for four years, the natural athlete decided he should broaden his sporting interests, and he began running, backpacking and hiking, which spurred the idea of hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.\n“I had known about the Pacific Crest Trail before but I hadn’t really heard of people hiking it until I talked to some friends who did it in ,” Asai said. “It sounded like a really fun thing to do.”\nIn April , Asai left the Pacific Northwest and with his parents, drove down the west coast to the U.S.-Mexico border.\nAt the Annual Day Zero Pacific Crest Trail Kick Off, Asai and his parents met about 200 to 300 ambitious hikers, including fellow employees of the Forest Service. After his parents hiked with him on the first day, Asai ventured up the trail with a backpack that carried a minimal list of supplies to sustain him over the next 2,650 miles.\n“I was with people basically the whole time,” he said. “During the first 450 miles, I was with a group of people. After that, I hiked with three others. During the final stretch of the trail, I hiked with one other person.”\nThe hike took Asai five months, which included hiking through national forests, mountains, deserts, and snow, as well as frequent stops in towns to resupply him with food and other necessities.\nAsai remembers hiking under moonlight on grand, sloping mountains in California, where sometimes the water in creeks was so cold that his shoes froze overnight. In Oregon, Asai recalls hiking for miles at a time through flat forested lands, and then arriving at Crater Lake, known for its intense, vibrant and magnificent views. And finally, hiking through Washington was a treat, especially when Asai hiked through the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, where his coworkers surprised him and greeted him to their forest.\n“I felt a sense of pride,” Asai said. “I remember thinking, ‘This is where I work.’”\nSee what else Asai has to say in the Forest Service special feature Faces of the Forest, a bi-weekly feature of the Office of Communication to showcase the people, places and professions within the agency.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Faces of the Forest\n Forestry\n FS\n Gifford Pinchot National Forest",

(Click to enlarge)\nThis has been the year of innovation at USDA Rural Housing Service. We are working smarter, faster, more efficient and environmentally conscious than ever before.  After years of brainstorming, planning, reengineering, testing, and training, RHS has realized its vision: the Section 502 Guaranteed Single Family Home Loan Program now operates paperless, and we’re saving more than we ever imagined possible.\nUSDA’s Rural Development State field offices now transact business with private lenders via Web-based uploads and electronic signatures.  This means RHS and our private partners are no longer printing and sending hundreds of pages of paper back-and-forth every time a loan guarantee is used to help a rural American family buy their home.\nAs a result, loan guarantees are processed faster and families move into homes more quickly. Postage fees will be eliminated and huge print jobs avoided for every one of the 140,000+ home loans USDA guarantees we will make in the coming year. Initial estimates show USDA Rural Housing Service will save 37,500 reams of paper every year now that we do more business in a paperless environment.\nMore than 135,333 staff hours per year nationwide were being spent managing these paper processes. Staff will have more time to assist our customers, connect with potential partners and, of course, help more rural Americans buy their own homes through our 502 homeownership programs.\nAll of the savings in time, paper and postage adds up to some serious savings of American tax dollars. In fact, we estimate RHS will save more than $4.2 million in just one year of using the new process nationwide.  This means we can allocate more time and money into oversight initiatives that will work to ensure lender compliance, and more adequately staff other Single Family Housing Programs to better serve Rural America.\nThe people who work in the Rural Housing Service are proud of this milestone! But, as they like to remind everyone, RHS is just getting started.  Innovation projects of this sort have begun to touch every one of the Agency’s programs. RHS is advocating for the American dream of homeownership by working smarter, faster, more efficiently, and more conscious of the environment than ever before.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n innovation\n ModernUSDA\n RD\n Rural America\n Rural Housing Service\n Single Family Home Loan program",

Through the Farm Service Agency (FSA) USDA is focused on increasing opportunities for farmers and ranchers and has made several modifications to farm loan programs, including making Microloans to beginning farmers and veterans exempt from direct loan term limits. Producers have more flexible access to credit for initial start-up expenses, family living expenses, minor farm improvements and hoop houses to extend the growing season.\nKentucky couple Kim and Jeff Essig, owners of Middlebridge Blueberry Farm, know about the benefits of the Microloan program first-hand. Kim shares their story:\nI married a man who was already in love — with Kentucky.  Although we were both born and raised in Orange County, Calif., he grew up visiting his grandpa Martin’s farm in Oakland, Ky. during summer breaks.\nSo it was no surprise that six months after our wedding, we packed up our things and blazed the trail from Southern California to Smiths Grove, Ky., to live on the land.\nThe first several years we had limited land and dabbled in growing food for ourselves and trading produce with neighbors. In , we were able to purchase a few acres in Bowling Green, Ky.  It was then we started thinking large scale.\nWe chose blueberries as our main crop.  Between and we installed an acre of blueberries and also started beekeeping. By , we added blackberries, raspberries and strawberries. As our berries grew, the customers came as did the idea of branching out into blueberry plant propagation for selling, expanding our bees and maximizing what we could do with our little piece of earth.\nOne day I saw an announcement for the Kentucky Farm Service Agency (FSA) Microloan program.  I contacted the FSA office for an application. The application process informative, organized, helpful and painless. And Farm Loan Officer Tracy Bailey called and met with us right away.\nLooking back over these past two years, we find ourselves very grateful to God for the opportunity to expand our farm and take hold of opportunities that we most likely would have had to pass up if not for the FSA’s Microloan program.\nWhat we found most helpful were the people behind the program. Tracy Bailey, as well as others in the office, really made the process friendly and smooth. The interest rate and payment terms have been key in helping us to grow into our farm vision.\n Kim and Jeff Essig\nUSDA is proud to see the progress that farmers and ranchers are making in their daily operations with the help of the Microloan program. To date, USDA has issued more than 4,900 Microloans totaling $97 million. The microloan program is part of USDA’s StrikeForce for Rural Growth and Opportunity Initiative, our commitment to growing economies, increasing investments and creating opportunities in poverty-stricken rural Kentucky and 19 other states.\nThe Essig family started with blueberries and later expanded to include blackberries, raspberries and strawberries.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Beginning Farmers\n beginning ranchers\n Blueberries\n California\n FSA\n Kentucky\n microloan success\n microloans\n Producers\n small farmers\n StrikeForce\n veterans",

El evento examinó cómo las políticas públicas del país afectan a la comunidad Latina y cómo las políticas futuras pueden proveer una mejor calidad de vida para los Latinos.\nAunque la discusión cubrió un gran gama de temas de interés para la comunidad, gran parte de la conversación se enfocó en la obesidad infantil y el impacto que esta tiene en la educación, el talento y el futuro de la fuerza laboral no solo de los Latinos pero de toda la nación.\nComo se enfatiza en la campaña  Let’s Move! de la Primera Dama, el índice de obesidad se ha triplicado en las últimas tres décadas.  Aunque uno de cada tres niños en América sufre de sobrepeso u obesidad,  el 40% de los niños latinos y afroamericanos están experimentando las consecuencias de esta epidemia.  Como los Latinos son el grupo demográfico de más rápido crecimiento y el más joven del país, resolver el problema de obesidad  de  los Latinos se convierte en un punto crítico pues resolverlo ayudará de manera contundente a solucionar el problema de obesidad infantil en todo el país.\nEl compromiso de la Administración Obama en mejorar la salud y el bienestar de los niños es claramente una prioridad y los esfuerzos que se están llevando a cabo ya están teniendo impacto en nuestras comunidades diversas. Esfuerzos como la Ley de Niños Saludables Libres de Hambre (conocida en inglés como Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act), Let’s Move! y las Mesas Redondas Comunitarias en las que visitamos los estados de más alta inseguridad alimentaria, nos están acercando a la erradicación de la obesidad infantil.

        "content": "USDA Office of Communications in\n Food and Nutrition\n Sep 09, \nA new poll shows that parents of school-age children overwhelmingly support national nutrition standards for all foods and beverages sold to students during the school day. For more information, visit: www.pewtrusts.org/SchoolFoodParentPoll. Click to enlarge.\nOver the past four years, USDA has worked closely with schools, parents, community leaders, and nutrition experts to ensure that when children go off to school, they are greeted by a healthier school environment.  According to the CDC, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years, leading to an increase in obesity-related health outcomes in children, including cardiovascular disease, pre-diabetes, and bone and joint problems.  Improving school nutrition is vital to reducing childhood obesity, because many children consume half of their daily calories during the school day. Making the healthy choice the easy choice sets our nation’s children up for a lifetime of healthy choices, and supports a healthier next generation.  Recently, we’ve seen evidence that student acceptance of healthier meals is increasing across all grade levels.  Today, we are pleased to see the results of the latest poll by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the American Heart Association, showing that most parents support the healthier meal and snack standards implemented through the Healthy, Hunger-free Kids Act of . \nRead more about the results of that study in this guest blog, from the American Heart Association.\nA majority of parents favor strong national nutrition standards for food and drink sold at schools, according to a poll released Monday by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the American Heart Association.\nIn addition, the poll found that parents would also like to see salt limited in school foods and more fruits and vegetables served.\nThe poll, which was conducted in June among 1,112 parents, said that 80 percent of the parents said they were concerned about their children’s health. Seventy-four percent said they were concerned about childhood obesity, a major risk factor for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar and cardiovascular disease later in life. Currently, more than one third of children and adolescents are clinically overweight or obese. Among children ages six to 11, obesity rates rose from 7 percent in to 18 percent in . The rates increased from 5 percent to 21 percent during that same period for youth ages 12 to 19.\nChildhood obesity has been a major national focus, with federal agencies and advocacy organizations, including the American Heart Association, working on ways to curb the trend.\nThe poll was conducted just weeks before the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued “Smart Snacks” standards on July 1, which mandated that school snacks must be a fruit, a vegetable, protein, dairy, or whole grain; have fewer than 200 calories; and be low in fat, salt, and sugar.\nThe poll revealed that support for stricter school nutrition standards cut across racial and political lines. Sixty-eight percent of whites, 85 percent of Hispanics and 91 percent of African-Americans said they support the standards.\nFifty-six percent of Republicans, 71 percent of independents and 84 percent of Democrats favored stronger standards. Only 22 percent of parents expressed that they strongly opposed higher school nutrition standards.\nAmong the poll’s other findings:\n72 percent favor national standards for school meals;\n72 percent support standards for school snacks;\n91 percent support requiring schools to include a serving of fruits or vegetables with every meal;\n75 percent think salt should be limited in meals;\n23 percent believed food sold a la carte at schools was nutritious, whereas only 8 percent believed the same of food sold in vending machines.\nPenny Kris Etherton, PhD, a professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pennsylvania, said the findings are encouraging, but parents voicing support is just the beginning.\n“Schools and parents need to be on the same page about what the kids eat,” she said. “You can’t have one set of standards at school and another set of standards at home. It’s encouraging to see that parents are supportive of higher nutritional standards, but we need to educate across the board so that parents understand what this really means for how their kids should eat.”\nReducing sweetened beverages can lower a child’s intake of “empty” calories, Kris-Etherton explained. However, some parents might believe fruit juice is healthy “when it’s really just sugar water. The child would be better off either drinking plain water or eating a piece of fruit to get the fiber and nutrients from the fruit. The challenge will be making healthy eating fun and interesting for kids.”\nThe poll was conducted by Hart Research Associates and Ferguson Research.  Pew, RWJF, and AHA are jointly supporting efforts to ensure all foods and beverages in schools are healthy. The Kids’ Safe and Healthful Foods Project is a collaboration between Pew and RWJF. Voices for Healthy Kids is an initiative of RWJF and AHA, with Pew providing additional expertise.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n American Heart Association\n CDC\n Childhood Obesity\n children\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n HealthierNextGen\n Pennsylvania\n Pennsylvania State University\n Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\n school meals\n Smart Snacks",

With such an important worldwide recognition of all forests do for us humans, the Forest Service would like folks to ask themselves: Do I really know how much trees contribute to my daily life?\nOr, in another words, what is the power of one tree?\nJust as we humans are comprised of many parts functioning together allowing us to do wondrous things, the anatomy of a tree is just as wondrous, empowering them with super hero qualities.\nWhat am I talking about?  A tree has the ability to provide an essential of life for all living things on our planet – oxygen, and the power to remove harmful gases like carbon dioxide making the air we breathe healthier.\nHere is how it works:\nTo keep it simple a tree is comprised of its leaves, stems, trunk and its roots.  When you look at a tree, note that about five percent of the tree is comprised of its leaves, 15 percent its stems, 60 percent goes into its trunk and 20 percent is devoted to its roots.\nHere is the super hero part. Through a process called photosynthesis, leaves pull in carbon dioxide and water and use the energy of the sun to convert this into chemical compounds such as sugars that feed the tree.  But as a by-product of that chemical reaction oxygen is produced and released by the tree.  It is proposed that one large tree can provide a day’s supply of oxygen for up to four people.\nTrees also store carbon dioxide in their fibers helping to clean the air and reduce the negative effects that this CO2 could have had on our environment. According to the Arbor Day Foundation, in one year a mature tree will absorb more than 48 pounds of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen in exchange.\nSo next time you take a deep breath of air give credit to a tree or hug a tree in thanks for what it gives us – the very air we breathe.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Arbor Day Foundation\n Forestry\n Forests\n FS\n International Day of Forests\n trees\n United Nations",

Volunteers will be working in rural Panama and meeting with local communities to raise awareness about as well as report suspected cases of New World screwworm, one of the most costly and economically significant pests of livestock in South America.\nThe New World screwworm is a parasite of warm-blooded animals, including humans. Female screwworms are attracted to and lay their eggs in exposed flesh wounds.  After eggs hatch, larvae burrow and feed on flesh, causing severe tissue damage and may even be lethal to the host. The screwworm was eradicated from the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Curacao and, finally, all of Central America in using the Sterile Insect Technique in which sterile male flies are released in massive numbers to mate with wild female populations. The mated female flies then lay non-viable eggs, leading to a decrease and subsequent eradication of screwworm populations. To prevent the screwworm from spreading north of South America, The Commission is maintaining a barrier at the Darien Gap between Panama and Colombia, by utilizing both preventive release of sterile flies and field surveillance.\n Murali Bandla, APHIS Associate Deputy Administrator, International Services\n Posted in\n Animals\n Plants\n Nov 13, \n Respond to this story",

The holidays are also when we share favorite, treasured foods with our loved ones.\nWhether you are making a favorite recipe for a party, holiday dinners, or mailing goodies to a lucky friend or family member, follow these food safety tips to make the most of your time when preparing your special holiday treats.\nMake space\nThis is a good time to clean your refrigerator so that you have room for holiday foods. You’ll also want to clean and clear off your kitchen counter so that you have room to work. Cooking can be a messy business and you don’t want to splash or spill juices from raw meat or poultry, or mixtures that contain raw eggs on clean dishes, kitchen towels, your children’s homework or decorations.\nMake a plan\nMany holiday dishes and treats contain perishable foods such as meat, poultry, eggs and dairy products. If you are preparing a complicated food that takes some time to make (e.g., egg rolls, lumpia, pasteles, alcapurrias and ravioli), make sure that the perishable foods stay hot or cold until needed. It may be helpful to divide up the different stages of the recipe. For example, if you are making lumpia, you can prepare the filling one day, and keep it in the refrigerator until you roll and package the lumpia.\nIf you are making a large batch of a favorite food (such as jams or jellies, pickled vegetables, sofrito) make sure you have all the ingredients and equipment you need before you get started so the food doesn’t sit at an unsafe temperature and allow bacteria to multiply.\nPack it Up and Hand it Out for Gift Giving\nOnce your goodies are prepared it’s time to pack them up for gift giving. Label with the name of the product, how it should be stored, and a ‘best by’ date if needed. (e.g., “Grandma’s Ravioli. Keep Frozen. Use by April ”). Not sure how long your item will last in the pantry, refrigerator or freezer? Download our FoodKeeper app to find out.\nStore your goodies in a safe place (a cool, dry place for baked goods, the refrigerator or freezer for perishable foods), until time to deliver or serve. If you are presenting perishable foods be sure to tell the lucky recipient that the item must be kept in the refrigerator or freezer. Avoid leaving perishable gifts on a doorstep or handing them out at a workplace if there is no refrigeration.\nServe it Up\nIf you are preparing your family favorite for a dinner or party you can make it up to 4 days in advance. If you are making a large quantity of food, store it in several small or shallow containers, which will cool down faster than a large container. When it is time to serve, rather than having a large amount of food sit out on the serving table, put out one portion and keep a batch warm in the oven or cold in the refrigerator until you need it.\nTaking it on the Road\nIf you are delivering your special treat or traveling to an event, remember to keep it out of the “Danger Zone,” the temperature range between 40 and 140°F. Pack perishables in a cooler on ice to keep them safe while you travel. If you are mailing perishables, see Mail Order Food Safety for tips on mailing food.\nConsumers with questions about food safety can call the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline or chat live with a food safety specialist in English or Spanish at AskKaren.gov, available from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n Tags:\n Food Safety and Inspection Service\n FSIS\n Food Safety\n Holidays\n FoodKeeper\n AskKaren\n Meat and Poultry Hotline",

The investments we are announcing today will provide broadband in areas that lack it, help rural-serving public television stations begin using digital broadcasts, and support other telecommunications infrastructure improvements.\"USDA is providing assistance through the Community Connect Grant program, the Public Television Digital Transition Grant program and the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan program.Community Connect grants establish broadband service in rural areas to boost economic growth and offer educational, health care, social and public safety benefits. Public television grants help public television stations serving rural areas acquire the equipment they need to transition from analog to digital broadcasts. Telecommunications infrastructure loans help maintain, upgrade or expand rural telecommunications networks.Through today's announcement, USDA is providing $190.5 million for 25 projects in 19 states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Funding is contingent upon the recipients meeting the terms of their grant or loan agreements.In Arkansas, Arkwest Communications is receiving a $24 million telecommunications loan to provide voice, broadband, and internet TV service to nearly 4,000 customers and to make other system improvements.Nexus Systems, in Monroe, La., is receiving a $2.5 million Community Connect grant to provide high-speed broadband in the Powhatan, La., area. Powhatan is sparsely populated, economically distressed and considered a persistent poverty area. USDA is targeting assistance to the region through its StrikeForce for Rural Growth and Opportunity initiative.Public television broadcasters serving the U.S. Virgin Islands will use a $750,000 USDA grant to replace analog mobile production and satellite equipment with a digital high-definition video recorder. Congress reauthorized the public television grant program in the Farm Bill.The Farm Bill builds on historic economic gains in rural America over the past five years, while achieving meaningful reform and billions of dollars in savings for taxpayers. Since its enactment, USDA has made significant progress to implement each provision of this critical legislation. The Department has provided disaster relief to farmers and ranchers; strengthened risk management tools; expanded access to rural credit; funded critical research; established innovative public-private conservation partnerships; developed new markets for rural-made products; and invested in infrastructure, housing and community facilities to help improve the quality of life in rural America.

(USDA Forest Service photo)\nUsually when an event as wonderful as the lighting of the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree has its 50th anniversary, the events surrounding it are packed with people ready to celebrate. That was the plan this year, but the Covid-19 pandemic changed everything and yet nothing.\nThat’s because, yes, the crowds were not there this year, but the thrill and excitement was there for all to see--albeit virtually.\nPlanning for the lighting of the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree, or the People’s Tree as many refer to it, started over a year ago much as it has been done for 50 years.\nBut Covid-19 changed all that.\nIn fact, there were even rumors about the tree lighting ceremony for the 55-foot-high Engelmann spruce not even happening this year.\nHowever, the hard working USDA Forest Service folks, and their partnering organizations on the host forest where the tree was harvested, the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests, thought differently. Instead of giving up, they duteously kept planning for not only the lighting but also the tree’s epic journey from Colorado to Washington, D.C. with whistle stops along the way.\nWith a galaxy of LED lights and thousands of handmade ornaments and gifts for the tree – made by the children of Colorado – anyone with a smart phone can see a picture of the People’s Tree or actually see it in person if they happen to be in Washington, D.C. through New Year’s Day.\nThe pandemic presented unique challenges and disruptions this year, and for some, personal tragedies. But it did not stop the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree from shining through it all. Now that’s a Christmas story worth telling.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Forest Service\n Forestry\n Capitol Christmas Tree\n Architect of the Capitol\n Grand Mesa Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests",

(Administrator Anne Alonzo, 4th from right) USDA Photo Courtesy of Peter Wood.\nMarch is National Nutrition Month, and local food plays an important role in providing Americans with fresh, healthy fuel for their bodies. From farmers to financiers to schools and hospitals, there is a lot of passion for sharing good food by supporting strong local and regional food systems. I experienced this firsthand during my trip to Chicago, Ill., where I spoke at last week’s Good Food Festival & Conference.\nThe trip came on the heels of a recent announcement that USDA is making $97 million available to expand access to healthy food and support rural economies.  Grants from my agency -- the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) – make up over $90 million of that funding.  AMS was a sponsor and exhibitor at the trade show, where we shared information with stakeholders about the many resources we have to support local and regional food systems. Through our Specialty Crop Block Grant Program and Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program (comprised of the Farmers Market Promotion Program and the Local Food Promotion Program), AMS supports producers, local food entrepreneurs, and rural and urban communities across the country.\nAt the conference, I met many local food producers and stakeholders who have directly benefited from AMS support for local food systems. I emphasized USDA’s continued commitment to this valuable sector and thanked the conference host, FamilyFarmed.org, for their inspired leadership in advancing local foods. Last year, FamilyFarmed.org received an AMS grant for their Good Food Business Accelerator Program, which leverages an impressive collection of partnerships to provide local food startups in the Chicago area with strategic, operating, and financial support.\nThe FarmLogix team, Aramark and the Chicago Public Schools have worked together to add locally-grown produce onto school menus. During the visit, students at Cyrus H. McCormick had a lunch featuring local apples and carrots. (Administrator Anne Alonzo, 2nd from right) USDA Photo Courtesy of Peter Wood.\nAnother highlight of the trip was a visit to my old elementary school, Cyrus H. McCormick, in the urban Latino community where I grew up on Chicago’s South Side. Chicago Public Schools and FarmLogix, another AMS grantee, organized the visit to highlight how school districts are incorporating locally-grown produce to provide kids with fresh, healthy food. We visited the students over their lunch that included local carrots and apples. Later, at a school assembly, they asked me all about my career, education, and working in government. I was in their shoes 30 years ago – it was incredibly moving to connect with them and hopefully inspire them to pursue careers in public service and agriculture.\nUSDA continues to support the local food sector and has identified strengthening local food systems as one of the four pillars of our commitment to rural economic development and job creation. All of us here at USDA are doing all we can to support this sector via the Know your Farmer, Know your Food initiative.\nThe Good Food Festival and Conference, hosted by FamilyFarmed.org, brought local food producers and stakeholders to Chicago, Ill. From farmers to financiers, the event was all about strengthening local and regional food systems.

Photo credit: U.S. Embassy Bangkok, Thailand\nIn mid-August, I traveled to Southeast Asia and witnessed firsthand the great strides being made to help increase food security and trade. I also came to appreciate the immense potential for future trade opportunities in the area. I returned with a reaffirmed sense of urgency to continue building upon recent gains in trade with Thailand.\nThailand purchased a record $1.ates, making it our 13th largest export market. Overall, U.S. agricultural exports to Thailand have grown by more than 150 percent over the past decade. Throughout my visit, growing demand for both U.S. bulk commodities and consumer products was very clear.\nWhen I met with the Thai Feed Mill Association, we discussed the livestock industry’s growing need for grain. Total feed demand in was at 10.6 million metric tons and increased to 12.9 million metric tons in . In , due to insufficient local supplies of feed grains and co-products, Thailand imported feed ingredients totaling 17.9 million metric tons, valued at $1.7 billion.\nFAS Administrator Phil Karsting serves as sous chef to Chef Benjamin B. from the DOCK Seafood Bar to prepare U.S. Scallop Tom Yam Au Gratin. The DOCK Seafood Bar is operated by Thailand’s largest importer of U.S. seafood, Thammachart Seafood Retail. Photo credit: U.S. Embassy Bangkok, Thailand\nWhile in Thailand, I also had the opportunity to serve as sous chef to Chef Benjamin B. from the DOCK Seafood Bar in Bangkok. Thai consumers have developed a taste for safe, high-quality U.S. foods, from U.S. organic salad greens to U.S. seafood – all on full display during my visit to the Gourmet Market at Siam Paragon shopping complex. I also had an opportunity to discuss the quality, diversity and sustainability of U.S. seafood products. In , roughly 10 percent of Thailand’s fish and seafood imports came from the United States, including tuna, sockeye salmon, Alaska pollock, lobster, cod and scallops.\nWhether discussing future trading prospects in Thailand or elsewhere in the world, our principles and sustained focus on trade continue to point us in the same direction. At the Foreign Agricultural Service, much of our recent focus has been on Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) nations for obvious reasons. The TPP is significant – it brings together 12 countries representing nearly 40 percent of the world’s gross domestic product.  But other nations in the Pacific Rim, such as Thailand, are on the move and offering opportunities, too.\nTrading platforms like TPP create enhanced paths for U.S. producers, who already have exports to thank for 20 percent of farm income. In addition, we must continue to cultivate sound business relationships with customers all over the world, and reinforce adherence to science-based and rules-based trading systems. These three principles are the foundation of TPP and the core principles that will help increase exports of made-in-America food and agriculture products across the globe for generations to come.\nFresh U.S. seafood available for customers to purchase at Gourmet Market in the Siam Paragon shopping complex in Bangkok.

(Courtesy photo Sandra Cummings)\nSandra Cummings is an African American woman who is a part owner of two forested landscapes in Georgia. Her first property, 325 acres of land with a home in the city of Madison, was passed down by her maternal great-grandmother, who was born a slave. The second property consists of 165 acres of land in the town of Portal, which was passed down by her paternal grandfather.\nTo ensure that the family’s ancestral land remains intact, Mrs. Cummings and her family decided to put it into an irrevocable trust to prevent their children and grandchildren from dividing and selling it. “You see, they didn’t grow up in the dirt like we did,” she said. “We grew up working those farmlands, picking cotton, tobacco, planting watermelon. We were able to see the benefits of having this land. My children and grandchildren did not.”\nMrs. Cummings wanted to encourage long-term stewardship of her land, and sought out resources to help achieve this goal. Amadou Diop, an Atlanta-based outreach liaison for the US Forest Service, helped Mrs. Cummings find information about forest management and stewardship plans.\n“If it wasn’t for Amadou’s wealth of knowledge, willingness to help people, and putting me in touch with the resources directly, I would have never been able to get any of this done,” said Mrs. Cummings. “He made sure that I was taken care of, and he deserves a lot of credit.”\nThe Forest Service’s Forest Stewardship Program encourages long-term stewardship of important state and private forest landscapes by assisting landowners to more actively manage their forests and related resources. The Forest Service helped Mrs. Cummings through a forest management and stewardship plan created by the Georgia Forestry Commission, which laid out a 10-year plan for managing the land.\nUnder the plan’s guidance, Mrs. Cummings now uses the land in Madison for timber management, grazing for cattle, and wildlife habitat. She manages the land in Portal for forestry, wildlife, silvopasture (with assistance from the NRCS), and a pine straw operation. As a result, she obtains additional earnings from her land by leasing it out for deer hunting and harvesting pine straw.\nShe is enjoying the benefits of being a forest landowner.\n“One of the benefits for me is the extra income from the pine straw operation —extra income is always good, you know,” she said.\n“It also gives you some self-sufficiency,” she continued. “I will say this: if something were to happen in Atlanta—where we are living now, then we always have a place to go. If we needed to build another house or something….we can do it! So both lands give us some stability.”\nMrs. Cummings intends for her family’s legacy to continue. She hopes to renovate her parents’ home into a historic site and to build a walking trail for guests, and she is exploring the potential for solar power generation on her property in Portal.\nCattle like these graze Mrs. Cummings property in Portal, Georgia.

Bramwell explained that it changed later once “I had to take the trash out as a kid.”\nBramwell started his Forest Service career as a hotshot crew member fighting fires, but now he works as the sole national historian for the agency. It all started as a summer obsession to spend as much time outdoors as possible.\n“It was my big adventure,” Bramwell said. “I couldn’t wait to drop my books and head off for the summer.”\n“The interesting part was, I liked studying history, but I loved my summers working for the Forest Service,” he said, “…but I couldn’t figure out how to get the two together.”\nBramwell’s love of history started at a young age; since his mother was a history buff, she recognized and cultivated this passion in him. It wasn’t until graduate school that Bramwell finally found out that he could combine his love for the nation’s natural resources and his interest in history.\n“Coming out of a hotshot crew was like a chocolate donut with chocolate frosting for me!”\nBramwell enjoys communicating the insights and significance of Forest Service history to stakeholders, political leaders and the public while improving agency operations and employee morale.\nLearn more about Bramwell in his feature on Faces of the Forest, a bi-weekly feature of the Office of Communication to showcase the people, places and professions within the agency.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Faces of the Forest\n Forestry\n FS",
