This includes manufactured homes, which can help boost the housing supply in rural America and bring homeownership within reach for millions of people.\nThrough the Combination Construction-to-Permanent Loan Program (, 158 ), USDA and its lending partners are making sure the dreams for millions to achieve homeownership come true by requiring no money down.\nUnder this program, USDA guarantees 100% of the appraised value of the home and land. The program also helps lenders finance land costs, closing costs, site development, installation and setup costs for the home. It also allows lenders to obtain the loan note guarantee up front, creating more flexibility for both the lender and borrower.\nFor example, USDA’s lending partner Metroplex Mortgage Services Inc. is working with the agency to ensure people in rural Florida, Texas, Tennessee and Alabama have a place to call home.\nMetroplex Mortgage Services Inc. President Sean Stephens said the company recently helped a single mother buy a new manufactured home with the Combination Construction-to-Permanent Loan Program. She was able to qualify due to the no-money-down requirement and the flexibility of the program.\nGuild Mortgage, based in San Diego, California, is financing four manufactured homes through the Single-Family Housing Guarantee Loan Program to help people in the Paradise community hit by wildfires access affordable housing as soon as possible. The homes are a construction type known as CrossMod. These types of homes blend the features of site-built homes with the innovative and efficient methods of factory construction and result in a product that appears as a conventional stick-built home.\nChecklist for Lenders\nIf you’re a lender who is interested in financing new manufactured home construction through USDA’s Combination Construction-to-Permanent Loan Program, here are some tips to keep in mind. In order to receive USDA Rural Development financing, the unit must be new and:\n Transported directly from the manufacturer to the site where it will be financed.\n Have a floor area of no less than 400 square feet.\n Installed on a permanent foundation built according to FHA .\n Meet the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standard.\n Certified by its builder that thermal requirements have been met.\nFor more information, visit Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program | Rural Development (usda.gov).\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Rural Development\n Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan program\n homeownership\n You May Also Like\n USDA Thinks Outside the Box at Inaugural Innovation Event\n Diversifying the Policy Space: Tribal Policy Intern Celeste Lucero\n USDA Rural Development Celebrates National Homeownership Month",

In Indian Country, culture and tradition are sustained through shared meals with family and the community. Traditional foods are a powerful way for each new generation to connect with and honor its history and its ancestors, and participants in USDA’s Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) have access to more traditional foods than ever this year. November, Native American Heritage Month, is an especially fitting time to celebrate the addition to FDPIR of bison, blue cornmeal, wild rice, and wild salmon – foods that not only nourish a body but sustain a culture.\nIn collaboration with the FDPIR community, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service and Food and Nutrition Service have been working to identify culturally relevant foods to procure and offer through FDPIR, a program that provides healthy food and nutrition education to an average of 92,500 income-eligible individuals living on or near reservations across the United States each month. The food package offers more than 100 domestically sourced, nutritious foods, including a variety of meat, poultry, fish, dairy, grains, and fruits and vegetables.

But the growth in agricultural trade doesn’t mean that trade flows were insulated from the effects of the pandemic. Much of was in fact shaped by other factors. For instance, 95% of global agricultural trade growth came from China and was driven in part by non-pandemic related factors of increased feed demand, efforts to restock grain reserves, and policy factors. A recent paper by USDA’s Office of the Chief Economist, Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19? Findings from an Econometric Assessment (, 1.4 ) (Arita et al.), suggests that while agricultural trade remained stable at the aggregate level, a deeper empirical analysis reveals there were still significant disruptions due to the pandemic.\n Mirvat Sewadeh, Communications Director, Office of the Chief Economist\n Posted in\n Trade\n May 20, \n Respond to this story",

A stronghold of the region’s environment and economy, longleaf was an essential building material used during the American Industrial Revolution. Today, only four percent of the original forests remain standing.\nThe Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Alabama is working with groups to revive this strong and resilient wood, while also providing environmental benefits for the Gulf Coastal Plain’s wildlife and water.\nThrough the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), NRCS is collaborating with The Conservation Fund (TCF), Resource Management Service (RMS), and many others on the Coastal Headwaters Forest, on a working forest project in Alabama and Florida.  The first RCPP phase is underway in Florida. The second phase in Alabama will use $5.1 million from RCPP, leveraged by $5.1 million in private and public partner funding, to protect and restore the longleaf pine ecosystem on 4,500 acres.\nThe Coastal Headwaters Forest Partnership offers a needed solution, bringing partners and resources together to conserve and restore longleaf pine habitat on private lands, where the majority of southeastern forest land is located.\nNRCS will place a conservation easement on property in Alabama, providing protection and preventing land fragmentation. By preventing the forests from becoming fragmented into smaller parcels, the lands retain their ability to provide space for wildlife to live and migrate, as well as filter our water and remove CO2 from the air is compromised. The private landowner, RMS, will retain ownership, restore longleaf pine, keep the land on the tax rolls, and continue its forestry work that benefits the regional economy.\nSeveral partners attended a tour of the RCPP project area in the Coastal Headwaters Forest in Baldwin County, Alabama this summer.\nDuring a site tour held in late June, several partners, including the Longleaf Alliance, Alabama Wildlife Federation and the E. O. Wilson Foundation joined NRCS, The Conservation Fund and RMS in visiting key areas that will see direct benefits of restoring the longleaf pine ecosystem.\n“Restoring longleaf pine in Alabama’s Gulf Coastal Plain will preserve two major coastal river systems, Perdido and Escambia Rivers, in the Gulf Coastal Plain and protect habitat for the threatened gopher tortoise and approximately 250 other species related to longleaf pine habitat,” said NRCS Alabama State Conservationist, Ben Malone.\nThe private landowner’s commitment to longleaf pine conservation and restoration is critical to regional wildlife and water protection.  The keystone species include the gopher tortoise, cotton-tailed rabbit and indigo snake. The project will also help protect and filter the many miles of streams flowing to the Perdido River and into the Gulf of Mexico.\n“With the RCPP grant, dozens of public and private partners are ready to meet, educate, make a change and be a model for restoring longleaf pine in Alabama’s Gulf Coastal Plain. The Coastal Headwaters Forests Partnership will make a difference in reversing the decline in longleaf pine and show large commercial timberland owners that longleaf pine can be a viable economic resource,” The Conservation Fund’s Andrew Schock said.\nThe Coastal Headwaters Forest Partnership will advance the goals of America’s Longleaf Restoration Initiative—a collaborative, public-private effort to restore the threatened longleaf ecosystems across eight million acres by .\nThe Longleaf Pine Ecosystem is one of several “critical conservation areas”—or focal areas—for the RCPP, and this project will build on other RCPP longleaf efforts in the Southeast, along with other federal, state and private investments being made throughout a 9-state region to restore longleaf pine.\nCreated by the Farm Bill, RCPP investments of nearly $600 million have already driven 199 partner-led projects, including four projects in Alabama. The program leverages local leadership to establish partnerships that can include private companies, local and tribal governments, universities, non-profits and other non-government partners to work with farmers, ranchers and forest landowners on landscape-and watershed-scale conservation solutions that work best for their region.\nThis is an established longleaf pine stand located in the Coastal Headwaters Forest just off the Gulf Coast in Alabama.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Alabama\n Conservation\n Farm Bill\n Florida\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n Forests\n longleaf pines\n NRCS\n Regional Conservation Partnership Program\n The Conservation Fund",

The Golden Apple Award, for example, is presented to teachers and parents who are “caught being healthy.”\n“Last year one of our Kindergarten teachers decided to change up the menu for the Valentine’s Day Party- but she did it in such a positive way that no one felt deprived,” said Fitzpatrick. “It was a beautiful party full of healthy red, white, and pink foods- things the kids love, like strawberries and yogurt. The kids had a great time.  No one had a chance to miss cupcakes!”\nOne thoughtful parent award-winner was looking for a way to thank hard working teachers. She developed an after-school exercise program conveniently located and timed so that staff could participate before leaving the school building. Yet another parent manages the school garden.

NRCS photo by Gene Barickman.\nNo matter where you grew up, you are likely familiar with monarch butterflies. You may have childhood memories from science class when you watched those peculiar green caterpillars transform into beautiful butterflies. Depending on where you live, you may have seen masses of their orange-and-black wings fluttering in the sky while the butterflies were on their annual cross-country migratory journey.\nToday, the iconic monarch butterfly is under pressure. Habitat loss has led to a steady decrease in their numbers.\nWe’re working to reverse that trend. This year, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is launching a targeted effort in ten key states to create and enhance habitat for the iconic monarch on private lands. Through this effort, we’re partnering with farmers and ranchers to voluntarily establish habitat for the monarch on working lands while ensuring America’s farms and ranches stay productive.\nBecause monarch butterflies are often on the move, they need to have the right plants at the right time along their migration route, including milkweed, which is the sole food source for monarch caterpillars. We worked with butterfly experts across the United States to choose the best plant species for monarchs based on geographic location and value to monarchs.\nWe’re focusing efforts in the southern Great Plains and Midwest – two regions at the heart of the monarch’s migration. In the southern Great Plains, our work will focus on rangelands and ways to improve the health of pastures so they provide good forage for livestock and food for monarchs. In the Midwest we’re focusing on integrating plantings into croplands and making improvements to wetland areas.\nWe’re looking for private landowners in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas and Wisconsin who are interested in making monarch-friendly improvements to their land. These efforts not only benefit butterflies, they also strengthen agricultural operations, support other beneficial insects and wildlife and improve our natural resources.\nWhen we designed this effort, we pulled together a variety of tools from the Farm Bill toolbox. In fiscal year , we’re making available $2 million through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and $2 million through the former Wetlands Reserve Program for existing wetland easements. Additionally, we created new enhancements through the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) to establish monarch habitat. The CSP enhancement assistance is available nationwide.\nWe’re also working with the broader federal family on this effort. NRCS’ effort contributes to a multi-agency, international strategy to reverse the monarch’s population decline in North America. The Obama administration, through the National Strategy to Protect Pollinators and Their Habitat, has a goal of increasing the eastern population of monarchs to 225 million by .\nLearn more about the Monarch Butterfly Habitat Development Project and other pollinators.

The Secretary established the People's Garden project in February to commemorate Abraham Lincoln’s 200th birthday.  (See the groundbreaking on YouTube.)  Since then, more than 300 People's Garden have blossomed across the country.\nThe office has 80 Natural Resources Conservation Service, Farm Service Agency, Rural Development and Information Technology Services employees. The employees will volunteer their time to help care for and harvest the garden. The garden's bounty will help needy families in the area and provide a hands-on learning experience for second graders at North Dover Elementary School.\nAnd not only does the Delaware garden grow food, it grows partnerships, as well. At the ceremony, NRCS Chief Dave White pointed to the cooperative efforts by federal and state agencies, schools, and private conservation groups to make the garden a reality.\nRural Development Deputy Under Secretary Cheryl Cook told the crowd that this and other People’s Garden’s are important to making people aware of where their food comes from and encouraging smart eating.\nMichael Scuse, Deputy Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services, affirmed that People’s Gardens educate the public about the work that farmers do every day to provide food, fiber, and fuel. \nNRCS Delaware State Conservationist Russell Morgan said that he sees People’s Gardens as ways to teach lessons in taking better care of natural resources.\nOne phase of the People's Garden at the USDA office in Dover is the expansion of a rain garden. Storm water runoff and flooding are top concerns in the Delaware Estuary because of the damage that can occur when large volumes of rainwater occur.\nLearn more about the People's Garden movement at www.usda.gov/peoplesgarden.\nNRCS employees dig out paths and install borders and landscape fabric.\nThe garden is in the final construction stages.

That’s right, “Happier than a pig in mud!” Feral swine are no exception to this old farmer’s anecdote. Because they lack sweat glands, wallowing in mud and water is an instinctual behavior necessary for them to maintain a healthy body temperature. Unfortunately this behavior has cascading impacts, not only to water quality in individual streams, ponds, and wetlands, but to entire watersheds and ecosystems.\nExcessive feral swine traffic around wallows and water sources causes erosion along stream banks and shorelines. Sounders, or family groups, of feral swine spend large amounts of their day around the wallow, especially in hot weather, which means they leave significant amounts of urine and feces in and around the water. The impacts to water quality go far beyond the immediate wallow site when silt, excrement, and potentially harmful pathogens, are washed down stream.\n Jeanine Neskey, APHIS Wildlife Technician\n Posted in\n Health and Safety\n Animals\n Plants\n USDA Results\n Jul 08, \n 6 Responses",

They all braved the winter weather and traveled to the site of Super Bowl XLV to support the Fuel Up to Play 60 (FUTP60) program. FUTP60 conducted a kids’ football clinic at the NFL Experience, an interactive theme park at the Dallas Convention Center. The clinic, aimed at kids,  focused on the fundamentals to improve nutrition and physical activity in their schools and personal lives.\nKids from the local school district and beyond arrived at the converted Astroturf playing field, anxious to get moving. The buzz in the air wasn’t from the Katy Perry song reverberating throughout the arena; it was the excitement of kids anxiously awaiting the chance to run on the field to learn from the pros – Cowboy’s linebacker DeMarcus Ware and Colts’ wide receiver Reggie Wayne.\nAfter encouraging the kids to eat healthy and stay active, Secretary Vilsack introduced them to the dairy farmers on hand, who are working hard to provide kids across the nation with the dairy products that are so critical to a nutritious diet. While two major dairy states were represented in the Super Bowl, I have to say that it looked like more of the farmers on hand were backing the Steelers, rather than the Green Bay Cheeseheads.\nAs the players took to the field the kids were all high-fives and cheers. The impact and influence of high profile players and role models, committed to living a healthy and active life, cannot be overstated. You could see it clearly in the wide-eyed stares and smiles of every child as they clung to every word from the NFL pros.\nAs the players and kids ran through ladder and reception drills the excitement was overwhelming – we were all ready to suit up for the big game.  Not wanting to get hit by an overthrown pass from DeMarcus, I headed to the sideline where parents stood with cameras in hand and was caught up in a conversation between Secretary Vilsack and a Steelers fan.  The Steelers fan pointed out his son and said that he couldn’t be happier to see him out there active, healthy, and having a great time.\nTwo years ago the father promised his son they could go see the Steelers play in the Super Bowl, but when the big day came, his son was in the hospital receiving a bone marrow transplant.  Fast-forward two years and this father kept his promise to take his son to a Steelers Super Bowl. Not only did they get to go, he watched on as his son joined NFL greats running, laughing and playing in perfect health.\nWhile the Super Bowl is the ultimate goal for any aspiring football player, the Fuel Up to Play 60 events were a dream come true for the kids, as well. The energy in the convention center was contagious and everyone thought of how to bring this excitement to communities across the country. Suffice it to say that FUTP60 has some big goals and some big names on board to reach those goals.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n Dallas\n DeMarcus Ware\n Fuel Up to Play 60\n NFL\n Nutrition\n Reggie Wayne\n Super Bowl XLV\n Texas\n Tom Vilsack\n video",

The ten regional USDA Climate Hubs were established to synthesize and translate climate science and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers that are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA's Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate.\"\nIt can be a daunting task to try to plan for something as big and complex as climate change. Uncertainty, whether we will be facing drought, extreme storms—or both—from one year to the next, may make planning for healthy and productive forests seem impossible for managers and landowners.\nJust like no two forests are alike, neither are the people who own or manage them.  The different values and goals are reflected in the variety of decisions people make when responding to risks or incentives.  The USDA Northern Forests Climate Hub and the Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science (NIACS) are focused on helping people think about climate change in a way that’s practical and relevant to their particular goals.  We use the Adaptation Workbook to help all kinds of organizations and people consider climate adaptation while meeting their land stewardship goals.\n Todd Ontl, USDA Climate Hub Fellow\n Posted in\n Forestry\n USDA Results\n May 11, \n Respond to this story",

Who doesn’t participate, and why not? Policymakers need high-quality on such questions to make informed decisions about these programs, which affect millions of lives each year. That is why two USDA agencies are collaborating with the U.S. Census Bureau to produce research that sheds new light on the programs.\nThe strategic partnership among USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS), the USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), and the Census Bureau brings each agency’s expertise to the effort. ERS is USDA’s principal social science research agency, while FNS administers USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – which serves about 42 million people a year, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) – in which about 7.2 million people participate. The Census Bureau not only conducts the nation’s decennial census, but is the leading source of quality about the U.S. people and economy.\nThe three-way collaboration, known as the Next-Generation Platform, combines USDA administrative with survey and administrative from other government programs to provide a more complete picture of the SNAP and WIC programs. It is yielding findings that would otherwise be impossible to obtain.\nFor example, ERS researchers used the Next-Generation platform to link two sources to estimate the SNAP Access Rate - that is, the share of eligible people who participate in SNAP within small geographic areas (such as counties) and for certain demographic groups (such as race/ethnicity, household type, and veteran status). The SNAP administrative helps to identify the number of participants, while the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey on income, citizenship, and household composition helps to estimate how many people are eligible to participate in a particular area.\nYou can view an interactive visualization of these rates for New York. Three , SNAP Access at the State and County Levels: Evidence from Texas SNAP Administrative Records and the American Community Survey, Annual and Monthly SNAP Participation Rates, and Improving the Assessment of SNAP Targeting Using Administrative Records, provide additional detail on some of the findings that have already come out of this project.\nThe partnership between USDA and the Census Bureau is a long-term effort to acquire State-level for SNAP and WIC, which will continue to inform the research. The individual records in a State’s dataset can be linked in a secure environment, protecting confidentiality, to matching records in government surveys or in administrative from other government programs.\nAs States have learned about the project and have seen the value of sharing, more States have provided their to the project. In mid-year of , 20 State SNAP agencies (including some of the counties in California) and 11 State WIC agencies were partners in the Next-Generation Platform.\nResearch based on this collaborative -linking effort will continue to produce findings that inform policymakers and the American public.\nUSDA’s Economic Research Service and Food and Nutrition Service are partnering with the U.S. Census Bureau to acquire and link USDA administrative and survey , enabling researchers to get a more complete picture of the 42 million people who participate in SNAP and the 7.3 million women, infants and children in the WIC program.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Economic Research Service\n food assistance\n Food and Nutrition Service\n U.S. Census Bureau\n SNAP",

The former President also noted the importance of elevating the status of women in developing countries, educating them, and giving them job opportunities.  He said that agriculture will be at the “vortex” of major global issues.\nThe forum continues through tomorrow.

In a PWS scheme, landowners are financially compensated for the watershed services they provide.  The payment for watershed services helps incentivize watershed protection and leads to net increases in forest protection and improved management.\nFor example, in New York City, the local government pays landowners for provision of watershed services directly and provides a suite of enhanced services to landowners, in part funded by water users downstream.  Through conservation easements, riparian restoration, and land purchase, the city has protected more than 35% of the watershed. A watershed forestry program, run by the non-profit Watershed Agricultural Council in partnership with city, state and federal partners including the U. S. Forest Service, provides the enhanced services and incentives to landowners.\nAbundant, clean water is a precious resource and one of the most valuable products provided by public and private forest lands. Drinking water is also one of most direct links between people and the valuable services that forests provide. Private forest owners and the Forest Service clearly have an important responsibility as stewards of not just the land but the nation’s liquid assets as well.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Forestry\n FS\n water\n watershed\n World Water Day",

Every May Americans recognize their efforts and express gratitude during Military Appreciation Month. At USDA, we also celebrate the contributions that our Military members have made to agriculture and farming.\nIn , for the first time the Census of Agriculture, conducted by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), collected information about agricultural producers who served or are currently serving in the U.S. Armed Forces.\nThe resulting showed that 370,619 producers – 11% of the country’s 3.4 million producers – had military service. These producers accounted for 129,144,965 acres and $41 billion in agriculture sales.\nFarms operated by producers with military service accounted for 11% of total U.S. agriculture sales, with 53% ($22 billion) in crop sales and 47% ($19 billion) in sales of livestock and livestock products. The ag census also found that 17% of all farms had a producer who served or is serving in the U.S. Armed Forces.\nThe Census of Agriculture, currently underway, will provide updated information on military producers, which they can use when making decisions about their operations.\nCollecting on producers with military service is critical to providing needed programs and services. For example, USDA offers programs that benefit veterans who want to transition to agriculture, or start or expand a rural business. USDA is committed to ensuring service members have the tools they need to grow and thrive in agriculture.\nIt’s not too late for all producers to respond to the ag census.

The workshop was held at the University of Puerto Rico Agricultural Experimental Station in Corozal, Puerto Rico. (Photo by William Gould)\nThe United States and its territories have suffered five consecutive years of at least $10 billion weather and climate disasters. And, for five consecutive years, USDA’s Climate Hubs have been there to help American agriculture prepare for and respond to these and other major climate events.\nClimate Hubs were introduced in February to develop and deliver science-based information, technology, tools, and education to help stakeholders make climate-informed decisions in 10 specific regions. “The Climate Hubs connect USDA research to programs and serve as a model for how to put climate resilience into practice,” said Rachel Steele, national climate hub lead with USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS).\nClimate Hubs, led by ARS and U.S. Forest Service, include representatives from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, Farm Service Agency, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and Risk Management Agency. Scientists in the hubs assess climate risks and vulnerabilities based on regional needs, including drought, forest and crop resilience, and threats from pests and disease.\nOne of the most highly-visible efforts to date has been the Caribbean Climate Hub’s response to devastation in Puerto Rico caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. After discovering that the storms damaged about 30 million of the island’s trees, staff provided training to develop knowledge and technical skills that improved the island’s capacity to generate high-value products from the downed trees, such as furniture, musical instruments, and artisanal products.\nIn the North Central United States, staff at the Northern Plains Climate Hub in Fort Collins, CO, and their collaborators developed Grassland Productivity Forecast (Grass-Cast), an online tool that helps ranchers predict the amount of vegetation on rangelands. Grass-Cast provides ranchers and other land managers with information about the likely availability – or shortage – of grazing resources in their area.\nOver five years, the Climate Hubs have provided critical resources and services (, 613 ), including collectively providing technical expertise to more than 17,000 people through 237 webinars, podcasts, and other digital media; participating in more than 410 peer-reviewed publications and 690 other papers; sharing climate-related education resources to more than 15,000 youth at over 50 events; and developing 36 pieces of formal curricula geared toward USDA staff, producers, foresters, land managers, and K-12 students.\nIn its five-year review, the Climate Hub Executive Committee learned that demand for programs and products exceeds current capacity. The Committee determined that the hubs could play a larger role co-producing regionally relevant science.\n“The Hubs are poised to support the regional implementation of the USDA’s Agriculture Innovation Agenda, recently announced by Secretary Perdue, and the climate adaptation components of the USDA’s Science Blueprint (, 2.6 ),” Steele said. “In a world with growing populations and at-risk natural resources, increasing production while reducing our ecological footprint will foster a resilient agricultural sector that can withstand the spectrum of environmental shocks and extreme events.\n“The hubs are a model for ensuring that working land managers, extension professionals, and agricultural advisors have the information, , and tools they need to build landscape-level climate resilience,” she said.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Agricultural Research Service\n ARS\n USDA Science\n USDA Science Blueprint\n USDA Climate Hubs",

The exhibit features exciting new interactive components. Visitors experience a connection to the Great Lakes through hands-on learning and up-close encounters with native Great Lakes species.\n“There is a strong connection between the health of national forests and the health of the Great Lakes,” said Regional Forester Kathleen Atkinson. “The Forest Service is thrilled to collaborate with the Shedd Aquarium to raise awareness about the interconnectedness of these resources.”\nAfter strolling through Shedd’s impressive views of aquatic species from around the world, visitors come “home” to the Great Lakes. Upon entering At Home on the Great Lakes, visitors are greeted by a very special welcoming committee of three lake sturgeons in a “touch pool.” Visitors have the opportunity to touch the “freshwater giant” that is sometimes referred to as a “living fossil.” Found in all five Great Lakes, lake sturgeon are the longest and largest living fish in the Great Lakes, growing up to 9 feet long and weighing as much as 200 pounds.\nThe Forest Service Eastern Region is a proud partner of this exhibit, providing funding to Shedd Aquarium through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. One of the emphasis areas of this initiative is education and outreach to the general public on aquatic and terrestrial invasive species.\nMaking this partnership even more significant is the fact that six Eastern Region national forests are within the Great Lakes basin – Chequamegon-Nicolet, Ottawa, Hiawatha, Superior, Huron-Manistee, and Finger Lakes national forests.\nShedd Aquarium focuses on four key Great Lakes issues:\nbuilding awareness of ecological separation;\ncontributing to solution oriented research to address invasive species;\naccelerating habitat restoration; and\nprotecting and promoting native wildlife.\nVisitors to the aquarium will also see Asian carp, sea lampreys and the small but destructive round gobies, all invasive species threatening the health of U.S. waterways. The exhibit helps visitors understand what they can do to help prevent the spread of these invasive species.\nDigital technology enhances the visitor experience, allowing guests to learn more about the species they see, as well as get breaking news from monitors providing real-time updates on basin-wide conservation news and events.\nThe Forest Service has long been a partner with Shedd, who provides an outlet for education and outreach at an extremely large scale – 2 million people visit the aquarium each year.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n aquatic species\n Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest\n Chicago\n fish\n Forestry\n FS\n Great Lakes Restoration Initiative\n Hiawatha National Forest\n Huron-Manistee National Forest\n invasive species\n national forests\n Ottawa National Forest\n Superior National Forest",

USDA photo by Bob Nichols.\nRecently, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack opened the G-8 International Conference on Open for Agriculture here in Washington.  As head of the U.S. Delegation, the Secretary noted that “ is quickly becoming one of the most important commodities in agriculture,” and encouraged the sharing of to magnify its power. Hundreds of individuals attended from around the world and thousands more watched the event as it was streamed on the Internet. In this blog, Katherine Townsend, Special Assistant for Engagement at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) gives an example of how open can improve crop yield and help producers keep more of the income generated by their labor.\nJimmy Wambua, a social justice worker and young entrepreneur in Nairobi, Kenya, saw a problem. In a country where smallholder farmers grow the food that feeds the Kenyan people, crop yields were not reaching their full potential and growers were not getting a fair price. Decisions about what crops to plant and when were made on speculation and instinct, and farmers sold their crops based on prices offered by middlemen and traders. A solution seemed evident: increase access and sharing of information that already exists and is public, but is not in-use by the farmers. Jimmy joined the M-Farm organization that set up a text-message based mobile phone application for farmers to gain a better price by accessing market price for their crops- rather than relying on the word of the buyer- and provide a platform for farmers to sell their goods online. USAID contributed to the work of M-Farm- not through a grant or loan or other financial capital- but with information capital. With the release of an open set from the Famine Early Warning System (FEWSNet) M-Farm now has access to ten years of historic about market prices of crops, which show trends in crop price fluctuation, and enables better decision making on which crops to plant to yield the highest income.\nM-Farm’s story was just one of dozens that took the stage April 29 & 30 at the G-8 International Open Agriculture Conference and showcased innovative organizations that use open to support global food security. Dr. Howard-Yana Shapiro of Mars Global shared progress on mapping the genomes of over 100 crops that are vital to food security, but are overlooked because they are not commercially viable. Palantir Technologies and Grameen Foundation displayed their open app that they developed at USAID’s Hack for Hunger,which uses community knowledge worker-collected and Palantir analytics to build a crop-specific food security early warning system for farmers in Uganda.\nThe concept of open agriculture fuses transparency and technology to improve food security worldwide; farmers, entrepreneurs, and researchers recognize the impact and potential of increasing access to information and are increasingly receiving high-level support. USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack touted the U.S. Government’s leadership role in increasing open for development impact and for global growth. Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, highlighted the use of open genomic to leapfrog development of new agricultural products. Dr. Kathryn Sullivan, acting NOAA Administrator and the first American woman to walk in space, delivered an inspiring perspective of the role that can play in transcending and unifying an Earth without country borders or sector divisions. Four hundred food security specialists, scientists, and technology experts gathered with policy makers from G-8 and the six African New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition countries to work together to increase available information and launch G-8 country action plans to get more open from both the public and private sector. U.S. Chief Technology Officer and Special Assistant to the President Todd Park cheered the work of the conference stating that, “by liberating from the vaults of government and the private sector, we can accelerate the use of open agriculture and nutrition to advance global food security while also fueling the growth of new businesses and jobs.”\nUSAID has been consistently demonstrating its role as a leader in increasing open . Multiple G-8 conference speakers joined because of products they had made as a result of the December Development DataJam that USAID’s Innovation & Development Alliances (IDEA) office co-hosted with the White House Office of Science & Technology Policy. At the DataJam, USAID leadership joined with other issue experts, innovators, scientists, and entrepreneurs to commit to developing prototypes that use open to improve international. Continuing the support of these and other innovators and social entrepreneurs, last week USAID launched www.usaid.gov/developer with new datasets and tools that had previously not been available to the public, including some we support through Feed the Future the U.S. Government’s global hunger and food security initiative. Each of these datasets are useful on their own, and when compared and applied with other datasets from USAID and other organizations, they have the growing potential to dramatically increase the impact and efficiency of international assistance.\nIn an increasingly networked and tech-savvy world, open has the potential for more people to use information for social good, and USAID and global development goals directly benefit from increasing access to information.Like any technological tool, open is useless without the people applying and engaging with it. Only through active and consistent participation can we ensure that information is timely, useful, and used. We can expect that these changes will come. Let’s get that information online and useable. Let’s get open.Food security is just the beginning.\nby Katherine Townsend, Special Assistant for Engagement\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Feed the Future\n G-8\n G-8 International Conference on Open for Agriculture\n Kenya\n Open \n Open Gov\n OpenAgData\n Tom Vilsack\n Uganda\n USAID",

My itinerary included a visit to a tempeh and tofu production compound, or village, in the Cipayung neighborhood of East Jakarta, where local workers are using U.S. soybeans to produce nutritious, affordable, high-quality food products.\nTempeh, a cake made from fermented soybeans, and tofu or soybean curd, are staples of the Indonesian diet. Those with limited incomes rely on these relatively inexpensive, soy-based products for their high protein and nutrient content. Demand for the products continues to grow, especially in Greater Jakarta, which has one of the fastest-growing population rates of any urban area in the world. But historically, tempeh and tofu production has been small-scale, informal and often unhygienic.\nIn January , the American Soybean Association-International Marketing (ASA-IM) – which receives export market development funding from USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service – established Forum Tempeh Indonesia (FTI) to provide support to small-scale tempeh producers at the village level, particularly in the area of proper hygiene.  Mercy Corps International, a U.S.-based humanitarian organization, has partnered with FTI to renovate tempeh and tofu production facilities in Jakarta under a pilot project. Supported by technical assistance through ASA, as well as private-sector funding, FTI and Mercy Corps have upgraded tempeh village facilities, hygiene practices and production equipment. As a result, production costs at these project sites have been reduced by as much as 30 percent.\nDespite Indonesia’s growing demand for soybeans, the country’s domestic production is relatively limited. In fact, more than ates. U.S. soybean sales to Indonesia have grown 40 percent in the last six years, reaching a record $805 million in calendar year and making it our fifth-largest market. All of the soybeans used at the Cipayung tempeh village come from the United States.\nOn my visit, I watched each step in the production process, and couldn’t help but feel pride in that U.S. support has helped to improve production of a food source important to Indonesians, and that U.S. soybeans are playing such a crucial role in feeding the Indonesian people and the world.\nTo learn more about the Agribusiness Trade and Investment Mission to Indonesia, visit our website.\n Category/Topic:\n Trade\n Tags:\n American Soybean Association\n FAS\n Indonesia\n Mercy Corps International\n Michael Scuse\n Southeast Asia\n Tempeh\n tofu\n Trade and Investment Missions",

Farmers’ market incentive programs, which couple access to healthy foods with incentives to purchase healthy products while at the market, help SNAP recipients consume a healthy diet.\nAs spring marches closer, farmers markets across the country are ramping up or reopening for the season. In addition to year-round staples like local milk, meat, and grains, the stars of the season—asparagus, onions, new potatoes, lamb, and greens of all varieties—are beginning to make their debuts. In a few months’ time, the markets will be in full swing, bursting with berries and zucchini and other summer fruits and vegetables. Here at USDA, we’re working hard to ensure participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have access to this healthful, local bounty.\nRemarkable progress has been made in providing better access to the nation’s 8,200 farmers markets and farm stands; more than 4,200 markets and direct marketing farmers now redeem SNAP benefits.  Beyond providing heightened access to farmers markets, we know that coupling access with incentives to purchase healthy products while at the market helps SNAP recipients consume a healthy diet. A new report from USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service makes clear that private sector organizations share the goal of increasing access and incentives, and are willing to dedicate financial resources to ensuring the success of this approach. Researchers for the Farmers Market Incentive Provider Study interviewed representatives from more than 100 organizations that provide financial incentives to SNAP participants redeeming their benefits at farmers markets.  Wholesome Wave is a great example of a not-for-profit organization that partners with 305 farmers markets in 24 states with nutrition incentive programs for doubling SNAP, WIC, and Senior Farmers Market vouchers at farmers markets.\nThe USDA report researched how these organizations design and run their incentive programs, how they choose markets to participate, and how they evaluate the success of their efforts. The study also identified challenges that they face; it’s no surprise that securing sustained funding topped the list.\nFarmer’s market incentive programs are discovering new partnerships and affinities with health care organizations, local public health efforts, philanthropies, donors, and others in support of their work.  But the need for institutional local support far exceeds current private reserves.  In that regard, I am happy to report that the new Agriculture Act of enacted and signed by President Obama provides additional support for incentive programs.  Although the details are still being finalized, the legislation includes $100 million in grant money to provide federal matching funds for incentive projects that increase the amount of fruits and vegetables bought by SNAP households.  State, local, and tribal agencies; nonprofits; SNAP-authorized retailers; and economic development agencies, among others, are eligible to apply for the grants.\nI’m encouraged by the efforts of the many incentive providers and partners highlighted in the study, and pleased that soon USDA will be able to contribute much needed financial resources to augment the impact of these important programs. It’s clear that in working together we can help SNAP participants fill their farmer’s market baskets with items sure to support a healthy diet and a healthy farm economy in communities across the country.\nAnd that is the kind of ‘yield’ that both farmers and consumers alike can applaud.\nEditor’s Note: To further enhance SNAP redemptions at farmers markets, USDA also recently funded the creation of MarketLink.org, a website that assists farmers markets in becoming SNAP-authorized and helps them determine whether they are eligible for no-cost Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) equipment.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n EBT\n Farm Bill\n Farmers Markets\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n Food Stamps\n fresh fruits and vegetables\n HealthierNextGen\n Kevin Concannon\n KYF2\n President Obama\n Senior Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program\n SNAP\n WIC",

Like many, my perceptions were created by years of media reporting. On Saturday, I arrived in Baghdad in a Blackhawk helicopter, and am still processing my feelings of heartbreak and inspiration. Yesterday I was honored to open the first U.S. agribusiness trade mission to Iraq in more than 20 years. At the opening plenary session, nearly 20 U.S. companies and more than 150 Iraqi entrepreneurs and buyers were present, as well as U.S. and Iraqi government officials.  The U.S. companies on the mission are both large and small, representing commodity, consumer-ready food, and forest product industries, as well as agricultural input suppliers, including agricultural equipment and irrigation system manufacturers.\nThe purpose of this trade mission is simple: to increase U.S. agricultural exports to Iraq, promote joint ventures, and boost investment in Iraq’s developing agricultural sector. Over two days, U.S. and Iraqi producers, processors, buyers, traders, and investors will meet face-to-face in dozens of one-on-one meetings. In these meetings business will be conducted, ideas will be exchanged, and friendships will be forged. The courage and optimism of all the participants cannot be overstated. We hope this mission will be looked back on as a turning point in our relationship. As Ambassador Christopher Hill said in the opening address, we hope we will move from America being represented by General Petraeus and General Odierno, to General Foods and General Mills.\nAgriculture is an important part of Iraq’s economy.  It is the country’s second largest economic sector, accounting for 9.6 percent of its gross domestic product and employing about 20 percent of its labor force. The country’s farmers produce wheat, barley, rice, vegetables, dates, cotton, livestock, and poultry.  But, with Iraq’s population expected to nearly double in the next 25 years, agricultural imports, including those produced by Iraqi farmers plus edible oils, pulses, and a variety of consumer-ready products, are needed to feed the country’s growing urban middle class and low-income consumers.  In addition, Iraq has vast natural resources and great potential to further boost agricultural productivity and output of a broad array of farm products. What it needs are agricultural inputs, such as seeds, feed, and machinery to put this potential to work. With greater access to inputs, Iraq’s agricultural sector can develop more quickly. The U.S. companies on this mission can meet these varied needs.\nUSDA’s strategy also reflects the Strategic Framework Agreement that the United States and Iraq signed in December . That agreement outlines the U.S.-Iraq bilateral relationship and recognizes that building a prosperous and diversified economy in Iraq will be key to its stability and integration into the world economy.\nI am someone who has worked for over 30 years to promote America’s agricultural exports all over the world. Nothing prepared me for what I have seen here and the spirit and resilience and spirit of the USDA and entire U.S. Government and military team working here in Iraq to give the people here a better chance to live the way anyone would want to, in security and freedom.\nUSDA Head of Delegation Dan Berman discussed the benefits of expanded agriculture trade with Iraqi TV at the June 8 kickoff for the U.S.-Iraq Agriculture Trade Mission in Baghdad.\nAmbassador Christopher R.

Photo courtesy Kansas State Athletics.\nWhen a Kansas State University football player plants his opponent’s face into the turf, the result may be a better-tasting blend of artificial grass. Turf is not a part of the USDA’s MyPlate recommendations, but defensive ends playing in the Wildcats’ stadium can skip their pre-game soy latte and get their fill during the game instead.\nKansas State claims to be the first NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision institution to install soy-based AstroTurf. The synthetic grass also being used at some Major League Baseball and National Football League stadiums is an environmentally-friendly and sustainable alternative to petroleum-based products. With the help of the United Soybean Board, Kansas State was able to join the ranks of other sports organizations using soy-based turf.\nBuilding global demand for U.S. soybeans is the mission of the United Soybean Board, which recently celebrated its 20th anniversary.  The board is administered by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service, and is a checkoff program supported by a collective investment from farmers. The funds are used to strengthen the position of soybeans in the marketplace and expand domestic and foreign markets. The Board’s promotion and outreach efforts spur global demand for U.S.-grown soybeans, which has risen by more than 140 percent over the past 20 years.\nOver the last 20 years, the cohesive research and development work of the soybean checkoff has identified many new uses for soy, and the Kansas State football field is just one example of the program’s success.\nBob Haselwood, the board’s New Uses Chair, said industrial use of U.S. soy has increased 50 percent since . The animal agriculture sector is the primary user of soybeans for the production of feed, but Haselwood said soybean oil is also applied in the development of paint, cleaners and other products.\nThe brand of soy-based turf blanketing the Kansas State Wildcats outdoor stadium qualifies for the USDA BioPreferred program. The program promotes the increased purchase and use of biobased products, and is expected to spur economic development, create new jobs, and provide new markets for farm communities. The USDA BioPreferred program compiles a catalog of biobased products.\nBiobased products are commercial or industrial products (other than food or feed) that are composed in whole, or in significant part, of biological products, renewable agricultural materials (including plant, animal, and marine materials), or forestry materials. The Farm Bill extended the definition of biobased products to include biobased intermediate ingredients or feedstocks.\nSo the next time you watch a Wildcats home football game, remember that the players are literally running on soy.  And that the United Soybean Board, under the oversight of USDA, helped bring this sustainable product into the sports arena.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n AMS\n Kansas\n Kansas State University\n Livestock and Seed Program",

Details are available at www.fs.fed.us/geneworkshop.\nThe story of Super Girl being placed in a pod on Krypton and fired off to earth to help save her cousin and at least some of her species is science fiction. But for many species the danger of extinction from climate change, habitat destruction, or invasive exotic pests is the real deal.\nAt an upcoming Gene Conservation Workshop experts will discuss different ways to safeguard species from climate change and other threats. For forest tree species that are experiencing rapid declines due to invasive exotic pests or climate change, long term seed storage is our best hope so that they can be returned to the wild once a control is found.\nHumans have learned how to preserve vulnerable plant species from extinction, and preserve a wide range of unique individual traits found in plant genes that may help them survive in the future. You can find some of these species including white pine and ash along with a wide variety of other non-endangered plant species at U.S. Forest Service, National Seed Laboratory and Agricultural Research Service seed banks.\nBut the challenge is daunting. For example, blister rust on white pines in the Rocky Mountains and Emerald ash borer on ash species in the eastern US are killing the trees faster than a solution can be found.\nTo save vulnerable species we need to follow their propagation patterns. Seeds of most plants in temperate zones must drift some distance from the mother plant once they mature. As this often occurs during dry weather the seeds must have the ability to dry out without dying. The seeds go into stasis and drift off in their own little escape pod with an embryo safely carried in each seed.\nDuring their journey, humid air surrounding the seed results in higher moisture content and dryer air results in lower moisture content for the seeds. Seeds will always adjust their moisture content to the relative humidity around them. Seed scientists have found that adequate drying of seeds for long-term storage occurs when the air around the seeds is at or close to 30 percent relative humidity.\nIf the air is more humid the biological activity in the seed increases and the seeds begin to lose viability. If the air is much dryer than 30 percent relative humidity water is removed from the seed that is needed for the structural integrity of the cells and physical and chemical damage occurs.\nSo, once the seeds have fully adjusted their moisture content in the ideal environment of 30 percent relative humidity, lab technicians seal them in moisture proof containers to prevent them from reabsorbing moisture should the relative humidity around them increase. Seeds that are dried adequately, sealed in moisture proof packets, and kept at 0o F, can be kept for decades without any decrease in germination and the ability to produce a new plant.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n ARS\n Climate Change\n Forestry\n FS\n Gene Conservation Workshop\n USFS National Seed Laboratory",

They decided in the best interest of this Nation to seek out qualified women for important roles.\nAnd choosing me did come down to some important qualifications, including 40 years of operating a farm, serving as a county executive for the Farm Service Agency, working in the private sector, and my belief that Federal crop insurance is invaluable to the success of any ag operation.\nThis administration’s decision to choose me is a testament not to me, but to this administration's commitment to ALL women. They recognize the value of women in agriculture and what women continue to do throughout time - their day-to-day work, supporting partners, and their desires to make things better for their families, which is why this month - Women's History Month - is so important to me.\nSometime this month, please find a moment to reflect on the contributions and sacrifices of women to society and in our personal lives.\nMarcia Bunger is the Administrator of USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA). Prior to her appointment, she served as a County Executive Director for USDA’s Farm Service Agency.

It validates one's identity, encourages authenticity and builds inclusive and supportive cultures. USDA's correspondence and communication should aim to adopt the use of gender-inclusive pronouns; and normalize clarifying pronouns in communication to eliminate the possibility of misgendering individuals. As a default, the pronouns “they/them/their” should be used in USDA sponsored communications, outreach, and correspondence rather than \"he/she pronouns, unless Program guidance specifically directs otherwise.\nAn individual communicates their pronouns. For example, “Hi my name is John Doe and my pronouns are he/him/his” instead of “Hi my name is John Doe.” A good practice is to inquire into an individual's preferred greeting.

To view the comic—beginning with my debut—visit Mark Trail.\nHow did this happen? James Allen, the strip’s current author, called the APHIS Public Affairs Office with his interest in developing the storyline. I took Allen’s call and answered his questions—not suspecting at the time that I would end up in the comic!  He was curious about the EAB, which likely arrived in the US in the late ’s or early s, in solid wood packing material.  In response, APHIS now requires that imported wood packing material be treated to kill any invasive pests that may be hitchhiking inside. \nI provided an outline of how the USDA would respond if Mark Trail contacted us about the EAB, and developed a scenario to fit into his planned storyline. I told Allen about the sticky purple traps APHIS uses to survey for EAB and the stingless wasps we release as a biological control.\n“Abbey got right on the task and sent over a treasure trove of info and pictures. Details of everything... step by step procedures of their approach to identifying the insect, quarantine of the area and biocontrol practices. Abbey was so helpful, I asked her permission to put her in the strip as an agent of the USDA,” said Allen.\n“She kindly obliged and sent a picture of herself. I referenced from her photo and made her a \"Mark Trail-ized\" character,” he added.\nWhile I provided key messages, it was Allen who crafted the story and art for each installment. He took some scientific and other liberties—ranging from my job title (“Agent Powell” instead of public affairs specialist) to technical points concerning the biology and behavior of EAB, and the story’s ending.\nAllen and I have both been flattered by the response. He said, “As I continued writing the story, her part began to grow. It seems the public's interest grew as well. Readers at the Comics Kingdom website were posting things like ‘I searched Abbey Powell... there is one that actually works at the USDA!’ ... and ‘I found her LinkedIn profile and she looks like the character in the strip!’”\nI’m humbled and honored to be part of this comic strip with national reach to help raise public awareness about EAB and other invasive pests and diseases and what APHIS does to combat these threats.\nSee you in the funny papers!\nFor more information about EAB and other invasive pests, visit www.hungrypests.com.\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Tags:\n APHIS\n EAB\n emerald ash borer\n Hungry Pests\n invasive pests",

(Photo credit: USDA)\nWhen the Buffalo Fire sparked on the White River National Forest on June 12, the flames stopped short of nearly 1,400 residences near Silverthorne, Colorado. But, it wasn’t just the air support from firefighting helicopters and tankers and the more than 150 firefighters on scene that helped prevent a catastrophe in two small mountain subdivisions. Part of the success can also be attributed to proactive work over the last decade to build fuel breaks and reduce hazardous fuels where homes meet wild lands or what is called the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI).\n“The fuel breaks reduced the number of trees available to burn next to homes; gave firefighters safe spots to aggressively fight the fire; and provided for effective fire-retardant drop zones,” said Bill Jackson, district ranger, White River National Forest, USDA Forest Service. “Without the proactive forest treatments, we likely would have lost homes.”\nTanker pilots were able to effectively drop fire retardant (pink foreground) as ground crews simultaneously used the fuel breaks as a safer place to engage the Buffalo Fire near Silverthorne, Colo. On June 13, . (Photo credit: USDA)\nThese fuel breaks are 300- to 500-foot wide open spaces developed between the forest and subdivisions where lodgepole pine trees that had been killed by the mountain pine beetle once stood ripe for ignition. The fuel breaks were built as part of larger proactive forest management programs in Summit County and throughout the watershed around the Dillon Reservoir. \n“Wildfires don’t know boundaries, so when it comes to forest management in Denver Water’s priority watersheds, we take an all hands, all lands approach,” said Christina Burri, watershed scientist at Denver Water. “By partnering with all the land owners, from federal, state, local and private, we’re able to better protect all of our interests from catastrophic wildfires and extend our investment and reach throughout the entire area.” \nOne such partnership is the From Forests to Faucets program, which is a forest management partnership between Denver Water and the Rocky Mountain Region of the Forest Service. Since , Denver Water and the USDA Forest Service have invested approximately $33 million for treatments across 70,000 acres.\n“From Forests to Faucets helps us identify areas where we have common interests in limiting high intensity wildfires and improving forest and watershed health,” Jackson said. “The partnership helped us stretch our funds to treat more acres in Summit County.”\nIn this case, the Forest Service was able to invest in 900 acres of hazardous fuels reduction projects next to the Wildernest and Mesa Cortina neighborhoods above Silverthorne- projects that saved an estimated $913 million worth of homes and infrastructure from the Buffalo Fire.\nThe Colorado State Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service joined From Forests to Faucets in to allow forest managers to take even more of an “all hands, all lands” approach as funds will go to forest treatments on non-federal and private lands as well as national forests.\nA helicopter drops water to cool off hot spots at the edge of a hazardous fuels treatment as the Buffalo Fire erupts on June 12, .

Massachusetts used a USDA Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program grant to help local farmers tap into the $14.3 billion craft brewing industry. Photo courtesy Greg Peverill-Conti.\nOver the years, the way we look at food in America has changed and evolved. As people explore new tastes, adjust their diets and become more familiar with new ingredients, it is up to farmers and ranchers to stay innovative and responsive to new demands. Through my role at USDA I often visit with farmers and ranchers about what it takes to grow their businesses, to remain competitive in a global market, and how USDA is an important partner to help meet these challenges.\nThe Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program (FSMIP), administered by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), is designed to support research projects that improve the marketing, transportation and distribution of U.S. agricultural products. FSMIP is a collaboration between Federal and State governments that puts matching funds from each towards projects that bring new opportunities for farmers and ranchers. \nIn , craft brewing accounted for 14.3 percent of the U.S. beer market—that’s a value of about $14.3 billion. With the market growing 10.9 percent over the last decade, the interest in sourcing local ingredients for the brew has also grown. Looking to tap into the market potential, the Massachusetts Department of Agriculture Resources used a FSMIP grant to partner with the state Brewers Guild. They surveyed craft brewers to assess the variety, volume and value of local ingredients used in the brewing process.\nExploring how farmers and brewers can work together to match production and processing requirements, the project is giving Massachusetts growers more opportunities to sell their products. From pumpkin beer to fruit-infused brew, the combination of locally crafted beer and locally sourced ingredients is resulting in some creative partnerships… and some one-of-a-kind beers. \nOn the opposite end of the grain spectrum, some Americans are looking for alternatives to wheat and barley in their diets. Whether for health reasons or because they want a broader variety of carbohydrates, consumers are interested in more gluten-free options. For Colorado millet growers looking to expand their customer base, it became increasingly important to show consumers how this unique cereal crop can fit into a gluten-free or regular diet.\nA millet medley with carrots, mushrooms and parsley. The Colorado Department of Agriculture used matching funds from a USDA FSMIP grant to help millet growers in the state market their gluten-free grain to consumers. Photo courtesy Jennifer with recipe at \nUsing a FSMIP grant, the Colorado Department of Agriculture worked with a graduate nutrition class at Colorado State University in Fort Collins to develop gluten-free recipes using Colorado millet. The students created appetizers, desserts, snacks and entrees such as Black Bean and Millet Medley, Millet Stuffed Peppers and Spiced Millet Pudding. The project also brought the millet industry together, where they worked collectively to better understand and pursue opportunities in the export market. \nThese are just a couple of examples of the innovative and collaborative spirit inherent to FSMIP projects. USDA will continue to work with states and communities across the country to establish and implement innovative marketing programs that have a positive, lasting effect for states, communities and rural America.\n Category/Topic:\n USDA Results\n Tags:\n AMS\n Colorado\n Colorado Department of Agriculture\n Colorado State University\n craft brewers\n Ed Avalos\n Farmers\n Federal State Marketing Improvement Program\n FSMIP\n gluten-free\n Grants\n innovation\n Massachusetts\n Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources\n millet\n Ranchers",

Since then, scientists have tracked Journey as he zigzagged throughout the state, becoming the first wild wolf in more than 60 years to appear west of the Cascades, and eventually reaching northern California Dec. 28 – all in search of a mate.\nSince Journey’s southward quest for a mate began, he has trekked through Siskiyou National Forest, Umpqua National Forest, and Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. Today, Journey was last seen roaming through Lassen National Forest in northern California.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Forestry\n FS\n Lassen National Forest\n Siskiyou National Forest\n Umpqua National Forest\n Wallowa-Whitman National Forest",

But when describing the activities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), a far better phrase is “working with peanuts,” especially when referring to the agreement recently reached by USDA to provide this nutritional commodity to a neighboring nation in great need, the Republic of Haiti.\nUSDA crafted a deal that will result in 500 metric tons of packaged, dry-roasted peanuts grown in the United States to be shipped later this year to school children in Haiti who have little access to food.  This effort stems from the “Stocks for Food” program that first started in late , a joint project between the Farm Service Agency (FSA), Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS) and Food and Nutrition Services (FNS) that transfers surplus farm commodities in government inventory to feeding programs and food banks both domestically and overseas.\nThe school feeding project in Haiti, where the United Nations will distribute the peanuts, is funded by the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service through the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program, which sends domestic agricultural commodities to school feeding programs at primary schools around the world that are struggling against poverty, malnutrition, and disease. The surplus peanuts will help feed nearly 140,000 malnourished kids for a full school year. Having food available for the kids increases their attendance at school and improves their ability to learn.\nThe Farm Service Agency joins the Foreign Agricultural Service in prideful use of the nation’s commodities to help nations in need. FSA’s Commodity Operations staff in Washington, D.C., and Kansas City, Missouri, worked diligently to procure the peanuts necessary to fulfill the international food-aid mission led by FAS and the domestic needs addressed by the Food and Nutrition Service. The multi-agency, USDA effort is especially rewarding when all of the puzzle pieces fit and a commodity is used wisely to meet nutrition requirements of people throughout the world.\n Category/Topic:\n Trade\n Tags:\n Commodity Operations\n FAS\n FNS\n FSA\n Haiti\n McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program\n Missouri\n peanuts\n United Nations\n Washington DC",

The Farm Income Forecast and Outlook for U.S. Agricultural Trade show a positive picture for , and predict sustained growth for the future. \nThis recovery is a testament to the Farm Bill, to a wide range of efforts of the Obama Administration – such as the Recovery Act – to move the economy forward and to support the agriculture economy, and the hard work and resilience of America’s farmers and ranchers. \nLike the rest of the economy, the agriculture sector has struggled through tough economic times.  But after declining more than 20 percent in , the main measures of farm sector earnings experienced a rapid rebound and are forecast to rise in .  Net farm income has rebounded, up 24 percent from .  And net cash income will be the second highest on record.  \nJust as important – this recovery was sector-wide.  While an increase in the value of livestock production accounted for much of the upward movement, there is also an increase in the value of dairy production, meat animal production, and poultry and egg production.  And this progress is having an immediate effect on the lives of millions of Americans: average farm family household income is projected to reach more than $81,000 in – up 5.8 percent from .\nThese forecasts highlight the importance of USDA’s work to increase agricultural exports as a part of President Obama’s National Export Initiative.  We are pursuing a new trade strategy which looks at nations based on the nature of their marketplace.  We have worked hard to negotiate the removal of barriers to exporting pork, poultry and other products.  And we have pursued an international trading system with rules based on the best available science to ensure that U.S. agricultural producers have fair access to foreign markets.  \nThese efforts mean that agriculture is one of the only major sectors of the economy with a trade surplus, which we expect to be worth $30.5 billion this year.  Overall, we agricultural exports should be worth $107.5 billion in fiscal year – up from $96 billion in – and we expect them to rise again in .  More importantly, this progress should create good jobs for Americans: USDA studies show that every billion dollars in agricultural exports supports over 8,000 jobs and generates an additional $1.4 billion in economic activity.  \nAnd I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that the underlying values of rural America has played in this strong and rapid recovery. The dedication of our farmers and ranchers is second to none. They have worked hard keep their debt low and to capitalize on a broader economic recovery.  And their willingness to adapt, innovate and embrace new research has ensured their success for decades and was main reason they have been so resilient in the current economy.  \nAs the American economy continues to climb out of the recession, with help from the Obama administration and USDA, American Agriculture is helping to lead the charge. American farmers and ranchers have stayed resilient, and will continue to support a foundation of economic prosperity for the rest of the nation.\n Category/Topic:\n USDA Results\n Rural\n Tags:\n Economic Growth\n Economy\n Farm Income Forecast\n Job Growth\n Outlook for U.S. Agricultural Trade\n Rural America\n Tom Vilsack",

While the centerpiece for these feasts is as diverse as our nation, beef is a popular choice, particularly the standing rib roast, a traditional favorite. Last holiday season, the standing rib roast accounted for one fourth of all beef roasts marketed in retail outlets.\nThe standing rib roast, cut from the rib portion and usually including six ribs, gets its name as it “stands” in the oven on its bones. It gets its nickname, prime rib roast, from its “prime” location on the beef rib, not to be confused with the USDA Prime quality grade.\nDeveloped in the s, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service’s (AMS) U.S. grades are based on nationally uniform standards of quality developed by AMS. These standards promote uniformity and assurance of product quality on a continuous basis regardless of supplier. The official USDA grade shield indicates the product's quality level and are regarded as symbols of high-quality American beef. USDA’s voluntary quality grades (Prime, Choice, Select) are widely used as a “language” within the beef industry and consumers, making business transactions easier and providing a vital link to support rural America. USDA grading services support the domestic and international marketing of a variety of American agricultural products in addition to beef—such as turkey, lamb, veal, chicken, and shell eggs.\nToday, AMS employs 150 highly-skilled beef graders who, sometimes with the help of electronic monitoring, evaluate several factors that determine the grade, including the amount and distribution of marbling, which is the fine threads of fat dispersed within the lean. Marbling is what gives beef its flavor, juiciness, and tenderness. USDA Prime beef has the highest marbling score or fat content, followed by USDA Choice. USDA Select has only a slight amount of marbling.\nUSDA Choice is the most common grade, followed by USDA Select, and USDA Prime. During December , 69 percent of graded beef was eligible for the USDA Choice grade, 18 percent for USDA Select, and 7 percent for USDA Prime. The USDA quality grade is your assurance that the beef you serve your holiday guests will provide a memorable eating experience.\nAs you sit down to enjoy your holiday beef roast this year, remember to think of the many ranchers, graders, and marketers whose hard work went into to making your holiday celebration a success!\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Health and Safety\n Tags:\n Agricultural Marketing Service\n AMS\n grading\n USDA Prime\n USDA Choice\n USDA Select\n Holiday\n Holidays",

As the associate administrator for USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service, I am here in Ilsan, northwest of Seoul, for several reasons. Among the most important is to meet face-to-face with exhibitors and business representatives who are here to sell American agricultural and food products, as well as Korean importers, food processors, and industry leaders converging at this event, the biggest trade-only food show in South Korea. Up to 1,800 exhibitors are here in this huge, 49,000-square-foot exhibition space. More than 35,000 visitors are expected.\nMay 12, was the first day of this year’s show and I was privileged to represent the United States in the opening ceremonies.  I joined Minister Chang, the Korean Minister for Food, Agriculture, Forestry & Fisheries (MIFAFF), as a dozen or so dignitaries cut the ribbons signifying the official opening of this year’s show. As Minister Chang prepared to depart the show, he and I had a moment to chat informally.  I was impressed by his warmth and sincerity as we both re-affirmed the interests of MIFAFF and USDA in working together cooperatively on areas of mutual interest and concern.\nI then turned my attention to the USA Pavilion, which featured 36 exhibitors, representing a truly diverse range of U.S. food and beverage products including American meat products, fruits, cheese and a variety of other products. Last year, 30 U.S. exhibitors left the show with expected sales of $8.9 million in sales over the ensuing 12 months. This year, they hope to sell even more U.S. food and beverage products.  Even if the contacts made here don’t lead immediately to sales contracts, several exhibitors told me that it is nevertheless important for them to be here, to be visible with the trade and showcase their products.  Building a market presence is sometimes a long process, and participation in these types of trade shows introduces foreign buyers and consumers more quickly and effectively to the attributes and advantages of American products.  The exhibits not only showcase the U.S. products, but also demonstrate ways to use and serve the products, whether American style or adapted to Korean style.  Even the non-edible give-aways, such as the carrying bags with egg-head caricatures on them given out by the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, are a visual reminder of the likeability of American agricultural products.\nKorea is already a very important trade partner for the United States. It is the third largest economy in Asia and the world’s 15th largest economy. This country is an economic powerhouse. My presence here emphasizes how strongly the United States values its long, strategic partnership with Korea, which began 60 years ago. As I meet with Korean officials, buyers, and traders, I have the opportunity to reinforce that partnership.\nLooking back on the response of visitors to the food and beverages displayed at the USA Pavilion, I am optimistic that the demand for U.S. agricultural products is strong and our reputation as a reliable supplier of safe, wholesome food and agricultural products is excellent. Our FAS staff here in Korea in partnership with U.S. cooperators, NASDA, the state and regional trade groups SUSTA and Food Export-Midwest, as well as innovative and forward-looking businesses, have done an outstanding job of showcasing American food agricultural products here. \nFAS Associate Administrator Janet Nuzum shakes hands with Korea’s Minister for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Chang Tae-Pyong.\n Category/Topic:\n USDA Results\n Food and Nutrition\n Trade\n Tags:\n FAS\n Fisheries Chang Tae-Pyong.\n Food\n Janet Nuzum\n Korea\n MIFAFF\n Seoul\n Trade",

The majority of lowbush blueberries are processed into items like jams, jellies and baked goods.\nMy agency, the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), does its part to help more people eat these little blue dynamos.® Through our Commodity Procurement Program, we purchase frozen cultivated and wild blueberries. The purchases send this highly nutritious food to school children, families, and communities through federal food distribution programs like the National School Lunch Program.\nIn , we bought nearly $17.9 million or 11.3 million pounds of frozen wild blueberries. This provided a reliable outlet for producers in places like Maine where 98% of the nation’s wild blueberries are harvested. As a result of this purchase, states like Maine can continue to strengthen their rural economies.\nOur purchases are also making a big difference in states like New Jersey -- the birthplace of the cultivated blueberry. The state’s blueberry industry produced more than 51 million pounds that  yielded nearly $81 million in revenue in . This was by far the largest revenue generator in the Garden State’s fruit and vegetable sector that year. In , AMS helped continue this trend by buying $18.4 million or 15.4 million pounds of frozen cultivated blueberries from growers across the country.\nIn addition to our purchases, AMS supports the blueberry industry by offering grants to help it remain competitive in the marketplace. Classified as specialty crops, blueberries are eligible for grants through our Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. This program offers funds to states to support research and marketing projects that do things such as increasing crop yields. So, thanks to Specialty Crop Block Grant funds, several state agriculture departments can conduct research to mitigate the damage to its blueberry crops created by the Brown Marmorated Stinkbug and other invasive pests.\nWhether it’s July or any other part of the year, AMS is committed to supporting our nation’s blueberry producers and processors. We recommend that you add some color to your plate with some blueberries. The U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council’s website has some great recipes to get you started.\nIn , AMS purchased nearly 11.3 million pounds of frozen wild blueberries and 15.4 million pounds of frozen cultivated blueberries from growers across the country. The purchases sent this highly nutritious food to school children, families, and communities through federal food distribution programs.

(Photo courtesy National Weather Service, Chicago, Ill., Weather Forecast Office)\nOver the past few decades, water quality in the Jelkes Creek–Fox River watershed in northern Illinois has diminished greatly.\nThat’s why USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service collaborated with the Kane-DuPage Soil & Water Conservation District and Illinois Environmental Protection Agency in on a watershed planning process with residents, environmental groups and other stakeholders.\nOne of the results of the thorough process was a watershed action plan, which was funded by NRCS partner, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. A watershed action plan is not a legally binding document, but rather a tool to help community leaders make informed decisions about water quality in a certain area.\nOne change that can negatively affect water quality in a watershed is the conversion of land from wilderness or agricultural uses to urban areas.\nThat’s because land covered with asphalt or concrete pavements can cause excessive surface water runoff from rain or snowmelt, which can contain contaminants like sediment, petroleum products from roads, and fertilizer and pesticides from yards. The water flows over the land, picking up any contaminants found there, and eventually drains into the lowest water body in the watershed—in this case Fox River and its largest tributary, Jelkes Creek.\nThe impermeable pavement typically used to create sidewalks and roads also reduces the amount of water that can be absorbed into the soil.\nThe Jelkes Creek–Fox River watershed action plan, which the conservation district developed with technical advice from NRCS, set goals for addressing water quality in the watershed—primarily reducing stormwater runoff, water pollution and soil erosion.\nWhen the conservation district obtains funds to implement the watershed action plan, NRCS will help install the conservation practices needed to protect water quality. First, though, NRCS experts will analyze where the worst of the erosion is coming from and estimate sediment delivery so that the most problematic areas in the watershed are tackled first.\nThen stormwater runoff will be reduced through the addition of rain gardens, engineered wetlands and biowales (landscaping that removes silt and pollutants). Soil erosion will be addressed with the building of stone structures that will slow the speed of water running down hills, helping to prevent soil from washing into the river.\nThe plan will be put into action not just by the conservation district and NRCS, but also the people who live in the watershed, says David Powleit, Jelkes Creek–Fox River Watershed Coalition member.\n“The development of the watershed plan offers an opportunity for citizens to get involved with the water resources out their own backdoors,” he says.\nThe Kane-DuPage Soil & Water Conservation District suggests voluntary methods for residents to enhance water quality. For example, they can sweep up yard debris, plant native plants and reduce the use of fertilizer and pesticides.\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\nCheck out other conservation-related stories on the USDA blog.\nGully erosion in the Jelkes Creek-Fox River Watershed.

For many followers of the Islamic faith, the month of Ramadan – known as a time of fasting and sacrifice – is also a time of reflection.  As we deal with hunger and thirst from sunrise to sunset, we are reminded of those who deal with hunger – and poverty – every day. As we reflect on our spiritual responsibilities, we must also recall our obligation to help others in times of need.  For Muslim employees of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), this holds especially true.\nUSDA touches the lives of every American.  Our nutrition and food safety programs ensure that all America’s children have access to safe, nutritious, balanced meals, while our rural development programs promote prosperous, self-sustaining communities.  Our conservation programs protect our national forests and private working lands, while our agricultural support programs promote American agriculture and biotechnology while increasing food security around the world.\nThis year, USDA expanded the StrikeForce Initiative for Rural Growth and Opportunity (www.usda.gov/strikeforce), to increase partnerships with local/state governments and communities to promote economic development and job creation in rural communities with persistent poverty.  Through StrikeForce, USDA is working to ensure that all communities can fully access USDA programs.\nThat is why it was such a privilege to work with one of our partners, Islamic Relief USA (IRUSA), to host our fifth annual Iftar dinner (blogs.usda.gov/tag/iftar/). Almost 200 Muslim and non-Muslim employees from USDA and across the federal government came together with community members and representatives of faith-based organizations to break the day’s fast and discuss our shared goal – rebuilding and strengthening communities in need.\nUndersecretary Michael Scuse (then acting deputy secretary) kicked-off the event, talking about USDA’s support for rural communities, especially during times of disaster.  He was followed by Dr. Joe Leonard, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, who reminded us that while we’ve made great progress in providing equal access to USDA’s programs, there’s still more work to do.  Ali Zaidi, White House Policy Advisor spoke of the importance of USDA programs that support those in need – particularly those that provide America’s next generation with access to safe, healthy food.\nDr. Abed Ayoub, president of IRUSA, showed a video about the work of his organization, and discussed efforts to provide communities around the world with access to food and water.  He also discussed IRUSA’s partnership with USDA to provide meals to low-income children here at home, during the summer months when school is out, and recognized SMILE, a New Jersey-based Islamic service organization, instrumental in helping people during the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.\nFollowing tradition, the fast was broken with dates from American farmers in California.  A delicious Middle Eastern dinner was provided by IRUSA.  USDA’s Iftar is the largest among federal agencies.\nPhotos from the event can be viewed on USDA’s Flickr Page: \n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n California\n Center for Faith Based and Neighborhood Partnerships\n Farmers\n Hunger\n Hunger Action Month\n Hurricane Sandy\n Iftar\n Joe Leonard\n Michael Scuse\n Muslim\n New Jersey\n Nutrition\n Poverty\n rural communities\n StrikeForce\n White House",

But I am here to tell you that school lunch is amazing and looks a lot different than what you may remember if you’re a kid of the 90s, like me.\nLast week, I volunteered at my son’s school. As lunchtime approached, the students were lined up in two lines: packed lunch and school lunch. The teacher announced, “Today, the cafeteria is serving popcorn chicken!” Immediately, several kids jumped from the packed lunch line to the school lunch line. That’s when I knew I was in for a treat!\nAs we were walking towards the cafeteria, my son’s teacher told me to try the zesty meatloaf. I was already excited for popcorn chicken, but I decided to take her advice.\nThis is not what school lunch looked like when I was kid. The meatloaf did not disappoint and neither did the mashed potatoes and broccolini. I can say with certainty that the school lunch my son receives is far more nutritious than anything I would pack for him.\nThere was also a fantastic salad bar featuring locally grown produce. Kids were piling their plates with fruits and veggies…especially cucumbers. Did you know that FNS awards grants to support schools in purchasing equipment like salad bars, to allow them to serve nutritious meals to students? You can learn more about these equipment grants.\nI happened to be visiting during Virginia’s Farm to School Week.

A lot of local food!  \n This week, USDA announced early results from USDA’s second Farm to School Census indicating that school districts across the country invested more than half a billion dollars in local foods in the - school year. That represents an increase of $212 million (or 55 percent) over final results from the last census, conducted two years ago.\nPreliminary numbers also show that thanks to the hard work and dedication of school food service directors, teachers, farmers, fishermen and ranchers, more than 42,000 schools are involved in farm to school activities. Whether through buying local foods, building school gardens, or taking a field trip to a local farm, these programs improve child nutrition and provide dynamic educational experiences for students, all the while providing new market opportunities for local and regional farmers. \nIndeed the benefits derived from adopting farm to school strategies are significant. The Farm to School Census found that school districts participating in farm to school activities enjoyed at least one of the following advantages: \nGreater support from parents and the community\nGreater acceptance of the new meal pattern\nLower school meal program costs\nReduced food waste\nIncreased participation in school meals \nWhile these early results are impressive, we know that they do not represent all of the remarkable work happening across the nation. That is why, from now until November 20, , we encourage all food service directors to visit the Census site and follow the three easy steps outlined there to make sure your district is counted, and counted correctly! \nA Colorado elementary school student shows off fresh lettuce grown by students in his school’s garden. \nWe look forward to sharing a more complete picture of farm to school with you in early , when we have tallied the final numbers.

Photo courtesy of the Napa County Agricultural Commissioner's Office.\nLast fall, the results of trapping for the European Grapevine Moth (Lobesia botrana or EGVM) in California were recounted during a conference call for the partners working to eradicate this invasive insect: zero, zero, zero, one moth.\nWe’ve gone from more than 100,000 EGVM trapped in to just one in . This success makes the EGVM detection and eradication partnership one of the most effective programs for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), county departments of agriculture, University of California Cooperative Extension (UC Coop), and growers in the last decade.\nWe’ve come a long way, but our work isn’t finished yet. One of APHIS’ top goals is the complete eradication of EGVM from California in the next two to three years.\nEGVM was first detected in Napa County, California in . Subsequent surveys detected EGVM in ate. The detection of this pest put fruit crops worth more than $5.7 billion at risk and threatened to close valuable export markets for U.S. grapes and stonefruit around the world. In , 90 percent of U.S. grape production came from California, so the finding of EGVM was especially concerning to grape growers, as well as the wine industry.\nCounty of Napa inspectors looking for EGVM early in , before we knew how big the infestation was. The damage in the Wicker vineyard and several others indicated the level of damage we could anticipate if we did not take action against this pest. Photo courtesy of the Napa County Agricultural Commissioner's Office.\nNapa Valley grape producer Ron Wicker recalled the impact the EGVM had on his crops. “In one week, our crop went from isolated clusters of rotting grapes to spreading through the entire vineyard. We lost 11 acres of chardonnay - all 60 tons of fruit.”\nGreg Clark, Napa County Agricultural Commissioner said “in Napa County, wine grape production accounts for 99% of annual crop production, or over $656 million in . This translates into approximately $14 billion in economic activity for the county. Napa is world renowned and we have to be good stewards of the crop, wine, and image.”\nFaced with this enormous threat, we and our partners in California moved quickly. We designed an eradication program that would produce results by closely involving growers and the community. The plan called for growers to carry out pest treatments, while state and county partners set traps and lures for detection purposes and reported findings. We also relied on the excellent support of the EGVM Technical Working Group, which met regularly to provide APHIS and its partners with the best science and to combat EGVM.\nPeeled piece of bark with lots of EGVM pupa. Photo courtesy of the Napa County Agricultural Commissioner's Office.\n“Another key reason for success was the grower liaison role that was created early in the program,” said Nick Condos, Chief of the EGVM Quarantine Program for CDFA’s Plant Health Programs. “The grower liaisons were critical to conveying information to growers and ensuring they understood the voluntary treatments planned.”\n“Growers worked closely with the liaisons and cooperated fully with both the quarantine and treatment plans,” Condos continued. “The reason WHY is because the pest was doing significant damage immediately. We were dealing with a potential game changer for how industry exports and operates.”\nThe quick response, sound scientific strategy, hard work by growers and industry, and the support of the community has produced fantastic results. We have eliminated EGVM from nine of 11 counties, and more than 80 percent of the acres that were quarantined have been declared free of the moth.\nNow, with one moth detected in , success is even closer. Some day soon, we’ll get the news that we’ve accomplished our goal: no more EGVM in California.\nAt a field day organized by the University of California Cooperative Extension (UC Coop) and the County of Napa, UC Coop staff show pest control advisors how to look for EGVM pupa hidden underneath the bark at a Wicker Vineyard Management vineyard.

Bats are often situated among this imagery, whether as silhouettes in the background or as blood-sucking monsters.\nBut bats are none of these things. They are primarily nocturnal, they make their homes in dark places, but there’s nothing scary about them.\nThat is why Bat Week, October 24-31, is a time to celebrate bats, what they contribute to our society, and to dispel the myths that cause so much misunderstanding of these gentle, intelligent creatures.\nThere are more than 1,300 species of bats worldwide, and they are diverse. Some, like Kitti’s hog-nosed bat, also known as the bumble bee bat, can be as small as your thumbnail and survives on insects. Others like the flying fox eat fruit and have earned their name due to their impressive size.\nBats like this Mexican free-tailed bat feed on insects and play an important role in pest control on agricultural crops. Photo by MerlinTuttle.org.\nThere are three species of vampire bat among those 1,300. However, they live in Mexico, Central and South America; feed primarily on large livestock; and take about an ounce of blood in a feeding. Forty-seven species of bat call the United States home.\nBats provide valuable services to us. Most feed on insects and play an important role in pest control on agricultural crops. The various species of beetles, moths, and other insects that often plague crops represent a tasty meal to a hungry bat. In fact, it is estimated that if bats were lost in North America, savings of up to $3.7 billion dollars annually would be lost due to increased pesticide requirements in agriculture. In one case, a Georgia pecan farmer was able to abandon pesticide use altogether after he built bat houses housing several thousand Mexican free-tailed bats.\nThe Forest Service is looking into the role that bats play in pest insect control on the forest as well. Many insects, like bark beetles and gypsy moths, can be devastating to forests, and as voracious insect eaters, bats have the potential to help cull their numbers.\nRecognizing the role they play, the Forest Service has long been a champion of bat conservation. Over the last decade, the fungal disease white-nose syndrome has killed more than six million bats. While Forest Service researchers seek a solution to white-nose syndrome, the agency’s land managers explore improved ways to manage bat habitat.\nWithin the 193 million acres of forests and grasslands that the agency manages, there are more than 25,000 abandoned mines that present both opportunity and hazard. Recognizing the potential of abandoned mines as ideal roosting, hibernation, or maternity sites, the Forest Service has constructed “bat gates” that provide a grating to keep visitors from stumbling into a potential hazard while allowing bats to fly freely.\nYou too can make a big difference by planting bat-friendly gardens, building bat houses, and helping dispel myths about bats.\nLittle Brown bats found in Maine with white-nose syndrome.

Landowners benefit because they receive compensation for the carbon credits generated on their lands. They get a new source of revenue, while thriving grasslands provide nesting habitat for wildlife, are more resilient to extreme weather, and help mitigate the impact of climate change. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, recently purchased almost 40,000 carbon dioxide reduction tons generated on working ranch grasslands in the Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. It was the first purchase of its type. \nRobert Bonnie, USDA's under secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the purchase and USDA's involvement in the project at an event at USDA headquarters. He was joined by Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Greg Martin, executive director for global public policy, General Motors; Sean Penrith, executive director of The Climate Trust and Paul Schmidt, chief conservation officer of Ducks Unlimited. The under secretary thanked Senator Stabenow, Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, for her staunch support for the program, which she said is delivering “real world measurable results.” Bonnie said he hopes this purchase will set a pattern for future carbon credit sales.\n Patrick Holmes, USDA Office of Natural Resources and Environment\n Posted in\n Conservation\n Nov 20, \n Respond to this story",

But how do we measure this crop accurately enough to make dependable forecasts for cotton yield and production? That’s where our measurement process, known as the objective yield kicks in.\nAll of the objective yield measurements are done by a well-prepared team of National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) enumerators. For this growing season, we spent the week of July 12-14 training 43 enumerators with a combination of classroom and hands-on field practice. Since approximately 63 percent of the Texas crop, which represents 30 percent of the U.S. total cotton crop, comes from the High Plains of Texas, this group has the bulk of the samples in Texas.\nOnce we begin collecting , these agency representatives lay out approximately 525 plots in cotton fields. Each objective yield sample will consist of two units per field, which, when combined, cover about 83 square feet of land. While this may seem like a small area, when combined across all of the plots in the state, this scientific process is quite accurate. We expect each one of these samples to represent nearly 10,500 acres of cotton grown in Texas.\nOf course it takes more than one measurement to get an accurate yield and production estimate. Our enumerators return to the plots each month to collect updated . During their visits, the enumerators count plants and fruit in a 10-foot area and pick cotton samples once bolls open. The cotton samples are weighed and sent to our National Operations Division in St. Louis, Missouri for further analysis. We also count squares, blooms, and large and small bolls from a separate 3-foot count area.\nThe we collect from these plots, combined with the information growers provide in our monthly Agricultural Yield surveys, become the key source for Texas production forecasts throughout the growing season. The resulting cotton production inform decisions made by traders, agri-marketers, legislators, and of course the farmers themselves. Key decisions impacting the cotton sector are usually rooted in these numbers.\nThis year, we will publish the first monthly Crop Production report for cotton production on August 12. After that we will continue publishing updated information each month through December. Final Texas and national cotton estimates will be available in early May .

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nEven in a tropical paradise like Hawaii, Christmas just isn’t Christmas to some folks without an evergreen tree decked out with twinkling lights and sparkling ornaments. But some USDA scientists worry about that Yule tree being decked out with something else: invasive western yellowjackets.\nThese black-and-yellow-striped predators normally build their nests in the ground. But for close to a century, they’ve also been successful at sneaking into Hawaii aboard holiday trees harvested in the Pacific Northwest.\nFirst spotted in Hawaii in , the western yellowjacket (Vespula pensylvanica) remains a target for researchers and regulators who have observed the stinging invader competing with Hawaii’s birds for native insect prey.\nApplications of insecticide before the trees are harvested have proven 100 percent effective in killing the yellowjackets, and residues of insecticides applied 6 weeks earlier were still killing the pests at harvest.\nA process of literally shaking these trees, however, offers a pesticide-free alternative to ridding them of yellowjackets.  In the past, Hawaii’s agricultural regulators have that 10 percent of Christmas trees bound for the islands be shaken manually to detect hitchhiking pests if an inspector is present at harvest, or 100 percent of the trees be shaken mechanically if no inspector is present.  But there’s no precise rule about how long the tree should be shaken, and the duration could make a big difference in the number of pests dislodged.\nScientists with USDA’s Agricultural Research Service teamed with colleagues from Washington State University, the University of Hawaii and the Hawaii Department of Agriculture to evaluate the efficacy of shaking the trees.  Although their research demonstrated that current shaking techniques won’t dislodge all the yellowjackets, Hawaiian authorities have since stepped up protection efforts by requiring that all incoming Yule trees undergo shaking.  These scientists are working to make pesticide-free shaking treatments more effective to help ensure Hawaii’s holiday celebrants don’t find more than they wanted under their Christmas trees.\nWashington State University plant pathologist Gary Chastagner uses a mechanical tree shaker at a commercial shipping yard in western Oregon.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n ARS\n Hawaii\n Science Tuesday",

Though it sounds delicious, this colorful plant is invading and threatening Hawaii’s native forests and watersheds and has already overtaken hundreds of thousands of acres on the archipelago in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.\nIntroduced to Hawaii in , strawberry guava is a tree native to Brazil and has since advanced through Hawaii’s native forests. Removal is extremely difficult in remote forest areas. The species has also adversely affected Hawaii’s watersheds.  A University of Hawaii study shows that strawberry-guava-infested forests lose 27 percent more water than native forests.\nAdded to all this degradation, Forest Service scientists report that the millions of pounds of dropped fruit are a primary source of oriental fruit flies which invade Hawaii agriculture crops and cost the state millions of dollars annually in quarantine treatment and control efforts.\n“We hope people understand that release of this biological control insect will not kill all strawberry guava,” said Tracy Johnson, lead researcher for the U.S. Forest Service in Hilo. “There will still be a lot of strawberry guava around. Slowing its reproduction and invasiveness will help restore the balance in favor of the native forest plants like”ohia.”\nNative Hawaiian forest\nFor more than 15 years, U.S. Forest Service scientists have been testing for potential natural control insects for strawberry guava. Their results have determined that the Brazilian beetle known officially as T. ovatus, will slow the spread of strawberry guava providing natural control of the species and will not harm other native or beneficial plants or insects.\nT. ovatus lives most of its life inside the strawberry guava leaves, causing leaf galls or bumps, which reduces the vigor of the plant but does not kill it. The damage is similar to galls frequently found on `ohia which are caused by native insects.\nAn initial release is scheduled at one site on Hawaii Island where progress will be monitored by the U.S. Forest Service.

Working together as a team the six of us joined in a discussion with Under Secretary Kevin Concannon and Chef Sam Kass to discuss opportunities and challenges of the Chefs Move to Schools, a program of the Let's Move! initiative.\nThe true spirit of Chefs Move to Schools (CMTS) is to engage children in their classroom through food. The program has morphed into a fun and educational program benefitting both school children and school nutrition professionals. One practice that is becoming popular is to have the program benefit both these groups; first by getting kids excited by a chef demo then having the chef step into the school kitchen, not to comment about the food, rather to work hands on with the kitchen staff to help re-educate them on basic kitchen skills. This quick educational lesson is often welcomed by the staff who see it as an opportunity to network with a local chef. Engaging organizations is important to seeing through with the success of CMTS. The American Culinary Federation, School Nutrition Association and Share Our Strength are the top three organizations involved to see through with the success of CMTS.\nFeeding children healthy school meals is important for several reasons but most importantly 32 million children participate in the National School Lunch Program and two thirds, yes two thirds of them qualify for free and reduced meals.\nAt a time when one in four kids lacks access to nutritious foods every day, now is the time for everyone to step up to the plate, take baby steps and see to it that every meal that a child receives in school is a good one. Green and orange veggies, whole grains, minimally processed foods along with salad bars are a great start.\nThe HealthierUS School Challenge and Let's Move! Salad Bars to Schools coupled with Let's Move!

In addition to knowing where and when farmers markets are operating, the National Farmers Market Directory also lists what federal nutrition assistance nutrition programs (like SNAP, WIC, SFMNP) are accepted at which farmers markets.  This is a critical way to map how farmers markets are making fresh, healthy, local food more accessible to more Americans.\nThe bell has rung and farmers market season has now begun!

In concert with FNS’ 15 nutrition assistance programs, hundreds of organizations are working hard every day to create the safety net against hunger that protects Americans. Without fanfare and with little public notice, coalitions of non-profits, religious organizations and groups of volunteers are often the first line of defense against hunger.\nOne shining example of this excellent teamwork is in New Orleans where I recently met with Catholic Charities Archdiocese CEO Gordon Wadge and other representatives. They work hand in hand, using a combination of FNS programs, donations and community-building outreach techniques that aid people in many different ways across the city. For example, at Café Hope the food is prepared and served by disadvantaged, at-risk young people who might otherwise be on the street.\nI also talked with Tim Robertson the director of the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, Food for Families. Food for Families warehouses, pre-packs, and transports supplemental food boxes to more than 120 donation sites throughout Louisiana and where the program serves 60,000 people.\nI even visited a garden where former prison inmates, who are now members of AmeriCorps, work with the Sisters of the Holy Family. The Cornerstone Builders, as administered by Catholic Charities’ Office of Justice and Peace, eases formerly incarcerated individuals back into society by giving former inmates education, support and the opportunity to do community service.\nThese examples don’t even scratch the surface of all that Catholic Charities does to enrich the lives of so many in New Orleans. Through their local service and the service of organizations like them across the United States, we strengthen the food safety net and our commitment to helping those in need.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Café Hope\n Catholic Charities\n Commodity Supplemental Food Program\n FNS\n Kevin Concannon\n Louisiana\n New Orleans",

Everyone takes their jobs seriously and is committed to producing the best agricultural statistics available. We are honoring many this week with an award ceremony and certificates of recognition for truly outstanding contributions.\nAnd why do we need these agricultural statistics? On a practical level, there are examples such as a Pennsylvania township using information about dairy farms to determine which roads to plow first in a snow storm so that milk could get to market instead of potentially being dumped. And the beginning farmer who used to determine where to locate her organic farm based on the proximity of farm services, other organic farms, and other criteria that would create a favorable business environment her operation. Or the trucking company that wanted to determine the best location to expand based on where large volumes of certain grains and byproducts are produced.\nIn the big picture, we need them to understand local and global food supply, ensure smooth domestic and international trade, and to inform local and national food, land and farm policy. Many federal agencies and policy makers use the information for programs such as crop insurance, determining the use of and need for conservation programs, animal health and financial assistance.\nSince we collect the information personally, we often hear from producers just how important these are to them.

They emphasize the cooperation and understanding of the countries involved to promote shared knowledge, and resources, which can be crucial during an animal health event.\nThe three arrangements, signed by the United States, relate to the International Animal Health Emergency Reserve (also signed by Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom), the Sharing of Vaccines for Foot and Mouth Disease (Australia, Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand), and Supporting the Recognition of Zoning for Foreign Animal Disease Outbreaks (Australia, Canada, and New Zealand).\nThe International Animal Health Emergency Reserve agreement allows for countries to share emergency response teams and personnel as needed during animal disease outbreaks.  It also lets the countries involved to act rapidly and more effectively control and eradicate an outbreak.\nThe Sharing of Vaccines for Foot and Mouth Disease agreement allows for countries to more readily request and consider requests for FMD vaccine from their respective FMD vaccine banks. This particular arrangement provides an opportunity to share vaccine resources can be beneficial during an outbreak and leaves the door open to include other countries’ FMD banks if there is future interest.\nSupporting the Recognition of Zoning for Foreign Animal Disease Outbreaks agreement allows countries to understand and accept each other’s processes for managing outbreaks and paves the way for recognizing “zones” for trading purposes.  This arrangement would allow for trade to be resumed early from disease-free zones and support continuing trade from affected zones where biosecurity risks can be effectively managed through specific import conditions, such as product treatments.\nOur animal health experts have a shared vision to safeguard our nation’s agricultural resources and to support international trade and cooperation while preventing the introduction of dangerous and costly disease in our country.  These agreements will complement our existing preparedness activities and benefit not only US producers and consumers, but the global community.\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Trade\n USDA Results\n Tags:\n animal diseases\n Animals\n APHIS\n France\n International Trade\n Trade",

Today, consumers also look to food labels for information about how their food was grown and how healthy it is.  \nSome food labels, such as grades of beef, eggs and apples, are based on longtime Federal requirements that apply to all companies. In , Congress also directed USDA and FDA to set standards for organic and nutrition food labels. But private-sector companies can put other information on food labels, such as whether a product is “raised without antibiotics,” or made without genetically modified ingredients (“non-GMO”), without government verification.\nA new report by USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS), Beyond Nutrition and Organic Labels—30 Years of Experience With Intervening in Food Labels, evaluates the impact of Federal organic and nutrition labels and several other food labels that emerged in recent decades.\nNational standards for the Nutrition Facts label were intended to provide consumers with information to make healthy food choices. Since then, it has emerged that shoppers may be overwhelmed by the amount of information provided and in response, some companies have added simpler health claims on the front of food packages. \nBefore USDA developed standards for organic food, the word “organic” meant different things for different products, and in different U.S. States. National standards have helped level the playing field for producers and have widened consumer access to organic food. Since Federal organic standards were implemented in , U.S. retail sales of organic food have risen five-fold.\nWhile Federal label standards can be comprehensive, this doesn’t ensure that consumers understand them. The USDA Organic seal, for example, means that the farmer used practices that maintain or improve soil conditions, did not use GMOs, antibiotics, hormones, or synthetic pesticides -- and met many other requirements. However, many consumers confuse the USDA Organic seal with other less comprehensive food labels, especially labels that make a single claim such as “natural,” non-GMO,” and “raised without antibiotics.” \nWithout government involvement, the same label can be based on different standards — and private labels are often not verified. For example, early “raised without antibiotics” labels had different meanings, confusing consumers and creating conflict between companies. Though the labels now mean the same thing, firms don’t need their labels to be verified by USDA or other groups in order to use them.  \nPrivate-sector labels making single claims, such as “raised without antibiotics,” also provide opportunities for producers, and more choice for consumers. For example, producers can adopt a single practice at a lower cost than meeting all the requirements to use the USDA Organic seal, and in turn, offer a lower retail price for that product. Grocery store price premiums for USDA Organic chicken breasts, for example, were double the premiums for “raised without antibiotics” chicken breasts in . Smaller price premiums for single-trait products expand the market of potential customers while still giving companies an economic incentive to adjust their production processes.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Food Safety\n Food and Nutrition\n Economic Research Service\n food labels",

        "content": "Funding is First Part of $75 Million Investment to Support a Fairer Food System and Expand Access to Nutritious Food\n Release & Contact Info\n Press Release\n Release No. .22\n Contact: USDA Press\nEmail: press@usda.gov\n WASHINGTON, June 3, – The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announces significant investments to support urban agriculture, including $43.1 million for grants and cooperative agreements as well as six new urban county committees to help deliver key USDA programs to urban producers. These actions support USDA’s efforts to strengthen the food supply chain and transform the food system to be fairer, more competitive, and more resilient.\nSpecifically, USDA is investing $10.2 million in new cooperative agreements to expand compost and food waste reduction efforts and $14.2 million in new grants to support the development of urban agriculture and innovative production projects. Additionally, $18.7 million will fund 75 worthy grant proposals from the application cycle, which was oversubscribed.\n“Investing in urban agriculture innovations helps us build a fairer, more transparent food system and promote equity by increasing nutrition security and economic opportunity in underserved communities,” said Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Chief Terry Cosby. “These projects will help for urban farmers create new, more affordable, and better local market options and help urban communities produce fresh and healthy food locally, reducing food waste while building nutrient rich compost.”\n“Supporting agriculture in our urban communities helps grow our economy and provides food to people,” said U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow. “I’m proud that Michigan has been a pioneer in this effort. Urban farmers provide fresh and healthy food to children and families while creating jobs and revitalizing our neighborhoods.”\nThese investments build on USDA’s Food Systems Transformation Framework unveiled earlier this week. The goals of USDA’s Food System Transformation Framework include:\n Building a more resilient food supply chain that provides more and better market options for consumers and producers while reducing carbon pollution.\n Creating a fairer food system that combats market dominance and helps producers and consumers gain more power in the marketplace by creating new, more and better local market options.\n Making nutritious food more accessible and affordable for consumers.\n Emphasizing equity by creating wealth that stays in small towns and underserved communities.\nUSDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) is also standing up six more urban county committees, which help deliver farm loans, disaster assistance, safety net and conservation programs.\n“Urban county committees promote equity by giving urban producers a voice in creating and implementing policy and developing and designing programs specific to urban producers,” FSA Administrator Zach Ducheneaux said. “These new urban county committees will work to encourage and promote urban agriculture and address areas such as food and program access, community engagement and food security.”\nComposting and Food Waste Reduction Cooperative Agreements\nThis is the third year of USDA’s Composting and Food Waste Reduction (CFWR) cooperative agreements, and so far, USDA has invested $3 million in community composting in urban areas across the country. The $10.2 million to be awarded in will fund pilot projects that develop and implement strategies for municipal compost plans and food waste reduction plans.\nLocal governments may submit projects that do one or more of the following:\n generate compost;\n provide access to compost to farmers;\n reduce fertilizer use;\n improve soil quality;\n encourage waste management and permaculture business development;\n increase rainwater absorption; reduce municipal food waste; and/or\n divert food waste from landfills.\nFor example, Philadelphia is launching the first of a coordinated system of small-scale urban food waste composting sites on city properties. Meanwhile, Winterville, Georgia is building six composting stalls to collect and process food excess and refuse from producers and local community members. The compost is then provided to local producers and others.\nPriority will be given to projects that anticipate or demonstrate economic benefits, incorporate plans to make compost easily accessible to farmers, including community gardeners, integrate other food waste strategies, including food recovery efforts and collaborate with multiple partners. Projects should span two years.\nOffice of Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production (OUAIP) Grants\nThis is also the third year of OUAIP grants, which have already provided more than $7.5 million focused on food access, education, business and start-up costs for new farmers, and development of policies related to zoning and other needs. The $14.2 million to be awarded in will support the development of urban agriculture and innovative production projects through:\n Planning Projects that initiate or expand efforts of urban and suburban farmers, gardeners, citizens, government officials, schools and other stakeholders to target areas of food access, education, business and start-up costs for new farmers, urban forestry, and policies related to zoning and other needs of urban production.\n Implementation Projects that accelerate urban, indoor and other agricultural practices that serve multiple farmers and improve local food access. They may support infrastructure needs, emerging technologies, education and urban farming policy implementation.\nFor example, Growing Gardens in Oregon received planning project funding to identify opportunities to meet community needs for healthy, affordable, culturally appropriate food through building greenhouses. Meanwhile, Grow Ohio Valley in West Virginia received implementation funding to set up a training and demonstration farm to support new and aspiring urban farmers.\nHow to Apply for Grants and Cooperative Agreements\nSubmit applications via grants.gov for Composting and Food Waste Reduction Cooperative Agreements and UAIP Grants. Pre-recorded webinars on the purpose, project types, eligibility and basic requirements for submitting applications will be posted at usda.gov/urban. Email UrbanAgriculture@usda.gov with any questions.\n OUAIP Grant Projects\nAdditionally, $18.7 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds were awarded to 75 Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production grant applicants from . This grant program has been oversubscribed the last several years, ARPA funds made it possible to fund these worthy projects. A full listing of projects is posted on usda.gov/urban.\nUrban County Committees for Urban Agriculture\nThe new urban county committee (UCOC) locations are Chicago, Detroit, Grand Rapids, Los Angeles, New York City, and Oakland, and they join 11 previously announced urban county committees. The six locations for county committees were selected based on a consideration of that included opportunity for economic growth, diversity, proximity to tribal nations, as well as the number of farm-to-table projects, urban farms, community and residential gardens, and green infrastructure projects within metropolitan and suburban areas.\nLike rural county committee members, urban committee members make important decisions about how FSA programs are administered locally. Each urban and suburban county committee will be composed of three elected members who will serve a term of up to three years. Urban farmers who participate in USDA programs in the areas selected are encouraged to participate by nominating and voting for themselves or others.\nUSDA and Urban Agriculture\nGrants and cooperative agreements to support urban production are part of a broad USDA investment in urban agriculture. Other efforts include $260,000 for risk management education from USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA) and technical and financial assistance through conservation programs offered by USDA’s NRCS.\nOUAIP was established through the Farm Bill. It is led by NRCS and works in partnership with FSA and numerous USDA agencies that support urban agriculture. Its mission is to encourage and promote urban, indoor, and other emerging agricultural practices, including community composting and food waste reduction. Learn more by visiting farmers.gov/urban or downloading the new Urban Agriculture at a Glance brochure (, 1 ). Additional resources that may be of interest to urban agriculture entities include grants from USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture as well as FSA loans.\nThese significant investments by USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and Office of Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production (OUAIP) build on the Biden-Harris administration’s Food System Transformation framework for USDA to transform the food system to benefit consumers, producers and communities by providing more options, increasing access, and creating new, more, and better markets for small and mid-size producers.\nUSDA touches the lives of all Americans each day in so many positive ways. In the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA is transforming America’s food system with a greater focus on more resilient local and regional food production, fairer markets for all producers, ensuring access to safe, healthy and nutritious food in all communities, building new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate smart food and forestry practices, making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America, and committing to equity across the Department by removing systemic barriers and building a workforce more representative of America.

The demo was part of the first U.S. beef tasting event held in Belgium, which was hosted by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) office in The Hague, Netherlands, and the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF). The tasting was part of ongoing efforts to help expand U.S. beef exports to the European Union (EU). (Photo courtesy FAS The Hague) \nThe European Union (EU) is a relatively new market for U.S. beef exports. It wasn’t until August when the United States began exporting high-quality beef (marbled with a high fat content) to the EU under a negotiated tariff rate quota for non-hormone treated beef.\nToday, about 25 percent of U.S. beef exports to the EU are high-quality cuts such as tenderloin, strip loin and rib eye mostly used by upscale restaurants. The remaining beef exports include medium and lower quality cuts such as flank steak, chuck eye roll, briskets and shoulder clods. Finer restaurants in the EU traditionally do not integrate these cuts into their menus\nTo help introduce these secondary cuts and expand U.S. beef exports to the EU, the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) office in The Hague, Netherlands, partnered with the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) and a Belgium-based meat importer and distributor to host the first U.S. beef tasting event in Belgium Sept. 24. USMEF’s international marketing efforts on behalf of U.S. beef, pork, lamb and veal are funded by the FAS Market Access Program (MAP) and Foreign Market Development programs to support activities such as this event.\nDuring the U.S. beef tasting event, approximately 130 Belgian chefs learned about the preparation of these less familiar beef cuts. Local Dutch Chef Eric Troost presented various cooking demonstrations including slowly cooked top sirloin with barbecue sauce, tartar of shoulder clod with artichoke and shallots and top blade with beets, coriander and sesame vinaigrette.\nThe chefs were excited to learn cooking techniques for the secondary beef cuts, which are nearly 40 percent cheaper than primary beef cuts, said Mary Ellen Smith, agricultural attaché at the FAS office in The Hague.\n“Typically, secondary cuts from European beef cannot be used for finer dishes, so the Belgian chefs were intrigued by the various cooking methods that take advantage of the unique marbling in U.S. beef,” she said. “Events like these help introduce new U.S. products not only to the chefs that prepare them but to the thousands of European consumers that they serve.”\nThe U.S. beef tasting event is just one example of how FAS’s market development programs have a long history of helping farmers, ranchers, and businesses of all sizes build and maintain commercial markets for U.S. food and agricultural products around the world. It also helps support President Obama’s National Export Initiative, which aims to double U.S. exports by the end of .\nClick here to view a video recap of the U.S. beef tasting event in Belgium.\n Category/Topic:\n USDA Results\n Trade\n Tags:\n beef\n Belgium\n European Union\n Exports\n FAS\n MAP\n National Export Initiative\n Netherlands\n President Obama\n The Hague\n Trade",

Rogue Creamery, an artisan cheese company, is dedicated to sustainability and the art and tradition of making the world's finest handmade cheese.\nEarlier this week I traveled to Paris to attend the 24th edition of the Salon International d’Alimentation (SIAL). This 5-day event is one of the largest international food and beverage trade exhibitions in the world, attracting 5,500 exhibitors and over 147,000 trade-only visitors representing 188 countries. I was very impressed by the wide variety of U.S. products on display and by the number of participating countries.\nFor nearly 20 years, the United States has participated in SIAL Paris. This year’s USA Pavilion at SIAL was the largest to date, with some 140 exhibitors occupying over 2,700 square meters. SIAL offers U.S. food exporters the opportunity to test products and meet with European as well as other international traders and industry professionals. Clearly, this is a major factor for the large U.S. presence.\nOne of my primary reasons for attending the show was to meet face to face with U.S. Cooperators, exhibitors, and importers from Europe and other regions, as well as industry leaders. I had the pleasure of talking with many small- and medium-sized companies and Cooperator groups who expressed their appreciation of our programs and services, including American Food Service, Head Country Food Products, Rogue Creamery, U.S. Meat Export Federation, USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, and representatives from the state regional trade groups (SRTG), just to name a few. Tuesday night’s SRTG-hosted trade reception, as well as an industry reception, was yet another wonderful opportunity to talk with Pavilion exhibitors and trade visitors. Reception guests included buyer groups from North Africa and the Middle East recruited by our FAS Field offices.\nThe European Union (EU) is a major trading partner for the United States. The EU is America’s fifth largest market for agricultural and food products. France alone imports nearly $1 billion of U.S. farm goods annually. However, the scope of SIAL extended beyond the EU, reaching importers from all corners of the world. Building a market presence is sometimes a long process, and participation in these types of trade shows introduces foreign buyers and consumers more quickly and effectively to the attributes and advantages of American products.\nLooking back on the response of visitors to the wide variety of U.S. food and beverage products showcased in the Pavilion, I am optimistic that the demand for U.S. agricultural products is strong, and our reputation as a reliable supplier of safe, wholesome, and innovative products is excellent.

As part of their research experience, students in the program search the guts of beetle larvae to discover new cellulases, enzymes that break down cellulose, an organic compound that helps make plant cell walls rigid.\n“They (students) crack open logs and extract beetle larvae that they then dissect. They’re looking for the microbes in the larval digestive tract that make cellulases, enzymes that break down cellulose in tree cell walls,” Green said. “Though beetle larvae feed on wood, they don’t actually have the enzymes to digest it, so they rely on microbes.”\nUsed in the paper and pulp industry to break down wood fiber, cellulases are showing promise in the fermentation of woody biomass into biofuels, although this process is still in the experimental stage.\nWoody biomass is described as byproducts of forest management, such as limbs, tops, needles, leaves, and other woody parts of trees and woody plants.\n“If we find new cellulases that are even a little more efficient that would be a big deal,” Green said. “These enzymes could be key to making the process of turning wood into fuel efficient and economical.”\nMcKinney said the experience the students receive is invaluable.\n“Students get to experience what real scientists do on an everyday basis,” she said.\nStudent Rashad Warren doing the lab work to find “science gold” in the bellies of beetles. Photo credit: Ellen Green\nMcKinney’s microbiology class and Green’s entomology class worked on the project together. As a result, McKinney’s microbiology students picked up some entomology and Green’s entomology students picked up some microbiology skills.\n“We were very fortunate to get funding from the Forest Service’s Southern Research Station Partnership Enhancement Initiative grant,” Green said. “It allowed us to design a research experience that we could incorporate into the classroom and reach as many students as possible.”\nGreen and McKinney worked closely with Nathan Schiff, research entomologist with the agency’s Center for Bottomland Hardwoods Research. Schiff participated in classes and attended scientific meetings with project students.\n“They were quite enthusiastic and seemed to be getting an understanding of the scientific method,” said Schiff. “They seem more advanced than I was at this stage, and I expect that some of them will turn to a career in research.”\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n biofuels\n Energy\n Forestry\n FS\n Mississippi\n Science\n Southern Research Station",

FarmBeats will help them achieve that.\n“FarmBeats is a digital agriculture platform to integrate coming from different sources at the same location,” said Steven Mirsky, research ecologist at the Agricultural Research Service’s (ARS) Sustainable Agricultural Systems Laboratory in Beltsville, Md. “It provides management and helps build standards around Internet of Things (IoT) systems.”\nIoT is a network of physical objects that contain sensors, software, and other technologies that connect and share over the internet.\nAccording to Mirsky, FarmBeats facilitates management and analysis from sensing technologies deployed in farm fields. The system uses the Microsoft Azure cloud platform to gather, store, and configure . FarmBeats also improves sparse communications in rural environments through use of television white space (TVWS) technology. TVWS refers to unused VHF (very high frequency) and UHF (ultra high frequency) television channels and can transmit about 100 times the distance of Wi-Fi.\nThe system is still in its early stages of development. At ARS, researchers are using it to store “phenocam” images with metadata to monitor drought stress in corn, soybeans, and cotton. Phenocam is a digital camera that captures time-lapse images of foliage to record environmental effects on plant growth and health.\n“The future of agriculture involves extensive sensing technologies that provide actionable to farmers,” Mirsky said. “FarmBeats is a resource that does this.”\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Technology\n Tags:\n Agricultural Research Service\n ARS\n USDA Science\n technology\n Environment\n water\n You May Also Like\n USDA Nutrition Research Fuels Olympians’ Engines\n Meet Mari Gomez—Public Servant at USDA & Leader in Her Community\n Shining a Spotlight on USDA Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area Employees",

One way we are doing that is a new program that we recently piloted in Mississippi that provides free training through a partnership with the National Food Service Management Institute (NFSMI). The Team Up For School Nutrition Success Training (Team Up) is tailored to schools and covers topics like menu planning, financial management, procurement, meal presentation and appeal, as well as youth engagement tactics, and strategies to reduce plate waste.  \nAnother partner in this initiative is First Lady Michelle Obama. Mrs. Obama is grateful for the hard work being done in our country’s school cafeterias, but also recognizes that some may need a little help. When she heard about our initiative, she took the time to make a video to not only thank and encourage the dedicated school food service professional around the country, but to encourage them to take advantage of Team Up. Hear with the First Lady had to say about Team Up: \nThe name Team Up really says it all. This unique learning experience provides not only professional training and resources, but peer-to-peer mentoring. Schools have the opportunity to learn from each other, in order to make positive strides toward providing healthy school environments with financial stability and strong student participation. It isn’t a one-off experience. The peer-to-peer mentoring will continue after trainees return to their districts, and NFSMI will conduct 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups to gauge the success of the plans the schools developed after the training.  If additional training is needed, NFSMI will recommend options based on the schools progress.  The state agencies and USDA Food and Nutrition Services will also provide support and feedback. \nI couldn’t be more pleased with what I have heard about the how the first training class went, which was attended by 53 participants and 27 mentors. Participants told us that it was helpful to have a chance to discuss their individual challenges, as well as those that participants had in common. They said that hearing their colleagues and mentors talk about how they have handled some of these challenges in their schools was especially helpful.  Some participants even said that it was the best training they had ever attended!  The Kentucky Department of Education staff was so inspired that they created a video to say what a great experience they had.\nWe look forward to continuing our relationship with the White House and all the trainees. Together we can ensure that America’s students are getting and eating the healthiest food possible during the school day.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Child Nutrition\n Food and Nutrition\n HHFKA\n NSLP\n Nutrition\n Partnerships\n SBP\n School Lunch\n schools\n training",

Volunteers will be working in rural Panama and meeting with local communities to raise awareness about as well as report suspected cases of New World screwworm, one of the most costly and economically significant pests of livestock in South America.\nThe New World screwworm is a parasite of warm-blooded animals, including humans. Female screwworms are attracted to and lay their eggs in exposed flesh wounds.  After eggs hatch, larvae burrow and feed on flesh, causing severe tissue damage and may even be lethal to the host. The screwworm was eradicated from the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Curacao and, finally, all of Central America in using the Sterile Insect Technique in which sterile male flies are released in massive numbers to mate with wild female populations. The mated female flies then lay non-viable eggs, leading to a decrease and subsequent eradication of screwworm populations. To prevent the screwworm from spreading north of South America, The Commission is maintaining a barrier at the Darien Gap between Panama and Colombia, by utilizing both preventive release of sterile flies and field surveillance.\nEffective surveillance is crucial to maintaining the screwworm barrier. Beyond Peace Corps Volunteers, U.S. Panama Commission for Eradication of Screwworm relies on field staff and an estimated 552 honorary volunteer inspectors, composed of farmers and private veterinarians to stay on the lookout for suspected cases of screwworm.  There is a constant threat of screwworm reintroduction beyond the Darien Gap from Columbia, where the pest is still present and the migration of people, domesticated animals, and cattle pose a risk. Because most of the Darien Gap and rural areas in Eastern Panama are not easily accessible, APHIS enlisted Peace Corps volunteers, who are already trained and skilled at working with rural communities, to assist with the screwworm surveillance program and reach out to local communities and their officials to explain the risk this pest poses to both people and livestock.\n“Not only are we creating opportunities for Peace Corps Volunteers who have an interest in agricultural work, it’s an opportunity for APHIS to enhance our screwworm surveillance,” said Deputy Administrator of International Services, Beverly Simmons, who oversees all international action programs, including screwworm.\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Tags:\n action programs\n APHIS\n eradication\n Panama\n Peace Corps\n screwworm",

Photo by Christopher Leonard. \nWith Independence Day just around the corner, families across the nation are making preparations to honor the day as the grill chef, king of Castle Suburbia, lord of the living room, master of the flames, marches forth.\nWith a meaty feast to honor the day, the Fourth of July has become almost as much a celebration of grilling greatness as it is a celebration of the nation’s independence. However, all that glitters isn’t gold and an infection of Salmonellosis can quickly knock the grill king off his throne and onto another.\nFittingly, the Fourth of July sits in the middle of grilling season. The amber flames roaring up between the grill grates can easily give the false impression of bringing death to all bacteria. However, don’t be misled. Preparing burgers on the grill is a quest that must be tackled safely. Taking the four oaths of food safety (clean, separate, cook and chill) will ensure a feast free from visits to the porcelain throne, or worse, a trip to the emergency room.\nThe battle against foodborne illness begins on the way home from the store. Separating raw meat products from ready-to-eat products on the journey home is an essential step in preventing cross-contamination. Cooking hamburgers to 160 degrees will safely kill Salmonella and dangerous E. coli bacteria, but it does no good if you contaminated a salad with raw meat juice. And the specter of Salmonella isn’t constrained to poultry. No, the risk from this bug reaches to beef, pork and other meats as well as poultry.\nEver hear the phrase “clean as you cook?” It’s sage advice considering cross contamination can ruin nearly any dish. Cutting boards, cabinet handles, countertops, basically anything you may touch with your dirty, meaty hands can potentially transmit pathogens.\nA recent FSIS-sponsored study asked 80 consumers to prepare a meal including a fruit salad and meat dish. The meat provided was inoculated with L. casei, a bacterium found in yogurt, to test average food safety preparation. Half of the group heard food safety messages and half did not. Despite this, 90 percent of the fruit salads were contaminated with the target bacteria. Kitchen towels were a major source of contamination, but the sink, refrigerator, oven and trash cabinet handles were also contaminated, just waiting to infect something else. Check back soon for more information on this study’s findings.\nIf the grill king’s subjects use proper techniques (see FoodSafety.gov for tips), there is still the matter of cooking the meat. Despite the common advice of cooking to color or checking juices, the ONLY way of ensuring doneness is with a food thermometer. Nothing else, short of dragon fire will do.\nFinally, keep cool by keeping food cool. Don’t leave food out in the hot summer air without a way to chill it. Again, fightback.org is a good source for tips on what foods can stay out and for how long.\nStick to these four oaths of food safety and the grill king and his guests will enjoy the feast to honor the day. Make it a safe one.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n Tags:\n Food Safety\n foodborne illness\n Fourth of July\n FSIS\n Independence Day\n Salmonella",

Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service\nMeandering along a rustic trail surrounded by towering prairie grasses and blooming flowers, you feel a sense of simplicity as you come to a quiet overlook that slopes onto a bench where you can observe the activity of birds and small mammals surrounding a still pond. This beautiful prairie landscape leaves the viewer with an appreciation for nature’s wide open spaces.\nAnd, amazingly, you’re in the middle of one of America’s most populated regions because this could only be the Midewin (mi-Day-win) National Tallgrass Prairie, the largest piece of contiguous open space in the Chicago metropolitan area, located just an hour’s drive from the heart of the Windy City.\nUnique open space and wildlife viewing is not the only thing offered by the Midewin.\nThere are bison roaming this land and on May 7, the U.S. Forest Service will host the Midewin Bison Expedition. The free event allows visitors to get a unique close up view of bison in the event pasture.\nMidewin exists today because of a major grassroots efforts by volunteers, partner agencies, businesses and organizations that all worked with the U.S. Forest Service to restore 19,000 acres of farm and industrial land to a mosaic of tallgrass prairie habitat. Restoration efforts included bridge replacement, streambank stabilization, creation of trails and picnic areas; and removal and disposal of old utility poles, railroad ties and other debris, planting native species, and much more.\nThe first 5,000 acres were opened to the public in , and today a total of 7,200 acres and 22 miles of trails are open. The grassland habitat supports the state’s largest population of upland sandpiper and provides refuge for other grassland birds such as the Bobolink and Logger head shrike. A plethora of recreational opportunities await visitors including bicycling, hiking, horseback riding, hunting, outdoor learning, picnicking and now bison viewing.\nSince establishment of the Midewin, locals and staff have shared a vision of bringing bison back to the Prairie. Thanks to the dedication, work and support of the National Forest Foundation, partners and volunteers this vision was realized in November when four bulls and 23 cows were introduced to their new home.\nThe hope is that the re-introduction will have a positive impact on prairie health. Prairie staff will explore how bison grazing patterns support the tallgrass ecosystem and benefit grassland bird habitat. Ultimately, the experiment will determine if bison can be used as a restoration tool across the more than 1,200 acres they call home.\nInspired to make a trip to Illinois? If you can’t make the bison event on May 7, check out other fun and educational programs throughout the year. And, make sure the first stop on your visit is the Midewin’s Welcome Center, where you can find out the best areas for bison viewing and other information to make your prairie adventure a memorable one.\nThe Midewin’s beautiful and unique open spaces await you.\nView of Midewin’s Prairie Creek from West Patrol Road.

This recently happened when a breeding pair of whooping cranes took a break from their northern migration to enjoy the newly restored wetland.\nWhooping cranes are considered one of the most endangered wetland-dependant species in North America. These magnificent creatures, found only in North America, are the tallest birds on the continent, and are beloved for their distinctive call and intricate mating dance. In , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that the total population of whooping cranes in the U.S. was fewer than 400. Whooping cranes generally mate for life, and may return to the same watering holes again and again over the years.\nThe creation of the 330-acre floodplain, in the historical Purgatory Swamp between the Wabash and Embarras Rivers, was an almost immediate boon for migrating and regional wildlife. As soon as the restoration work was completed, water pooled into a wet area that attracted the pair of whooping cranes, who stopped by this week. The cranes had previously been banded as No.4 Female and No. 16 Male, according to a source with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and are probably on their way back to their nesting site in Wisconsin or Canada.\nThis floodplain project was one of 11 Illinois Emergency Watershed Protection – Floodplain Easement Program projects funded by the Obama Administration’s American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of (Recovery Act). In the past century, over half of the floodplains in Illinois have been altered by levees, lock and dams, and stream channelization. Water that enters these lands not only takes longer to drain, but also causes millions of dollars in crop damage.\nTo help reduce damage to flood-prone lands, and the associated costs for farmers and local governments, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service offers landowners a chance to take flood-prone areas out of production through conservation easements, beginning the process of restoring these lands to their original function as floodplains.\nThough restoring a floodplain is not a quick process, some benefits are visible almost immediately—like the appearance of the pair of endangered birds! And some of the benefits of wetlands, like downstream flood prevention and water quality protection, are less visible, but just as important.\nLearn more about NRCS ARRA Programs.\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\nCheck out other conservation stories on the USDA blog.\n Category/Topic:\n Initiatives\n Conservation\n Tags:\n ARRA\n Conservation\n Illinois\n Lawrence County\n NRCS\n U.S. Fish and Wildlife",

Follow along on the USDA blog.\nEarlier today, I met with leaders from the 566 federally-recognized Native nations who participated in the White House Tribal Nations Conference. This was the seventh of such conferences hosted by the Obama Administration, and built upon the President’s commitment to strengthen the government-to-government relationship with Indian Country and to improve the lives of American Indians and Alaska Natives, with an emphasis on increasing opportunity for Native youth.\nAll told, over the course of the Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture alone has invested nearly $3 billion in rural development projects that have helped Tribal members achieve the dream of homeownership; improved community facilities in Tribal communities; made critical upgrades to electric, water and telecommunications infrastructure that serve Tribal communities and members; and invested in the Tribal businesses and entrepreneurs who drive economic growth in Indian Country.\n Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack\n Posted in\n USDA Results\n Initiatives\n Rural\n Technology\n Nov 05, \n Respond to this story",

However, I recently had the chance to see both worlds collide during a National Peanut Board meeting in the big apple. In addition to the normal items of business, the board also planned some unique peanut-inspired events for New Yorkers.\nThe National Peanut Board is one of the more than 20 industry Research and Promotion Programs that my agency – the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) oversees. These self-help programs that are requested for and completely funded by the industry are charged with developing cutting edge marketing campaigns and supporting nutrition research that benefits all of the industry’s members. The Peanut Board recently invaded the streets of New York to connect the city to the more than 7,000 peanut farming families the board represents.

        "content": "National Partnership Office, U.S. Forest Service in\n Forestry\n Jan 28, \nKristin Merony and Tammy Randall-Parker, a Forest Service district ranger and a ski instructor at Telluride Mountain Resort, after Kristin’s first solo run down the mountain after a day of ski lessons. (U.S. Forest Service)\nA new year means new resolutions and new adventures to embark upon. As many of you sit down to contemplate your goals of the year, I would like to suggest learning to ski or snowboard on national forests.\nJanuary is Learn to Ski and Snowboard Month, which means that on many resorts learning now can be the easiest and most affordable time to head to a forest near you. The U.S. Forest Service is host to 122 ski areas. The most visited forest, the White River National Forest, has 12 ski areas.\nLast winter, I ventured onto the Uncompahgre National Forest in Colorado as a true beginner to the sport of skiing. Even today, I can vividly recall the distinctive “click” as my boots locked into my rental skis for the first time. As I looked around at the other skiers and snowboarders effortlessly cruising on the crisp high-country powder I became excited. I knew I would soon be like them, schussing effortlessly down the mountain. Or so I thought.\nAs Colorado’s newest resident, I had to see for myself what it takes to be a skier. Looking around the ski area, I saw children fly past me without ski poles and seasoned experts sliding off the lift with a graceful ease before gliding down the slopes – backwards.\nI could only imagine how they looked at me. I wobbled back and forth trying just to stand. At that moment I thanked myself for the wisdom to seek out lessons from a professional ski instructor. The slopes I envisioned conquering would have to wait.\n“The first day is always the toughest,” said my instructor, Tammy Randall-Parker, a Forest Service district ranger and a certified ski instructor.\nShe promised to take me step-by-step through the process from basic mechanics to stopping at full speed, turns on one leg and seemingly endless trips up the magic carpet. Hours later, after getting the feel for it, Tammy finally gave me the clear to take on my first green circle, or the easiest terrain with a gentle slope. I remember that as I pushed off with my ski poles, held my breath and slowly made my way down. All the while, I kept repeating her advice in my head:  “Shift your weight, roll your toes, pick up your foot, glide.” Sounds simple, but without her guidance and tips I would have never made it 10 feet.\nLucky for me, Tammy has a lot of experience with newcomers.\n“When you see their face light up with the big smile as they finish their very first run it’s infectious - like looking in a mirror,” she said. “They instantly forget about the boots that were hurting them and all the falls that came before. Now, they have conquered there first run and will be back to see me tomorrow to learn more and enjoy their new love of skiing.”\nNewbies like myself have learned how to ski or snowboard on national forests for a very long time. Now, as an employee, I know the agency is very proud to provide a place for people to learn how to slide on snow. Learning to ski with a qualified instructor is the best start to make sure everyone on the mountain has a safe and enjoyable experience like I did.\nThanks to Tammy, I did not venture into any terrain I was not prepared for. But in case, she also taught me how to navigate between other skiers and snowboarders who were enjoying their day, too.\nWhile on the mountain that day, I learned even more. Forest Service snow ranger Shelly Grail provided a list of tips for skiers and snowboarders to keep them safe while having fun on the mountain.\nNew experiences are always scary at first. However there are plenty of resources out there to get you connected to skiing and snowboarding and make the activity a little less daunting. For example, there is a skiing and snowboarding program for grade-school children in Colorado where fifth and sixth graders have the opportunity to ski for free at certain areas.\nLearning new things, especially sports, can be difficult. But those new ventures also can create life-long memories; I will never forget as we turned in our rental gear, my instructor turned to me, gave me a high five and said, “You are officially a skier.” I don’t think I stopped smiling the entire ride home.\nThe bright sunshine and clear blue skies of Colorado served as a perfect backdrop for Kristin Merony as she prepared to learn how to ski at Telluride Mountain Resort, which operates on the Uncompahgre National Forest.

All three states rank in the top 10 for the total value of agricultural products sold, which includes sales of all products produced by farmers in each state.\nProducers in Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin together provide much of what we see on our breakfast plates. Let’s break our fast on ag census blogs and start this monthly series with breakfast foods and the state rankings for these important staples.\n Pancake mix and bread: Minnesota is second in spring wheat production and third in buckwheat production.\n Oatmeal and cereal: Minnesota is second, Wisconsin fourth and Iowa sixth in oat production.\n Scrambled eggs: Iowa is first, Minnesota eighth and Wisconsin 17th in egg layers for the kitchen table.\n Bacon: Iowa is first, Minnesota second and Wisconsin 18th in hog inventory.\n Maple syrup: Wisconsin is fourth, Minnesota 11th and Iowa 14th in maple syrup production.\n Sugar: Minnesota is first in sugarbeet production.\n Milk: Wisconsin is second, Minnesota seventh and Iowa 10th in milk sales.\n Honey: Minnesota is fourth, Wisconsin 16th and Iowa 19th in honey production.\nSo, thank farmers for all the commodities they produce – especially when you start your morning at the breakfast table or treat yourself with breakfast for dinner!

NRCS is shifting to a younger age group for recruitment to evaluate if it’s effective in raising awareness for potential new staff members.\nThe grant in helped fund workshops for this school year and the next for high school students at TERRA Environmental Research Institute in Miami-Dade County. The 1.5-hour sessions share the educational requirements for various NRCS positions as well as hands-on activities to demonstrate skills, methods and tools used by staff.\nEach workshop is personalized from the perspective of the NRCS staff member who shares their unique educational background, experiences and career path.  So far this year, NRCS soil scientists, district conservationists, soil conservationists, agricultural engineers and resource conservationists have presented.\nNext school year, NRCS staff in southern Florida will present on career positions specializing in natural resources inventory, engineering, soil science, range conservation and grazing lands management.\n“The presentations and hands-on activities have been very instrumental in providing my students with many lessons,” said Surey Rios, a teacher at TERRA. “We are looking forward to the next presenters.”\nThe visits from NRCS staff were important because it helps students see the real-world applications of concepts that they are learning and hear the life stories of other adults, Rios said. She also said they enable students to learn about careers beyond those of their parents and about different education tracts.\nProject Grow is funded through a two-year grant from NRCS in partnership with Florida International University, Fairchild Tropical Botanic Gardens and TERRA.

(Courtesy Milwaukee Urban Connections/ Jean Claassen)\nThe Forest Service recently celebrated the opening of the Milwaukee Rotary Centennial Arboretum at the Urban Ecology Center - Riverside Park in Milwaukee.\nIn , the USDA Forest Service, Eastern Region proudly joined Urban Ecology Center partners – the Rotary Club of Milwaukee, Milwaukee County Parks and the River Revitalization Foundation – in this exciting project.\nThe designation as a Forest Service’s Children’s Forest adds an element of wonder to the space. As visitors explore this outdoor play space, they will discover interpretive stations to help them forge a deeper connection with nature. Only one of 22 children’s forests throughout the country, this Milwaukee forest is one of only three located within a major urban area.\nAs you pass under the archway into the arboretum, you find yourself climbing a hill surrounded by beautiful native plants and trees. Descending the hill, you catch a glimpse of the Milwaukee River gently flowing. Moving from this “prairie” scape, you find yourself in the forest, searching out “imaginature stations,” signified by a leaf imprint on a small wooden tree ring– like a built in scavenger hunt!\nWhen you get to the river, you can preview recent plantings, as well as non-native invasive species treatments on the river bank. You may even see ducks floating along, or people having fun careening down the river in a canoe.\nAnd, that is just the beginning!\n“I encourage visitors to come out to the new space and get your hands dirty by planting some native plants,” said Milwaukee Urban Connections coordinator Jean Claassen. “Visitors will also have the opportunity to receive a first-rate tour of the new arboretum from UEC educators.”\nVisitors were able to witness the symmetry of nature and art through a beautiful painting by well-known artist Louise Phillips, who was on hand to dedicate it to the children’s forest. Phillips aspires to donate one of her paintings to each children's forest across the country.\n“A partnership truly flourishes when both parties have similar goals and missions. A key goal of the Eastern Region’s Urban Connections program is to connect urban residents with nature and encourage more kids in the woods,” said Eastern Regional Forester Kathleen Atkinson.  “The mission of the UEC is to foster ecological understanding as inspiration for change, neighborhood by neighborhood. Because of this symmetry, we are excited about the possibilities of this partnership – and one great outcome is the Milwaukee Rotary Centennial Arboretum.”\nSignage at the new Milwaukee Rotary Centennial Arboretum features information related to its designation as a Children’s Forest.

        "content": "USDA also announces record $2.3 billion investments under the Western Water Framework; Funding builds on Administration’s historic water conservation efforts, which have stabilized short-term western water supply and are investing in long-term solutions\n Release & Contact Info\n Press Release\n Release No. .24\n Contact: USDA Press\nEmail: press@usda.gov\n WASHINGTON, Aug. 1, – Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will invest $400 million with at least 18 irrigation districts to help farmers continue commodity production while also conserving water across the West. This funding – which will support irrigation districts and producers in using innovative water savings technologies and farming practices while producing water-saving commodities in the face of continued drought – is expected to conserve up to 50,000 acre-feet in water use across 250,000 acres of irrigated land in production, while expanding and creating new, sustainable market opportunities.\nThis historic funding builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to conserve water, increase the efficiency of water use, upgrade existing infrastructure, and overall strengthen water security in the West. With historic water conservation enabled by President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Reclamation announced in May it had staved off the immediate possibility of the Colorado River System’s reservoirs from falling to critically low elevations that would threaten water deliveries and power production. Due to record conservation investments as well as improved hydrology, Lake Mead levels today are the highest since May . The Administration is now working to ensure the long-term sustainability and resilience by focusing on long-term water conservation in several basins across the west.\n\"Agricultural producers are the backbone of rural communities across the West and many of them are struggling under prolonged drought conditions,” Vilsack said. “USDA is taking an ‘all hands’ approach to help address this challenge, including these new partnerships with irrigation districts to support producers. We want to scale up the tools available to keep farmers farming, while also voluntarily conserving water and expanding markets for water-saving commodities.”\nPartnering with Irrigation Districts to Support Water Conservation, Produce Water-Saving Commodities\nUSDA worked to select irrigation districts based on several commodity production and water management-related criteria in order to maximize the ability to achieve program objectives, leveraging available from the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Reclamation to ensure close alignment and partnership. USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) provided and analysis to support the preliminary selections. Districts that have been preliminarily selected for potential inclusion in this program include:\n Black Canyon Irrigation District, Idaho\n Brooklyn Canal Company, Utah\n Central Oregon Irrigation District, Ore.\n Central Arizona Irrigation and Drainage District, Ariz.\n Corcoran Irrigation District, Calif.\n East Columbia Basin Irrigation District, Wash.\n Elephant Butte Irrigation District, N.M.\n Glenn – Colusa Irrigation District, Calif.\n Greybull Valley Irrigation District, Wyo.\n Hidalgo & Cameron Counties Irrigation District 9, Texas\n Huntley Project Irrigation District, Mont.\n Imperial Irrigation District, Calif.\n Maricopa – Stanfield Irrigation and Drainage District, Ariz.\n Palisade Irrigation District, Colo.\n Quincy Columbia Basin Irrigation District, Wash.\n Solano Irrigation District, Calif.\n Sutter Mutual Water Company, Calif.\n Truckee-Carson Irrigation District, Nev.\nThe preliminary selected districts may receive up to $15 million each in the awards and will enter into sub-agreements with the producers participating within the district. Depending on available funding, awards to additional districts may be possible.\nProducers who participate will receive payments for voluntarily reducing water consumption while maintaining commodity production. The needs of producers will determine the specific strategies for water conservation, including irrigation improvements, shifts in management practices, shifts in cropping systems, and other innovative strategies. USDA will learn from the diversity of strategies used and identify additional opportunities to maintain and expand water-saving commodity production in the future.\nParticipating producers and irrigation districts will commit to ensuring continued commodity production in the areas where water consumption is reduced. USDA is working to finalize agreements with the preliminarily selected districts, which will include the details of each individual district’s water-saving strategies, commodities to be produced, and specific budgets. Following the finalization of those awards, producers within the participating districts will work directly through their irrigation districts to participate. USDA and the preliminarily selected districts will provide more details on the agreements and opportunities for producers to directly enroll.\n“Maricopa-Stanfield Irrigation and Drainage District is pleased to be working with USDA to implement practices and projects that save water and improve efficiencies at a time when the historic drought in the southwest has put so much pressure on our agricultural producers. Investing in agriculture is an investment in America,” the District said.\n“Quincy-Columbia Basin Irrigation District is excited to enter into partnership with USDA to help bring Federal dollars to local growers. Our top priority is providing efficient and dependable irrigation water to our constituents, and we look forward to working with USDA to explore new water-efficient practices in the Columbia Basin,” the District said.\n“Greybull Valley Irrigation District (GVID) is extremely excited to explore water conservation efforts with the USDA Water-Saving Commodities team, this is a great opportunity for the District and their producers. GVID is always looking for ways to conserve water while supplying their producers with a steady flow for their crops, livestock, underground pipelines and pivots. The District is looking forward to discovering other conservation measures that would be very beneficial for all GVID members,” GVID said.\nInvesting in Water Conservation in Tribal Communities and Acequias\nIn addition to the preliminarily selected districts announced today, USDA is also announcing a Tribal set-aside within the program, targeting up to $40 million in funding for additional awards within Indian Country. USDA will work with the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Tribes, and Tribal producers to reduce water consumption and maintain land in agricultural production – supporting the production of water-saving commodities. USDA is partnering with BIA to use available and ensure meaningful engagement with Tribes to establish selection criteria that reflect the specific needs and water management systems within Indian Country. Additional information for further engagement and selections will be provided in the weeks ahead.\nUSDA will also include targeted assistance to support water-saving commodity production for acequias, recognizing that many irrigators in the Southwest are formed under the community-based acequia model instead of the irrigation district model. Additional information regarding targeted assistance to acequias that reflects the historical nature of their water distribution structure will follow.\nAdditional information for further engagement with Tribes and acequias will be provided in the weeks ahead.\nHistoric Investments in Western Water Complement Water-Saving Commodities Program\nUSDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is working to help producers and communities conserve water, manage and prepare for the effects of climate change and build drought resilience in the West through its Western Water and Working Lands Framework for Conservation Action (Western Water Framework), which was launched in . The Western Water Framework describes how NRCS assistance is used to address water resource related issues in 17 states in the West. In fiscal year , NRCS provided $2.3 billion in conservation investments that help producers and communities in Western states better steward water resources, including investments that also support climate change mitigation. This total includes a boost of 9.7 percent or $213.3 million from the Inflation Reduction Act.\nThe Western Water Framework includes key NRCS conservation programs, including the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP). Within EQIP NRCS has created a WaterSMART Initiative (WSI), to coordinate investments with the Bureau of Reclamation’s WaterSMART investments in priority areas.\nFor Fiscal Year , NRCS selected 9 new priority areas and is continuing to offer funding in 36 prior approved areas, making $29.7 million in EQIP funding available through the WSI across 16 states.\nEQIP and CSP provide conservation planning and funding to help with implementation of conservation practices. Practices like irrigation water management improve irrigation efficiency and mitigate climate change. Meanwhile, practices like conservation crop rotation, cover crop, residue and tillage management, no-till, and nutrient management help producers build resilience to future drought. ACEP gives producers and landowners tools to protect wetlands, grasslands and agricultural lands which can be used to conserve water.\nTogether, these efforts by FSA and NRCS advance USDA’s efforts to create more, new, and better market opportunities, sustainably grow agricultural productivity to feed a growing population, and help farmers and natural resource managers manage and prepare for the effects of climate change.\nLearn more about the Western Water Framework.\nUSDA touches the lives of all Americans each day in so many positive ways. In the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA is transforming America’s food system with a greater focus on more resilient local and regional food production, fairer markets for all producers, ensuring access to safe, healthy and nutritious food in all communities, building new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate smart food and forestry practices, making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America, and committing to equity across the Department by removing systemic barriers and building a workforce more representative of America.

Many families and communities will be celebrating with their Easter, Eid, and Passover traditions. Whether you’re celebrating your Easter dinner with ham, Eid lunch with lamb, or Seder meal with brisket, remember to keep food safety at the forefront.\nIn a season of different traditions and foods, USDA offers the same Food Safety Steps for everyone:\n Be sure to allow plenty of time to thaw a frozen ham, lamb, or brisket with the three safe thawing methods: refrigerator, cold water, or microwave thawing.\n FSIS recommends the following minimum internal temperatures when cooking meat and poultry items:\n Beef, pork, veal and lamb steaks, chops, roasts: 145 F\n Fish and shellfish: 145 F\n Ham, fresh or smoked (uncooked): 145 F\n Eggs: 160 F\n Ground meats: 160 F\n All poultry (breasts, whole bird, legs, thighs, wings, ground poultry, giblets, and stuffing): 165 F\n When reheating already cooked meat and poultry items that have cooled, they should be reheated to at least 165 F. USDA recommends reheating cooked meat and poultry products on the stove top, in the oven, or in a microwave. Keep in mind the “Danger Zone” between 40 and 140 F — a temperature where foodborne bacteria multiply rapidly and cause foodborne illness. To prevent entering the Danger Zone, perishable foods, such as kebabs, brisket, or ham, should be discarded if left out for longer than two hours. To prevent food waste, refrigerate or freeze perishable items within two hours, or keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold.\n Divide leftovers into smaller portions and refrigerate or freeze them in shallow containers, which helps leftovers cool quicker than storing them in large quantities. Leftovers can be kept in the refrigerator for three to four days or frozen indefinitely, but quality will decrease after three to four months.\nLearn more about the safe handling of beef, ham, and lamb products.\nIf you have questions about preparing meat, poultry or egg dishes, contact USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline to talk to a food safety specialist or chat live at www.ask.usda.gov from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n Tags:\n Food Safety and Inspection Service\n FSIS\n Food Safety\n foodborne illness\n beef\n lamb\n ham\n spring holidays\n You May Also Like\n USDA Process Verified Program: Transparency from Farm to Market\n Pack It Safe, Pack It Smart: Back-to-School Lunchbox Packing Essentials\n Food Safety Sparklers: Clean, Separate, Cook and Chill",

Over the last three decades, fire season lengths have increased by 60-80 days and annual acreages burned have more than doubled to over 7 million acres annually. In addition, growing housing development in forests has put more people and houses in harms’ way, also making firefighting efforts more expensive. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service, Southwestern Region, Kaibab National Forest.\nForests significantly contribute to our quality of life, but climate change is adversely affecting natural resources in rural and urban areas across the U.S. A new report released by the White House, the National Climate Assessment, explores many related issues including how a warming planet affects our forests.\nWith contributions from U.S. Forest Service scientists, the report is one of the most comprehensive examinations of climate change and its effects on forested land. It concludes that a warming climate will complicate future management of public, private and tribal forests.\n“Climate change is currently triggering multiple, sometimes contrasting, responses from our forests,” said Dave Cleaves, U.S. Forest Service Climate Change Advisor. “Longer growing seasons and gradually warming temperatures are helping trees grow faster in some areas, but in other areas, these longer and warmer growing seasons increase late summer moisture stress and reduce tree growth.”\nThe Forest Service integrates climate change awareness, mitigation and adaptation into the management of its 193 million acres through the Climate Change Performance Scorecard.  For example, this tool has encouraged national forests to identify vulnerable water resources, plant more climate-resilient tree species, research carbon storage capacity and more.\nSome of the other ways the Forest Service manages wildlands includes reducing the potential for large crown fires expected in a warmer climate by removing hazardous fuels and managing for lower stem densities in dry forests, managing forest genetic diversity to increase resilience to a warmer climate and restoring riparian areas adjacent to streams to ensure cold-water fish habitat during summer low-flow periods.\nPublic and private forests in the U.S. will increasingly be vulnerable to ecosystem changes and tree mortality through fire, insect infestations, drought and disease outbreaks. At the same time, the need for healthy forests will only continue to increase. Forests provide an expanding opportunity to support emerging bioenergy markets and carbon credit systems. It is likely such uses will interact with the demand for wood products, healthy watersheds and recreational opportunities. There will also be continued economic pressures encouraging a shift from forestland to agricultural or urban land uses.\nAccording to Linda Joyce, a Forest Service scientist, and one of the authors of the report, climate-smart management practices are being developed and implemented, and the agency is maintaining its focus on retaining forests as forests restoring forest health and resilience, and reforesting private and federal lands.\nHowever, Joyce emphasized that implementation of climate-smart management practices can be increased only through effective integration of scientific information in management of our national wildlands.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Climate Change\n Dave Cleaves\n Forestry\n Forests\n FS\n Linda Joyce\n National Climate Assessment\n White House",

But don’t panic. Let the U.S. Forest Service help out.\nYou read that right. The Forest Service wants you to give mom the gift of nature in all its innate perfection. And all you need to do is take her to your nearest national forest or grasslands.\nFor instance, if you live in Washington State, the Olympic National Forest, with its dramatic mountain range, conjures up images of the European Alps. The beauty doesn’t end there, though. The Olympics’ varied landscape includes lush rain forests, deep canyons, high mountain ridges and ocean beaches. Taking mom on a drive through this incomparable backdrop would be a scenic tour to brighten her day.\nJust south of the Olympic National Forest is the Gifford Pinchot National Forest (named for the founder of the Forest Service). Within the forest is one of the most famous volcanos in the world, Mount St. Helens. A visit to the Forest Service-managed Mount Saint Helens National Volcanic Monument is well worth the trip and will make for a Mother’s Day to remember.\nLooks can be deceiving: Mount St. Helens from its south facing slop looks as if had never erupted. Photo Credit: Robert H. Westover.\nNot all forests are full of trees, though. Some Forest Service land is filled with millions of cacti. So, if you happen to be in Arizona, take mom to the awe inspiring Sabino Canyon on the Coronado National Forest just north of Tucson, Ariz.  (Some of the trail is handicapped accessible.) You’ll want to hike the wonders of the Seven Falls, but mom will have to be a sturdy hiker because the trail is about 8 miles round trip and you’ll have to cross a stream a dozen times as you zigzag through the valley to and from the falls.\nBut the views are well worth it. Like a giant rock-ribbed cathedral rising up from the valley floor, the canyon suddenly opens up to the vista of the Seven Falls splashing down a natural staircase feature that climbs over a thousand feet directly in front of you.\nBut if forests and mountains don’t excite mom, don’t forget that the Forest Service manages millions of acres of grasslands in the heart of the ancient prairie lands of the West. From northern Texas to North Dakota, these serene grasslands seem to unfold forever across landscapes uninterrupted by mountain ranges. Aside from taking in the scenic views, you can do many other things on Forest Service grasslands. For instance on the Pawnee National Grassland you can camp, hike, mountain bike, or even go horseback riding.\nIf you live in North Carolina, visiting the Pisgah National Forest is a must. Surrounding the historic town of Ashville, N.C., and near the cradle of American forestry, the Biltmore Estate, the Pisgah has many fun activities for mom and family. Whitewater runs through the mountains of the forest creating deep river gorges, world-class whitewater, premier trout streams, scenic waterfalls and reservoirs with undeveloped shorelines. For a truly breathtaking experience that she won’t soon forget, take mom to Wilson Creek which offers great adventures for hiking, scenic viewing, mountain biking, fishing, camping, horseback riding and backpacking!\nThere is just so much you can do on your national forests and grasslands. You might discover taking mom into the woods (or grasslands, or desert) will be something you’ll want to do every Mother’s Day—or any other day of the year!\nWaters from the Seven Falls in Sabino Canyon seem to come out from nowhere.

FSA and Rural Development State Directors Gene Davidson and Bobby Goode hosted the Administrator and Ed Harlan of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Louis Buck of Tennessee Biomass Supply Cooperative, Pete Nelson of Memphis Bioworks, Atha Comiskey and Bart Comiskey of Clean Cities of Middle Tennessee, Paul Melgaard of Eco Energy, Terry Ruse of Clean Fuels Development Coalition, Warren Nevad of the Tennessee Renewable Energy Economic Council, Dan Stasser of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Stan Boyd and David Owenby of the Tennessee Department of Transportation and Rural Development Tennessee Energy Programs Coordinator Will Dodson.\nCanales opened the forum with the idea that, \"By making renewable energy sources commercially viable based on feed stock available in each region of the country, we create sustainable opportunities for job creation and economic development, and keep more energy dollars in the community.\"\nThe spirited discussion covered a range of challenges on the horizon for the emerging bioenergy industry from traditional fuel providers to misperceptions about the tradeoff between food and fuel crops. Canales emphasized that changes are coming to the USDA energy programs that will allow applications to be submitted year round and to encourage geographic and technological diversity.\nCanales and others brought up the regional nature of biofuel production. Regionally significant feed stocks mentioned included cellulosic switch grass, wood pulp and sucrose-rich crops.\nWith the commercial availability of existing flex fuels growing rapidly, participants called for a fresh examination of regulations intended to encourage their use. \"Greater use helps drive down production costs and will encourage more stations to carry fuels like E20, E30 and E85 as they come online,\" said Goode. \"We can help drive the change to cleaner fuels by doing more to take advantage of flex fuels in fleet vehicles and by educating consumers on the benefits of using more renewable American-made energy resources.\"\nCoop Manager Louis Buck said that with the advances being made in bioenergy production today he looks forward to a time when farmers send power down wires to the city and get a check delivered back in the mail. Electronic mail, presumably.\nDuring the roundtable, Canales also announced the award of a $25,000 Rural Energy for America (REAP) grant to the Tennessee Biomass Supply Cooperative.

She had monitored the tornado, keeping in contact with local officials as the tornado went through Mississippi on Wednesday. She linked up on Thursday morning with local USDA personnel in Oktibbeha County, arriving only hours after the tornado had passed through. She also toured damaged areas in Neshoba and Kemper Counties that afternoon.\nSecretary Tom Vilsack toured the area of Smithville, Mississippi and saw firsthand the heavy damage caused by the tornado.

Secretary Vilsack and State Director George were two of a number of Obama Administration Cabinet officials, federal administrators, and local leaders to see the damage caused by tornadoes in Mississippi and Alabama.\n“It is heartbreaking to see this damage and to talk to the people who are victims of the tornado,” said George. “I was able to not only see the physical damages, but I was able to listen to some of the actual victims, many of whom had lost everything. However, I can report that USDA Rural Development has programs that can offer some relief to these unfortunate victims.”\nGeorge cited USDA Rural Development programs such as funding to replace and repair single-family homes, shared community facilities and the water and wastewater systems in the damaged areas. “I want to make sure that people know about the availability of our programs, especially our single-family home loan and home repair loan programs, so that they can rebuild their homes and businesses and continue to have clean water.”\nGeorge has a history of fast action on disaster relief. Most recently, she was on the scene the day after tornadoes ran thru Holmes and Yazoo Counties in and made sure that USDA Rural Development programs were a part of both the immediate and long-term relief efforts in those counties. Local officials in both counties credited George and USDA Rural Development for their fast work in making resources available, especially to the homeowners who lost their homes in that disaster.\n“These people have lost everything but their spirit. For them to see the highest officials in our nation’s government, including Cabinet secretaries and head of relief agencies coming to what is left of their town to see the damage personally,” Said George, “I can’t convey to ya’ll how uplifting that is to those people.

This point, in itself, may have you wondering, “So What?” However, it’s the goal of the films and the potential for affecting the lives of young people that make this an important event. \nThe videos aimed to illustrate the importance of engaging youth in conservation, and inspiring the next generation of environmental leaders. The films displayed a variety of recreational, service, volunteer, and work experiences, while illustrating the community, career, and cultural benefits of exposing youth to the outdoors. \n“It’s really important for people to understand the value of places like this, but it’s also good to take that ethic back to your communities too,” said Levi Novey of the Corps Network, who led a group of inner-city Baltimore youth with CivicWorks on an expedition to the Boulder-White Clouds area. \nMany of the young people featured in the films shared that these were their first time experiencing the great outdoors, and the impact this had on their perception for conservation and public land stewardship. In one video, for example, a network of Latinos advocating for the health of the Colorado River led a group of Latino youth on an adventure of a lifetime navigating the river through the Grand Canyon with the goal of influencing Latinos to be future advocates for the river. \n“Feeling the water is a slap in the face with our history, with our culture, and it’s just wonderful,” said Rosalia Salazar of Las Vegas. \nOthers even mentioned how these experiences exposed them to career options they had not previously considered, expressing aspirations of working with the Forest Service, and other federal public land agencies.\n“Being to a place like this [brings] a difference in people. I see a connection between what I do and coming [here],” said Jamaal Weems of CivicWorks in Baltimore. “The connection is how to keep the environment a place where people can come at peace, a safe environment, a safe place… If it was up to me, I would do my best to help protect the environment because this is a beautiful place.”\n Interspersed between films were remarks made by USDA Under Secretary Robert Bonnie, speakers from the U.S. Department of Interior, The Corps Network, Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, AmeriCorps, Student Conservation Association, and a young corps participant. The videos were unique because they presented diversity of people, places, and projects. The films aimed to demonstrate the honest and transformative experiences of the next generation of diverse conservation leaders, many from minority backgrounds. \n“For a lot of these youth, [they] are marginalized in society and they don’t have that many opportunities like this [so] I think it means that much more to them. Culturally, it’s part of their genetic memory…is that memory and that connection to the land and that appreciation of nature. I feel a re-introduction to that part of themselves and that part of their story” said Jesus “Chucho” Ruiz of Chicanos por la Causa. \nThe films advocate for a strong work ethic from the participants, indicating that their work and service not only benefits them today, but will help to preserve those benefits for future generations to come. \n“Films like this are critically important, because they convey to viewers the positive impact of engaging with youth and veterans. They highlight the key contributions these people provide to 21 CSC programs, and, critically, demonstrate how these programs can shape the lives of participants in a constructive and rewarding way.  Both viewers and participants are exposed to life changing experiences they will never forget,” said Meryl Harrell of USDA. \nThe hope is that the participants will share their experiences with others, and continue to develop themselves as stewards of the land. \nVisit The Corps Network website to view the short films.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n AmeriCorps\n Boulder-White Clouds\n CivicWorks\n Corps Network\n Engaging the Next Generation of Conservation Stewards\n Forest Service\n Student Conservation Association",

This is the nation's largest, single-day volunteer effort for public lands sponsored by the National Environmental Education Foundation. This year’s theme is: “Helping Hands for America’s Lands.”\nNational Public Lands Day is one of six fee-free days in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, National Get Outdoors Day, and Veterans Day Weekend. Fees are waived generally for day use, such as picnic areas, developed trailheads and destination visitor centers. Fees are not waived for concessionaire-operated facilities or for overnight use such as camping or recreation rentals.\n“America’s national forests and grasslands belong to all of us,” said U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell. “These beautiful places have so much to offer, and we hope you’ll get outside and volunteer on National Public Lands Day to enjoy these places for yourself, while improving them for future visitors.”\nNPLD events include diverse activities such as planting trees, learning about bats, cleaning up rivers, and much more.  Participants can contact their nearest forest or grassland for event information or visit the National Public Lands Day web site. This year, many Forest Service sites will offer educational activities focusing on wildfire prevention.\nNational Tribal Lands Day will also take place on Sept. 28 and celebrate healthy lands, people and tribal culture. Activities will encourage volunteerism, outdoor recreation and environmental education on land that is owned and managed by sovereign tribal governments.\nIn , about 175,000 volunteers served at 2,206 National Public Lands Day sites in every state, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories, making it the largest participation in the event’s history. They collected an estimated 500 tons of trash and 23,000 pounds of invasive plants, planted 100,000 trees and other plants and built or maintained 1,500 miles of trails.\nForest Service lands, which include 155 national forests and 20 national grasslands, offer something for everyone, from the casual hiker to the thrill-seeking recreationist. There are also opportunities and programs for children, including the popular Discover the Forest and Junior Forest Ranger programs.\nWe look forward to seeing you at the 20th anniversary of National Public Lands Day and the second annual National Tribal Lands Day.  Let’s make this year’s event the best one yet, as we are all stewards of the nation’s forests and grasslands.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n bats\n children\n Discover The Forest\n Forestry\n Forests\n FS\n Grasslands\n invasive plants\n Junior Forest Ranger\n National Environmental Education Foundation\n national forests\n National Get Outdoors Day\n National Public Lands Day\n National Tribal Lands Day\n Tom Tidwell\n trees\n Tribal\n volunteerism\n Washington DC\n wildfire prevention",

The grant program provides funding to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops and support specialty crop growers through marketing, education, and research.\n“USDA is excited to announce that this year’s Specialty Crop Block Grant awards marks over $1 billion invested in nearly 12,000 projects that support the U.S. specialty crop industry,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. “The Specialty Crop Block Grant Program is a critical piece of USDA and the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to support small and mid-sized producers and ensure Americans have sustained access to fresh, locally grown specialty crop products.”\nFiscal year SCBGP funding is awarded to the departments of agriculture in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Funding for SCBGP is authorized by the Farm Bill.\nStates are encouraged to subaward funding to projects that address the needs of U.S. producers of fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops. Funded projects include investing in food safety, specialty crop research, including research to focus on conservation and environmental outcomes, developing new and improved seed varieties and specialty crops, and pest and disease control. Additional projects focus on increasing child and adult nutrition knowledge and consumption of specialty crops; and improving efficiency and reducing costs of distribution systems.\nMore information on the projects is included in the individual press releases for each state and territory. The press releases can be viewed on the SCBGP Grant Awards webpage.\nUSDA touches the lives of all Americans each day in so many positive ways. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA is transforming America’s food system with a greater focus on more resilient local and regional food production, fairer markets for all producers, ensuring access to safe, healthy and nutritious food in all communities, building new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate smart food and forestry practices, making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America, and committing to equity across the Department by removing systemic barriers and building a workforce more representative of America.

Quite a summer!\nExpanding access to the Summer Food Service Program is an important part of ending childhood hunger in the United States. Many children from low-income families depend on school meals for breakfast and lunch, but when school is out, those meals are no longer available.  For this very reason, USDA offers the SFSP, a federally funded program administered by states that reimburses organizations for meals served to children during summer.  As a community organization, school, university, local government, or individual, you can get involved!  You can sponsor the program and operate multiple feeding sites. Or you can become a feeding site and work with an existing sponsor to provide kids free nutritious meals.

One year later, she was named an Scholar and remained one for the entirety of her time at Prairie View A&M in Texas. “Receiving this honor made me proud of my accomplishments,” she said. “I was excited and relieved. The scholarship made me feel financially secure and enabled me to confidently focus solely on my education.”\nMonetary benefits of the program include a full-ride scholarship covering tuition, room and board, fees and the cost of books. Scholars also have the opportunity to participate in internships at USDA.\nKristina became interested in agriculture, specifically nutrition and dietetics, to improve her health and break the generational cycles of chronic disease in her family. She wanted to concentrate solely on nutritional science until she interned with the USDA Economic Research Service and the Farm Service Agency and discovered skills she didn’t even know she had.\n“I learned about analysis, interpreting , and presenting it in a unique way,” she said. “Those skills I gained in my internship opened me up to things I never thought I’d excel at. I didn’t think of myself as a or numbers person, but it turns out I’m actually pretty good at it.”\nThe scholarship also introduced her to the USDA liaison at her university, Horace Hodge, who played a critical role in assisting Kristina with her aspirations. “Even today, I still connect with Horace and keep in touch,” she said. “He made me feel important enough that it felt like having a personal mentor.” USDA liaisons like Horace serve as key representatives for USDA across America, connecting communities, students, faculty and staff, farmers, ranchers, foresters and others to the Department’s programs and initiatives.\nKristina expressed gratitude and shared insight about the program to future scholars. “I’m glad I had this experience because I now have a more well-rounded background,” she said. “Students need to be open-minded and open to working in an area that may not exactly match your background, because you may discover strengths.”\nToday she still makes a difference in the agriculture realm, performing analytics as a fellow for a humanitarian group that provides support in the food security sector.

She noted that one of the first things that Secretary Vilsack did when he walked in the door was to create an Office of Tribal Relations—a move that impressed the straight-talking Hipp.\n“Historically, we have had maybe one person trying to work across 17 agencies scattered in just about every county across the country…and around the globe,” she told the nearly 500 attendees.\nThe creation of a Tribal Relations Office, staffed out of the Secretary’s budget during a time of budget cutting, shows a genuine commitment by this Secretary and this administration to accelerate the work between the department and the hundreds of tribes with whom it works.\nHipp is a member of the Chickasaw Nation. She told the crowd that the Office is working to increase the number of consultations, create guidebooks for tribes to simplify access to USDA programs, and streamline interdepartmental regulations to make it easier for tribes to work with the diverse array of federal agencies offering services to tribes.\nHipp also encouraged the audience to take advantage of the upcoming meetings being held across all of Indian Country regarding the Keepseagle settlement—a settlement she and the Court called “fair and equitable.” She should know. She holds a J.D., an LL.M. in Agricultural Law, taught at several law schools, worked for the Oklahoma Attorney General, was an Administrative Law Judge for the Cherokee Nation, provided insight on US agriculture in China, Russia, Slovakia, Chile and Turkey, and co-founded the Intertribal Native Women and Youth in Agriculture. According to Hipp, the Keepseagle claims period meetings will be held June through December of this year.\nShe also noted that there will be tribal consultations beginning in June to get input on how the Agriculture Department might streamline its regulations.\nJanie Hipp’s passion for her work is obvious when you hear her speak. It is also effective, as evidenced by the trust so many have put in her. Recently Hipp was given responsibility as head of the Office of Tribal Relations along with the Food and Nutrition Service for USDA’s participation in Let’s Move in Indian Country. A part of the First Lady’s Let’s Move! Initiative, Let’s Move in Indian Country will build on efforts to combat childhood obesity in Indian Country by supporting and leveraging ongoing efforts by a number of Federal agencies, encouraging public/private partnerships and energizing tribal leaders to develop ideas that fit the unique characteristics of their tribes. The goal is to establish or encourage the establishment of 20 tribal food policy councils and committees across Indian Country to enhance comprehensive food policy to improve health.\nTo read more about USDA’s participation, along with other Federal agencies in Let’s Move! in Indian Country, click here. \n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Cherokee Nation\n Chickasaw Nation\n Janie Hipp\n Let's Move! in Indian Country\n OTR\n Tom Vilsack\n Tribal",

Joshua Farm installed its high tunnel with the help of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).\nJoshua Farm is managed by Harrisburg residents Kirsten Reinford and Joshua Mortiz. It grows over 40 varieties of fresh produce for over 45 local families. In just seven years, Joshua Farm has made a substantial impact on the community.\nThe farm is a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) business, where members share in the farm’s expenses in exchange for a portion of the harvest. Joshua Farm also allows members to provide volunteer labor as payment for CSA shares.\nThe longer growing season the high tunnel enables allows both the farm and its shareholders to benefit from higher productivity. The result is that Joshua Farm has fresh fruits and vegetables from May through October. Shareholders receive a harvest selection on a weekly basis during the 22-week growing season.\nJoshua Farm is part of Joshua Group, a non-profit that offers tutoring, mentoring and scholarships to underprivileged students. Through the farm, the organization teaches inner-city students where food comes from and how to grow food. The farm also employs up to six students and offers small cooking classes for young people.\nVegetables growing in the high tunnel at Joshua Farm.

These systems must work for all who need them, not just for a few.\nThe Science and Research Strategy is our answer to how research and innovative technologies can advance agricultural production while simultaneously tackling the world’s greatest challenges.\nIn this Strategy, we’ve identified USDA’s highest scientific priorities. Aligning with USDA’s Strategic Plan for -, (, 9.6 ) these priorities reflect input from our stakeholders and partners.\nUSDA’s five science priorities are:\n Accelerating Innovative Technologies & Practices\n Driving Climate-Smart Solutions\n Bolstering Nutrition Security & Health\n Cultivating Resilient Ecosystems\n Translating Research into Action\nOur crosscutting priorities reflect the expert feedback from scientific leaders across USDA and external stakeholders from across our diverse agricultural enterprise. These new priorities represent the complexity of the obstacles we face and will guide how USDA plans to meet this moment through science, , innovation, and partnerships.\nInterwoven throughout this Strategy and centered at the heart of each priority is our commitment to equity. By supporting a more equitable and just science enterprise, we will drive real and meaningful impact for the people we serve.\nOur Science & Research Strategy is meant to spur innovation and collaboration across all sectors. This is a call to action for our stakeholders and partners nationwide to propose bold, audacious actions to advance the priorities we’ve set forth.\nJoin the conversation! As we implement this Strategy over the next three years, your voices are critical. I encourage everyone to review this plan and share how your work intersects—or could intersect—with these priorities.\nThrough open science, transparency, and collaboration, we can find revolutionary solutions to transform our nation’s food and agricultural systems to benefit the many and the most.\nWorking together, in alignment with USDA’s Science & Research Strategy, let's continue to push the boundaries of possibility for agriculture and forestry to create a better world for all.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n USDA Science\n USDA Science and Research Strategy\n Science\n Research\n innovation\n Partnerships\n You May Also Like\n Reflections from the Road in Pennsylvania: Charting the Path Forward with Urban Agriculture and the Next Generation\n Young Producers Boost Great Lakes Agriculture\n America’s Summer BBQ: Sizzling from the Southern Plains",

We had the opportunity to help the teachers and parents serve lunch to the students--an experience I will never forget.  The energy of the students and positive outlook of the teachers attest to the impact of the program on these young lives.\nTraveling with Senator McGovern has provided a unique opportunity to gain knowledge of the history of U.S. food security and food aid programs.  Senator McGovern has been working to end global hunger since the Roosevelt Administration, and continues today as he works tirelessly for WFP, an organization he helped found.  I am so proud to be part of the team at USDA that administers the Food for Peace and McGovern-Dole food aid programs that were authored by Senator McGovern.\nAs the Obama Administration implements the Feed the Future Initiative, we owe a great debt to Senator McGovern, who has provided a wealth of knowledge and a deep commitment to global food security.\nDeputy Under Secretary Vetter helps to distribute the meals in the village of Gambella.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Trade\n Tags:\n Darci Vetter\n Feed the Future\n FFA\n FFAS\n FFP\n Food\n Food for Peace\n George McGovern\n Kenya\n McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program\n Nairobi\n Nutrition\n President Obama\n WFP\n World Food Program",

The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) provides aid to child and adult care centers and family or group day care homes for the provision of nutritious foods that contribute to the wellness, healthy growth, and development of young children and the health and wellness of older adults and chronically impaired disabled persons. CACFP administrators and program operators receive support from many advocacy organizations who help ensure children and adults participating in CACFP receive nutritious meals. Below is a story from one of those advocacy organizations, the Child Care Food Program Roundtable.\nBy Chris Clark, Child Care Food Program Roundtable\nIn , First Lady Michelle Obama’s initiative to end childhood obesity, Let’s Move!, celebrated its fifth anniversary. To mark the occasion, she issued the challenge which encouraged all Americans to do five things to lead a healthier lifestyle. The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) community heard this call to action and developed its own CACFP Take ACTION Challenge. That Challenge was launched at the CCFP Roundtable Conference, where over 500 conference attendees got up, got moving and performed the Dance!\nThe Challenge is a yearlong initiative aimed at creating national CACFP awareness, including its collaborative role in quality child care, healthy children, food security and childhood obesity prevention. It recognizes and celebrates CACFP participants’ and professionals’ efforts to get over 1.9 billion CACFP healthy meals and snacks served in family child care homes, centers and after school programs to over 3.8 million children and adults each year.\nIt consists of five categories, each with a list of corresponding activities. Categories include CACFP Take Action Launch, USDA Resources and Best Practices, Health and Wellness, Educate and Advocate and CACFP Campaigns. Participants select the activities they are interested in undertaking, complete the activities, take a picture and tell their story. At the end of the Challenge—at the CCFP Roundtable Conference in Rancho Mirage, Calif. – the following awards will be presented: CACFP Gold, Silver, Bronze and Commended.\nTo date, submissions have been received from child care providers, sponsors, USDA and state agencies in over 35 states. Additional challenge partners are: Child Care Food Program Roundtable; Food Research Action Center (FRAC); Team FNV; Let’s Move! Child Care; T & L Foundation; California Department of Education; National Farm to School Network and USDA. Some fun and creative examples of Challenge submissions received to date include:\nInvolving kids in taste testing recipes and creating their own recipe books to take home\nForming intramural sports teams and exercising together at work\nGetting infants and young kids moving by listening to the Fruit and Veggie Swag collection of songs and videos\nInspiring others to join the Challenge through friendly competition\nStarting a boot camp style fitness program for friends and colleagues\nBuilding a healthy culture calls for action within and across sectors, because progress in one area will advance progress in another. CACFP, you are doing it! Thank you!\nFor more wonderful Challenge stories, visit:  www.cacfptakeactionchallenge.org.

One thing that was abundantly clear about the folks I met was how much they care about the programs and the children they serve.\nThe School Nutrition Association Annual Conference draws thousands from across the nation.\nFor anyone not familiar with the conference, it is a huge gathering, drawing thousands from across the nation and featuring hundreds of educational sessions and a truly impressive Exhibit Hall. This year, staff from USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service spoke at nearly thirty sessions, hosted several resource booths in the Exhibit Hall, and operated a customer service center where we provided on-the-spot technical assistance.\nI had the opportunity to speak at the conference’s General Session, and it was a pleasure to thank school food service staff, industry, and the Association for all their efforts and share with them USDA’s vision for the school meals programs. I also had the chance to hear the inspiring story of Chef Jeff Henderson, a TV chef who speaks out about ending the cycle of poverty and childhood hunger. Growing up in poverty – and experiencing the hunger and uncertainty associated with that – led Chef Jeff into drug dealing and eventually prison, but he built a new life for himself through cooking.\nBut the real highlight of the conference, for me, was the opportunity to sit down with a small but diverse group of school food professionals to hear what’s on their mind. I was fortunate to join a listening session where we discussed everything from staff training to procurement to program oversight. I was grateful for all of the thoughtful, honest feedback. Opportunities to hear directly from our customers are extremely valuable – not just for me, but for all of my staff.\nCustomer service is one of our top priorities at USDA, but we can’t provide top-quality service without input from our customers. We need to hear from school food professionals – what tools and resources they need, how things are working on the ground, and their ideas for program improvement – in order to know how to best serve them.\nOur team has already started brainstorming ways to act on the feedback we received while at the conference, and I look forward to continuing the dialogue. USDA strives to provide schools, States, and our partners with excellent service so they can pass that on to those who participate in our programs. We want to make administering the programs as easy as possible so school nutrition professionals can focus on what really matters – serving our nation’s children nutritious meals to set them up for future success.\nOpportunities to hear directly from our customers are extremely valuable to USDA.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Food and Nutrition Service\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n Nutrition\n food service professionals",

State and local governments, federally recognized Indian tribes, non-governmental and educational organizations, private businesses and individuals are eligible to apply.Vilsack said priority will be given to applications that relate to nutrient management, energy conservation, soil health, air quality, climate change, wildlife, economics, sociology, environmental markets, food safety, historically underserved groups, or assessments of past CIG projects.In the 10 years that NRCS has administered the program, grants have helped develop water quality trading markets, demonstrated ways to increase fertilizer water and energy efficiencies, as well as address other resource concerns.For example, the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers Association used a CIG grant to work with growers to install automated sprinkler systems that conserve water and trim costs. Ducks Unlimited and other partners used a grant to develop a carbon credit system for North Dakota landowners in the Prairie Pothole region, a crucial area for migrating waterfowl. The Wilds, a wildlife conservation center, also used a grant to demonstrate how a combination of warm-and cool-season grasses can be successfully incorporated into a productive, sustainable rotational grazing system.The grant program enables NRCS to work with public and private partners to accelerate technology development and adopt promising approaches to address natural resource concerns. Funded through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, the grants are awarded through a competitive process. At least 50 percent of the total cost of grant projects must come from non-federal matching funds, including cash and in-kind contributions provided by the grant recipient.For more on this grant opportunity, visit To apply electronically, visit www.grants.gov.USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service helps America's farmers and ranchers conserve the nation's soil, water, air and other natural resources.

In the U.S. alone, there are now 18,513 certified USDA organic operations, representing nearly a 245 percent increase since .  And there are over 25,000 certified organic operations in more than 120 different countries around the world.\nEach year, the National Organic Program (NOP), part of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service, publishes the official list of certified operations. Through this online tool, you can search to see whether an operator is certified, find certified farms and operators in a particular state, or get a list of certified operators that produce a specific product.  The listed in the database is also available for download in Excel format going back to .\nThe newly released shows that the largest number of U.S. certified organic operations remain on the west coast, in New England, and in the upper Midwest. The also shows an increased rate of domestic growth of about 4 percent throughout U.S. regions, resuming previous trends.\nInternationally, there appears to be a decrease in the number of operations in areas with equivalency agreements, because operations in those countries no longer need dual certification. By minimizing duplication of certifications, equivalence agreements can provide great cost-saving for even the smallest of producers.\nThe database increases the transparency and integrity of the organic system, allowing consumers and stakeholders to search for information pertaining to organic certification, and increases the NOP’s oversight ability of accredited certifiers. It provides a way to identify and connect organic stakeholders across the supply chain.\nThrough the NOP, USDA has helped farmers and businesses create an industry that has grown to $35 billion annually in U.S. retail sales. USDA has a number of new and expanded efforts to connect organic farmers and businesses with resources that will ensure the continued growth of the organic industry domestically and abroad.  We help organic stakeholders access programs that support conservation, provide access to loans and grants, fund organic research and education, and mitigate pest emergencies.\nThe new Agricultural Act of (Farm Bill) includes provisions that will make a big difference to the organic community, including additional funding to assist organic producers and handlers with the cost of organic certification, and funding to improve the NOP’s certified operations database and technology systems. Greater Federal support could mean even more organic farms and production in the U.S. to meet continued growth in consumer demand.  Additional information about USDA resources and support for the organic sector is available on the USDA Organics Resource page.\nThe list of certified organic operations reflects the continued increase in domestic operations.

And that’s good news for housing as much-needed capital enters America’s recovering housing market.\nUSDA Rural Development is proud of our effort to help re-energize housing.  Last year, in addition to our refinancing efforts, the agency also helped more than 153,000 individuals and families in rural areas obtain safe, affordable homes through our single-family direct and guaranteed loan programs. And Rural Development helped bring safe, affordable multi-family housing to more than 270,000 low- and very-low-income families, thanks to $904.7 million in rental assistance to bring rents to an affordable level.\nAt USDA, our work builds upon the efforts of the Obama Administration to help responsible borrowers and strengthen the housing market. Due to expansion of the USDA refinancing program, residents in 35 jurisdictions can pursue lower monthly mortgage costs.  The original states in the two-year pilot program are Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Tennessee.\nI strongly encourage every homeowner in participating states with a USDA Single Family Guaranteed or Direct loan to learn more about the program and see if it can help them by contacting their local Rural Development office.  For a list of state offices, please visit: \n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Alaska\n Arkansas\n Colorado\n Idaho\n Kansas\n Missouri\n Montana\n North Dakota\n Oklahoma\n Puerto Rico\n RD\n Single-Family Housing Guaranteed and Direct Programs\n South Dakota\n Tammy Trevino\n Texas\n Utah\n Washington\n West Virginia\n Wisconsin",

USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) ensures that benefits are as convenient and easy to use as possible, however, historically there have been challenges when it comes to connecting participants with local farmers. Fortunately, modern technologies and innovative solutions have emerged to bridge this gap. By embracing online purchasing and mobile payment systems, FNS is creating a more efficient, inclusive, and mutually beneficial relationship between SNAP participants and farmers.\nThanks to a partnership between USDA and the National Association of Farmers Market Nutrition Programs (NAFMNP), direct marketing farmers are now able to accept SNAP payment online. The first direct marketing farmer enabled to accept SNAP online is River Queen Greens, a vegetable farm in New Orleans, Louisiana. SNAP online payments increase accessibility for River Queen Greens customers. “Having the capability for SNAP online payments makes the purchasing process much more seamless,” said co-owner Annie Moore.\nUntil recently, accepting SNAP payment online was an option primarily available for traditional brick and mortar retailers. As a result of the partnership with NAFMNP, SNAP participants can now purchase produce online from participating local farmers for pick-up or delivery. NAFMNP MarketLink’s Online SNAP solution will help small farmers attract new SNAP customers while providing SNAP participants with better access to fresh, locally grown produce. A win-win for all parties involved!\nThousands of direct marketing farmers apply for SNAP authorization each year. As part of our ongoing support for these farmers, USDA recently opened the competition for the Mobile Application Cooperative Agreement for SNAP Farmers and Markets. Through this grant, up to $4 million in funding will be provided to up to two grantees over a three-year period. The grantees will provide technical assistance to direct marketing farmers selling at farmers’ markets, roadside stands, or pick-your-own operations, who wish to become SNAP authorized and enable them to use their mobile phone to conduct transactions. As with past grants, farmers marketing directly to consumers would continue to be provided with a mobile app and a card reader to accept SNAP payments using their mobile phone. The current grant competition is open for applications between July 6-September 5, .\nUSDA is also helping SNAP participants access more healthy foods from local producers. The SNAP Healthy Incentives Programs encourage healthier eating by incentivizing the purchase of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy foods at participating retailers, including at farmers’ markets. To find out how your local farmers market can participate in an incentive program, you may visit the SNAP Healthy Incentives page.\nFor more information about the SNAP Online Purchasing program and the full list of retailers approved to provide SNAP online purchasing, visit the SNAP Online webpage.

The agreement seeks also to explore new collaborative projects to help protect and restore the species throughout the 15 million acre region surrounding Yellowstone National Park.\n“We need a landscape-scale approach to large scale issues like this.  The Forest Service has a lot to offer with land management, science and landowner services all under one roof.  Yet, working with other federal agencies can help us address problems more efficiently and effectively,” said Dave Cleaves, U.S. Forest Service climate change advisor.\nWhitebark pines grow in the very highest reaches of the Greater Yellowstone Area and scientists consider them a foundation species because they create conditions necessary for other plants and animals to survive in an Alpine region where winters are long and bitterly cold. The pines also produce a calorie-rich nut that several keystone animal species in the region including grizzly bears, red squirrels and Clark’s nutcrackers, depend upon to survive the long and bitterly cold winters that are a hallmark of the Greater Yellowstone Area.\nThe whitebark pine plays and important role in clean drinking water as the sheer size of the tree also helps maintain watersheds. In winter its bulk serves as natural snow fences, and in spring that same bulk helps shield the resulting snow banks from the sun, thus allowing for a relatively slow and even snow melt.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Forestry\n FS\n Gallatin and Teton National Forests\n Shoneshone\n Yellowstone",

The ten regional USDA Climate Hubs were established to synthesize and translate climate science and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers that are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA's Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate.\nYou might have noticed spring-like weather in the Northeast is arriving earlier than usual.  There is reliable evidence from many studies that conditions in the Northeast and upper Midwest have become warmer and wetter in recent decades, especially before the coming of winter and spring.  The spring-like warmth has snow melting faster and plant growth starting sooner.  On average, the last spring frost in the Northeast is about a week earlier now than it was 30 years ago.  The change is not as positive as one might expect since the start of growth for many plants has shifted even earlier than the last frost date leading to increased chances of frost damage.  This happens most often when unusually warm temperatures in March are followed within 2-5 weeks by a frost event.  In , record high March temperatures were followed by record low temperatures (for the date) at the end of April with terrible consequences for fruit growers across Michigan, Ontario, New York, Vermont, and surrounding states.  In some places losses were almost total.  In something of a repeat, unusual warmth in the Northeast this past winter was interrupted by very cold outbreaks in mid-February and early April.  This combination was particularly bad for peaches in New Jersey, Connecticut, parts of New York, and other northeastern states where greater than 90% losses have been reported.\n Dave Hollinger, Director, USDA Northeast Climate Hub\n Posted in\n May 16, \n Respond to this story",

The stump is part of a huge forest that was buried in a volcanic eruption 50 million years ago. (U.S. Forest Service photo)\nImagine nearing the remote, rugged crest of the Gallatin Range in Montana’s Gallatin National Forest. As you scramble up-slope, you put your hand against what appears to be a lightning-blasted stump for balance. But the stump is not weather-polished wood—it’s made of stone.\nThese are the 50-million-year-old remains of redwoods, pines and sycamores which make up the Gallatin Petrified Forest, where fossilized tree trunks are preserved in so much detail that cellular structures may be seen under a microscope and growth rings are often visible to the naked eye. But how did these trees turn to stone?\nTransport yourself back to the Eocene epoch, when a 9,200-foot volcano rose ominously out of a forested valley. A thin, dark plume of steam and ash shoots up from the angry crater.  The 3-foot-thick trunks of mature redwood trees in the valley swayed and heavier branches crack and fall from the stress of earth tremors that become increasingly violent over a period of weeks. Suddenly, with a wrenching ground spasm and booming roar, the plume morphs into a thick roiling column of ash and volcanic ejecta that rockets 19 miles up into the stratosphere, spilling outward as it rises. The fallout coalesces into a thick debris cloud that spreads across the horizon in only minutes, turning day into night. Massive quantities of charged volcanic particles inject into the atmosphere generating a near-continuous series of lightning flashes accompanied by peals of deafening thunder.\nVolcanic ash fall begins to pour from the sky at rates up to a foot an hour. Torrential rains join the ash fall, and flowing slurries of ash and coarse volcanic debris—which had eroded from the steep slopes of nearby inactive volcanoes—quickly choke off stream channels crossing the forested valley.\nViscous floodwater slurries of volcanic sediment overtop natural levees and sweep inexorably across the forest floor, depositing thick layers of coarse sediment while airborne volcanic debris shower down. Heavy, wet volcanic ash strip trees of their foliage and branches. The vegetation, rooted in place, is doomed.\nAs the eruption tapers to a halt, a once lush, verdant forest transforms into an eerily silent, sterile, bleak gray landscape. The naked boles of dead tree trunks poke out of a thick blanket of volcanic debris. Mineral-saturated groundwater circulates through the volcanic sediments, where the buried trunks already begin to absorb silica molecules into their pores, initiating the process of fossilization which will continue for millennia.\nBut, nature is resilient even in the face of catastrophic geological forces, and within months, seeds and spores of pioneer plant species borne by the wind and the droppings of birds flying overhead settle and germinate in the nutrient-rich volcanic soils.  Within a decade the plain is covered in grasses—small clusters of young trees and shrubs beginning to poke above. The surrounding volcanos remain dormant, and within 25 years as patches of woodland develop, the forest’s rebirth is well underway.\nSeven hundred years later, a new forest emerges to the same majestic grandeur as its predecessor buried below. Suddenly, a new volcanic plume arises against the horizon and the earth tremors again—a cycle that would repeat more than 24 times in the Greater Yellowstone area.\nToday, you can visit this ancient forest. Stop by one of the Gallatin National Forest offices for directions and to obtain a permit allowing the collection of a small sample of petrified wood from the Special Management Zone. Small pieces that are loose on the ground are suitable for collection, but petrified trunks preserved in place must not be damaged or disturbed.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n forest\n Forestry\n fossil\n FS\n Gallatin\n Montana\n volcano\n wood",

Selecting the right USDA grade of beef for your dish will help guarantee culinary success. Click to see a larger version.\nGrilling season is upon us.  It’s time to enjoy that wonderful smell of meat cooking across neighborhood backyards. With so many choices available at your store and meat counter, choosing the best cut of meat for your dish can be overwhelming. With a bit of beef knowledge, you can avoid that problem, and be the king or queen of the barbeque.\nWe’ve covered the basics of USDA beef grades, explaining the difference between USDA Prime, Choice or Select. This time around, we’re going to look at the marbling – or fine threads of fat – within different grades of meat.  Marbling is what gives beef its flavor, juiciness and tenderness.  USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) employs 200 highly-skilled beef graders who, sometimes with the help of electronic monitoring, evaluate several factors that determine the grade, including the amount and distribution of marbling.\nSelecting the right USDA grade of beef for your dish will help guarantee your culinary success.  When beef is cooked, the degree of tenderness is mostly dependent on the amount of fat in the meat.  USDA Prime beef has the highest marbling score or fat content, followed by USDA Choice. USDA Select has only slight marbling.\nBeef cuts with less marbling, such as USDA Select, can be cooked on the grill just like USDA Choice or USDA Prime grades but may need to be monitored a little closer and cooked a little less to keep it as tender as possible.  Cuts with more marbling, such as USDA Prime, may be grilled with high heat to a medium or medium rare for excellent results in flavor and tenderness.  Certain cuts, such as the tenderloin (filet) and top blade (flat iron), may naturally be more tender –regardless of the degree of marbling or the USDA grade.\nThe USDA grade shields are regarded as symbols of quality American beef.  Large-volume buyers such as grocery stores, military institutions, restaurants, and even foreign governments use the quality grades as a “common language” within the beef industry, making business transactions easier.  The shields also mean you can shop with confidence, knowing that your beef will have the quality and consistency that you count on to make your dishes delicious.\nThe next time you visit the supermarket or your favorite steak house, apply your beefed up knowledge on marbling, tenderness and grades to grill your beef to perfection!\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n AMS\n beef\n beef grades\n Food Preparation\n grading\n grading shields\n Grilling\n Infographic\n labels\n marbling\n Standards\n USDA Choice\n USDA Prime\n USDA Select\n USDA tender",

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nAs a boy, Steven Cannon helped his grandfather in the garden grafting fruit trees, all the while developing an interest in plants. As an adult, Cannon has followed in his grandfather’s footsteps, working with USDA as a scientist—but only after first taking a different, though ultimately, complementary career path.\nAfter graduating college, Cannon worked various jobs, including one as an educational software designer that used his knack for computing.  In , he rekindled his early interest in plant biology, earning a PhD and practical experience as a postdoctoral researcher assigned to a genome mapping project. In , he accepted a position as a plant geneticist with the USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Corn Insects and Crop Genetics Research Unit in Ames, Iowa.\nCannon didn’t simply cast aside his love of computing for his new career in plant genetics, however. Instead, he combined his two interests—so successfully, in fact, that on December 23, , he was named as a recipient of the Presidential Early-Career Award for Scientists and Engineers by President Obama.\nSince joining ARS, Cannon has hit the ground running, with significant contributions in projects to sequence the genetic code, or genome, of soybean, chickpea, and other legume crops that underpin the health and wellbeing of consumers worldwide.\nCannon’s computer skills proved valuable—from working with a team to improve SoyBase, a popular Internet resource among plant breeders and scientists, to successfully leading the Legume Information System Web site redesign, another online tool used by researchers worldwide.\nCannon’s fascination with plants that he cultivated as a boy has translated into important findings today about the evolutionary “road” that legumes have taken over the past 60 million years or so—particularly their relationship with root bacteria that turn nitrogen into forms that help them grow.\nCannon and colleagues’ efforts is geared toward fostering developing new, improved legume varieties to better meet humankind’s increasing global need for food, feed, fiber, and fuel.\n“We need to make faster progress in crop improvement and the best way of doing that is by knowing where important traits and genes reside,” says Cannon. “Whatever we learn about soybean is going to be useful in these other crops and vice versa.”\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n ARS\n Iowa\n Plant biology\n plants\n President Obama\n Presidental Award\n Science Tuesday",

Pendleton, Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Rural Development, Montana in\n Rural\n Oct 25, \nLast Chance Café manager Peggy Tobin shows off a homemade apple pie baked by a volunteer co-op member. \nIt is an iconic fixture of rural America – the local diner. Not just a restaurant, but a social hub for a community, and when the local café in Sunburst, Montana closed in it seemed one more nail in the coffin of a small town facing decline.\nJust over one hundred miles north of Great Falls, Montana along Interstate 15, and only nine miles south of the Canadian border you’ll find Sunburst, population 400. Much had changed and disappeared from Sunburst since the closing of a local refinery in the early seventies and now the loss of the café left the community with no family-friendly place to eat. Sure the local bar had bar food, and there were chicken fingers and corn dogs at the deli counter of the grocery store, but a place to sit down for a cup of coffee, conversation, and a good meal was gone – possibly for good.\nBy , local resident Peggy Tobin and some fellow community members started to explore options to bring their hometown café to life once more. They initially dismissed the idea of a cooperative, thinking it only applied to phones and electricity – but upon speaking with Brian Gion, Executive Director of the Montana Cooperative Development Center in Great Falls, plans began for the formation of a community cooperative to operate the Last Chance Café.\nFunded through the Rural Cooperative Development Grant program from USDA Rural Development, Montana Cooperative Development Center has assisted 123 entities and guided the formation of 37 cooperatives since its inception in . The reopening of the café as a cooperative has provided more than just jobs for the local residents. “It wouldn’t work without our volunteers,” said Tobin. “We have ladies coming in to bake pies and breads for the restaurant, or just to clean dishes and tidy up the place. It’s become a great opportunity for folks to get out and be active, and help support local businesses here in Sunburst.”\nProviding the equivalent of three full-time jobs, a project this size might seem inconsequential in the larger economic picture, but for Sunburst it’s a focal point for the community. New development is on the horizon through a wind power project, and a newly-opened U.S. Border Patrol station has brought more life into the town. With a year of operation under their belt, Tobin and her partners are proud of what they’ve accomplished at the Last Chance Café. “We have people driving all the way here from Great Falls just for our clam chowder [every other Friday night] and our homemade pies. It seems we’re getting a bit of a name for ourselves, and we’re thrilled to have the customers.”\nAs we recognize National Cooperative Month, it is appropriate to applaud the hard work of the Montana Cooperative Development Center, and the determination of the Last Chance Café cooperative in Sunburst, Montana.

USDA’s summer meal programs – the Summer Food Service Program and Seamless Summer Option – reduce food and nutrition insecurity and help ensure kids are healthy and ready to learn when they return to school in the fall. Nationwide, thousands of dedicated organizations sponsor summer meal programs and work tirelessly to offer high quality meals that are appealing and nutritious.\nThe Turnip the Beet Award showcases summer meal sponsors that go above and beyond to serve kids appetizing, high-quality meals. Recently, the Food and Nutrition Service recognized 98 summer meal sponsors with Gold, Silver or Bronze awards for going the extra mile in . The complete list of Turnip the Beet Award Winners can be found on the Food and Nutrition Service website.\nIf you know a summer meal sponsor in your area that’s excelling at serving kids, nominate them for a Turnip the Beet Award through this Turnip the Beet nomination form!\nLooking ahead to summer , we look forward to better serving kids in rural areas, thanks to legislation passed by Congress. Historically, the on-site, group feeding requirement for summer meals has been a barrier for some rural communities trying to connect kids with healthy meals. The challenges include the lack of transportation, centrally located facilities to host a site, and funds to support enrichment activities – to name a few.\nNow, approved summer meal sites in certain rural areas can distribute meals to kids without requiring them to be served in a group setting. This means program operators can use alternative models to better meet their communities’ needs. For example, instead of serving in-person meals, an approved school or library could potentially allow families to pick up a week’s-worth of meals for their children.\nThese flexible meal service options are monumental wins in the fight to end childhood hunger and they’re expected to benefit nearly eight million children in rural areas.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Nutrition Security\n Rural\n Tags:\n Food and Nutrition Service\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n Nutrition\n Summer Meals\n Summer Food Service Program\n Seamless Summer Option\n Turnip the Beet\n You May Also Like\n SNAP-Ed Connects Culture, Land, and Food\n Healthier Foods, Healthier Minds\n National Women’s History Month: Celebrating FNS’ Unsung Heroines",

On their own, mushrooms are pretty healthful – very low in calories, free of cholesterol and (almost) free of fat. They are also naturally low in sodium, high in potassium, and are generally high in vitamins and minerals.\nStuffing mushrooms just makes something wonderful ever better!  But what you stuff in these tasty little vegetables can make or break the dish. Typically, mushrooms are stuffed with foods containing saturated fats and sodium. So, if you’re trying to watch one or both of these in the New Year, consider various herbs and spices!\nHerbs and spices do a nice job of seasoning many of my favorite foods. When I decided long ago to reduce my intake of saturated fats, I knew that my taste buds would miss the flavors of these fats and the foods that contain them, but I didn’t want to settle for a bland diet. So, I invested in several healthy cookbooks and read (and reread) the chapters on herbs and spices. The results have been quite impressive.\nThey say that “variety is the spice of life,” but I like to think that “spices add variety to life.” Along with the spices came exciting and unlimited flavor combinations. Now, I choose whatever suits my mood. (Is there anything more inviting than a kitchen that smells of sautéed fresh rosemary?)\nStart adding more flavor to your plate in and you’ll see what I mean.

Photo credit: USDA Forest Service\nThe U.S. Geological Survey estimates that several million earthquakes occur in the world each year. Some, such as the devastating earthquake in Nepal and the series of earthquakes that destroyed infrastructure, homes and communities in Christchurch, New Zealand in , capture global attention.\nAfter natural disasters such as these, rebuilding a city needs to be efficient and cost-effective, with an eye towards resilience in the face of future disasters. Engineered wood building systems like glulam and cross laminated timber, also known as CLT, are well suited to meet these needs as they are often prefabricated offsite and can be quickly installed. That helps communities bounce back from disaster in a shorter time frame while minimizing waste. Furthermore, just as trees flex in high winds, timber structures flex in earthquakes, placing wood construction systems at the forefront of seismic design for resilience.\nCLT is relatively new to North America, having first gained popularity in Europe. CLT panels are typically constructed by laminating three or more layers of lumber together, with each layer perpendicular to the neighboring layer to create a solid wood panel. These panels are a renewable building material that is strong and versatile, and utilize smaller wood elements from sustainably managed forests.\nMany of our nation’s forests have become overstocked as a result of past fire suppression policies.  Today, the U.S. Forest Service is working with partners to remove small diameter trees, restoring the density and composition of our forests to better support natural fire regimes and provide benefits that we rely on, including clean water, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities. Using the byproducts of these restoration treatments creates viable markets for smaller trees, decreasing the cost of forest restoration treatments and creating jobs in rural and urban areas along each stage of the supply chain.\nTo promote the adoption of innovative wood building technologies, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is sponsoring the U.S. Tall Wood Building Prize Competition in partnership with the Softwood Lumber Board and the Binational Softwood Lumber Council.  This competition showcases the architectural and commercial viability of advanced wood products in tall-building construction, growing this emerging market and ultimately supporting employment opportunities in rural communities, maintaining the health and resiliency of U.S. forests, and advancing sustainability in the built environment.\nAdditionally, USDA is working to stimulate demand for forest products and expand the use of wood in building through research into innovative ways to use wood and fiber. The U.S. Forest Service Forest Products Laboratory, based in Madison, Wisconsin, has been an integral part of developing safe and sustainable products, including different applications for engineered wood products like CLT. Part of Forest Service Research & Development, the FPL has invested over $2 million in research and technical support for the use of wood as a green building material for housing developments and other building projects.\nOne facet of this research, spearheaded by FPL researcher Bob Falk, is looking to enhance human safety in the face of tornados.  Each year in the U.S., tornadoes results in more than 80 deaths and 1,500 injuries. Through the development of a “Do-It-Yourself” tornado safe room that can be constructed by anyone with basic construction skills using innovative wood products, the research has the potential to greatly reduce casualties associated with these natural disasters.\nIn early April, Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the award of over $9 million awarded to expand and accelerate wood energy and other wood product markets. These federal funds will leverage $22 million in investments from partners, resulting in a total investment of $31 million in 23 states.\nThis post is part of a series featuring the Forest Service’s work on restoration across the country.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n disasters\n Europe\n Forest Products Laboratory\n Forestry\n Forests\n FS\n ModernUSDA\n Nepal\n New Zealand\n Research\n restoration\n Tom Vilsack\n U.S. Geological Survey\n Wisconsin\n wood",

Reflects July 10, U.S. (click to enlarge)\nOn July 11, USDA’s World Agricultural Outlook Board cut the estimate for the U.S. corn crop by 1.82 billion bushels to “reflect expected impacts of persistent and extreme June and early-July dryness and heat across the central and eastern Corn Belt.”  The 12% cut, which left the projected U.S. corn production at 12.97 billion bushels, is a direct result of the nation’s worst drought in a generation—since . Yesterday, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack also announced that more than 1,000 counties across in 26 states would be designated as disaster areas due to the worsening drought.\nAccording to the July 10 U.S. Drought Monitor, 78% of the U.S. corn was within an area experiencing drought.  Drought-free sections of the Midwest are currently restricted to parts of western Iowa and the northern tier of the Corn Belt.\nDuring the next several days, a deep pool of atmospheric moisture over the southeastern U.S. will continue to focus drought-easing rainfall in that part of the country.  Additional rainfall totals of two to four inches can be expected from the western Gulf Coast region into the Tennessee Valley.  However, very little rain is forecast to spread north of the Ohio River, which will continue leave much of the Corn Belt in desperate need of moisture.  Some late-week rain will occur across the upper Midwest, although totals will be generally less than an inch.  During the next several days, high temperatures above 90°F will be common across the Midwest, and readings may approach 100°F in the southern Corn Belt.\nFor more USDA weather and climate information, visit our weather and climate page.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n climate\n drought\n Natural Disaster\n OCE\n weather\n weather update",

Provided the by U.S. Forest Service. \nWeather….  We all care about it. In many communities, local TV and radio weather forecasters are celebrities, and for good reason.  While we can’t do much about the weather, it affects us all every day.\nDuring last week’s Agricultural Outlook Forum two sessions drew exceptionally large crowds.  One was the Friday afternoon “Weather and Agriculture” segment and another was the morning “Markets and Weather” presentation.  While no one can say for sure what the weather outlook will be for the summer growing season, Brad Rippey, agricultural meteorologist with USDA’s Office of the Chief Economist (OCE), Eric Luebehusen, OCE ag. meteorologist and Anthony Artusa, meteorologist with the Climate Protection Section of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration made some observations and predictions in the afternoon session.  The snowpack in the West’s Sierra Nevada is far below normal.  The Western winter wet season has been a bust, with winter precipitation less than 10 percent of average in some areas.  California, the Great Basin and southern Great Plains are in drought.  The meteorologists said California, the lower gulf coast and much of New Mexico, Arizona and Texas could see above normal temperatures and below normal precipitation in March, April and May.  According to Rippey, “We need a miracle March in to avoid major problems in California.”  The most current information is available through NOAA’s Seasonal Drought Outlook map and the USDA drought monitor.\nThe morning session featured a discussion on ways producers and forest owners can increase resilience to climate variability.  Filling in for a speaker who was forced to cancel because of a snowstorm, Dr. Carolyn Olson of the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) discussed how soil texture matters in times of drought.  “Good soils produce good yield,” but as importantly, good soil has increased water holding capacity.  Additionally, conservation practices like cover cropping increase the ability of soil to retain water and increase resilience to climate change.  Adam Chambers, with the NRCS Air Quality and Atmospheric Change Team in Portland, Oregon, outlined practices that can increase the sequestration of carbon and reduce greenhouse gasses.  “Can we produce more food, fiber and fuel while also increasing conservation?  I think we can,” he said.  He talked about how the agriculture sector is a leader in the areas of water conservation and nutrient management, and that more producers are working voluntarily to keep more carbon in the ground.  Working with organizations like Ducks Unlimited by providing Conservation Innovation Grants, and setting up carbon credit trading systems, he said, USDA can move the effort forward.\nFinally, Bill Hohenstein, director of the USDA Office of Global Climate Change outlined the Secretary’s recent announcement of the creation of seven regional climate hubs, to act as an information storehouse for producers, and repositories of scientific on climate change. More information about climate hubs and USDA’s efforts to assist producers facing the challenges of climate change is available here.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Research and Science\n Technology\n Tags:\n Adam Chambers\n Agricultural Outlook Forum\n Anthony Artusa\n Bill Hohenstein\n climate\n Dr. Carolyn Olson\n drought\n Environment\n Eric Luebehusen\n NRCS\n OCE\n weather",

Photo by J. Grogan\nThis post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nThe very name mahogany is synonymous with luxury and sophistication. This beautiful wood has been traded internationally since the Spanish discovered natural forests around during colonization of Mexico and Central America. Mahogany is more than a pretty plank – its strength, light weight, resistance to rot, and structural stability made it an ideal timber for ocean-going vessels as well as furniture. Mahogany also occupies an important position in the ecosystem insofar as it is a large tree that emerges above the forest canopy. Many other species depend on it for habitat and survival.\nSadly, mahogany’s great value has also been its undoing over the past half century or so as modern industrial logging techniques made it commercially viable to extract mahogany from primary forests hundreds of miles from the nearest village or town in the Amazon Basin.\n“The future of mahogany as we know it depends on whether sustainable harvest systems can be designed for natural forests where mahogany still survives, especially in South America,” said field ecologist Jimmy Grogan, whose mahogany research has been funded by the Forest Service through the Institute of Tropical Forestry since .\nTo assist forest managers in sustaining timber production of mahogany from natural forests so the species may continue to benefit current and future generations, Grogan and his colleagues developed the Big-Leaf Mahogany Growth & Yield Model that simulates logging and then “grows” populations between harvests according to demographic algorithms constructed from 15 years of annual census in Brazil.\nThe model simulates actual mahogany populations in Brazil. Once the population is in the model, it is programmed with several rules or parameters, such as the number of years between harvests, the minimum legal cutting diameter (currently 60 cm in Brazil), the percentage of commercial-sized trees that must be retained after logging for regeneration purposes, and the minimum density of commercial trees below which logging is not allowed.\nGrogan’s work also receives generous support from Brazilian timber companies that own the sites where he and his colleagues conduct their research.\nThe Big-Leaf Mahogany Growth & Yield Model was built from demographic published in scientific journals over the past decade.

While at the market, Dean met with the market manager, FoodWIse, the Milwaukee Farmers Market Coalition, other community partners, and the farmers who play a critical role in increasing access to fresh, local produce.\nEvery Fondy project is community-driven and leverages existing networks to support local producers and entrepreneurs to meet the needs of the community. Several years ago, Fondy saw farmers, primarily HMoob farmers, dropping out of farming. The reason? Many didn’t have access to quality land or stable long-term leases. With several sources of USDA funding, including the Community Food Projects Competitive Grants Program (CFPCGP) and Environmental Quality Incentive Program, the organization launched the Fondy Farm Project.\nThrough the project, 40 acres of long-term, high-quality leased land became available to the historically underserved farmers who grow food for Milwaukee area residents. Long-term land access allowed farmers, many of whom identify as HMoob, to invest in their farms and serve diverse customers by growing culturally relevant crops without a fear of losing their land. The CFPCGP also provided capacity-building equipment, allowing producers to grow and process more food.\nIt was inspiring to learn that the market’s farmers are seeing an increase in SNAP purchases, due in part to a nutrition incentive program - Milwaukee Market Match. The match program is run by Fondy with support from FoodWIse, a SNAP Ed partner, which also delivers nutrition education at the market. FoodWIse supports the Milwaukee Farmers Market Coalition, which works towards policy, systemic, and environmental changes to establish and maintain inclusive SNAP/EBT programs at multiple markets across Milwaukee. This important program not only stretches the purchasing power of SNAP recipients, but increases their intake of fruits and vegetables.

USDA photo by Bob Nichols.\nThe word “agriculture” does not usually come to mind when one thinks of forests, but perhaps it’s time that it should.\n“The forest products industry employs nearly 1 million people and contributes $254 billion to America’s economy through sales and payroll,” said Eric Norland, a national program leader at USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).\nIn addition to the well-publicized environmental benefit trees have in mitigating the effects of climate change, forests are economically and socially important to individuals and communities. Trees also play an increasingly important role in sustainable energy, including fueling aircraft.\nAccording to Norland, more than 10 million family forest owners account for 262 million acres of the nation’s 751 million acres of forestland. Most of the wood that becomes construction lumber, furniture, paper, and other products comes from privately owned forests.\nNIFA’s Renewable Resources Extension Act (RREA) grants support Cooperative Extension programs that give practical information to help landowners sustain the forests that provide wood, wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration, clean and plentiful water, and other environmental and economic benefits to their local communities.\nNIFA’s forestry programs include research to understand the impacts of climate, drought, and insects on forests and education programs that train the next generation of natural resource scientists and land managers.\nOne example is the NIFA-funded project, the Ohio Woodland Stewards Program, managed by Ohio State University. The program focuses on providing woodland owners a variety of forestry skills. In , 612 landowners and natural resource professionals responsible for managing over 300,000 acres of woodland around the state attended workshops and other programs. The program’s website offers scores of publications with forest and related information.\nIn addition, NIFA is supporting research into silvopasture, the practice of combining forage plants, trees, and livestock. In this integrated system, trees provide shade and cooling for livestock, which in turn encourages forage growth. Eventually both the livestock and the trees go to market, potentially increasing profits for farmers.\nNIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n National Institute of Food and Agriculture\n NIFA\n Grants\n Ohio State University\n Ohio\n silvopasture\n bioenergy\n Forestry",

Did you know there are about 4,000 species of bees in North America and that one eighth of them have not even been named yet?\nDespite their importance, there has been little research on native bees. Much of what we know comes from before the ’s when collecting and studying insects was popular. Since there has been little research, we do not know if there have been wide spread declines in native bees like there have been with the non-native honeybees. Sam and other scientists and taxonomists are working together to create online identification guides for the bees of North America. You can find out more about this collaborative project at National Biological Information Infrastructure.\nDid you know that most of the native bees do not sting?  Only the few “colonial” bees (bees that form colonies) will sting and only if trapped or if their hive is attacked.  Most “bee” stings are in fact from wasps, like yellow jackets, not bees.  Sam noted that in general bees are vegetarians while wasps are meat eaters.  While bees are attracted to and pollinate flowers, wasps generally do not. Honeybees are important for agriculture since native bees are frequently not available around industrial farms.  The reason is that industrial farmland is devoid of the natural habitat native bees need.  Instead, beekeepers bring in beehives to provide pollination services. Another problem is that the pesticides used to eliminate insect pests in agricultural land also kill bees and other beneficial insects.  Because of the lack of research, we do not know the impact of pesticides on native bees or the honeybees. The presentation ended with a tour of the garden and Sam showing the attendees all the many bees peacefully pollinating the garden.\nThroughout the month of June, The People’s Garden is celebrating pollinators in honor of National Pollinator Week, June 21-27 with workshops and exhibits.

Earlier this afternoon, I joined Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy CEO Tom Gallagher to renew an historic agreement with the dairy industry to lower greenhouse gas emissions and to accelerate the adoption of innovative waste-to-energy projects on U.S. dairy farms which help producers diversify revenues and reduce utility expenses on their operations. Today's extension of the Memorandum of Understanding is an acknowledgement of the dairy industry's legacy of stewardship and its ongoing commitment to improve our farms.\nThis pact extends the agreement I signed during climate talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, in . Since then, millions of dollars have been awarded to the dairy industry for conservation improvements, grants, research, renewable energy and efficiency. Not only is this funding helping dairy producers make their operations more sustainable, it is also helping their bottom lines. Consumers are likely to increase dairy purchases if they believe dairy is environmentally friendly in addition to being nutritious, good-tasting and a good value.\nSince , USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service has provided funding that has helped more than 6,000 dairy farmers plan and implement conservation practices to improve sustainability. NRCS support for the dairy industry has resulted in 354 on-farm and in-plant energy audits as well as 18 conservation innovation grants for dairy-related projects during the past three years.\nUSDA support for agricultural and waste-to-energy research has played a key role in the agreement's success to date. Since signing the MOU, USDA has made nearly 180 awards that helped finance the development, construction, and biogas production of anaerobic digester systems with Rural Development programs, such as the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program, Value Added Producer Grants, amongst others. These systems capture methane and produce renewable energy for on-farm use and sale onto the electric grid. Additionally, during this period, USDA awarded approximately 140 REAP loans and grants to help dairy farmers develop other types of renewable energy and energy efficiency systems at their operations.\nThis agreement is a prime example of how the public and private sector are working with America's farmers and ranchers to take care of our planet. U.S. dairy producers are making great strides in sustainable practices and it is our job to continue to support them as excellent stewards of the land.\nWith the recent celebration of Earth Day, it is important to recognize the impressive efforts of our nation's dairy farmers. Dairy producers have taken a voluntary, proactive approach to conservation and thus serve as an exemplary model of the Obama Administration's overall energy priorities. I am confident that this agreement will help the dairy industry reach its long-term goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by .\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Energy\n Rural\n Tags:\n Conservation\n dairy\n Earth Day\n Energy\n NRCS\n President Obama\n REAP\n Rural Development\n Tom Vilsack\n VAPG",

(U.S. Forest Service)\nMany of us may think of the forest as a place to reflect upon times long past. There may even be a bit of nostalgia in those ruminations. Yet for members of the Round Valley Tribes, a recent walk through the Mendocino National Forest in California was more than a time to contemplate—it was a time to remember an agonizing event in history.\nThis autumn marked the 150th anniversary of the Nome Cult Walk, a forced relocation of 461 Native Americans from Chico, Calif., to the Nome Cult Reservation, near Covelo, Calif. Only 277 of those completed the forced march that passed through what is the heart of today’s Mendocino National Forest. Those who did not complete the journey were too sick to go on, some escaped, and others were killed.\nThe Nome Cult Walk was one of several military-enforced relocations of Native Americans throughout California in the mid-s. During those moves, Native Americans were not only taken from their tribal lands, but were also forced to live with many different tribes. Sometimes those people forced to live together had been longtime rivals. One result of the Nome Cult Walk relocation was the creation of the Round Valley Indian Tribes. This federally recognized tribe exists today and includes the Yuki, Wailacki, Concow, Little Lake Pomo, Nomlacki, Pit River, Maidu and Nissinan tribes.\nNearly two decades ago, descendants of the Nome Cult Walk began an annual commemoration of the forced relocation of their ancestors. September marked the 18th year that members of the Round Valley Indian Tribes retraced the original 100-mile route across the Sacramento Valley through the rugged North Coast Ranges. Three generations of Native Americans partook in this year’s tribute.\n“It is important that our youngest members take part in this annual event,” said Kenneth Wright, president of the Round Valley Indian Tribes. “The theme of the walk is ‘Honor Their Memory–A Path Not Forgotten.’”\nEduardo Olmedo (left), Grindstone District Ranger, and Kenneth Wright, Round Valley Indian Tribes President, enjoy the shade after a morning of hiking the Nome Cult trail on the Mendocino National Forest. (U.S. Forest Service/Denise Adamic)\nNot all of the participants hiked — some offered moral support, made camp, or cooked meals for the walkers. At the culmination of the weeklong event, the entire group descended into Covelo for various celebrations sponsored by the Round Valley Indian Tribes. The closing celebrations served as a meaningful way to end the week of remembrance.\n“While the Nome Cult Trail is a tragic chapter in our state’s history, it is also a story about the resilience and strength of California Indians,” said Mendocino Forest Supervisor Sherry Tune. “It is an important legacy for their decedents and for all Californians.”\nNovember is Native American Heritage Month and the theme is “Guiding our destiny with heritage and tradition.  The Mendocino National Forest encompasses over 913,000 acres of rugged landscape in northwestern California, and is a three-hour drive north from San Francisco.

But that wasn’t the case about 20 years ago, after the Great Flood of ravaged the area. That summer, all of these ecosystems resembled a moonscape with most of the vegetation removed.\nIn the wake of the flood, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) offered easement purchases through its Emergency Wetlands Reserve Program to help landowners take frequently flooding cropland out of production and restore functional wetlands.\nIn Alexander County alone, landowners enrolled seven easements covering 3,089 acres. This compilation of easements forms a “contiguous piece of Mississippi River floodplain,” says Dave Hiatt, NRCS biologist, providing prime habitat for local wildlife as well as migrating wildlife.\n“Each easement connects a larger area that gives migrating birds a place to rest and feed before traveling on,” he says. “Located at the top of the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, this locale is now a major migration staging area.”\nThis map shows acres enrolled in EWRP in outlined in red.\nWetlands also help reduce damage from floods, contribute to groundwater recharge and carbon sequestration and provide recreational opportunities. They are among the most biologically diverse ecosystems in the world. Even during significant droughts like the one experienced in Illinois and other parts of the country this past year, wetland areas support wildlife and plant species.\nOnce a landowner places his or her land in a conservation easement with NRCS, he or she retains the title to the land and the right to control access and recreational use, and still pays taxes on the property.\nAlternatively, the landowner can sell the property. In this case, the U.S. Forest Service purchased 3,000 acres of land encumbered by easements from landowners in order to restore the wetlands, which are adjacent to the Shawnee National Forest.\nOther easements purchased in Alexander County over the past 20 years have added another 2,367 acres of wetlands to the Wetlands Reserve Program; nearby Union and Jackson counties have several easements totaling thousands of acres in NRCS programs.\nNRCS biologist Hiatt calls these wetlands a beautiful “string of pearls along the Mississippi.” These “pearls” help clean the water and support native flora and fauna that we can all enjoy for years.\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\nCheck out other conservation-related stories on the USDA blog.\nThe flood of created this 60-foot deep lake in one landowner’s crop field.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Conservation\n Mississippi\n NRCS\n Wetlands Reserve Program\n WRp",

(Click for the registration link)\nFor most people, water quality markets are probably a new concept. They are not something you hear about on the news every day, even though frequently cover the need to clean up rivers and lakes. But to some—like states, utilities, and farmers—they represent an opportunity, and should be on the radar.\nWater quality markets can reduce costs of cleaning up waterways by allowing sources with high costs of meeting water quality requirements to purchase credits from sources that have lower costs of making the same water quality improvement. Agricultural producers often have lower costs of improving water quality, which makes farmers and ranchers prime candidates to supply water quality credits.\nUSDA supports the participation of farmers, ranchers and forest landowners in water quality trading as a voluntary way to put more conservation on the ground, and improve water quality. The Department develops tools to calculate water quality benefits and resources on how to structure trading programs. Furthermore, the Department provides funding to support the development of water quality trading markets through NRCS Conservation Innovation Grants.\nAnd now, in partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency, USDA is offering the public an opportunity to learn more about water quality markets. The EPA-USDA Water Quality Markets Workshop is bringing a host of experts involved in water quality trading markets together to share their experiences and provide a wealth of information to those interested in starting or participating markets. The event will take place September 15-17 in Lincoln, Nebraska, and includes regional forums where participants can learn more about trading programs in their area.\nThe Workshop will do more than provide information—it will also highlight the history of collaboration on water quality trading within the federal government. USDA and EPA signed a partnership agreement in to work together on environmental markets, including water quality markets. Tools and resources developed under the agreement will be previewed at the Workshop, and participants will learn how they can apply to water quality planning and management.\nWorkshop participants will also get a taste of the larger partnership that has developed in support of water quality markets—including a look at the National Network on Water Quality Trading. The National Network is composed of representatives from agriculture, industry, state, and environmental groups from across the country working to help others develop and participate in water markets.  The National Network recently released Building a Water Quality Trading Program, which identifies common trading issues and the options, considerations, and examples important to developing a program.\nThere are plenty of reasons to attend next month’s Workshop—it will be an excellent forum to learn more about water quality markets.

(Photo credit: Midroc Property Development) \nCross-posted from the White House Rural Council: \nAs part of the Obama administration's commitment to mitigate climate change, USDA, in partnership with the Softwood Lumber Board and the Binational Softwood Lumber Council, is announcing the U.S. Tall Wood Building Prize Competition. This competitive prize, open to teams of architects, engineers, and developers, will showcase the architectural and commercial viability of advanced wood products like Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) in tall buildings.\nAdvanced wood products are becoming the latest innovation in tall building construction. Products like CLT are flexible, strong, and fire resistant. In construction, wood products can be used as a successful and sustainable alternative to concrete, masonry, and steel. Using wood also reduces greenhouse gas emissions by storing carbon and simultaneously offsetting emissions from conventional building materials. By some estimates, the near term use of CLT and other emerging wood technologies in buildings 7-15 stories could have the same emissions control affect as taking more than 2 million cars off the road for one year.\nWood can also help struggling rural forest communities. During the Recession, the drop in new construction and decline in home remodeling had a deep impact on wood manufacturing. However, if CLT and similar advanced wood products can penetrate just 5 - 15% of the non-residential North American market, that would mean roughly 0.8 - 2.4 billion board feet of lumber consumed annually. To put that in real-world context, roughly 35 jobs are created for each million board feet of wood processed.\nThe winner of the Tall Wood Building competition will receive support for incremental costs of pioneering wood construction techniques to address the engineering design and code variances needed to incorporate wood technologies into new building sites. The competition requires that the winning project team source a share of materials from rural, domestic manufacturers and domestic, sustainably managed forests in order to jumpstart new production and economic opportunities in rural America.\nThe launch of this competition is part of USDA's overall strategy to promote the use of wood as a green building material. In addition, the White House Rural Council hosted the Building With Wood: Jobs and the Environment workshop in March . USDA's Forest Service has also partnered with WoodWorks to provide outreach and technical support for architects and engineers of wood construction, supported a new commercial-scale CLT manufacturing facility in Columbia Falls, Montana, and invested more than $2 million in research and technical support for emerging wood technologies through the Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin.\nWood is a readily available and renewable building material that creates jobs and stimulates the economy. It can be used in urban or rural settings to build energy-efficient houses, buildings, and other needed infrastructure. It is successfully being used around the world and can help mitigate climate change.\nAs Secretary Vilsack said at the March Workshop, \"Wood may be one of the world's oldest building materials, but it is now also one of the most advanced.\" Additional information about the competition is available at www.tallwoodbuildingcompetition.org.

Students across the country are enjoying a healthier school environment with more nutritious options as a result of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act.  To address public concern about our nation’s obesity epidemic and our children’s current and future health, the updates significantly increased the amount of whole grains, low-fat dairy, fruits and vegetables in the meals, and set limits for sugars, fats and sodium.\nThese new standards have resulted in healthier meals for tens of millions of kids across the country.  The lead author of the study, Lindsey Turner, explained, “Our studies show that kids are okay with these changes, and that there have not been widespread challenges with kids not buying or eating the meals.”\nWe know that these types of changes in schools can have a positive impact on students.  Earlier research found that school-based programs that encourage healthy eating, physical activity and positive attitudes toward body image are among a range of interventions that can help reduce levels of childhood obesity.\nOur children’s ability to learn in the classroom, grow up healthy, and reach their fullest potential depends on what we do right now to secure their future.  And it appears as if they and their families are embracing this commitment.\nTo see how students, school and cafeteria personnel view the new meals standards, based on the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, view the video below:\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n HealthierNextGen\n Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act\n Janey Thornton\n National School Lunch Program\n NSLP\n Nutrition\n Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\n school meals",

Do you want to learn more about how to conserve as much as possible, while cultivating a thriving garden?\nThe Peoples' Garden at USDA was conceptualized to help Americans learn more about all things gardening -- and this summer, we're putting on weekly Healthy Garden Workshops to help everyone learn the ins and outs of a great garden.\nJuly 3 Kickoff Workshop\nAt the July 3 Healthy Garden Workshop, “Watering Your Lawn and Garden,” USDA experts offered a few of the scientific tricks to ensure that your plants and lawn get enough water, but not too much as well as how much water plants “drink” from the soil every week.\nFor example:\nIt helps to create a weekly watering plan, and to monitor the rainfall in your lawn/garden and subtract that amount of water from your weekly watering plan.\nPlants use approximately one inch of water from the soil each week during the summer growing season. Therefore, this amount needs to be replenished for plants to continue to grow and thrive. Depending on where we live, nature takes care of this for us by providing rain and we supplement with additional water as needed. Watering is a delicate balance for gardens. Too little water causes plants to wilt and die. Too much water means the plant cannot breathe; this can cause rotting and make the plant susceptible diseases.\nAnd that's just a sample. For more information about these tips, and to learn more about gardening, visit the the Peoples' Garden page.\nUpcoming Events\nAt tomorrow's Healthy Garden Workshop, you can learn about gardening in containers and window boxes (especially helpful for Americans living in cities and urban areas). The workshop will include discussion on finding the right container for the job, getting good soil, and nursing the container garden over time. Next week, on July 24, we'll show you techniques for weeding and removing invasive plants.\nAt both of these activities, a \"Sprouts\" workshop for kids will focus on a series of activities for children that demonstrate how the food system works, from farm to fork.\nIf you can't make a workshop, consider a garden tour -- they're held every Tuesday and Thursday at 1 p.m. at the Garden.

The Compost and Food Waste Reduction (CFWR) cooperative agreements, which are funded by the American Rescue Plan Act, are part of USDA’s broad support for urban agriculture through its Office of Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production (OUAIP). The projects will be implemented between and .\n“These Compost and Food Waste Reduction projects play important roles in building resilient, local food systems, including strong food recovery networks and food waste reduction solutions that benefit farmers and communities,” said Terry Cosby, Chief of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), which houses OUAIP. “With an estimated 4% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions attributable to uneaten food, local strategies and tools like these are important climate solutions.”\nUSDA prioritized projects that anticipate or demonstrate economic benefits, incorporate plans to make compost easily accessible to farmers, including community gardeners, integrate other food waste strategies, including food recovery efforts and collaborate with multiple partners.\nRecipients include projects in 27 states and one territory. Some highlights of recipients include:\n Geneva Compost and Food Waste Diversion, Town of Geneva, Geneva, N.Y. The project will involve a variety of partners to improve the environmental justice profile of Geneva by diverting food waste and other biodegradables from the waste stream, generating nutrient-rich compost, improving soil quality, reducing reliance on fertilizers, and engaging in food recovery efforts that take “extra” food and get it to community members in need.\n Composting and Food Waste Reduction Pilot Project, Tucson Unified School District, Tucson, Ariz. This pilot project will build the infrastructure needed to provide compost to school and community gardens, improve soil quality, reduce food waste, and demonstrate the economic benefits of including food reclamation education as an integral part of a school garden and nutrition programs for students, their families and the community of Tucson and Pima County, Arizona.\n Tlingit and Haida Compost Pilot Project, Central Council Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska, Juneau, Alaska. This pilot composting program will operate in conjunction with the Tribe’s newly constructed Taay Hít Greenhouse in Juneau that already generates fresh produce for its tribal citizens. The integrated composting and greenhouse program design is supported by Tlingit & Haida's Climate Change Adaptation Plan and Climate Change Action Plan, which identify food security and community greenhouse projects as priorities. Tlingit & Haida first incorporated agricultural science into a greenhouse operation by using the best growing practices to maximize sustainable food production and recently completed its first harvest from the Taay Hít Greenhouse, serving community elders a curry soup featuring bok choi, kale and cilantro.\n Miami-Dade County CFWR Pilot Project, Miami-Dade County, Miami, Fla. This project will implement a two-year pilot project to jump start a circular economy for food waste that aims to accelerate and scale the services of three small locally owned composting companies. The project will expand existing service capacity by 50% over one year, obtain a renewable 18-month pilot project permit, and develop a commercially viable compost product that can be used by Miami-Dade County’s Parks, Recreation, and Open Spaces Department to create a circular economy for food waste and compost that will reduce landfill food waste and replace chemical fertilizer.\nLearn more about Composting and Food Waste Cooperative Agreements at usda.gov/urban, and view a complete list of cooperative agreement recipients and project summaries.

Rather serendipitously, the mother saw information on line about USDA Rural Development housing programs. She made a call that changed their lives. As it turned out, the house that they eventually found and qualified for was part of a “green home” renovation in conjunction with other local agencies. The family was able to purchase their home with a loan direct from Rural Development, give their four children a stable home and neighborhood, and the home itself has proven to be so efficient that they are saving monthly on their utility bills.\nThe family received homebuyer education classes and credit counseling as part of the programs they participated in. The mother said “We are lucky to have found out about you! We have nothing but high praise for the process. Thank you for your dedication to helping families like ours purchase a home.”\nIn Yavapai County another Rural Development program has helped families transition into stable home situations and sometimes rescued them from homelessness. With this program non-profits are able to rent for $1 a year Non-Program Real Estate Owned (foreclosed) REO homes owned by Rural Development. During the ten year rental agreement, the non-profit uses the home as transitional housing. In Cottonwood, Arizona, a church entered into such an agreement with USDA nine years ago. Since then, they have helped five families. The church limits the time a family can stay to two years and during that time they provide the family with job training and credit counseling. They also charge a “rental fee” to the family. Rent is calculated based on the family’s income and expenses.\nThe rent that is received is used to do any repairs and upkeep, pay property taxes and insurance and any remaining amount is put into an escrow account for the family to use as a down payment when their two year rental agreement is up. According to the spokesman for the church, the tenants are also to put an additional 20 percent  above that rental amount into the account—a way to teach the value of saving.\nThe second family who lived in the home included a mother and her two children. The family was living in a homeless shelter before moving into the house. In the two years that they were in the home, they learned important life skills such as maintaining the property and making regular payments.\nWe built the houses that helped build this great nation after World War II. We helped build the communities and many of facilities and infrastructure that make them function. In the tradition of barn-raising, we have given these rural communities what they needed to help themselves. And they have shown their gratitude by working to ensure that their debts are repaid so we can help the next small town or rural resident in the same way we helped them.\nJune is homeownership month.  To read more about how USDA helps credit-worthy, limited income families achieve their homeownership goals click here. \n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Ariozona\n Cottonwood\n homeownership\n Homeownership Month\n Housing program\n Rural Development\n Yavapai County",

Zankowski, Senior Advisor for Plant Health and Production and Plant Products, Office of the Chief Scientist in\n Research and Science\n Aug 14, \nIndoor and vertical farming may be part of the solution to rising demands for food and limited natural resources. Photo credit: Oasis Biotech\nImagine walking into your local grocery store on a frigid January day to pick up freshly harvested lettuce, fragrant basil, juicy sweet strawberries, and ripe red tomatoes – all of which were harvested at a local farm only hours before you’d arrived. You might be imagining buying that fresh produce from vertical farms where farmers can grow indoors year-round by controlling light, temperature, water, and oftentimes carbon dioxide levels as well. Generally, fresh produce grown in vertical farms travels only a few miles to reach grocery store shelves compared to conventional produce, which can travel thousands of miles by truck or plane.\nBeyond providing fresh local produce, vertical agriculture could help increase food production and expand agricultural operations as the world’s population is projected to exceed 9 billion by . And by that same year, two out of every three people are expected to live in urban areas. Producing fresh greens and vegetables close to these growing urban populations could help meet growing global food demands in an environmentally responsible and sustainable way by reducing distribution chains to offer lower emissions, providing higher-nutrient produce, and drastically reducing water usage and runoff.\nRecently, USDA and the Department of Energy held a stakeholder workshop focused on vertical agriculture and sustainable urban ecosystems. At this workshop, field experts shared thought-provoking presentations followed by small group discussions focusing on areas such as plant breeding, pest management, and engineering. Workshop attendees from public and private sectors worked together to identify the challenges, needs, and opportunities for vertical farming. A report on this workshop will be released to help inform Departmental strategic planning efforts for internal research priorities at USDA and external funding opportunities for stakeholders and researchers.\nWe’re excited about the potential opportunities vertical agriculture presents to address food security. That’s why USDA already has some of these funding and research opportunities in place. The National Institute for Food and Agriculture has funding opportunities (, 1.22 ) that could support future vertical agriculture conferences and research. Similarly, the Agricultural Research Service is working on a project to increase U.S. tomato production and quality in greenhouses and other protected-environments. We look forward to continuing our partnership with our customers, both internal and external.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Office of the Chief Scientist\n National Institute of Food and Agriculture\n NIFA\n Agricultural Research Service\n ARS\n Department of Energy\n vertical farming",

On my family’s Illinois farm, we relied on both paid and unpaid friends and family to bring in our hay.   Nearby farmers however relied on seasonal migrant labor to harvest vegetables. \nToday I’m a statistician overseeing the analyses and publication of environmental, economic and demographic on U.S. agriculture.  In that role, my team produces on farm labor that provides the basis for employment and wage estimates for all farm workers directly hired by U.S. farms.  It is also used by the U.S. Department of Labor to administer the H-2A agricultural guest worker program. \nThe H-2A program allows farmers and ranchers to hire foreign guest workers for seasonal jobs critical to American agriculture.  Agricultural labor is defined as any activity performed on a farm in connection with production of agricultural commodities. The Department of Labor relies on the we provide to monitor labor demands in the farming sector at key points during the year. They can then make decisions related to the supply of guest workers to meet reported labor demands.  And this is where our farm labor surveys comes in.\nWe reach out to farmers and ranchers to conduct an agricultural labor survey twice each year in April and October. In the past, we collected the four times a year, once per quarter.  Several years ago we combined the quarters and began collecting only twice a year. With this approach, we were able to reduce both costs and demands on the survey participants, while still collecting and publishing information. Currently, the April survey collects for a specific week in January and April, and the October survey collects for a specific week in July and October. is collected for the week containing the 12th of each month.\nOne of the easiest ways for farmers to help ensure there is enough agricultural labor in the United States at critical times in the production cycles is to take part in the Agricultural Labor survey. So I ask all farmers who receive the survey form in a few weeks to take the time to fill it out. Only with accurate can farmers, ranchers, policymakers and others make decisions that help the farm businesses and strengthen U.S. agriculture.\n Category/Topic:\n USDA Results\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Farm Labor survey\n farm work\n Farmers\n Ranchers\n U.S. Department of Labor\n United States Department of Agriculture",

Photo credit: Sagehen Creek Field Station\nEvery year in the U.S. roughly 200 people are killed in as many as 2 million wildlife-vehicle collisions and at a cost of more than $8 billion, according to the Western Transportation Institute.\nBut the U.S. Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest Research Station scientists, along with their collaborators in the Highway 89 Stewardship Team, are paving the way to reduce those statistics with their latest project. The team broke ground last May on its second and third wildlife underpasses along a 25-mile stretch of Highway 89 between Truckee and Sierraville, California.\n“Studies have shown that well-placed wildlife crossings, coupled with fencing, can reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions by as much as 75 to 100 percent,” said Sandra Jacobson, a wildlife biologist with Pacific Southwest Research Station.\nWhile wildlife crossings exist across the country, the Highway 89 crossings will be unique in their value to science. Built to near identical dimensions and only located a mile apart from each other, the underpasses will allow scientists to manipulate conditions to learn what might make an underpass more appealing to wildlife.\nFor instance there might be things that cancel out noise or add cover within the tunnels that might promote use among smaller animals. The tunnels are adjacent to the University of California, Berkeley’s Sagehen Creek Field Station in the Sagehen Experimental Forest, which will give scientists access to the forest’s research facilities and monitoring equipment.\nThe $2.8 million project was funded largely in part by a Federal Highways Transportation Enhancement grant.

It takes a lot of natural resources, energy, labor, and love to raise the estimated 46 million turkeys that will be consumed this Thanksgiving. Show your appreciation by making sure you waste as little food as possible. Photo courtesy of USDA.\nThanksgiving is a time to appreciate all that is good in our lives and to spend it in the company of friends and family while enjoying great food.  It is also a time to reflect on the bounty of our food supply.  Each year, as I put away the leftovers from my Thanksgiving dinner, I marvel at the abundance.\nI also can’t avoid pausing to consider how much food is wasted in this country.\nUSDA estimates that on average, American consumers waste about one-fifth of food that is available to them, equivalent to about $371 per person annually.  That’s enough money to buy about 21 whole turkeys for each person in the country.\nWouldn’t it be great if we could make reducing food waste one of our Thanksgiving traditions?  A tradition we practice throughout the year?\nReducing food waste starts with meal planning.\nBefore you start shopping, take stock of what you have in your refrigerator and cupboards so that you don’t end up tossing extras.  A friend of mine uses an “Eat Me First” bin, so that the most perishable items are not lost at the back of the refrigerator. On Thanksgiving, using up the food currently in your refrigerator is particularly important to clear room for all of those Thanksgiving ingredients and post-Thanksgiving leftovers.  Careful menu planning and portion control helps to minimize waste.  When buying a turkey, USDA recommends allowing for one pound of turkey per person.\nThanksgiving leftovers can be substantial, particularly when the gatherings are large.  Take time to make sure leftovers are refrigerated within two hours from when they are hot and have guests leave with something tasty to take home and eat later.  Leftovers can be delicious and the reason for gathering once more with friends and family.\nMany of my friends host Leftover Parties the day after Thanksgiving, which can sometimes spark debate among the partygoers as to whose pecan pie was better.  “The Friday after Thanksgiving is like a de facto National Leftovers Day – it’s the one day of the year where almost everyone enjoys leftovers,” says Jonathan Bloom, a food-waste author and blogger.  Of course, if you don’t have time to party with leftovers, you can simply store them.  Leftovers can be kept in the refrigerator for three to four days or safely frozen for up to a year.\nThanksgiving is the perfect time to begin food waste reduction strategies in your household that can gradually become habit for every day of the year.  No one wants to throw delicious Thanksgiving food into the trash or compost bin, but shouldn’t we treat all food that we eat with the same amount of respect year-round?\nSo here’s a toast to a Happy and Food Waste Free Thanksgiving.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Food Waste\n freezing\n Jonathan Bloom\n leftovers\n OCE\n refrigerating\n Thanksgiving\n turkey\n U.S. Food Waste Challenge",

In both fiscal year and , USDA received an additional allocation of $5 million dedicated to traditional and locally-grown foods. This fund, authorized under the Farm Bill and subject to the availability of appropriations, has allowed the exploration of new culinary opportunities for FDPIR.\n Lindsay Williams, Food Distribution Division, USDA Food and Nutrition Service\n Posted in\n Conservation\n Food and Nutrition\n Nov 14, \n Respond to this story",

On behalf of the USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, I would like to say thank you to our partners these past eight years as well as reflect on a few notable highlights of the work we have achieved together.\nUSDA touches the lives of all Americans every day, whether they realize it or not.

The People’s Garden Initiative is thrilled to have an exhibition in the Reinventing Agriculture area of Campus and Community. Please stop by to see it and talk gardening with USDA’s Executive Master Gardeners! Like us, universities from across the country are demonstrating how they engage communities through gardening. The Festival runs June 27 to July 1 and July 4-8 from 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.\nOur living exhibit showcases different types of gardens that qualify as People’s Gardens and demonstrates several relatively simple, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly practices that both beginner and expert gardeners can implement to make our communities healthier places to live, work and play.\nThe types of gardens demonstrated include all access, edible, pollinator, and container. These gardens surround a shed with sustainable features like designing with reclaimed materials, making and using compost, setting up a rain barrel, and installing a green roof.  20-minute demonstrations on these sustainable practices are offered daily.\nVisitors have been quite curious about the sheds design, who built it and what it is made from. I talked with Bob Snieckus, National Landscape Architect for USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and Michael Roggerson, Lead Carpenter at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) for answers.\n USDA landscape architect Bob Snieckus (far right), Professor Clarence W. Pearson, Jr. (third from left) from the University of the District of Columbia, and architecture students from the District of Columbia spent a day assembling the frame of the shed on the National Mall.\nHow did you come up with the idea of this shed? \nBob Snieckus: Matt Arnn, Chief Landscape Architect for the U.S. Forest Service, and myself came up with this idea to showcase sustainable shed design. We wanted to show people at the Folklife Festival how organic material can be used. This shed features different species of urban timber, open and airy construction, and a green roof. \nHow did UDC contribute in the process of planning and building the shed?\nMichael Roggerson: The shed was built in partnership between USDA and UDC, a Land grant university here in Washington, DC. Clarence W. Pearson, Jr. in the Department of Architecture and Urban Design at UDC worked with Bob Snieckus on the design plans for the shed. We built the shed at our university in about a week from morning until evening, while USDA oversaw the project. We had about ten architecture students total building it, and about five or six per day. \nHow did the shed get moved from UDC to the National Mall? \nBob Snieckus: The plans were originally designed for the shed to be built and remain in the People’s Garden at USDA Headquarters. I learned to modify the design so that it could be assembled and then disassembled and transported from UDC to the Festival site. \nWhat are the different elements of the shed?\nBob Snieckus: The door is white oak that came from fallen and removed urban trees from the District of Columbia.  We used red oak and poplar for the siding. The floor rim joists are naturally insect resistant black locust. The shed has a green roof and rain barrel attachment. The soil and plants that we put on the roof add an extra pounds, so we had to design a structure to hold more weight than a normal shed. We used posts and ceiling joists made from fir trees to hold up the plywood roof.\nWhere can you buy this type of reclaimed wood?\nBob Snieckus: There are a few lumber mills around the area in D.C. and Maryland. The mills stockpile the trees from various sources and then cut the wood to the sizes that you request. Most of the wood comes from trees that were old or diseased and were lining streets and railroad tracks. The Urban Forestry Administration is a good place in the District of Columbia government that has a lot of info on what types of wood to use. They can also help you with your design and source of wood.\nHow durable and long-lasting is this shed?\nBob Snieckus: Very. It will last for years and years. That’s because in the base we used black locust which naturally prevents termite decay. We also sealed the wood with a liquid water proofing material so that weather won’t speed up decay. \nWhat do you plan to do with the shed once the festival is over?\nBob Snieckus: We hope to move it to The People’s Garden on the corner. We want to add shelving and hooks so that gardening tools can be stored in it.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Forestry\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n Folklife Festival\n FS\n NRCS\n People's Garden\n usda150",

This afternoon in the Whitten Federal Building, area children and the public joined the agency for Smokey's official birthday celebration, where Forest Service officials had nothing but praise for his work.\n\"Smokey Bear is one of the most beloved symbols in American history and his important message has been communicated to generations of Americans during the past sixty five years,\" said U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell.\nJames Hubbard, Deputy Chief of the Forest Service for State and Private Forestry, said that even though Smokey's been around long enough that he might be eligible to retire, there's still lots of work to be done. With thousands of people enjoying America's national forests every year, Smokey's message continues to be vital.\nHank Kashdan, Associate Chief of the Forest Service, thanked the kids in attendance for the birthday cards they delivered to Smokey, and outlined Smokey's 65-year history for the crowd -- from the beginning of the Forest Service's fire education efforts with Bambi and friends, to Smokey's debut in . Following his remarks, Forest Service employees read Smokey's story, in both English and Spanish.\nAfter the reading, the Alexandria Choral Society's Children's Choir sang the Smokey Bear Song for the crowd, and after some chanting for Smokey, he came out to join the party ...\nFor 65 years, Smokey Bear has been there to help the Forest Service remind America: \"Only you can prevent wildfire.\" That's an important reminder, considering most fires aren't started by nature. In fact, 90% of wildfire is caused by our leaving fires unattended or coals burning. From his first day on the job, Smokey has been there to help Americans understand how their actions can affect the future of one of our most important national treasures.\nBe sure to check out Smokey's web site for more information on his history and birthday.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Forestry\n FS\n Hank Kashdam\n James Hubbard\n Smokey Bear\n Tom Tidwell",

CBOs partner with NASS to help reach these underserved agricultural producers and encourage them to participate in the Census. As the CBOs educate and motivate the producers they serve to complete their Census forms, these producers become part of the that represent the accurate picture of agriculture across the nation. The partnerships are serving both the CBOs’ mission of providing service to every producer and NASS’s goal of counting every farmer and rancher in the Census of Agriculture. In the following blog, one of NASS’s longstanding CBO partners, Ralph Paige, shares his thoughts on the importance of the ongoing Census of Agriculture.\nThe Census of Agriculture is Your Voice for Our Future\nBy Ralph Paige, Executive Director, Federation of Southern Cooperatives\nThere is little rest for America’s farmers and ranchers this spring. We must ensure our voices are heard and the future of our farms are represented by responding to the Census of Agriculture. As organizations such as the Federation of Southern Cooperatives work to develop, advocate and support public policies to benefit black and other family farmers in low income rural communities, there is no better time than the present to share the story of America’s black and African American farmers. One of the best ways to do this is to respond to the Census.\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census first counted minority farm operators in for the 12th decennial census of population. Over the past century special efforts have been made to improve coverage of minority farm operators in the Census.\nThe last Census of Agriculture counted 41,024 black operators on 32,ates. The number of black producers grew by 9 percent from , and the number of black women farm operators grew by 53 percent. As we look to the future, we wonder what the Census of Agriculture will reveal about black and African American farmers and the contribution they make to America’s food and fiber system.\nKnowing that information from the Census of Agriculture is used to shape local, state and national farm services, programs and policies, it’s vital to continue to share our story and be counted. Conducted only once every five years by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, the Census provides detailed covering nearly every face and facet of U.S. agriculture.\nThe Census of Agriculture looks at land use and ownership, production practices, expenditures and other factors that affect the way farmers strive to survive and grow in today’s world. The wealth of available from the Census includes information on small, family farms as well as large farms; information on young farmers and older farmers; and insight into traditional, rural farming versus trends in areas such as lifestyle and urban farming.\nThe information gathered is important, so it can provide an accurate and complete picture of U.S. agriculture and those who farm America’s agricultural land. And, the information will not only tell our story today, but it help all of us plan for tomorrow. Our communities depend upon it.\nIf you have not yet responded, I encourage you to do so today. Farmers can return their forms by mail or online by visiting, www.agcensus.usda.gov. If you have questions about the Census of Agriculture, call 1-888-4AG-STAT . The Census of Agriculture is your voice for our farming future.\nRalph Paige, Executive Director of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, discusses how the Census of Agriculture benefits the people and communities he serves.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Census of Agriculture\n NASS\n Science",

Move Across Missouri encourages 4-Hers to increase their physical activity and track the time they spend moving through the Presidential Active Lifestyle Award (PALA), which challenges kids to log 60 minutes of physical activity for five days out of the week for six out of eight weeks.\nThe PALA is one of four challenges First Lady Michelle Obama has issued to communities to reverse childhood obesity through the Let’s Move! initiative. Move Across Missouri is just one of many moves 4-H is making to carry out one of its core goals: healthy living. 4-H strives to equip youth with healthy living knowledge and skills that will prepare them physically, emotionally, and socially to meet the challenges of the 21st century.\nWith leadership from the 4-H National Headquarters, 4-H has made big strides in engaging not just folks in Missouri but 4-H’ers across the country in the PALA challenge. When the First Lady launched Let’s Move Faith and Communities on November 29, , 4-H’s Professional and Volunteer Development National Program Leader Doug Swanson, 4-H National Headquarters at the USDA, announced three ambitious commitments:\nCooperative Extension Master Gardeners, with the involvement of many 4-Hers, will develop 2,600 school gardens in . Through the Master Gardener program, we anticipate that well over 650,000 pounds of fresh produce will be provided to local families who have that need.  Over 1 million young people will be involved in community gardening in some way. \nAlso this coming year, 4-H is committed to having 250,000 4-H youth incorporate regular physical activity into their 4-H club experiences on a yearlong basis. We anticipate that 100,000 of those youth will achieve the President’s Active Lifestyle Award. \n4-H will reach all 6 million of our young people with the message that they can live a healthy life. We have set a goal to help 3 million 4-H young people develop the skills to make healthy decisions over the next three years.\nAnd 4-H is well on its way! In Missouri, Move Across Missouri’s 462 participants have logged almost 100,000 hours of physical activity. Click here to learn more about how 4-H is moving in Missouri!

Photo courtesy of Travis Dewitz\nNature provides numerous benefits that people value. In the conservation world, we call these benefits ecosystem services. On rangelands, some ecosystem services can be bought and sold in traditional market systems – like forages, meat, and other animal products from livestock. Other ecosystem services are not typically bought or sold, but nevertheless have value – like cleaner water, better air quality, and reduced risk from drought or flood. Conservation practices can increase the value of both types of ecosystem services. But, how do we put a dollar value on non-marketable services on rangeland? And how do we tie those dollar values to USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) conservation practices?\nWith these concepts and questions in mind, NRCS partnered with Earth Economics to do a pilot study to estimate non-market ecosystem services in the central Great Plains. Funded by the grazing land component of the Conservation Effects Assessment Project, the resulting Earth Economics study report, “Accounting for Nature’s Value with USDA-NRCS Conservation Practices in the Central Great Plains,” explains the framework and approach used to link practices to ecosystem services and put a dollar value on them.\nOn rangelands, conservation practices can be associated with many non-market ecosystem services, such as rejuvenation of native grasses and shrubs, whose roots can trap, slow, and filter rainwater and runoff. This filtration not only improves water quality in nearby streams and rivers for downstream drinking water, irrigation, and recreation. It also protects human property from flooding and improves wildlife habitat, leading to potentially better hunting, fishing, and aesthetics. These benefits extend well beyond a ranch’s fence line.\nEstimating the benefits of rangeland conservation investments should include the value of both on-site and off-site ecosystem services. Putting a dollar value on these ecosystem service benefits in NRCS policy and program decisions would improve conservation outcomes and perhaps give ranchers even more incentive to adopt NRCS conservation measures.\nThe pilot study (, 6.4 ) estimates that brush management and prescribed grazing (two commonly used NRCS rangeland practices) increased ecosystem service values by $15 million to $33 million from to , an average increase of $1.7 million to $3.6 million per year or $2.28 to $4.93 annually per acre. The ecosystem services that contributed the most to the total value were air quality (35%); water quality (19%); climate stability (12%); disaster risk reduction (10%); recreation and tourism (7%); water capture, conveyance, and supply (7%); soil retention (4%); habitat (3%); and aesthetics (3%).\nWatch the recent webinar about the report’s methods and findings presented by Loretta Metz (NRCS, CEAP-Grazing Lands Component Leader) and Angela Fletcher (Earth Economics).

USDA recently released a study that shows that the diets of American adults are improving. More people are reading nutrition labels and using that information to make healthier food choices at the grocery stores. We are eating out less and sitting down around the supper table with family more.\nAt USDA, we have made it a priority to support this progress by ensuring that our programs empower the American public to make smart choices every day at school, at home and in their communities. We are offering more nutritious food options and backing that up with the best available science-based advice on what to eat and why to eat it.\nOur MyPlate symbol makes it easier for people to visualize what a healthy meal should like on the plate, and is being used around the country in school cafeterias, in nutrition education programs and on food packaging. Tools like the SuperTracker are helping people establish and apply proper nutrition and dietary habits in their everyday lives.\nWe have also partnered with the Treasury and Health and Human Services Departments to help improve access to nutritious food in underserved communities. With our external and federal partners, we are supporting initiatives that expand healthy food options in communities, improve people’s ability to purchase that food, and create economic opportunities for America’s farmers and small businesses across the country.\nAmericans now have expanded opportunity to access healthy products from local farmers and ranchers through farmers markets, thanks in part to a more than 50 percent increase in the number of markets supported by USDA. Shoppers using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits now have access to more fruits and vegetables, as a result of USDA and our partners’ concerted efforts to expand SNAP card reader technology to nearly 4,000 farmers markets across the country.\nThrough our Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), which serves more than half of all babies born in the United States, we are ensuring that very young children get the vital nutrients they need during their most vulnerable years. Recent credit WIC for its key role in the tremendous progress we’ve in the fight against childhood obesity, as rates among low-income children are now declining for the first time since the s.\nOur schools are building upon that progress by serving healthier breakfasts, lunches and snacks—chock full of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy and lean protein—to students. Ninety percent of our nation’s schools are fully meeting the new nutritional standards for school meals and we expect the remainder to follow soon behind.\nThis progress is due in part to the commitment of public and private entities—not just USDA and this Administration, but our local leader partners in schools, small businesses, and state capitols across the country—charged with implementing practical, modern policies that work out in the real world, not just inside the Beltway.\nWe have made significant headway, but our work is not done. We continue to invest in critical programs that ensure that healthy, safe, affordable food is available to children and families. As always, we are pushing Congress to finish the work of a passing a new Food, Farm and Jobs Bill that continues to build upon these efforts and supports a healthier next generation of American leaders.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Childhood Obesity\n Farm Bill\n Farmers\n Farmers Markets\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n healthy foods\n HHS\n MyPlate\n Ranchers\n Secretary's Column\n SNAP\n SuperTracker\n Tom Vilsack\n Treasury\n WIC",

First, he shifted the farm to 100 percent no-till in . Then in , after spending years developing diverse crop rotations, he received a grant from Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education, a USDA-funded grants and outreach program, to test the introduction of cover crops into his system. This move has given him higher yields with fewer inputs, and therefore better profits.\nDan Forgey builds soil health naturally by using diverse crop rotations, cover crops and no-till, thereby reducing his reliance on chemical inputs. Photo courtesy The Furrow Magazine (John Deere Co.).\n“This is what the country needs. Between cover crops and no-till we are doing things to better the soil nature’s way,” Forgey says.\nOver the years, Forgey has diversified the farm to include 12 crops—including grains, oilseed crops and forages for his 750-head cow-calf operation. He plants them in long rotations in order to combat weeds, which present a major challenge in no-till systems.\nHis SARE-funded cover crop research showed that a mix of turnips, cowpeas and lentils increased corn yields by 18-20 bushels per acre compared to control plots. Now, Forgey is helping other growers adopt the soil-building strategies. Potter County, where he lives, and nearby Sully County have become a hotbed of no-till in the last 20 years, where an estimated 80-90 percent of growers now use the practice. But cover crops have been slower to catch on, partly because not enough growers have demonstrated which covers work well in local growing conditions.\nForgey has worked hard to share his success with cover crops with neighbors. He has conducted on-farm tours, held field days, spoken at regional conferences and recently been profiled in the national agricultural media. Many of his neighbors have taken notice. Seven producers—their operations ranging in size from 3,500 to 18,000 acres—planted cover crops for the first time in after seeing Forgey’s plots.\nTo hear Forgey’s story in his own words, check out the recently-published video series about Cronin Farms, produced by SARE and Cooking Up a Story.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n KYF2\n Meat and Poultry\n NIFA\n SARE\n South Dakota\n Sustainability\n Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education\n Working Lands",

USDA photo.\n“Water conservation begins where the first drop of rain falls…most likely on private working lands.” This is a favorite saying of Tom Vandivier, a Texas cattle rancher and recipient of the Sand County Foundation’s Leopold Conservation Award (LCA).\nTom was one of more than two dozen recipients of the LCA – which recognized landowners for achievement in environmental improvement on agricultural land – in Washington, D.C. last week.  I was fortunate to meet with them here at USDA headquarters to talk about the importance of conservation and the need to spread the message that investing in conservation practices on our farm and ranch lands not only protects water, air and wildlife – it also makes economic sense.\nJill Giacomini Basch is a LCA recipient who, with her father and three sisters, owns a family dairy in Marin County, Calif.  I had a chance to meet with the Giacomini family during my tour of several California farms last month. Jill explained that conservation improves the way they run their business. Partnerships with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and others have helped them protect their land and water resources, and ensure their dairy will be prosperous for the next generation.\n“We have very close ties with NRCS and other programs,” Jill said. “They have helped us with our water allocation -- above ground storage pond facilities and spring well drilling.  With the USDA we were able to utilize new technology to install a methane digester to help mitigate waste run off into the nearby lagoon, but also eventually the Point Reyes National Seashore.  Because of the methane digester, we generate about 65 percent of our on farm energy needs.”\n“Much of the work we’ve done has been through NRCS programs,” Tom added. “NRCS is very important to us.  We’re very much about conservation. The stewardship practices that we’ve accomplished on our property have enhanced water resources in the state of Texas.  I think it’s a message that needs to be spread so others can take similar stewardship practices and hopefully have the same results in their perspective states.”\nJon Bednarski, LCA recipient, shared his story as well.  He started farming 12 years ago outside of Louisville, Ky.  After meeting with NRCS, he discovered he was farming a “sensitive” piece of land, upstream of Louisville’s drinking water source. Since then he has managed his operation to help protect water quality.\nThe group discussed the need for conservation in the face of extreme weather – including the significant drought conditions in 11 western states.  As we were meeting, the U.S. Senate was in the process of voting on the Agricultural Act of . I talked about how important this legislation is to providing the tools and programs necessary for USDA to help farmers, ranchers and forestland owners manage the risk and uncertainty associated with extreme weather and climate change.  Conservation programs will be streamlined to better target limited resources to areas of highest need, while building on record conservation and stewardship efforts already underway.  I also previewed Secretary Tom Vilsack’s announcement of USDA’s new regional hubs to help agriculture and forestry mitigate the impacts of a changing climate.\nThe group also discussed the importance of passing on to the next generation the passion for agriculture and land stewardship.  There is a new energy in America around opportunities in agriculture. The Agricultural Act of will provide our communities with additional support to attract new economic opportunity and create jobs.  We all agreed that outreach and education is crucial.  USDA will continue to work with the LCA recipients and other partners to make that happen.  To view a video about the meeting click here.\nDeputy Under Secretary Ann Mills (center) addresses Leopold Conservation Award Winners at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

USDA’s certification programs have successfully helped the industry market its brands with USDA integrity for over twenty years. Photo courtesy Premshree Pillai. Used with permission.\nWhen consumers hear the term Kobe, the first thought that comes to mind is typically not a city in Japan, but rather a juicy steak right off the grill.  Kobe beef is globally renowned for its rich flavor, juiciness, and tenderness or high marbling content.  Kobe beef is cuts of beef from the Tajima strain of Wagyu cattle (which mean Japanese cattle), raised in Kobe, Japan.  But did you know you can find Kobe-style beef produced right here in the United States?\nSince , U.S. producers have worked to offer American Kobe-style beef that features the same characteristics, marbling and flavor that defines Japan’s Kobe beef by bringing herds of Kryoshi and Akaushi breeds of Wagyu cattle to the United States.  The same closed herd and multi-trait selection process used for Kobe beef was adopted and is now used by various U.S. trade associations (American Akaushi Association, the American Wagyu Association, and the Texas Wagyu Association) that promote and uphold the industry standards. Highly prized for their rich flavor, these cattle produce what some would argue is among the finest beef in the world.\nUSDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) provides certification services to beef producers for a number of marketing programs making labeling claims concerning breed of cattle and carcass characteristics, including American Kobe-style beef. These characteristics go beyond the requirements for the official USDA grades and are often the basis for approval of meat product labels making marketing claims.\nAMS created specifications to assist breed associations and processing entities to market branded products to consumers.  For the American Kobe-style beef specifications, AMS worked with our industry partners at Heart Brand Beef, Clear Creek Farms, American Certified Kobe Beef/Certified Wagyu Beef, Morgan Davis International Wagyu Beef, and Rosewood Wagyu Beef.\nAMS certification programs assure consumers that the products they purchase meet specified requirements and provide USDA’s quality stamp of approval. Our certification programs have successfully helped the industry market its brands with integrity for over twenty years.  Many companies across the U.S. have had their Kobe-style American beef certified through AMS, assisting them in marketing their products.\nWagyu cattle have been extensively studied in Japan and in the United States, and university studies have shown that marbling in Wagyu beef has a composition that is significantly lower in saturated fat and cholesterol and higher in omega monounsaturated fatty acid.  AMS is proud to help consumers all over the world enjoy the elegance and excellence of American Kobe-style beef.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n AMS\n beef\n beef grades\n grading\n grading shields\n Grilling\n Japan\n Kobe-style\n labels\n marbling\n Standards\n USDA Choice\n USDA Prime\n USDA Select\n USDA tender\n Wagyu beef",

USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) recently published two fact sheets that explain the basics of importing and exporting organic products to assist organic producers and processors in accessing new markets for their products.\nExpanding trade for U.S. organic products creates opportunities for small businesses and increases jobs for Americans who grow, package, ship and market organic products. During this Administration, USDA has streamlined trade with multiple foreign governments.\nTrade partnerships allow U.S. organic products to be sold as organic in multiple countries, including Canada, the European Union (EU), Japan, and Taiwan without maintaining certification to multiple standards. Many additional countries accept USDA organic products without a specific trade partnership.  Thanks to these partnerships, U.S. organic operations can tap into many larger international markets.\nU.S. organic exports to Japan are currently estimated at $80 million, with growth due to the partnership expected to reach at least $250 million in 10 years.  In , the U.S. exported around $73 million of organic products to the EU and close to $2 billion to Canada.  Organic import and export is published online by USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and you can also build customized .\nImported products must be certified in one of two ways to be sold as organic in the United States. First, products can be certified to the USDA organic regulations through the traditional certification process. USDA authorizes organizations around the world to certify farms and businesses. Secondly, the U.S. currently accepts most products certified to the Canadian, European Union, or Japanese organic standards.\nIn addition to organic requirements, traded agricultural products must meet all general or commodity-specific import and export requirements for the destination country. The requirements for importing and exporting organic products vary by country. For example, general requirements for organic products imported to the U.S. include:\nLabeling. Organic products sold in the U.S. must meet all USDA organic labeling requirements.\nImport Codes. For certain organic products, traders must use harmonized tariff schedule codes for tracking purposes.\nGrading. Imported and exported agricultural commodities must often meet product size, grade, quality, and maturity requirements through AMS grading services.\nHealth Inspection: Shipments must include permits, sanitary certificates, and phytosanitary certificates to ensure the product is healthy and free from pests.\nMeat, Poultry, and Processed Egg Products. USDA only allows imported meat, poultry, and processed egg products from countries with inspection standards equivalent to U.S. standards.\nThrough trade partnerships, consumers benefit from a wider range of organic products year-round. The United States and our many trade partners are committed to ensuring that all traded organic products meet the terms of the partnerships, retaining their organic integrity from farm to market.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Trade\n Tags:\n AMS\n Canada\n Certification\n European Union\n Farmers\n FAS\n Japan\n jobs\n National Organic Program\n NOP\n organic\n Organic 101\n organic certification\n Producers\n Ranchers\n rural communities\n small business\n Taiwan\n Trade",

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA's rich science and research portfolio.\nWhen Americans think of the United States Department of Agriculture, they understandably think about the millions of farmers and ranchers who produce our food, feed, fiber, and fuel - the most productive in the world. But there is another group of Americans directly impacted by the work of USDA - the millions of our children who are fed through our child nutrition programs such as the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs.\nA recent study sponsored by the Food and Nutrition Service examined how well schools across the country met USDA nutrition standards for key nutrients like protein, calcium, and vitamin C.  Several of us at the USDA Economic Research Service realized that we could use that same set to look at the characteristics of schools that met the fat requirements and, more importantly, what successful steps some schools are taking to do just that.\nThe set is small, but it is nationally representative.  We found many statistically significant associations between fat content and school policies despite the small nature of the sample.\nA number of school policies and practices were associated with lower fat lunches:\n* participation in programs that promote fresh fruits and vegetables or locally grown food;\n* providing low-fat milk as the only milk choice;\n* eliminating French fries or dessert from the menus;\n* eliminating vending machines in middle and high schools; and\n* excluding a la carte foods from elementary school menus.\nThe meal planning method also showed a pattern. In the traditional “food-based” method, each meal must consist of certain food item categories (e.g., meat, vegetable, starch). Some schools have moved to a nutrient-based method that plans meals according to nutrient content. And some have opted for an intermediate, “enhanced food-based” plan that combines the food-based method with more fruits, vegetables, and grains. The traditional meal planning method was used more by schools with the highest fat content.\nThe only school characteristic that was strongly associated with lower fat meals was being in an urban location compared to a suburban or rural one.\nThe strength of so many associations between school food policies and lunch fat content provide some interesting food for thought in addressing current concerns about nutrition for children.\nDr. Lynn Harvey with NC Department of Public Instruction Child Nutrition Services and Southeast Regional Administrator Donald Arnette with USDA Food and Nutrition Service encourages Thomasville Primary School students in the “strawberry in the spoon” race as part of the school’s Let’s Move program inspired by First Lady Michelle Obama (USDA photo by Debbie Haston-Hilger)\nLocal farmer and County Commissioner Billy Joe Kepley volunteers his time to teach Thomasville Primary School students the art of farming in their school’s garden.

Recent events, including record-breaking drought in the West and severe flooding in the Southeast have elevated a national dialogue on the state of our Nation’s water resources and infrastructure.\nThese challenges are why on March 22, the White House hosted a Water Summit to correspond with the United Nations World Water Day.  The meeting raised awareness of water issues and highlighted potential solutions to building a sustainable and secure water future. Following a slate of presentations outlining innovative solutions to water quality and quantity challenges, attendees were invited to review interactive demonstrations of projects including technologies that help communities and businesses manage the challenges of long term drought.\nEric Luebehusen, agricultural meteorologist for USDA’s Office of Chief Economist and World Agricultural Outlook Board, gave a live demonstration of the making of the United States Drought Monitor (USDM). The USDM is a groundbreaking product that has been used by the Department as a trigger mechanism for providing billions of dollars in USDA emergency aid to farmers and ranchers. As one of two USDA authors of the USDM, Luebehusen highlighted the various types of used by the authors and the partnerships that have developed across the Federal government through the years to strengthen this unique tool. He also provided insight into the substantial role that USDA played in migrating the USDM from a hand-drawn map, to one based in a state-of-the- art Geographical Information System (GIS).\nParticipants saw detailed assessments of the drought in their home states as Luebehusen explained the products that best describe the current level of drought in their particular locales. For example, in California, USDM authors use snowpack measurements and reservoir levels to accurately track drought.  In other regions, different measurements like 3-month rainfall accumulation, might be provide a more accurate depiction of drought conditions.\n“I was very pleased with the amount of interest and interaction our US Drought Monitor display generated,” said Luebehusen. “We actually had folks from multiple states come up to our display and comment on the current drought depiction, with some going so far as to offer some feedback and suggestions for this week’s map!”\n“I concur with Eric’s sense of pride with USDA’s role in shaping the Drought Monitor over the years.  Several of the attendees expressed their gratitude that we take the time to produce such an important product. The Department itself shows its confidence in the product by using it as a trigger mechanism for multi-billion dollar programs,” said Mark Brusberg, Deputy Chief Meteorologist in USDA’s Office of Chief Economist.\nUSDA has been at the forefront of transitioning the US Drought Monitor to a state of the art Geographic Information System. The USDM is jointly produced by the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the National Drought Mitigation Center.\nSince the inception of the USDM in the late s, the USDA Drought Monitor Team has been at the forefront of acquisition, building partnerships with providers of information to both ensure the sustainability of necessary products and facilitate creation of new types of information useful to the drought communities.  Several of these partnerships were on display at the USDA booth, including the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail, and Snow (CoCoRaHS) Network, an example of effective collection by citizen scientists through a coordinated volunteer network.\n“At the USDA, we take a great deal of pride in our contributions to the Drought Monitor, not only from an authoring perspective, but also from a developmental perspective, spearheading the effort to get the Drought Monitor based on a much more dynamic Geographic Information System Platform,” said Luebehusen.\nThe United States Drought Monitor is just one of the important ways USDA uses state of the art and research to support communities facing water quantity and quality challenges due to changing climate and extreme weather. The White House Water Summit served as an important platform to highlight the ongoing work of the federal family in bringing modern solutions to water challenges now and into the future.\nEric Luebehusen and Mark Brusberg, from USDA’s Office of the Chief Economist, presented the United States Drought Monitor at the White House Water Summit.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n USDA Results\n Tags:\n adaptation\n Climate Change\n drought\n National Drought Monitor\n OCE\n Partnerships\n resilience\n tools\n United Nations\n water\n White House\n World Water Day",

During his trip to Hanoi, Vietnam, earlier this week, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack—whose own personal story and history of public service epitomizes these very characteristics—challenged a packed auditorium of more than 600 students and faculty at the Hanoi University of Agriculture (HUA) to be the generation whose dreams transform their communities, their country and their world.\nHUA, Vietnam’s oldest and largest agricultural university, was the perfect setting for this message, as many of its alumni have been instrumental in helping Vietnam transform in just 25 years from a food aid recipient to one of the world’s top agricultural producers and exporters. In fact, Vietnam is one of the world’s fastest growing economies and an important market for U.S. agricultural products. In the past decade, Vietnam jumped from the fiftieth to fifteenth position as a market for U.S. farm exports. At the same time, the United States has become a growing market for Vietnamese goods such as rice, coffee, cashew, spices and seafood. Two-way trade between the United States and Vietnam is strong for each partner.\nAlthough Vietnam no longer faces the problem of chronic food shortages, Secretary Vilsack reminded the students that new threats to the country’s food supply—whether from the impact of climate change to the decimation of crops and livestock through disease—needed to be anticipated, countered and controlled. “What is the best way to do that?” asked the Secretary. Embrace science—just like Dr. Norman Borlaug.\nWhen Secretary Vilsack told the capacity crowd about Dr. Borlaug’s green revolution, the estimated 1 billion lives he saved, and the World Food Prize he established, you could almost feel the dreams taking flight from the eager students. Secretary Vilsack closed his remarks by challenging the audience to aspire to make a difference, not by dreaming of things as they are, but as they should be.\nI know that somewhere in that auditorium, someone is going to do just that.\nNote: Vilsack is visiting with Asian Pacific partners in Vietnam and China to help strengthen trade relations and support the American brand throughout the region.

The campaign mobilizes the combined resources of the federal government, state and local governments, foundations, business and nonprofit organizations to help solve the problem of childhood obesity within a generation so that children born today will reach adulthood at a healthy weight and live healthier lives.\nThe recently announced Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP) in Massachusetts will empower low-income Americans to eat more nutritious food and has the potential to strengthen the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program that serves as a critical safety net to the most vulnerable in our society.\nThe Food and Nutrition Service and First Lady Obama believe increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, especially in the place of higher calorie foods, can help move America towards healthier lifestyles and a healthier future.  The Farm Bill authorized $20 million for pilot projects to evaluate health and nutrition promotion in the SNAP.  Through HIP, FNS will be able to determine if incentives provided to recipients at the point-of-sale increase the purchase of fruits, vegetables or other healthful foods among SNAP participants.\nThe evaluation of this pilot, still in the early development stages, will offer solid evidence on whether a financial incentive can influence fruit and vegetable purchases and consumption.  The Healthy Incentives Pilot will enroll 7,500 randomly selected SNAP households to receive incentives. For every dollar participants spend on fruits and vegetables using their SNAP Electronic Benefit Transfer cards, 30 cents will be added to their benefit balance - thus cutting the cost of fruits and vegetables by almost one-third.\nHampden County, Massachusetts was chosen to be the first county in America to use the HIP.  Massachusetts was selected competitively due to its broad pilot proposal that included very thorough and strong design, implementation, staffing and management plans. Hampden County is a mix of 27 urban, rural, and suburban cities with a total of 50,000 SNAP households.  The majority of recipients are concentrated in the areas of Springfield, Holyoke, and Chicopee.  Massachusetts will begin operating the pilot in the fall of .\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Farm Bill\n FNS\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n Healthy Incentives Pilot\n Let's Move\n SNAP",

And this week, a new report amplified our understanding for the critical importance of the Farm Bill in protecting natural resources in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.\nThe report showed that over the past seven years, conservation efforts have reduced the amount of nitrogen leaving fields by 48.6 million pounds each year – about 26 percent – and reducing phosphorus by 7.1 million pounds, or 46 percent.\nThese conservation practices are also preventing soil erosion, helping to ensure that our farm fields across the Chesapeake Bay Watershed remain vibrant and productive in the years to come. Conservation practices have lowered the estimated amount of eroded soil by about 15.1 million tons every year, or 60 percent. Put another way, that’s enough soil to fill about 150,000 railcars.\nIn addition to ensuring healthy cropland and clean water, these programs strengthen wildlife habitat that boosts outdoor recreation. From hunting and fishing, to camping and hiking, outdoor recreation adds more than $640 billion in benefits to our economy each year.\nThe Chesapeake Bay watershed initiative is just one of many landscape-scale initiatives undertaken by USDA in recent years. From the Mississippi River Basin to the Ogallala Aquifer, USDA has worked with producers to enroll millions of acres in targeted landscape initiatives – and today’s report once again highlights the positive impact this work can have across the nation.\nFrom clean soil to healthier water, the benefits of conservation impact every American – and they’re one reason why USDA is pressing Congress this fall to provide a comprehensive, multiyear Food, Farm and Jobs Bill that continues our record conservation efforts.\nA new Farm Bill would continue targeted conservation efforts on working lands that ensure soil quality, water quality, erosion control, forest restoration, and wildlife habitat.  It would continue major working land programs such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and Conservation Stewardship Program, through which USDA has provided more than 190,000 landowner contracts since , as well as the Conservation Reserve Program under which we have held a signup each year during this Administration.\nA new Farm Bill would also ensure that tens of millions of acres remain in conservation practices by linking crop insurance compliance to conservation program participation.\nAcross the nation, our farmers, ranchers and landowners are stepping up to protect our natural resources. They deserve our support – and the most important thing that can happen today is for Congress to achieve passage of a new Food, Farm and Jobs Bill that stands by producers and continues our long legacy of conservation.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Chesapeake Bay Watershed\n Conservation\n CRP\n CSP\n EQIP\n Farm Bill\n Farmers\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n NRCS\n Producers\n Ranchers\n Secretary's Column\n Soil\n Tom Vilsack",

The Secretary made the announcement while visiting a farm in Illinois.\"These grants promote creativity and problem-solving efforts that benefit farmers and ranchers and protect our natural resources,\" Vilsack said. \"They're critical in sparking new ideas and techniques for conservation on America's private lands and improving the environment.\"The grants announced today are funded through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program. Grantees must work with producers and forestland owners to develop and demonstrate the new technologies and approaches. At least 50 percent of the total cost of CIG projects must come from non-federal matching funds, including cash and in-kind contributions provided by the grant recipient.Vilsack made the announcement while visiting a corn and soybean farm owned by David and Tamara Erickson and their sons, Nicholas and Bradley. The Ericksons have a five-year Conservation Stewardship Program contract with USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service and have also received technical assistance from NRCS. The Secretary saw soil conservation practices including \"no till\" and grassed waterways to reduce runoff. He viewed soil cores which demonstrate the benefits of efforts to improve soil health.The National Corn Growers Association and the National Association of Conservation Districts, both involved with conservation activities in Illinois, are receiving grant awards to demonstrate the use of best management practices such as conservation tillage, cover crops and advanced nutrient management to address soil health concerns. Almost half of the grants announced today support the agency's priority of getting more conservation on the ground by improving the health of our nation's soils. The National Corn Growers Association will receive almost $1 million to promote soil management practices aimed at improving productivity, profitability and environmental outcomes in seven states. The National Association of Conservation Districts will receive $750,000 to fund a project to significantly increase the number of farmed acres nationwide (including Illinois) that are successfully managed for soil health.Other organizations, tribes and academic institutions will receive funding for conservation projects. For example, the University of California will receive almost $229,000 for the second phase of a project to support using native bees to supplement crop pollination. Montana State University will receive $50,000 to study ways to improve sage grouse chick and brood survival. The University of Missouri will receive almost $368,000 to work on an energy recovery system that field tests show could reduce energy consumption in poultry houses by 40-50 percent. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University will receive almost $382,000 to continue to develop procedures to improve soil health and increase the acreage being managed with conservation tillage practices. In Arizona, the Navajo Nation will receive over $28,000 for mule deer conservation efforts, and the First Nations Development Institute will receive almost $69,000 to develop a conservation planning process, led by Navajo livestock producers on the Navajo Reservation.Seven of the approved grants support conservation technologies and approaches to help farmers and ranchers who historically have not had equal access to agricultural programs because of race or ethnicity, or who have limited resources, or who are beginning farmers and ranchers.A full list of recipients is available here: in the following States were selected for awards: Ala., Alaska, Ariz., Ark., Calif., Colo., Fla., Ga., Hawaii, Idaho, Ill., Ind., Iowa, Kan., La., Minn., Miss., Mont., Mo., N.C., N.D., Neb., N.Y., Ohio, Okla., Ore., Penn., S.C., Tenn., Texas, Utah, Va., Vt., W.Va., Wash., Wis., and also the District of Columbia.Soil health is the foundation and future of sustainable agriculture, enabling producers to fare better against drought and other climatic extremes while increasing production. They have greater water holding capacity, increase water infiltration, reduce soil erosion, decrease soil compaction, improve crop productivity, and improve our natural resource condition.NRCS has offered this grant program since , investing in ways to demonstrate and transfer efficient and environmentally friendly farming and ranching. In the past years, the grants have helped develop trading markets for water quality and have shown how farmers and ranchers may use fertilizer, water and energy more efficiently. Since through this year's funding, 323 projects were or are slated to be awarded for a total $126 million investment in novel conservation.To enhance the value and adoption of previous CIG results, a new search tool is available on the website for past awarded projects.For more on this grant program, visit USDA's Conservation Innovation Grants webpage.The announcement of today's funding was made possible by the Farm Bill. The Farm Bill builds on historic economic gains in rural America over the past five years, while achieving meaningful reform and billions of dollars in savings for taxpayers. Since enactment, USDA has made significant progress to implement each provision of this critical legislation, including providing disaster relief to farmers and ranchers; strengthening risk management tools; expanding access to rural credit; funding critical research; establishing innovative public-private conservation partnerships; developing new markets for rural-made products; and investing in infrastructure, housing and community facilities to help improve the quality of life in rural America.

An outbreak of exotic fruit flies—one of the most destructive pests of fruit and vegetables—could threaten Florida’s powerhouse agricultural industry. By detecting these pests early and responding rapidly, USDA, FDACS, county officials, and growers can avoid large-scale agricultural losses and keep valuable export markets open.\nIn August , some of those traps captured Oriental fruit flies (OFF) in Miami-Dade County.\nThe OFF attacks more than 430 different fruits, vegetables, and nuts, including avocado, mango, guava, papaya, and pitaya.

Salako was recently accepted to Pitzer College after writing an essay about his experiences with this community food project.\nIt began with the desire of a group of South Los Angeles high school students to increase access to more effective nutrition education at their school.  They started small—a monthly guest speaker, bags of veggies, cutting boards, and nutrition education. Now, their efforts have blossomed and manifested into RootDownLA, a community food project operating in three South Los Angeles neighborhoods with the help of the youth participants, referred to as Cultivars.\nAs a recipient of a $226,705 Community Food Project grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), this youth-driven organization works closely with members of the community to grow fresh fruits and vegetables and provide access to more quality food. The major encouragement of all of RootDown LA’s activities is for people to choose to eat good food.\n“In , the NIFA grant let us develop a 13-week training program that prepares youth to increase supplies of fresh food in their communities,” said Megan Hanson, RootDown LA’s executive director. “Youth trainees learn to design, install, and maintain gardens that are located in the yards of homes that neighbor their schools. These youth also distribute food from gardens within the community.”\nHanson added, “We are making the consumption of fresh food a more realistic daily option for community members by growing food right in neighbors’ yards and promoting and distributing it both in and around the high schools where students and their families interact every day.”\nThe impact also goes beyond nutrition and access to food; RootDown LA provides employment for local youth to manage activities at their various sites. Many early participants are now paid staff who handle day-to-day operations and manage youth interns and the network of neighborhood gardens.\n“The youth in our programs have had tremendous success demonstrating that they are completely capable of co-creating and facilitating effective nutrition, cooking, and horticultural programs that get more of their neighbors wanting to eat their veggies,” Hanson said.\nNIFA’s Community Food Projects Competitive Grant Program administers all community food project grants, seeking to increase self-reliance within communities, access to quality foods, community outreach, and provide assistance to projects.\n“There is that saying, ‘Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.’ Well, RootDown LA taught me that it’s not about how much space you have, it’s about how you use the space,” said Jocelyn Ramirez, one of RootDown LA’s Cultivars. “Why feed your lawn when your lawn can start feeding you?”\nNIFA’s mission: Invest in and advance agricultural research, education, and extension to solve societal challenges. NIFA’s vision: Catalyze transformative discoveries, education, and engagement to address agricultural challenges.

The center is a great example of the opportunities that exist when we brings together federal, state and local resources. The center is designed to meet the growing needs of farmers, agri-entrepreneurs and other businesses by helping them overcome the financial obstacles and start-up costs of constructing a commercial kitchen.\nOne such entrepreneur is Ron Reed, owner and expert at Ron Reed’s Signature Barbeque Sauce Company. Ron was one of six small businesses, and four barbeque sauce companies utilizing the facility to cook and prepare his signature sauce.  Ron uses the kitchen on a basis and pays a rental fee that grants him access to equipment that would otherwise cost him tens of thousands of dollars and prevent him from pursuing his dream.\nThe importance of these programs for developing and strengthening rural economies is clearly stated in Ron’s own words:\n”USDA's commitment to the future of rural communities truly does impact folks like me. I have always had a passion for cooking and an entrepreneurial spirit. The support that the USDA has provided to the Cumberland Culinary Center has given me the opportunity to take my passion and turn it into a growing business, that one day will assist with adding jobs to our local community.”\nAgriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan joins Ron Reed at the Cumberland Culinary Center. \nNow this is where the competition started to heat up. The Center is also home to another three barbeque entrepreneurs - R&R Condiments, producer of OL’ SOUTH Fine Swine Bar-B-Que Sauce, BBQ Fight Club sauces, and Smokey’s Gourmet Products, producer of Smokey Cornwall’s BBQ Sauce.\nNot wanting to get caught in the middle of what clearly involves a lot of time, hard work, and culinary creativity, I will leave judgment on this battle to the more seasoned barbeque connoisseurs.\nIf you have a small business or a dream that you want to pursue, I encourage you to follow in Ron’s footsteps and reach out to your local USDA Rural Development office.\n Category/Topic:\n USDA Results\n Tags:\n Cumberland Culinary Center\n Kathleen Merrigan\n Rural Business Enterprise Grant program\n Tennessee",

The TMCF Internship Program is one of many that enable USDA to recruit a diverse workforce while helping students gain the valuable knowledge and skills needed for employment with one of USDA’s agencies and offices.\nThe students from the 47 publicly supported historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) were selected by one of the following USDA agencies for their 10-week internship: Farm Service Agency, Foreign Agricultural Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights.\nThe TMCF Internship Program accepts undergraduate students with at least a sophomore standing, as well as graduate and professional students. Applicants must maintain at least a 3.0 G.P.A. along with strong verbal and written communication skills. They must be able to demonstrate initiative and drive in science, technology, engineering, agriculture, mathematics or business. Candidates apply during the fall semester and are selected on a rolling basis for their internships by the USDA agencies based on their interest and major. All students receive a stipend and housing allowance for their internships.\n“Internships play a crucial role in shaping one’s career and are stepping stones that allow students to gain a competitive edge when applying to graduate school or entering the workforce,” said Travis Johnson, USDA liaison with Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement (OPPE), which oversees the program. “USDA’s partnership with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund not only allows our students to stand out among other job applicants, but also gives them access to executive mentorship and valuable resources.”\nThrough this experience, students grow both personally and professionally while developing key leadership skills and getting a chance to apply their college learning to real-world challenges.\n“Being in the USDA office and meeting everyone from different divisions allows you to have a better understanding of what the various USDA agencies do,” said Jayme Beasley, a Thurgood Marshall College Fund intern who worked with USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service. “Having this knowledge also gives you an advantage when applying for jobs on USAJobs.gov because the internship gives you the experience and language to use in your resume.”\nTo be notified about future TMCF Internship Program and other student opportunities, sign up to receive OPPE notifications.\n Category/Topic:\n Equity\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement\n OPPE\n students\n college\n Thurgood Marshall College Fund\n intern\n Internships\n careers\n jobs\n You May Also Like\n National Scholar’s Roots Run Deep in Agriculture\n CAPAL Intern Driven to Change Food Insecurity\n HEP/CAMP Intern Draws Inspiration from USDA",

It’s part of a pilot program funded by a grant from the Forest Service’s National Fire Plan. In , the Darby School District was the first in the state to have a biomass system.\nSince installing the biomass boiler the program has provided significant savings – up to $200,000 this past year alone helping the school system meet its yearly budget requirements.\nBecause Darby High School has successfully demonstrated the use of forest biomass as a renewable energy source, other regions in the West have used the Darby boiler system as a best practice example.\nBurning wood is considered \"carbon neutral\" because, as trees grow, they pull carbon out of the atmosphere and when they die, decompose, or are burned they release that same amount of carbon. With this, there is no net gain of CO2 in the atmosphere and growing plants and trees will continue to cycle that CO2.  Compare this to the burning of fossil fuels like petroleum and natural gas, which release old carbon that has been deep in the earth for millions of years, creating a carbon imbalance in the atmosphere which contributes to global warming.\nBy promoting and developing the utilization of forest biomass for energy, the Fuels for Schools and Beyond program achieves several goals in the national interest:\nStrengthens local economies.\nReduces national dependency on foreign oil and non-renewable fossil fuels.\nReduces greenhouse gas emissions.\nProvides financial incentives for treating hazardous fuels by creating markets for otherwise wasted woody material.\nEncourages community engagement in national forest management.\nReduces and stabilizes heating costs for public facilities.\nReduces air pollution from open-pile slash burning.\nDarby High School students learn about the biomass system, part of a pilot program funded by a grant from the Forest Service’s National Fire Plan and aid from the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation.\n Category/Topic:\n Energy\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Biomass\n Darby School District\n Energy\n Forestry\n FS\n Fuels for Schools and Beyond\n Montana",

Follow along on the USDA blog. \nWhen the Cheyenne River Youth Project (CRYP) first began its organic garden in , staff members at the 26-year-old not-for-profit youth organization scarcely could have imagined where that little garden would take them. Now, 16 years later, the thriving two-acre Winyan Toka Win (“Leading Lady”) garden located in Eagle Butte, South Dakota is the beating heart of the youth project — and it’s quickly becoming a veritable micro farm.\nToday, sustainable agriculture at CRYP supports nutritious meals and snacks at the main youth center for children four to twelve and at the Cokata Wiconi teen center.  It also provides fresh ingredients for the seasonal Leading Lady Farmers Market. To continue pursuing the long-term vision for the initiative, CRYP has invested in a new irrigation system, a composting system and a garden redesign.\nThe most recent garden upgrades began last fall when CRYP began the process of installing the new irrigation system, made possible through the USDA Rural Development Community Facilities program.\nJulie Garreau, CRYP’s executive director, said she hopes the new planting areas and water system will allow the youth project to increase its yields by up to 50 percent and also to increase outdoor-classroom use among teen interns who wish to become gardeners and farmers.\nThe internships available for youth summer interns, ages 12-17 allow work on special wellness projects and on programs related to the two-acre, naturally grown, pesticide-free Winyan Toka Win garden.\nInterns commit to working a total of 60 hours at CRYP’s East Lincoln Street campus before school resumes in the fall. Thanks to funding from Diabetes Action Research (DARE) each intern receives a $500 stipend at the conclusion of his or her summer internship.\nEthnobotanist Steven Bond worked closely with CRYP to design the new irrigation system and develop the new garden layout to increase production. Bond currently works for the Intertribal Agriculture Council as technical assistance specialist in the Eastern Oklahoma Region and Western Region. “Steven has a wealth of knowledge about sustainable stewardship of the land, and his input was immensely helpful in starting to design and implement an even more sustainable and productive garden at CRYP,” Garreau said.\nBond has worked with CRYP in the past, discussing nutrition with staff for youth cooking classes and teaching community classes in Modern Gardening Basics and Advanced Gardening / Farming.\n“CRYP is a valuable resource for this community and should be considered an excellent example for other tribes and nontribal communities,” said Bond. “The Intertribal Agriculture Council was honored to be included by the youth project in its mission to increase the quality of life of children and the Cheyenne River community by providing resources and also sharing with folks ways to develop sustainable agriculture practices to generate wealth and ensure sovereignty.”\nBy late May CRYP completed all underground installations and all new mounds. Staff, teen interns and volunteers then began planting each of the six new growing areas, complete with their drip lines and irrigation system support. By the end of summer the team had planted radishes, lettuce, squash, carrots, beets, broccoli, cabbage, tomatoes, several pepper varieties, strawberries and asparagus.\nCRYP closes out another successful growing season and will continue to thrive and expand thanks to hard work led by committed volunteers and staff and partnerships and resources from USDA Rural Development, South Dakota Department of Agriculture, Native Agriculture and Food Systems, Honor the Earth, Running Strong for American Indian Youth, the Wellmark Foundation, Northwest Area Foundation and the J.R.

        "content": "USDA Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Mar 18, \nMore than 4,200 markets and direct marketing farmers now redeem SNAP benefits across the country. Farmers’ market incentive programs, which couple access to healthy foods with incentives to purchase healthy products while at the market, help SNAP recipients consume a healthy diet.\nAs spring marches closer, farmers markets across the country are ramping up or reopening for the season. In addition to year-round staples like local milk, meat, and grains, the stars of the season—asparagus, onions, new potatoes, lamb, and greens of all varieties—are beginning to make their debuts. In a few months’ time, the markets will be in full swing, bursting with berries and zucchini and other summer fruits and vegetables. Here at USDA, we’re working hard to ensure participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have access to this healthful, local bounty.\nRemarkable progress has been made in providing better access to the nation’s 8,200 farmers markets and farm stands; more than 4,200 markets and direct marketing farmers now redeem SNAP benefits.  Beyond providing heightened access to farmers markets, we know that coupling access with incentives to purchase healthy products while at the market helps SNAP recipients consume a healthy diet. A new report from USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service makes clear that private sector organizations share the goal of increasing access and incentives, and are willing to dedicate financial resources to ensuring the success of this approach. Researchers for the Farmers Market Incentive Provider Study interviewed representatives from more than 100 organizations that provide financial incentives to SNAP participants redeeming their benefits at farmers markets.  Wholesome Wave is a great example of a not-for-profit organization that partners with 305 farmers markets in 24 states with nutrition incentive programs for doubling SNAP, WIC, and Senior Farmers Market vouchers at farmers markets.\nThe USDA report researched how these organizations design and run their incentive programs, how they choose markets to participate, and how they evaluate the success of their efforts. The study also identified challenges that they face; it’s no surprise that securing sustained funding topped the list.\nFarmer’s market incentive programs are discovering new partnerships and affinities with health care organizations, local public health efforts, philanthropies, donors, and others in support of their work.  But the need for institutional local support far exceeds current private reserves.  In that regard, I am happy to report that the new Agriculture Act of enacted and signed by President Obama provides additional support for incentive programs.  Although the details are still being finalized, the legislation includes $100 million in grant money to provide federal matching funds for incentive projects that increase the amount of fruits and vegetables bought by SNAP households.  State, local, and tribal agencies; nonprofits; SNAP-authorized retailers; and economic development agencies, among others, are eligible to apply for the grants.\nI’m encouraged by the efforts of the many incentive providers and partners highlighted in the study, and pleased that soon USDA will be able to contribute much needed financial resources to augment the impact of these important programs. It’s clear that in working together we can help SNAP participants fill their farmer’s market baskets with items sure to support a healthy diet and a healthy farm economy in communities across the country.\nAnd that is the kind of ‘yield’ that both farmers and consumers alike can applaud.\nEditor’s Note: To further enhance SNAP redemptions at farmers markets, USDA also recently funded the creation of MarketLink.org, a website that assists farmers markets in becoming SNAP-authorized and helps them determine whether they are eligible for no-cost Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) equipment.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n EBT\n Farm Bill\n Farmers Markets\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n Food Stamps\n fresh fruits and vegetables\n HealthierNextGen\n Kevin Concannon\n KYF2\n President Obama\n Senior Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program\n SNAP\n WIC",

Yet for members of the Round Valley Tribes, a recent walk through the Mendocino National Forest in California was more than a time to contemplate—it was a time to remember an agonizing event in history.\nThis autumn marked the 150th anniversary of the Nome Cult Walk, a forced relocation of 461 Native Americans from Chico, Calif., to the Nome Cult Reservation, near Covelo, Calif. Only 277 of those completed the forced march that passed through what is the heart of today’s Mendocino National Forest.

They all braved the winter weather and traveled to the site of Super Bowl XLV to support the Fuel Up to Play 60 (FUTP60) program. FUTP60 conducted a kids’ football clinic at the NFL Experience, an interactive theme park at the Dallas Convention Center. The clinic, aimed at kids,  focused on the fundamentals to improve nutrition and physical activity in their schools and personal lives.\nKids from the local school district and beyond arrived at the converted Astroturf playing field, anxious to get moving. The buzz in the air wasn’t from the Katy Perry song reverberating throughout the arena; it was the excitement of kids anxiously awaiting the chance to run on the field to learn from the pros – Cowboy’s linebacker DeMarcus Ware and Colts’ wide receiver Reggie Wayne.\nAfter encouraging the kids to eat healthy and stay active, Secretary Vilsack introduced them to the dairy farmers on hand, who are working hard to provide kids across the nation with the dairy products that are so critical to a nutritious diet. While two major dairy states were represented in the Super Bowl, I have to say that it looked like more of the farmers on hand were backing the Steelers, rather than the Green Bay Cheeseheads.\nAs the players took to the field the kids were all high-fives and cheers. The impact and influence of high profile players and role models, committed to living a healthy and active life, cannot be overstated. You could see it clearly in the wide-eyed stares and smiles of every child as they clung to every word from the NFL pros.\nAs the players and kids ran through ladder and reception drills the excitement was overwhelming – we were all ready to suit up for the big game.  Not wanting to get hit by an overthrown pass from DeMarcus, I headed to the sideline where parents stood with cameras in hand and was caught up in a conversation between Secretary Vilsack and a Steelers fan.  The Steelers fan pointed out his son and said that he couldn’t be happier to see him out there active, healthy, and having a great time.\nTwo years ago the father promised his son they could go see the Steelers play in the Super Bowl, but when the big day came, his son was in the hospital receiving a bone marrow transplant.  Fast-forward two years and this father kept his promise to take his son to a Steelers Super Bowl. Not only did they get to go, he watched on as his son joined NFL greats running, laughing and playing in perfect health.\nWhile the Super Bowl is the ultimate goal for any aspiring football player, the Fuel Up to Play 60 events were a dream come true for the kids, as well. The energy in the convention center was contagious and everyone thought of how to bring this excitement to communities across the country. Suffice it to say that FUTP60 has some big goals and some big names on board to reach those goals.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n Dallas\n DeMarcus Ware\n Fuel Up to Play 60\n NFL\n Nutrition\n Reggie Wayne\n Super Bowl XLV\n Texas\n Tom Vilsack\n video",

        "content": "Natural Resources Conservation Service, Kentucky in\n Conservation\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Oct 06, \nLarry E. King worked with NRCS to build a seasonal high tunnel on his farm in Whitley County.\nLarry E. King was raised in a family with farming roots. The very land he now farms in McCreary County, Kentucky was purchased by his mother during World War II.  He remembers his mother telling him, “If we didn’t raise it, we didn’t have it.”\nIn his late teens, King raised strawberries on the farm. His life moved away from farming at 17 when he followed in his two brothers’ footsteps and joined the Air Force.\nFor six years, King was stationed out of Little Rock, Arkansas where he worked with the mobile support systems out of the Military Airlift Command. After his military assignment, he finished college and worked for the U.S. Forest Service Civilian Conservation Corps. After a long career with the Forest Service, Larry retired a few years ago, bringing him home to the 34-acre family farm.\n“I look at this place more like a homestead than a traditional farm, because I use it to help veterans who want to get started farming,” he said. “I’m a farmer, but I’m also a philosopher.”\nKing grows blueberries, raspberries and grapes in addition to potatoes, greens, tomatoes, onions, eggplant, okra, peas and green beans. And now, thanks to a conservation program through USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), he has a new seasonal high tunnel to use as what he considers a learning center.\nThe tunnel is used to raise fruits and vegetables, and it helps promote local food sources as it lengthens growing seasons, allowing them to be grown earlier and later than normal. NRCS provides technical and financial assistance for landowners, like King, interested in seasonal high tunnels and other conservation practices through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or EQIP.\nAlso, through EQIP, NRCS is helping King transition his operation into an organic one, a multi-year process.\nOrganic farming refers to ecologically-based systems used to produce food and fiber. It relies on preventative practices for weed, insect and disease problems, uses nontoxic methods to manage problems if they do occur and improves the natural resources of the farm, including soil and water quality.\nNRCS offers assistance to farmers who are already certified organic or interested in becoming certified.\nFarming comes with many challenges, but he appreciates each one. He runs the farm on his own and occasionally has the help of his “student” veteran farmers. King said he finds farming to be therapeutic and wants to share that with his fellow veterans. He said he has a passion for helping others get on their feet, which he said is why he has worked with local governments in the area.\nHe has worked with the local government and the Grow Appalachia program to establish a local farmers market and processing center. He continues to work with the Growing Warriors project to establish additional markets.\nHis advice to those who want to get started farming is: “You can learn from both good and bad so don’t give up.” King is a member of the Disabled American Veterans, the American Legion, Growing Warriors and Kentucky Proud’s Homegrown by Heroes.  He looks forward to expanding his operation.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n Arkansas\n CCC\n Civilian Conservation Corps\n Conservation\n EQIP\n Farmers\n Forestry\n FS\n high tunnels\n Kentucky\n KYF2\n NRCS\n organic\n veterans",

Locating and learning about these special places is now easier than ever through a new interactive map. The map enables everyone to explore the 173 public projects proposed for investment in 43 states, including important waterfowl nesting habitat in the Prairie Potholes, battlefields and historic sites from Pennsylvania to Washington, scenic vistas in iconic locations like Maine’s Acadia National Park, and recreation sites in national monuments in California and Arizona.\nLand and Water Conservation funds secure access for the American public to their Federal lands.  For 50 years, the law has been one of the most successful programs for recreation and conservation in our history. LWCF has provided funding to local communities that supported the construction of more than 40,000 city parks, hiking and biking trails, and boat ramps, and access to thousands of acres of fishing and hunting and  important wildlife habitat.\n Robert Bonnie, USDA, Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment and Kristen Sarri, DOI, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Policy Management and Budget\n Posted in\n Conservation\n Aug 11, \n 4 Responses",

Pictured from l to r: Andrew Novakovic, DIAC chairman; Chuck Nicholson, Ph.D., California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo; Mark Stephenson, Ph.D., University of Wisconsin; Scott Brown, Ph.D., Food and Agricultural Policy research Institute; Wayne Knoblauch, Ph.D., Cornell University. \nUnless policies are changed, the volatility and price fluctuations seen by the dairy industry within the past two years will become more severe, according to a panel of dairy policy experts who presented their research findings yesterday during the USDA Dairy Industry Advisory Committee meeting.\n“There is an issue. There is a problem,” said Charles Nicholson, Ph.D., agribusiness professor at California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo. “There has been an extreme level of volatility and [if policies do not change] the length and depth of the increases and decreases will grow greater and deeper.”\nNicholson, along with three other experts addressed the 17-member advisory committee at the USDA headquarters in Washington, D.C., offering industry projections for the next eight years and several solutions that could help reduce price and income variability.\n“I’m optimistic about the next 10 years,” said Scott Brown, Ph.D., program director of livestock and dairy at the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) at the University of Missouri. “Although the volatility could be great, on average it looks better than what we just came out of.”\nFrom -09, dairy farmers suffered a loss in income as consumers and businesses cut back on the amount of milk and milk-based products they bought, creating a surplus and driving prices down. During the first quarter of , milk prices — which are based on commodity markets and fluctuate with global demand — dropped from $16.80 per cwt to $12.23 per cwt due to oversupply.\nPolicy changes to avoid these types of fluctuations were presented in a 53-page document, along with several other , outlining three programs — Legislation Introduced by Costa and Sanders, The Marginal Milk Pricing program and Elements of the Foundation for the Future program — that would allow a percentage growth in milk production per year and a market access fee per hundredweight to be paid on either all milk or marginal milk at the producer’s choice.\nBrown cautioned that although policy change is needed, a careful decision must be made in order to avoid negative consequences. “A policy or procedure that eliminates volatility may sound good, but there may be side effects,” said Brown, who alluded to an accumulation of dairy product stock, which could overhang the market. “That would cause the industry to have a slower and even longer recovery period.”\nThis is the third meeting of the Dairy Industry Advisory Committee, which was formed by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack earlier this year to review the issues of farm milk price volatility and dairy farmer profitability.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Charles Nicholson\n Dairy Industry Advisory Committee\n Marginal Milk Pricing program\n Ph.D.\n Secretary of Agriculture\n Tom Vilsack\n USDA",

These programs are critical to the health and well being of so many people which is why we’ll continue to seek the help of partners on all levels -- federal, local, state, nonprofit and community to ensure all those eligible for nutrition assistance can access these programs.   The No Kid Hungry campaign seeks to increase participation in federal nutrition assistance programs including School Breakfast Program and the Summer Food Service Program. Very timely, as Congress works to strengthen our child nutrition programs by reauthorizing the Child Nutrition Act. With a strong reauthorization bill, we can ensure that our children have a healthy start in life and provide the nutritional foundation that will carry them through to adulthood.\nSo overall, I have a good feeling about our chances for making a real difference in New Orleans and for children nationwide.  At the No Kid Hungry kick-off, it was great to see students from Success Preparatory Academy, a New Orleans charter school, participate in the event. Seeing these kids put a face on the group we are serving and showed us how children can succeed when they have access to steady and healthy meals, and a nurturing school environment.\nA few of the partners in the No Kid Hungry initiative were represented at the kick-off.

In fact, the natural, digestive regurgitation and belches from livestock ruminants contribute most to environmental methane emissions. Ruminants are grazing animals with digestive systems that ferment the cellulose in grasses and other vegetation they eat. Methane gas is released as a fermentation byproduct.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says methane accounts for about 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions — and enteric (intestinal) fermentation accounts for approximately 2.7% of that. To help this issue, scientists are turning to a seaweed compound called bromoform, which could reduce enteric methane emissions by as much as 82% when fed to ruminants as a small portion of their diet.\nStudies are underway to determine the seaweed species with the greatest potential to reduce methane. Researchers at the USDA-ARS U.S. Dairy Forage Research Center plan to include seaweed as part of dairy cattle’s diet to evaluate both lactation performance and enteric methane emissions. Expanding this nutritional supplement nationwide, and perhaps globally, could markedly reduce methane emissions, and that’s something worth boasting—not belching—about this Earth Day.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Agricultural Research Service\n ARS\n USDA Science\n Climate Change\n Livestock\n Earth Day\n You May Also Like\n USDA Nutrition Research Fuels Olympians’ Engines\n Meet Mari Gomez—Public Servant at USDA & Leader in Her Community\n Shining a Spotlight on USDA Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area Employees",

Chief Weller celebrated the good work of rice farmers who provide critical habitat for ducks and other migratory waterfowl. From L to R in the chairs: Betsy Ward, President and CEO of USA Rice; John Owen, Chairman of USA Rice Producers’ Group; George Dunklin, President of Ducks Unlimited; Dale Hall, CEO of Ducks Unlimited; and Dr. Mark Petrie, report author and Director of Conservation Planning at Ducks Unlimited. USDA photo by Tom Witham.\nRice is not just for people but for the birds, too. And a new report underlines the value of rice fields as habitat for migratory birds and other waterfowl.\nThe working rice lands report, released this week by Ducks Unlimited and the USA Rice Federation, shows that replacing rice fields with restored wetlands would cost an estimated $3.5 billion. Plus, a large amount of food available to migratory birds during winter comes from rice fields: 44 percent in California’s Central Valley and 42 percent along the Gulf of Mexico coast.\nJason Weller, chief of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, (NRCS) joined the two partners for the report’s unveiling today, noting the important relationship the agency has with both groups as well as American farmers.\n“We applaud the many rice producers who integrate extra conservation measures into their rice production to maintain water quality and provide much-needed waterfowl habitat,” he said. “The partnership between Ducks Unlimited, USA Rice and USDA offers increased technical and financial assistance to help producers accomplish these goals on their land.”\nRice farmers have used voluntary conservation work to improve their rice operations while also providing valuable habitat to birds and other environmental benefits.\nFor example, through the former Wetlands Reserve Program (now the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program), NRCS has worked with more than 12,500 farmers – and many partners like Ducks Unlimited and USA Rice Federation –  to enroll almost 2.9 million acres of wetlands.\nAfter the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, NRCS launched a new initiative, the Migratory Bird Habitat Initiative that created almost a half of million acres of critical shallow water habitat that year, providing refuge from the oil slick to millions of migratory and wintering birds. Over the next two years, farmers put conservation practices on more than 82,000 acres of land through the initiative. A large part of their work was ensuring lands in the flyway would continue to be suitable for shallow water habitat.\nThis initiative’s successes can be seen across the country. In Texas, when Taylor Wilcox of Chambers County flooded his rice fields earlier than normal through the initiative, he noticed a swelling of waterfowl and shorebirds on his land. “We have seen an exceptional increase in the amount of diversity of wildlife populations,” Wilcox said.\nAnd in Mississippi, DeSoto County rice farmer Lan Burns typically measures his yield in rice, soybeans and milo. But after participating in the initiative, he was also able to measure on the amount of migratory birds he housed. “It was great to see NRCS and farmers help with the catastrophe on the coast,” he said of how, by flooding his land early, he was able to provide forage and shelter for a wide variety of species. To hear a USDA audio report about the event, please visit the Rice Growers and Beneficial Habitat for Waterfowl audio report.\nA male mallard walks on a vegetation buffer beside a stream.

To embrace the 9th African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Forum’s theme, “New Strategies for a Changing World,” the organizers made some innovative changes, splitting the forum between Washington DC and Kansas City, Mo. Why Kansas City?\nAs a major agricultural hub, Kansas City was ideal for bringing American and African agribusinesses and investors together. It also took the forum beyond policy discussions and into the field, literally. It was the perfect place to demonstrate the close relationship between American farmers and “the people’s department,” as USDA was originally named by Abraham Lincoln.\nTom and Karla Waters explained how they plant, harvest, store, and sell crops in their seventh generation farm operation. USDA Farm Service Agency’s county director and an extension agent discussed how the Department supports smallholder farmers and large scale operations such as the Waters’ 5,000 acres through research and training at land-grant universities, and marketing and credit programs. In the Foreign Agricultural Service, I oversee capacity building and development programs, many in Africa. I talked about how our technical assistance programs help give farmers in Africa the same knowledge and tools available to farmers in the United States, through partnerships and coordination with farm groups, governments, and other public and private organizations.\nThe ministers and delegates asked questions about purchasing seeds, planting cycles, irrigation, value-added end products, how prices are determined, and how to make a profit. On the policy side, they gained valuable insight about the Farm Service Agency’s network of service centers where farm loan managers, rural development officers, and extension agents serve the agricultural needs of communities throughout the United States. By seeing the producer-government relationship in action at the farm, I hope the ministers and delegates will take some new ideas and practices to use back home.\nPat Sheikh- Deputy Administrator for Capacity Building and Development.

These efforts help farmers, ranchers and other small business owners save money on their energy bills, reduce America's dependence on foreign oil, support America's clean energy economy, and cut carbon pollution. The resources announced today are made possible by the Farm Bill.\"Developing renewable energy presents an enormous economic opportunity for rural America,\" Vilsack said. \"The funding we are making available will help farmers, ranchers, business owners, tribal organizations and other entities incorporate renewable energy and energy efficiency technology into their operations. Doing so can help a business reduce energy use and costs while improving its bottom line. While saving producers money and creating jobs, these investments reduce dependence on foreign oil and cut carbon pollution as well.\"USDA is making more than $280 million available to eligible applicants through the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). Application deadlines vary by project type and the type of assistance requested. Details on how to apply are on page 9 of the December 29, Federal Register or are available by contacting state Rural Development offices.USDA is offering grants for up to 25 percent of total project costs and loan guarantees for up to 75 percent of total project costs for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements. The REAP application window has been expanded. USDA will now accept and review loan and grant applications year-round.Eligible renewable energy projects must incorporate commercially available technology. This includes renewable energy from wind, solar, ocean, small hydropower, hydrogen, geothermal and renewable biomass (including anaerobic digesters). The maximum grant amount is $500,000, and the maximum loan amount is $25 million per applicant.Energy efficiency improvement projects eligible for REAP funding include lighting, heating, cooling, ventilation, fans, automated controls and insulation upgrades that reduce energy consumption. The maximum grant amount is $250,000, and the maximum loan amount is $25 million per applicant.USDA is offering a second type of grant to support organizations that help farmers, ranchers and small businesses conduct energy audits and operate renewable energy projects. Eligible applicants include: units of state, tribal or local governments; colleges, universities and other institutions of higher learning; rural electric cooperatives and public power entities, and conservation and development districts. The maximum grant is $100,000. Applications for these particular grants have been available since December 29 of last year and are due February 12.The REAP program was created in the Farm Bill. Because of the success of the program, Congress reauthorized it in the Farm Bill with guaranteed funding of no less than $50 million in annual funding for the duration of the 5 year bill. The Farm Bill builds on historic economic gains in rural America over the past six years while achieving meaningful reform and billions of dollars in savings for taxpayers.Since , USDA has awarded $545 million for more than 8,800 REAP projects nationwide. This includes $361 million in REAP grants and loans for more than 2,900 renewable energy systems. When fully operational, these systems are expected to generate more than 6 billion kilowatt hours annually – enough to power more than 5.5 million homes for a year.In , owners of the Ideal Dairy restaurant in Richfield, Utah, used REAP funding to install 80 solar modules and two 10-kilowatt inverters, which convert energy from solar panels to electricity. The owners have saved, on average, $400 per month. These savings have helped them preserve their restaurant and livelihood.President Obama's plan for rural America has brought about historic investment and resulted in stronger rural communities. Under the President's leadership, these investments in housing, community facilities, businesses and infrastructure have empowered rural America to continue leading the way – strengthening America's economy, small towns and rural communities. USDA's investments in rural communities support the rural way of life that stands as the backbone of our American values. is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

The eTrade Document Exchange (eTDE) System, funded by USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service through the Market Access Program, makes electronic trade documents, including official certificates, available securely through the Internet to facilitate the domestic and international movement of U.S. agricultural products.\nThis system provides users with the ability to access commodity-related trade documents as files that can be used to verify hard copy documents or to eliminate the use of hard copy documents entirely. It allows authorized product owners, buyers, carriers, brokers, and government port agents access to critical information around the clock and around the world.\nUSDA collaborates with trade associations to provide this information as an export service to the supply chain. The certificates available in the repository are provided by a variety of document providers. Some certificates are provided by USDA, some by programs under department certification, and some from commercial sources that operate independently. USDA validates the identity of each document provider and has security controls in place to ensure that certificate obtained from providers remains unaltered once it is posted to the site.\n Douglas Bailey, AMS Information Technology Service Deputy Administrator\n Posted in\n Trade\n Oct 02, \n Respond to this story",

        "content": "Rural Development Arizona Public Information Coordinator in\n Rural\n Jan 24, \n Rain poured through the roof of the old Black Canyon, Arizona, fire station, making the floor slippery and rusting the tin that covered the roof. Nonetheless, the one ambulance and fire truck that would fit into the aging metal shed still faired better than the other five vehicles parked outside. Those vehicles were not only pelted by rain and hail, but Arizona’s scorching sun baked them during much of the year—rotting the tires, fading the paint, and drying out the parts and equipment. Parking the vehicles outside also meant that the theft risk was greater, which increased insurance rates.\nA dilapidated trailer from the 70s was parked next to the shed. Three bunk beds were crammed into the small bedroom for use by fire crews. “It’s hard to recruit firefighters when they have to be housed in those conditions,” said Fire Chief Tom Birch.\nOn January 21, a large crowd gathered to officially cut the ribbon for a new fire station for Black Canyon City. The new building has plenty of room—which means that all of the Department’s vehicles can be parked inside. It also has office space, a reception area, kitchen and three bunk rooms. The total project cost was $1.5 million. USDA Rural Development funded over half of that total. The Fire Department and their long list of building fund contributors made up the difference. That list of community supporters took two full pages of small type to list in the grand opening program.\nChief Birch was joined at the ceremony by Fire District Board Members past and present, and the contractor and architect for the new facility. Also on hand were Arizona State Director of USDA Rural Development Alan Stephens, Bureau of Land Management District Manager Angelita Bulletts, Yavapai County Supervisor Tom Thurman and USDA Community Programs Director Leonard Gradillas.\n“Because of the distances involved in this rural area, our volunteers are to be here at the station during their shifts,” said Birch. “Morale has soared since we got the new station.”\nThe Spacious interior of Black Canyon City Fire Department Building-Residents line up for a potluck meal. \nThere are lots of other pluses with the new fire station.  The station is built on land close to the interstate for rapid deployment, and because the vehicles can be parked inside, BCCVFD was upgraded to a Class 5 insurance rating—significant because that means lower rates which get passed along to their customers.\nThree days after Chief Birch and his crew moved into the new fire station, they were called upon to help with a fire in the brush land to the north. “We had a call from the State Forester asking if we could help by providing a pre-stage location for their rapid-response team,” said Birch. “There would have been no way we could have provided that kind of support and assistance before,” he added. “We had the space to be able to accommodate the equipment and the personnel. Our efforts helped ensure that the brush fire did not become a bigger disaster.”\nTo find out more about how USDA’s Community Facilities Programs can help your community, click here. \n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Alan Stephens\n Arizona\n Black Canyon\n BLM\n Leonard Gradillas\n Rural Development",

The Alaskan Pacific University operated seven camps, each with about 20 athletes this summer. (Courtesy U.S. Ski Team Women’s Coach/Coach Matt Whitcomb)\nAmerica’s elite, Olympic-bound Nordic skiers have a high-altitude secret they hope will give them an edge in Sochi, Russia, during the Winter Olympics in late February.\nTeam members take a 10-minute helicopter ride from sea level up to Eagle Glacier on Alaska’s Chugach National Forest, the most northern national forest in the U.S. The environment there mimics what they expect to find in Sochi.\nThe glacier, 5,500 feet above Girdwood, Alaska, is home to the Thomas Training Center operated under permit by the Alaska Pacific University Nordic Ski Center. The ski center was established in the late s as a model for creating international success in American Nordic skiing.\n“Right now we have three ladies who have skied in the top 10,” said Erik Flora, center director and head coach. “We have Kikkan Randall, who is the overall sprint World Cup leader last year, and World Champion Holly Brooks, who is fifth in the World Cup, and Sadie Bjornsen, who is also in the top 10 in the World Cup. Right now we are one of the only clubs with three ladies in the top 10 in the World Cup. And a lot of that is due to skiing up here.”\nThe glacier presents variable conditions like those that skiers are likely to encounter when they race overseas in the world championships or the Olympics. Whether it’s soft, slushy snow or hard snow, it all helps to build technique and fitness. The regular presence of fog and clouds require skiers to sharpen all of their senses.\nFlora and his team have used those conditions to their advantage, re-creating the trails and experience racers will confront in Sochi.\nNoah Hoffman, a member of the men’s team who hopes to compete in Sochi, described the trails in Russia as some of the most difficult  he’s ever skied in the world, with the longest climb of any race course he’s ever seen. Flora created a similar layout on the glacier.\n“To be able to practice a climb of that length and that sustained effort is really important,” said Hoffman. “Sochi also has some rolling terrain with moderate steepness of hills, and on another section of the course out here [on Eagle] Erik was able to mimic that and get us a good feel for the upper part of the Sochi trail.”\nFrom the moment they exit the helicopter, walk off the rocks and onto the glacier, skiers recognize what a special place it is. Globally, there are four or five major summer skiing snowfields or glaciers that cross country skiers practice on in the summer. Eagle is unique in that you can stay in a warm dormitory right at the glacier’s edge.\n“There’s no other place in the world that’s like Eagle Glacier,” said Holly Brooks, a member of the U.S. Women’s ski team. “This is the only place you can sleep right next to a glacier and train twice a day. You wake up in the morning and walk out on snow.”\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Alaska\n Alaska Pacific University Nordic Ski Center\n Chugach National Forest\n Eagle Glacier\n Forestry\n FS\n Olympic Winter Games\n Russia\n Thomas Training Center",

        "content": "USDA Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics in\n Food and Nutrition\n Jun 04, \n The White House on June 2 convened a national forum to seek action on the problem of anti-microbial resistance. The development of antibiotics was one of the most significant medical achievements of the last century, and has helped to save millions of lives. But their overuse or misuse has resulted in the rise of bacteria strains that are resistant to antibiotics.\nThe White House has unveiled a National Action Plan designed to advance the appropriate use of antibiotics in food animals as well as promote collaborations among partners in medicine, veterinary medicine, and public health. This is consistent with a “One Health” approach that embraces the idea that a disease problem impacting the health of humans, animals, and the environment can only be solved through improved communication, cooperation, and collaboration across disciplines and institutions. USDA, which helped develop the National Action Plan, was pleased to join our many Federal partners and continue our work with the agriculture industry at the forum.\nUSDA continues to research alternatives to antibiotics, including vaccines, to reduce the use of medically important antibiotics and develop new tools to prevent and treat diseases that impact the health, welfare, and production of livestock, poultry and fish.\nFor example, recent findings by USDA Agricultural Research Service scientists suggest that lysozyme, an enzyme used in many foods and beverages can serve as a natural alternative to antibiotics used to improve feed efficiency and growth in pigs.\nAnd through our shared goal, USDA will continue working with the agriculture industry to optimize stewardship of antibiotics in food animals.  \nIn addition, collaborations among partners in medicine, veterinary medicine, and public health are being promoted to support a one health approach to the issue of antimicrobial resistance.  \nThere are a number of entities in the agriculture sector that are trying to address antibiotic stewardship. Specifically,\nFood producers and retailers are taking actions such as voluntarily phasing out the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion, providing responsible use to suppliers from whom they purchase meat, and funding research for alternative management practices that reduce the need for antibiotics.  Some store owners are committing to purchase from suppliers who already have or are phasing out the use of medically important antibiotics or that can provide them with antibiotic-free meat and poultry. \nAnimal pharmaceutical companies are committed to align their medically important antibiotic products with FDA’s guidance, including removing growth promotion uses and changing marketing status to require veterinary oversight of product use.  Further, the companies investing in vaccines, best management practices, on-farm hygiene, and proper nutritional innovations that will benefit animal health while lessening the reliance on traditional antibiotics.\nAnimal feed industry organizations and livestock and poultry farmers are educating producers and ranchers about the FDA labeling changes that will bring all feed uses of medically important antibiotics under the oversight of licensed veterinarians.  These educational campaigns are helping to make farmers aware of antimicrobial stewardship programs and keeping them updated on best practices for antimicrobial use and policy.\nLivestock and poultry farmers are conducting education and outreach campaigns to make farmers aware of antibiotic stewardship programs and keeping them updated on best practices for antibiotic use and policy.\nVeterinary, animal agriculture, and meat associations are developing and updating species-specific judicious use , conducting education campaigns on judicious use, and encouraging collection efforts. The organizations are committed to magnifying education outreach efforts through their vast networks by distributing educational material, holding symposiums to bring those in public health and agriculture together, and conducting regional workshops on new antibiotic use and veterinary oversight policies.\nAnd, general agriculture, food system non-government organizations are conducting education and outreach and developing standards with an accompanying verification program for the judicious use of medically important antibiotics in food producing animals. \nThrough this multidisciplinary approach, USDA’s objective remains to preserve, maintain or reduce health risks to animals, humans, the environment and society.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n antibiotics\n antimicrobial resistance\n ARS\n Catherine Woteki\n Farmers\n FDA\n Livestock\n Poultry\n Producers\n Ranchers\n REE\n White House",

Photo credit: USFWS/Ann Froschauer\nMost people associate pollination with bees and birds but often forget the work of their furry colleagues: bats. Bats take the night shift, playing a major role in pollinating crops and spreading seeds.\nOne important bat is the Mexican long-nose bat, which dwells in large colonies. Their range includes the southern parts of Texas, California, New Mexico and Arizona.\nThroughout time, plants and mammals have shared a dependency on one another that is mutually beneficial. So naturally, these bats feed on flowers, including those of valuable commercial crops, like figs, dates, mangoes and peaches, which have flowers that only open at night.\nThese mammal pollinators are finicky eaters with a specific palate. Dining on plant pollen and drinking sweet nectar is a delicacy at its batty-best. They tend to enjoy a flower that’s mild in scent and not bright in color. Simply speaking, white or pale crop flowers attract the night pollinators to feed on them.\nMexican long-nose bats can fly extensive distances to gather nectar from specific plants.\nA lesser long-nosed bat pollinates a cross section of a saguaro cactus flower. Photo by Merlin D. Tuttle, Bat Conservation International.\n“When they are in Texas and New Mexico, they feed on the nectar of agave flowers too,” said Cyndee Watson, a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\nThe common feeding features of pollinating bats are elongated snouts and tongues, combined with smaller and fewer teeth. This aids in the rapid collection of nectar.\n“Bats get pollen on their faces and bodies and go to the next flower. That is how cross pollination happens,” Watson said.\nMexican long-nose bats visit up to 30 flowers each night, feeding and transporting pollen.\nThey use a sonar system, through which the echoes of sound waves determine the shapes of surrounding objects. Because the powerful echoes emit higher frequencies and vibrations, bats can detect the existence of swift flying predators, too.\nThe seeds and fruits that compose part of our diet would not exist without the interaction between flowering plants and pollinators, including bats. Bats serve a purpose with other popular pollinators, and they’re just as important as the day shift birds and bees, which feed on daytime flowering plants.\nSome states where large populations of bats live are also working to ensure bats always have a place to call home after a nighttime feeding.\n“Texas is trying to install bat condo structures where the furry friends can make a home,” said James Rogers, a wildlife biologist with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service.\nNRCS works with farmers, ranchers and forest landowners to implement conservation practices on the ground that have numerous environmental benefits, including ones that provide habitat and food for pollinators.\nFor example, through the Farm Bill, landowners have an opportunity to receive financial assistance through conservation programs and practices, which can include planting cover crops and riparian buffers that target these beneficial pollinators. Bats’ survival depends on improved conservation practices to ensure they have healthy ecosystems to hang around in.\nThroughout the summer, wildlife biologists conduct nighttime surveys to learn more about the many bats that live in the Coconino National Forest. Scientists gather information about species, population, and habitat. This bat from the genus Myotis is having its wing examined.

Through it all, USDA continues to support the industry. For this year’s National Dairy Month, we’d like to highlight two major ongoing USDA programs that focus on the dairy industry.\nIn January, we announced the new Organic Dairy Marketing Assistance Program (ODMAP). ODMAP was established to help mitigate market volatility, higher input and transportation costs, and unstable feed supply and prices that have created unique hardships in the organic dairy industry. Under ODMAP, USDA’s Farm Service Agency is making $104 million available to organic dairy operations to assist with marketing costs. ODMAP began May 24 and runs through July 26, .\nAnd since their inception in , Dairy Business Innovation (DBI) Initiatives have been supporting dairy businesses in the development, production, marketing and distribution of dairy products. DBI Initiatives provide direct technical assistance and grants to dairy businesses, including niche dairy products, such as specialty cheese, or dairy products derived from the milk of a dairy animal, including cow, sheep and goat milk.\nThrough programs such as these and ongoing agency support, USDA works to protect, grow and develop the U.S. dairy industry.

Working together as a team the six of us joined in a discussion with Under Secretary Kevin Concannon and Chef Sam Kass to discuss opportunities and challenges of the Chefs Move to Schools, a program of the Let's Move! initiative.\nThe true spirit of Chefs Move to Schools (CMTS) is to engage children in their classroom through food. The program has morphed into a fun and educational program benefitting both school children and school nutrition professionals. One practice that is becoming popular is to have the program benefit both these groups; first by getting kids excited by a chef demo then having the chef step into the school kitchen, not to comment about the food, rather to work hands on with the kitchen staff to help re-educate them on basic kitchen skills. This quick educational lesson is often welcomed by the staff who see it as an opportunity to network with a local chef. Engaging organizations is important to seeing through with the success of CMTS. The American Culinary Federation, School Nutrition Association and Share Our Strength are the top three organizations involved to see through with the success of CMTS.\n Tim Cipriano, Executive Director of Food Services for New Haven Public Schools\n Posted in\n Initiatives\n Food and Nutrition\n May 06, \n Respond to this story",

Habitat for this ground-dwelling bird, native to much of the American West, has been dwindling in recent years, due to fencing, wildfires and invasive species.\nThe young adults, all residents of the Duck Valley Indian Reservation and the Battle Mountain Indian Colony, range in age from 18 to 26. They were happy to find work that would let them be outdoors and physically active. Their employment was made possible by a partnership between the Bootstraps Program of University of Nevada Cooperative Extension in Lander County and USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).\nThe Bootstraps Program teaches life skills and job responsibility by combining formal classroom instruction with real outdoor work experience. NRCS’ role was to provide technical guidance and financial assistance through its Environmental Quality Incentives Program.\nPinyon and juniper trees are cut to provide optimal growth conditions for native sagebrush.\nThe eight young people are working to restore sage-grouse habitat on 1,000 acres of public land and 400 acres of private land. Restoration means the removal of invasive pinyon pine and juniper trees in order to provide optimal conditions for the native sagebrush that provides food and cover for the greater sage-grouse.\nIn June, the Bootstraps workers received intensive training from Extension specialists covering use of chainsaws, two-way radios, satellite phones and GPS units, as well as safety, first aid and basic job skills. Once trained and equipped, they started work.\nThey removed only certain pinyon pine and juniper trees. They left old-growth trees standing, as well as trees on steep slopes, because removing them would create other problems, like erosion.\nThe cut trees were left on the ground to protect the soil from erosion and provide shelter for wildlife.\nWhen the crew wasn’t cutting trees, they were fencing springs and meadow areas to protect them from overuse by livestock or wild horses. Meadows are critical habitat for young sage-grouse.\nAn important meadow is fenced to protect critical habitat for sage-grouse.\nAll of the young adults say they have enjoyed the experience—especially working outside, and with their hands.\nMost of the pinyon pine and juniper will be cut this fall, and next year a new Bootstraps crew will finish it and start work in other areas.\nFind out more about the Environmental Quality Incentives Program.\nCheck out more conservation stories on the USDA blog.\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Conservation\n EQIP\n Nevada\n NRCS\n Tribal",

The Department of the Interior and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s Forest Service have signed an agreement with the Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to use the NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite — R series (GOES-R) to rapidly detect and report wildfire starts. Supported by a $20 million investment from the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—$10 million each from Interior and Agriculture— this new agreement will use advanced remote sensing capabilities to improve the speed and accuracy of wildfire detection.\nPresident Biden’s Investing in America agenda, through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, is bringing much-needed assistance to communities across the country — deploying innovative tools to tackle wildfires, increasing the resilience of lands facing the threat of wildland fires, and better supporting federal wildland firefighters. The law includes $5 billion for these Departments over five years to invest in preparedness, fuels management, post-fire restoration, and fire science.\n“This partnership is one of the many ways we are investing in technology to improve firefighter and community safety,” said Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack. “Wildland firefighting will always require highly skilled individuals working on the ground, but with more real-time information we can reduce the risks to crews and pilots, and improve our response time, reducing the risk to impacted communities.”\n“This collaborative effort demonstrates how the federal government is deploying resources from President Biden’s historic Investing in America agenda to improve its emergency response capabilities and address increasingly frequent and extreme climate-driven wildfires,” said Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland. “By using expanded satellite capacity to pinpoint wildfire ignitions and provide real-time for wildfire managers, this partnership with NOAA will enable the Interior and Agriculture Departments to respond to wildfires more rapidly and make informed decisions for firefighting operations and public safety.”\n“Now more than ever, the impacts of climate change are increasing the threat of wildfires across the country and thanks to President Biden’s commitment to investing in America, NOAA has been able to significantly improve fire weather forecasts to keep communities safe,” said Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “This new partnership, a result of the most ambitious climate agenda in history, will help expand our ability to detect wildfires, improve response times, and keep families in western communities out of harm’s way.”\nUse of NOAA’s GOES-R satellite will enable the Interior and Agriculture Departments to detect wildfires early, provide firefighters a more detailed look at wildfire conditions, allow faster hot spot detection, and provide the ability to track wildfire progression in real time. GOES-R series satellites are frequently capable of detecting wildfires before they are spotted on the ground or reported to 911. The satellites can also be used to pinpoint the exact location of a fire after smoke occur. These improved capabilities will support interagency efforts to protect people and communities from increasingly devastating wildfires.\nGOES-R satellite observations are not only valuable for detecting wildfires but are also critical for observing and monitoring smoke from those fires. The ability to monitor smoke plumes in near real time is particularly useful in directing firefighting efforts from the air. Deploying airplanes and helicopters for wildfire suppression efforts is often hampered by poor visibility. GOES-R satellites can help guide decisions for deploying flights by providing information on the exact location and drift of smoke from a fire. The smoke detection and monitoring information also enable better air quality forecasts to help safeguard public health. These improvements help equip communities with the information they need to assess risks and develop climate solutions—a key objective of the National Climate Resilience Framework.\nToday’s effort supports recommendations by the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission, which was established through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and charged with making recommendations to improve federal policies related to the mitigation, suppression, and management of wildland fires in the United States. In September , the Commission released a comprehensive report (, 5.3 ) to Congress outlining 148 recommendations to improve the nation’s relationship with wildfire. This collaboration advances recommendations for expanded use of wildfire detection systems and improved collaboration across organizations and jurisdictions.\n#\nUSDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer, and lender.",

        "content": "Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service in\n Research and Science\n Mar 23, \nARS scientists have shown that some tree nuts such as pistachios actually have fewer calories than previously thought by improving the method used for estimating calories.\nWe all love nuts, but we’re careful not to eat too many because of the high fat calories. Now, there may be less to worry about. In a series of studies, USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) physiologists David Baer and Janet Novotny looked at how many calories of almonds, walnuts, and pistachios are used by the human body. There are a lot of factors to consider, such as whether the nuts are raw, roasted, or ground, and how well they’re chewed.\nOver the years, nutrition science has become more sophisticated, and research by ARS scientists is showing that counting calories isn’t always as simple as it may seem.\nThe concept behind this is “bioavailability.” For example, while an ounce of almonds has approximately 160 calories, not all of those calories may be used by the human body. This is the idea of “bioavailability.” When food is eaten, it is broken down into its nutritional components, and its calories are burned for energy. However, just because nutrients are present doesn’t mean the body will readily use them. The question of whether those nutrients are “bioavailable” is being examined by scientists in the ARS Food Components and Health Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland. This lab is part of the Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center.\nIn their study, Baer and Novotny found the calorie uptake from pistachios was 22.6 calories per gram—5 percent less than the currently accepted 23.7 calories per gram. An ounce of pistachios has 161.9 calories, but only 153.8 calories are bioavailable. That may not sound like a lot, but a calorie reduction of 5 percent can be quite significant on a daily basis. There’s also a bonus. In their study, they found that pistachios lowered LDL cholesterol by 6 percent, but didn’t significantly change total plasma cholesterol.\nProviding accurate information about metabolizable energy (ME) content—or calories—of foods is important for reliable food labeling and has health ramifications, according to Novotny.\nIn another study, the team found that a 1-ounce serving of walnuts contained 146 calories, which is 39 calories—or 21 percent—less than the amount in the label, according to Baer. This finding could explain why some of us don’t gain excessive weight from eating nuts.\nBaer and his colleagues also looked at almonds, and here, too, found the trend continuing. Almonds were found to have 32 percent fewer calories of ME than determined by the Atwater factors: 129 calories instead of 168-170 calories.\nThe way nuts are processed also impacts their ME value. In whole raw nuts, the fewest fat calories were taken in. Chopped nuts provided the next fewest compared to the label, and nut butters were consistent with the fat calories on the label. So, don’t be afraid to eat those nuts!\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Agricultural Research Service\n ARS\n Research\n Nuts\n pistachios\n walnuts\n almonds\n bioavailability\n metabolizable energy\n calories\n fat calories",

Check back next Thursday for another Census Spotlight on another state and the Census of Agriculture.\nThe Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture.\nThe Census of Agriculture results are out and, just as many predicted, Ohio continues to grow agriculturally. True to our rich history, the Buckeye State is a large contributor of corn, soybeans, winter wheat, milk, hogs, poultry, and floriculture and nursery. And that is just a few of our many commodities produced in Ohio.\nAccording to the census results, there are 75,462 farms (ranking 7th nationally) on 13,960,904 acres of farm land in Ohio. Even though was a drought year, Ohio ranked 13th nationally in total sales by topping $10 billion, a whopping 42 percent increase from just five years ago, which was the last time my agency conducted the Census of Agriculture. We also ranked 10th nationally in crop sales with just under $6.6.billion and 20th nationally in livestock sales with just under $3.5 billion.\nThe majority of our agricultural income in Ohio traditionally comes from crops and was no exception. Ohio growers produced more than 436 million bushels of corn and sold nearly $2.9 billion worth of this crop. Our local growers also produced more than 200 million bushels of soybeans which results in sales of more than $2.7 billion and 31 million bushels of winter wheat, with total sales amounting to more than $223 million.\nNot to be outdone, the Livestock industry is also well represented in the Buckeye State. Ohio farmers had milk sales of over $938 million in , placing Ohio into 11th nationally in that category. And hog sales were just below that number at over $788 million in sales. In the poultry industry, Ohio ranked 2nd nationally with a layer inventory of over 28 million layers. The impact this industry has on Ohio agriculture is especially noticeable on a more local level. Ohio’s Darke and Mercer counties ranked 2nd and 3rd nationally among top layer counties in the U.S.\nIn addition to these two major agricultural sectors, the floriculture and nursery industries were also well represented in Ohio. On the floriculture side, Ohio growers surpassed $228 million in sales, ranking 6th nationally. Nursery growers sold more than $181 million in , ranking 7th nationally.\nOn the demographics side, the average age of Ohio farmers is 56.8 years, which is below than the national average of 58.3 years. More than 5,000 Ohio operators are under the age of 35 and over 20 percent of our principal operators have been operating any farm less than 10 years. Women are the principal operator on over 11 percent of Ohio farms.\nThese are just some of the exciting facts about Ohio agriculture.

        "content": "Posted by acampbell in\n Food and Nutrition\n Trade\n Mar 01, \n In keeping with USDA’s commitment to addressing global food insecurity through school feeding programs, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced that USDA will donate more than 100,000 tons of U.S. agricultural commodities valued at nearly $170 million in fiscal year under the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition (McGovern-Dole) Program.\nThe McGovern-Dole Program helps support education, child development and food security in low-income, food-deficit countries that are committed to universal education. The program has helped feed millions of children over the years and one example of the success of this program can be found in Senegal.\nChildren in 112 primary schools and 21 pre-schools and mothers and infants in 58 maternal and child health nutrition (MCHN) centers in the Matam region of Senegal are eating a daily meal and much more due to a Counterpart International (CPI) project funded by USDA’s McGovern-Dole Program.\nMost people in the Matam region are extremely poor and face high rates of malnutrition. In addition, the area receives little rainfall and food prices are inflated, making food unaffordable for vulnerable households. As a result, roughly 30 percent of children under the age of five are stunted in height and 58 percent of women of child-bearing age suffer from anemia.\nTo improve this situation, USDA donated more than 9,500 tons of crude degummed soybean oil, vegetable oil, textured soy protein and used the proceeds to provide a daily lunch to 17,774 primary school children and 1,800 pre-school children.\nAfter nearly three years of operation, this school feeding program has achieved a large measure of sustainability. Successes achieved by CPI include:\n- National and local governments created school feeding divisions, allocating more than $2 million to school feeding activities and setting aside additional funds to purchase supplementary food ingredients.\n- Nearly 450 teachers and Parent-Teacher Association members were trained in managing school feeding activities and providing proper nutrition.\n- More than 22 villages are implementing school garden activities by growing cabbage, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, eggplant and carrots.\n- Nearly 250 head nurses, community health workers, pre-school teachers and pre-school management committee members at MCHN centers were trained in weighing techniques, infant nutrition, breastfeeding, hygiene and illness prevention.\n- In addition, a joint project with the U.S. Peace Corps is reducing dependence on fuel wood for cooking by providing mud stoves to select recipients to prepare school meals and training people in 30 villages on mud stove construction techniques.\nThese accomplishments resulted in USDA renewing its McGovern-Dole agreement this year with CPI for another three years to achieve an even greater degree of sustainability.\nThe McGovern-Dole Program is administered by USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service.  More information about the program is available online at:  \nFor more information about CPI’s development work, visit \n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Trade\n Tags:\n George McGovern\n Global Food security\n Grant\n McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program\n MCHN\n Senegal\n Tom Vilsack",

        "content": "in\n Food and Nutrition\n Jun 27, \nToday, USDA is furthering its commitment to improving the way that our youngsters eat by establishing science-based, common-sense standards for snacks sold in schools. The new “Smart Snacks in School” nutrition standards will positively impact more than 50 million American youngsters by ensuring that they are offered only healthier foods at school.\nBased on feedback from nearly 250,000 parents, teachers, school food service professionals, and the food and beverage industry, we carefully balanced science-based nutrition standards, based on recommendations from the Institute of Medicine and the Dietary for Americans, with practical and flexible solutions to promote healthier eating at school.\nI’m proud that we were able to develop meaningful standards that compliment the healthier school meals introduced last fall and make the healthy choice, the easy choice for students across the school food environment – by encouraging snacks that contain whole grains, low-fat dairy, fruits, vegetables or protein as their main ingredients, and placing sensible limits on sugar, fat, and salt.\nWe were able to achieve this goal while still giving schools flexibility to continue important traditions like fundraisers and bake sales, and preserve parents’ ability to send in homemade lunches and birthday cupcakes. The new standards are also appropriately limited in scope and do not apply to foods sold at venues such as after-school sporting events or weekend school plays.\nBut we also recognize that decisions on what standards make the most sense for their communities should happen on the local level, which is why we’ve set only minimum standards that act as a consistent national baseline to provide greater certainty for food and beverage companies and for schools. States and schools with more stringent standards than what we’ve released today will be able to maintain their own policies.\nAs with the new school meals, we know that change takes time. That is why schools and snack food companies will have an entire school year to prepare for the necessary changes, and we will offer training and technical assistance every step of the way. In fact, a wide range of healthy options are already available in most food and beverage companies’ portfolios, in response to the growing call by parents and schools for healthier snack foods.\nThe Smart Snacks in School nutrition standards are the next step in our efforts to improve the health of America’s young people, but we know there is more work to be done. USDA and our partners are working hard to ensure that all children have access to affordable, nutritious food, so that America’s next generation of leaders grow up healthy and strong.\nClick to enlarge infographic. \n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Child Nutrition\n FNS\n HealthierNextGen\n Infographic\n Nutrition\n Smart Snacks in School\n Tom Vilsack\n video",

It helps build and keep wealth in rural communities. USDA is committed to making sure that people, no matter where they live, have access to high-speed internet. That’s how you grow the economy – not just in rural communities, but across the nation.”\nThe $40 million in grants comes from the fourth funding round of the ReConnect Program. The Department will announce additional investments in the coming weeks. USDA has invested $1.7 billion since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration through the ReConnect Program to bring high-speed internet access to rural Americans.\nThe three projects being announced today in New Mexico are:\n The Western New Mexico Telephone Company Inc. is receiving a $23.8 million grant to deploy a fiber-to-the-premises network to provide high-speed internet access to people in Catron County. The company will make high-speed internet affordable by participating in the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Lifeline and Affordable Connectivity Programs (ACP). It also will provide a $34.99 monthly plan with 75 megabits per second upload and download speeds for subscribers within the project area who are enrolled in the ACP.\n The E.N.M.R. Telephone Cooperative is receiving a $2.6 million grant to deploy a fiber-to-the-premises network to provide high-speed internet access to people in De Baca, Guadalupe, Harding, Quay, San Miguel, Socorro and Union counties. E.N.M.R. will make high-speed internet affordable by participating in the FCC’s Lifeline and Affordable Connectivity Programs. This project will serve socially vulnerable communities in De Baca, Guadalupe, San Miguel and Socorro counties.\n The Peñasco Valley Telephone (PVT) Cooperative is receiving a $13.9 million grant to deploy a fiber-to-the-premises network to provide high-speed internet access to 550 people, 48 farms and 11 businesses in Chaves, Eddy, Otero and Lincoln counties. PVT will make high-speed internet affordable by participating in the FCC’s Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). PVT also offers a program that can provide free internet for households participating in the ACP. This project will serve socially vulnerable communities in Chaves, Eddy and Otero counties.\nBackground: ReConnect Program\nTo be eligible for ReConnect Program funding, an applicant must serve an area that lacks access to service at speeds of 100 megabits per second (Mbps) download and 20 Mbps upload. The applicant must also commit to building facilities capable of providing high-speed internet service with speeds of 100 Mbps (download and upload) to every location in its proposed service area.\nBackground: Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\nPresident Biden forged consensus and compromise between Democrats, Republicans and Independents to demonstrate our democracy can deliver big wins for the American people. After decades of talk on rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure, President Biden delivered the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law – a historic investment in America that will change people’s lives for the better and get America moving again.\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides $65 billion to ensure every American has access to affordable, reliable high-speed internet through a historic investment in broadband infrastructure deployment. The legislation also lowers costs for internet service and helps close the digital divide, so that more Americans can take full advantage of the opportunities provided by internet access.\nTo learn more about investment resources for rural areas, visit www.rd.usda.gov or contact the nearest USDA Rural Development state office.\nUSDA Rural Development provides loans and grants to help expand economic opportunities, create jobs and improve the quality of life for millions of Americans in rural areas. This assistance supports infrastructure improvements; business development; housing; community facilities such as schools, public safety and health care; and high-speed internet access in rural, tribal and high-poverty areas.

USDA photo by Stephen Ausmus.\nLess than 2 years ago, the USDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched the U.S. Food Waste Challenge, with the goal of reducing food waste in the United States.  We set an ambitious goal of having at least 400 businesses, schools, and/or organizations join the challenge by letting us know what they are doing to reduce food waste in their operations.  USDA also committed to finding ways in which its 33 agencies and offices could help reduce food waste through policy, partnerships, and research.\nAs of today, we have surpassed our membership goal by signing up 1,313 participants in the U.S. Food Waste Challenge.\nThe number and diversity of participants joining the challenge are indicative of a growing movement to reduce food waste that is spreading across the country.\nFounding members, Rio Farms, Unilever, General Mills, and the Food Waste Reduction Alliance have been joined by members from across the food supply chain.  Hannaford, a supermarket chain in the Northeast, recently joined the U.S. Food Waste Challenge and shared the many ways in which it keeps food from ending up in landfills.  Using the “food recovery hierarchy,” Hannaford tries to reduce food waste at the source by having fresh products delivered on a daily basis instead of 3-4 times per week.  Daily deliveries lead to more accurate ordering, less food waste, and improvements in quality.  Safeway, another supermarket chain participating in the U.S. Food Waste Challenge, donates the wholesome, edible food that goes unsold in their stores to feed hungry people.  In , Safeway recovered and donated 72 million pounds of food to hunger relief organizations.\nOther participants in our challenge like K-12 schools, universities, and sports teams are also involved in food recovery and donation activities.  With the help of organizations like Campus Kitchens and Food Recovery Network, over 120 colleges and universities have started food recovery efforts in their dining facilities to donate wholesome unsold food to local food pantries.  Sports teams like the Milwaukee Brewers and movie studios like NBC Universal have also signed up for the challenge because of their work with Rock and Wrap It Up!, an organization that recovers and donates unsold food at sporting events and movie shoots.\nMoving down the food recovery hierarchy, some participants in our challenge keep food from landfills by converting it to livestock feed.  Four Minnesota schools in the Chisago Lakes School District have their food waste picked up by Barthold Pig Farm, where it is then heated and fed to pigs. The 72 McDonalds’ in Hawaii now sell their used cooking oil to Pacific Biodiesel, where it is then recycled into fuel.\nNot to be outdone by all of our U.S. Food Waste Challenge participants, the USDA also delivered on reducing food waste through our policies, partnerships, and research.  USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) continues to study and provide estimates on how much food goes uneaten at the retail and consumer level.  The estimated pounds, monetary value, and calories of food loss that USDA ERS helps policymakers, the food industry, and nonprofits better explain the food waste issue to the public, make recommendations, and set targeted goals.\nThrough the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the USDA is researching and developing new products that help 1) reduce food spoilage; 2) reuse waste from food processing to produce new value-added products; and 3) recycle food waste into livestock feed or biobased products such as biodegradable plastics. ARS, for example, helped Gorge Delight, a grower-owned business, develop a 100% fruit bar that uses blemished or damaged apples and pears from their orchards that would have otherwise been discarded.  Not only does ARS’s work help reduce food waste, but it also creates new economic opportunities in rural areas.\nFor consumers and families, USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has updated the “Ask Karen” website, which is visited over 10 million times a year, to answer people’s questions on how to safely handle, prepare, and store food.  FSIS, which is responsible for ensuring that the nation’s commercial supply of meat, poultry, and egg products is safe and correctly labeled, recently streamlined procedures for donating wholesome misbranded meat and poultry products.  In April , as a result of this directive, FSIS was involved in the donation of approximately 84,310 pounds of misbranded pork sausage.  The misbranded product was donated to the Westmoreland County Food Bank and Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank.\nFinally, here at USDA headquarters in Washington, D.C., the cafeteria, which serves up to 3,000 people a day, has found some innovative ways to reduce food waste.  The dining service company, IL Creations, holds “Happy Hour” from 2:30 pm – 3:00 pm, at which food is sold at a 30% discount to reduce the amount of unsold leftovers.  For people with eyes bigger than their stomachs, USDA has promoted composting and made it easy for employees by placing composting bins all over the building.   In , USDA headquarters composted about 2,650 pounds of food waste per week.  This represents about a 10% increase from , which is double our original goal of a 5% increase.\nThe goal we had for launching the U.S. Food Waste Challenge was to help inspire organizations and individuals across the food supply chain to start reducing, recovering, and recycling food waste in their day-to-day operations.  What we didn’t expect was how much your energy, passion, and support would push us to do more.  Indeed there is so much more work to be done to reduce food waste in America, and we want to continue working on this issue for years to come.\nUSDA FSIS recently changed on donation of mislabeled meat and poultry products. In April , this new directive led to 84,310 pounds of misbranded pork sausage being donated to local food pantries instead of being dumped into a landfill. \n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n ARS\n Ask Karen\n Compost\n EPA\n ERS\n food loss\n food recovery\n Food Safety\n Food Waste\n FSIS\n Hawaii\n Minnesota\n restaurants\n supermarkets\n U.S. Food Waste Challenge\n Washington DC",

This 40-acre lake was named after Dr. Hugh Hammond Bennett, the first chief of USDA’s Soil Conservation Service, today known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).\nIn April , that peaceful setting was threatened when record rainfall and floodwaters caused the downstream face to erode on the lake’s 80-year-old dam. The major weather event reduced the stability for the masonry rock core of the dam.\nPartnering to Reduce the Danger\nAlthough the dam was still fully functioning, the downstream slope had to be repaired. Without repair, the erosion could cause the dam to burst, washing out roads, flooding the Park Ranger’s home, and releasing tons of sediment. The community turned to the NRCS for help.\n“Funding through the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program helped to rebuild the back slope of the dam to its stable, pre-disaster condition,” said Walt Delp, state engineer for NRCS in Arkansas. “Being able to work on a project 80 years after our agency’s founder established has been an honor.”\nNRCS partnered with the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism on the Lake Bennett EWP project. Sharing the cost for construction, NRCS also provided engineering assistance and ADPT provided administrative support.\nEWP allows communities to quickly address serious and long-lasting damages to infrastructure and to the land by assisting local sponsors to prevent of further damage from natural disasters.\nPreserving the History\nMaking the repairs to the dam also preserved an important piece of conservation history. Lake Bennett watershed project was built in in partnership with the Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps to study the effects of water run-off, silt, and erosion.\nThis was the first project in the United States built to scientifically study a specific watershed. As a result of these studies, a new philosophy of land management was born.\nPrinciples tested at Lake Bennett laid the foundation for soil conservation practices considered common today. Strip cropping, terracing, crop rotation and planting soil-retaining vegetation are now soil protection methods used nationwide.\n“With the historical significance of the structure and the impact it has had on soil conservation across the country, I’m thankful I had a part in ensuring that the dam is here for years to come,” Delp said.\nMore Information\nUSDA offers a variety of risk management, disaster assistance, loan, and conservation programs to help agricultural producers across the country weather ups and downs in the market and recover from natural disasters as well as invest in improvements to their operations.

Our team is instrumental in creating awareness on the importance of healthy eating habits in all our communities.”\nPeople’s Gardens have expanded to all 50 states, three U.S. territories – including Puerto Rico – and eight foreign countries. They are located at faith-based centers, on federally leased or owned property, at schools and other places within the community.\nLush herbs and vegetables grow in La Fortaleza People’s Garden.\n“This is about a nation’s goal,” Jiménez said. “It is also the reason to spread the educational program ‘Siembra Vida,’ or ‘Planting Life,’ in the schools throughout the island. We are confident that the seed we are planting today will grow for many years to come.”\nThe People’s Garden Initiative engages USDA agencies, including USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, to help “sow” gardens across the county. Late last year, NRCS Caribbean Area Director Edwin Almodóvar honored Jiménez for her efforts, which are important in a place like Puerto Rico.\n“We import over 80 percent of what we consume on the island,” Almodóvar said. “We have had food security issues in the Caribbean for a long time. We are vulnerable to storms, markets and to many other things that happen globally.”\nBut the island’s good weather and fertile soil make it perfect for growing food, whether it’s in acres, feet or pots. He said he is glad the First Lady is working to promote home gardening.\n“For the first time, the Governor’s Mansion in Puerto Rico has a vegetable garden in the backyard,” he said. “Many students and visitors tour the vegetable garden, and it is a great educational component that not just exposes them to the work of USDA, but shows how with minimal space you can save money and enjoy while learning and eating healthy.”\nPuerto Rico’s other two People’s Gardens are located at the Mayagüez Field Office on the USDA Tropical Agriculture Research Station grounds and at the Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in San Juan.\nNRCS Caribbean presented an award to First Lady Wilma Pastrana Jiménez, second from right.

USDA is making the funding available under the ReConnect Program, which received new funding from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n“High-speed internet connects people and businesses to new markets and helps people in rural America build brighter futures,” Torres Small said. “For too long, too many rural communities have been left out of the digital economy. This funding will help everyone in America – regardless of where they live – because rural people provide the everyday essentials our country depends on. Investments like the ones we are making through President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help close the digital divide across rural America.”\nUSDA is making additional funding available for high-speed internet in Round 4 of the ReConnect Program. The Department will begin accepting applications on September 6 for up to $150 million in loans, up to $300 million in loan/grant combinations, and up to $700 million in grants. The Department will use funds appropriated under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, also known as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides a historic $65 billion investment to expand affordable, high-speed internet to all communities across the U.S.\nThe application deadline is November 2.\nUSDA has made several improvements to the ReConnect Program for Round 4. Collectively, they increase the availability of funding in rural areas where residents and businesses lack access to affordable, high-speed internet. These include:\n Allowing applicants to serve areas where at least 50% of households lack sufficient access to high-speed internet.\n Adding a funding category for projects where 90% of households lack sufficient access to high-speed internet. For applications submitted under this category, no matching funds will be .\n Waiving the matching funds requirement for: (a) Alaska Native Corporations, (b) Tribal Governments, (c) projects proposing to provide service in colonias, (d) projects proposing to serve persistent poverty counties and (e) projects proposing to provide service in socially vulnerable communities.\nAdditionally, to ensure that rural households that need internet service can afford it, all awardees under this funding round will be to apply to participate in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). The ACP offers a discount of up to $30 per month towards internet service to qualifying low-income households and up to $75 per month for households on qualifying Tribal Lands. The Department’s actions to expand high-speed internet access in rural areas are key components of the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to help America build back better in its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBackground: ReConnect Program\nTo be eligible for ReConnect Program funding, an applicant must serve an area where high-speed internet service is not available at speeds of 100 megabits per second (Mbps) (download) and 20 Mbps (upload). The applicant must also commit to building facilities capable of providing high-speed internet service at speeds of 100 Mbps (download and upload) to every location in its proposed service area.\nFor additional information, see page 0 of the August 4 Federal Register (, 231 ).\nTo learn more about investment resources for rural areas, visit www.rd.usda.gov or contact the nearest USDA Rural Development state office.\nUnder the Biden-Harris Administration, Rural Development provides loans and grants to help expand economic opportunities, create jobs and improve the quality of life for millions of Americans in rural areas. This assistance supports infrastructure improvements; business development; housing; community facilities such as schools, public safety and health care; and high-speed internet access in rural, tribal and high-poverty areas.

A new report from USDA’s Economic Research Service, Rural Manufacturing at a Glance, examines the manufacturing sector in rural America.\nManufacturing jobs in rural areas totaled about 2.5 million jobs in and pay relatively well; among all rural sectors, only mining had higher median earnings.\nThe manufacturing sector’s share of employment and earnings in rural areas began to exceed its share in urban areas in the s, when import competition forced domestic manufacturers to lower costs. Rural areas generally have lower wages, property taxes, and land prices, making these areas relatively attractive to manufacturing firms.\nOverall, manufacturing is no longer the driver of job growth that it once was. Between and , a period that included two recessions (in and -09), manufacturing employment fell close to 30 percent. In addition, 71 percent of U.S. counties experienced a decline in manufacturing employment. Counties with the largest relative declines were concentrated in the eastern United States, the traditional hub of U.S. manufacturing.\nDespite the relative importance of manufacturing to the rural economy, economic restructuring is altering job opportunities for rural areas of the country. Rural manufacturing employment was smaller both in relative and absolute terms in than in . There were 21 percent fewer manufacturing jobs while total employment grew almost 7 percent. That is, manufacturing employment became a smaller piece of a larger pie.\nWhen a manufacturing plant closes in a community, there is a reduction in local employment, earnings, and government tax revenue. To better understand factors affecting manufacturing plant survival, another ERS study, released in May, followed the plants from until the end of , if they survived that long. It found that rural plants have a higher survival rate than urban plants. All else being equal, plants in urban counties were 23 percent less likely to survive than plants in rural counties. \nSurvival rates were significantly lower for textile and apparel manufacturing industries than other industries. In rural America, textile and apparel manufacturing plants had a 26-percent survival rate between and . During the same period, rural plants as a whole had a 57-percent survival rate. Trade-related policy changes and automation were two of the reasons for textiles and apparel manufacturing declines during the study period.\nManufacturing is relatively more important to the rural economy than the urban economy.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n manufacturing\n jobs\n Economic Research Service\n Rural America\n Rural Economy",
