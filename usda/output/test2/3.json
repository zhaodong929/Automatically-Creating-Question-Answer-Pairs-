Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nTo raccoons, snakes and opossums, crayfish look pretty tasty, and large crayfish will even cannibalize their smaller kin. Crayfish, which live in rivers and streams, need instream cover to hide from all their predators. They also use cover to find food, to shelter while incubating eggs, and to keep themselves from being washed away in floods.\nSusan Adams, a fisheries research scientist for the Forest Service’s Southern Research Station, examined different types of cover in the Yazoo River basin of Mississippi to see whether crayfish used large pieces of household trash for shelter when natural cover was limited. Her findings recently appeared in the journal Environmental Management.\n Sarah Farmer, Southern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service\n Posted in\n Forestry\n Jun 03, \n Respond to this story",

With three school assemblies focusing on harvests, the popular event centered around chef-led demonstrations featuring spaghetti squash, pumpkins, and other varieties of healthful foods.\nChef Burrows said she became involved with the Chefs Move to Schools program by simply answering First Lady Michelle Obama’s call to service.  Through the initiative, the First Lady has encouraged chefs to adopt a school and work with teachers, parents, school nutritionists and administrators to help educate kids about food and nutrition.\nThe Morrison Senior Living executive chef, who works in the school’s community, chose Freemont for several reasons: “As an Executive Chef I love teaching others, especially children, about healthy and nutritious foods and how to cook them.  I know that little minds are sponges and can be inspired to do amazing things, like learning how to cook.  My Grandma Sendejar was the one who inspired me to learn when I was six years old.  I wish to give back what was so freely given to me.”\nHer story is not unique, as chefs across the country have been motivated to take their unique talents to benefit young, hungry minds in our nation’s schools.\nChef Burrows also happens to be the parent of an eighth grade student at Fremont Elementary School.  Her son has shown great interest in following in his mother’s footsteps.  Along with her other three children and husband, the family has always shared a love of eating good, nutritious food.  And this collective love of cuisine made the program a natural fit for her expertise.\n“Earlier this summer before the American Culinary Federation (ACF) National Convention, I participated in a community service event with the Chef and Child Foundation.  A group of chefs spent the day at Hermosa Village, a low-income housing development, working with the families through four food stations.  The focus was on healthy and nutritious eating.  It was an inspiring day which lead me to the Chefs Move to Schools program.”\nLast month, Burrows planned a chef demo and an on-site registration for the Chefs Move to Schools program to engage other principals in the program.  Thanks to her passion, more school leaders will likely follow her selfless lead.\nPlease follow USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service on Twitter.\nChef Melinda Burrows demonstrating different varieties of squash and pumpkins at Fremont Elementary School in Alhambra, California. \n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n Alhambra\n California\n Chefs Move to Schools\n Child Nutrition\n FNS\n Let's Move",

Consider the cornucopia. This centerpiece is symbolic of the food and thanks that we share with our friends and family. Inside, we find examples of grains, fruits, and vegetables – familiar crops that have occupied places at our tables for generations. We continue to enjoy foods made from these crops today, largely due to plant breeding efforts over the past century that significantly expanded their diversity and productivity.\nPlant breeding is the human-aided development of new plant varieties with important characteristics such as drought or pest resistance. It is one of agriculture’s most effective tools for ensuring food security and the adaptability of crops to changing conditions.\nTake grains, for instance. These iconic components of many cornucopias and fall harvests in the U.S. are some of our most important food crops. Over the past century, plant breeders from USDA and its land-grant university and private partners developed more productive and drought resistant corn. Similarly, USDA researchers working with universities and international partners developed more productive and disease-resistant wheat. These efforts contributed to what is known as the ‘Green Revolution,’ which is estimated to have saved over one billion people worldwide from starvation.\nIf we were to take a fruit from our cornucopia, say grapes, we would see a similar story where plant breeders have produced many new varieties of disease-resistant table grapes. And the same is true for vegetables. Since , extensive plant breeding research by USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and its university partners has produced over 115 new disease-resistant and productive onion varieties.\nPlant breeding programs remain just as active and important today for creating a food secure and adaptable agricultural system as they were during the Green Revolution. For example, in collaboration with ARS scientists, researchers at Washington State and Cornell Universities are currently in the process of breeding exciting and delicious new varieties of apples.\nThis year, as we celebrate the harvest, let us also remember the care and agricultural research that helped to create this bounty.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n National Institute of Food and Agriculture\n NIFA\n Office of the Chief Scientist\n plant breeding\n Agricultural Research Service\n Washington State University\n Cornell University",

The importance of this age group has been emphasized by First Lady Michelle Obama, who said that “If our kids get into the habit of getting up and playing, if their palates warm up to veggies at an early age, and if they’re not glued to a TV screen all day, they’re on their way to healthy habits for life.” So, making sure that even the youngest infants and toddlers are on the road to a healthy life is critical, and having national dietary guidance for infants and children from birth to 24 months can help make this happen.\nThe Dietary for Americans (DGA) provides sound advice for making food and physical activity choices that promote good health and a healthy weight, and help prevent disease for Americans, including Americans at increased risk of chronic disease. The DGA has traditionally focused on adults and children 2 years of age and older. Infants and toddlers from birth to 24 months of age have not been a focus in previous versions of the DGA because of their unique nutritional needs, eating patterns, and developmental stages.\n Colette I.

In their search to reach new markets, they not only compete against each other they also compete with larger establishments. To help them meet their goals, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) offers some contracts exclusively for small businesses. This allows companies with less than 500 employees to compete against similar sized organizations to provide a service or product to the government. Small businesses are the glue that holds our economy together and AMS is committed to supporting them.\nOur Commodity Procurement Staff (CPS) recently purchased 25 million pounds of fresh russet potatoes in one of our small business procurements. While reducing a potential surplus in the market caused by a nearly 9 percent increase in U.S. potato production from the previous year, the purchase also enabled small businesses to sell products to the USDA. These companies sent their products to food and nutrition programs like the National School Lunch Program and food banks.\nThe recent purchase will send 25 million pounds of fresh russet potatoes to food and nutrition programs like the National School Lunch Program and food banks. Photo courtesy of Michelle@TNS.\nAMS, along with other agencies in USDA, has employees dedicated to help small businesses understand federal procurement programs. Whether you are new to federal contracting or just learning about opportunities within USDA, there are a number of resources to help your business successfully compete for a contract.\nCompanies looking to sell products to AMS should visit our Commodity Procurement website to see the list of foods the agency purchases and how they can become an approved vendor. All offers to supply products need to be placed through our Web-based Supply Chain Management System (WBSCM). This online tool houses all of the business processes for our procurements including: orders, solicitations, bids, awards, deliveries, invoices, and payments. Last year, the system was used to purchase 10 billion pounds of food. This includes $170 million worth of protein items from our nation’s producers -- many of which were small businesses -- who were devastated by the drought.\nAMS remains committed to creating opportunities for small companies looking to do business with our agency. After you become an approved vendor, get training on the WBSCM system by checking out the schedule of upcoming training courses. New vendors should go to the new vendor page and become approved.

After all, when I was a student at the University of Michigan (Go Blue!), I volunteered at Food Gatherers. So, when asked to speak at their “The State of Our Plate” convening, I said, “Yes!” Some of the people in the room, who were classmates, continuously help federal nutrition programs operate successfully in Washtenaw County through their work to improve food access. I am deeply appreciative for their unwavering service and for showing up for families in need.\nAnother set of Michiganders that I’m fiercely proud of are the school food service professionals. I joined the Oakland County child nutrition professionals at their 42nd annual workshop: Get Your Groove On for Child Nutrition. Day after day, they are feeding our future and giving kids a healthy start. After meeting with 15 Oakland County food service directors, I learned more about their local initiatives and their thoughts on the child nutrition proposed rules.\nI heard about Oakland County’s Better with Breakfast program, a groundbreaking public/non-profit collaboration between the Oakland County Board of Commissioners, Oakland Schools, and the United Way for Southeastern Michigan. Following the meeting, I also visited Waterford Kettering High School’s early lunch service, talked with students, and met with school administrators who couldn’t agree more that hungry children don’t learn well.\nBut it is not just kids who need proper nutrition to thrive, nutrition security for all is critically important which is why USDA was thankful to be a part of the summit hosted by ProMedica and The Root Cause Coalition at Trinity Health Ann Arbor. Healthcare professionals, insurers, federal, state, and local government officials, and many others came together to discuss hunger as a public health issue. Hunger and diet-related diseases are almost entirely preventable and while USDA administers some of the most effective tools to help address these problems, USDA can’t fight this battle alone. One amazing model that provides access to healthy foods and bridges nutrition security and healthcare is The Farm at Trinity Health which I toured following the summit. Watch for an upcoming blog about The Farm and how it is growing a healthy community.

(Photo courtesy National Weather Service, Chicago, Ill., Weather Forecast Office)\nOver the past few decades, water quality in the Jelkes Creek–Fox River watershed in northern Illinois has diminished greatly.\nThat’s why USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service collaborated with the Kane-DuPage Soil & Water Conservation District and Illinois Environmental Protection Agency in on a watershed planning process with residents, environmental groups and other stakeholders.\nOne of the results of the thorough process was a watershed action plan, which was funded by NRCS partner, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. A watershed action plan is not a legally binding document, but rather a tool to help community leaders make informed decisions about water quality in a certain area.\nOne change that can negatively affect water quality in a watershed is the conversion of land from wilderness or agricultural uses to urban areas.\nThat’s because land covered with asphalt or concrete pavements can cause excessive surface water runoff from rain or snowmelt, which can contain contaminants like sediment, petroleum products from roads, and fertilizer and pesticides from yards. The water flows over the land, picking up any contaminants found there, and eventually drains into the lowest water body in the watershed—in this case Fox River and its largest tributary, Jelkes Creek.\nThe impermeable pavement typically used to create sidewalks and roads also reduces the amount of water that can be absorbed into the soil.\nThe Jelkes Creek–Fox River watershed action plan, which the conservation district developed with technical advice from NRCS, set goals for addressing water quality in the watershed—primarily reducing stormwater runoff, water pollution and soil erosion.\nWhen the conservation district obtains funds to implement the watershed action plan, NRCS will help install the conservation practices needed to protect water quality. First, though, NRCS experts will analyze where the worst of the erosion is coming from and estimate sediment delivery so that the most problematic areas in the watershed are tackled first.\nThen stormwater runoff will be reduced through the addition of rain gardens, engineered wetlands and biowales (landscaping that removes silt and pollutants). Soil erosion will be addressed with the building of stone structures that will slow the speed of water running down hills, helping to prevent soil from washing into the river.\nThe plan will be put into action not just by the conservation district and NRCS, but also the people who live in the watershed, says David Powleit, Jelkes Creek–Fox River Watershed Coalition member.\n“The development of the watershed plan offers an opportunity for citizens to get involved with the water resources out their own backdoors,” he says.\nThe Kane-DuPage Soil & Water Conservation District suggests voluntary methods for residents to enhance water quality. For example, they can sweep up yard debris, plant native plants and reduce the use of fertilizer and pesticides.\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\nCheck out other conservation-related stories on the USDA blog.\nGully erosion in the Jelkes Creek-Fox River Watershed.

(Courtesy photo American Tree Farm System)\nHurricane Michael, which roared through Florida, Alabama and Georgia on October 10, hit timberland owners and timber markets hard.\nJohn Alter and his wife Elizabeth manage more than 1,000 acres in Malone, Florida, including 18 Tree Farm stands. The Alters were honored as Florida’s Outstanding Tree Farmers of the Year in .\n“This is a true disaster,” said Alter. “My immediate focus is on determining what to do with what’s left of my timber, and I do not have access to everything right now.”\nTimber damage on John Alter’s land in Florida. The total losses to Florida timber producers and consumers from Hurricane Michael may exceed $1 billion. (Photo by John Alter)\nThe monetary estimate of timber damage in Florida alone is well over $1 billion. The hurricane also caused extensive damage in Georgia and Alabama.\nResearch shows that damage from individual storms and other forest threats, such as insects, fire, and disease, can create widespread wealth redistribution among timber land owners. The entire supply chain is impacted – from landowners to loggers to the mills and beyond. Southern Research Station Forest Economics and Policy researchers Thomas Holmes and Jeff Prestemon’s studies show that growers with damaged stands lose wealth.\n“Prices fall during the salvage period due to the spike in volume and quality degradation,” said Holmes. “Plus, not all damaged timber can be salvaged.”\nTimber growers with damaged stands and timber consumers – mills – tend to lose out, he explained. However, timber producers with undamaged stands benefit because wood is still needed, and prices can rise to make up for the lack of high-quality wood available after salvage operations. He predicts that, based on a timber market welfare analysis, the aggregate losses to timber producers and consumers in Florida from Hurricane Michael may exceed the current $1 billion estimate.\nIn the past, state governments have taken steps to assist timber managers with salvage operations. Some examples include relaxing weight limits on roads; allowing logging trucks to carry heavier loads; permitting larger than normal log storage volumes at mills; and assisting private landowners and nongovernmental organizations with salvage planning.\n“It would take 2.4 million logging trucks to remove all of the dead trees that we have in Florida as a result of this hurricane,” said Florida Forest Service State Forester/Director Jim Karels.\nThe Forest Service is supporting restoration efforts by working closely with state foresters in Florida and Georgia to increase timber sale and salvage operations. At the states’ request, agency specialists will also provide technical assistance to help private landowners write plans for treatments and get their timber to market. The Forest Service will also provide funding to state forestry agencies to administer landowner reforestation programs.\n“Active cooperation between state and federal agencies will be the key to recovery,” said Rob Doudrick, SRS Director. “Our research will provide the sound science for making decisions.”\nUsing satellite imagery, Southern Research Station scientists are able to see the impacts of Hurricane Michael’s destructive winds and Florence’s drenching rains. The ForWarn tool, which SRS scientists helped develop, reveals impacts before people can view damage on the ground.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Forest Service\n Forestry\n Southern Research Station\n Hurricane Michael",

Photo credit: Getty Images\nSweet potatoes, which are native to the Americas, sustained our founding pioneers with beneficial nutrients like beta carotene, calcium, fiber, and a host of vitamins. No wonder it’s a holiday favorite, especially during Thanksgiving. But what makes a good sweet potato?\nUSDA scientists know what it takes to make a good sweet potato, whether you like it in pies and custards, baked, as chips or French fries, and even juice or smoothies. Together, researchers with the Sweetpotato Breeding Program at North Carolina State University (NCSU) and the USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) develop sweet potato varieties for improved color, flavor and texture—testing them for sugar, starch, beta carotene, anthocyanins and other characteristics that appeal to consumers’ appetites.\n“Different sweet potato varieties with different flesh color—white, yellow, orange, and purple—are available around the world,” says Van-Den Truong, research leader at the ARS Food Science Research Unit (FSRU) in North Carolina. “But for American consumers, a good sweet potato should have a deep-orange flesh color, a good shape and size with the common skin color of light to medium rose, copper, or red. It also should have good sweetness, flavor, and moist texture.”\nTruong provides a wealth of information about sweet potato production, different varieties, genetics, storage, packing for fresh root markets, and technologies for processing into consumer food products and functional food ingredients for the food industry in his chapter in the recently published Handbook of Vegetables and Vegetable Processing, 2nd Edition. The chapter also details the nutritional quality of raw sweet potatoes and the processed products.\nARS scientists work closely with NCSU researchers, developing new varieties for commercial production that have high yields and nutritional value; are more disease and insect resistant; and can be stored for longer periods for fresh root markets and the food processing industry. Additional research involves testing new varieties for consumer preference.\nFSRU food technologist Suzanne Johanningsmeier recently showed the high potential for consumer acceptance of Evangeline, a new sweet potato variety, because of its intense orange color, flavor, and moist texture.\n“It came as no surprise that consumers preferred both Covington and Evangeline sweet potato varieties oven baked compared to cooking in the microwave due to more sweetness and flavor development and softer textures,” Johanningsmeier says.\n“We always focus on what the American consumers would like,” Truong says. “We target the orange flesh color, which is very rich in beta carotene.” Sweetness—increasing the sugar content—and texture also are important traits. ARS scientists are also evaluating purple-fleshed sweet potato varieties with high anthocyanins and antioxidants for home cooking and processed foods as well as natural colorants.\nDesired sweet potato characteristics vary somewhat depending on how they’re prepared. For making pies, scientists develop varieties that make a good puree—not too viscous, sticky, or hard to mix after cooking. For fries and chips, sweet potatoes should have higher dry-matter content for good texture, low reducing sugars, and free amino acids for less browning and low acrylamide formation during frying, Truong says.\nScientists believe that the sweet potato was domesticated more than 5,000 years ago, but there is debate as to whether this took place in South America or Central America. However, everyone agrees that the sweet potato ranks as one of the healthiest vegetables because of its high levels of vitamins A and C, iron, potassium and fiber.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Agricultural Research Service\n ARS\n sweet potatoes\n Science\n Fiber\n vegetables",

In the photo are John Dennis and USDA Rural Development State Director Virginia Manuel\nMaine USDA Rural Development State Director Virginia Manuel welcomed the Deputy Administrator for Rural Utilities (RUS) Jessica Zufolo to Maine this week for an important tribal consultation meeting with leaders of Maine’s Native American tribes.\nThe Tribal Consultation was held at the Buchanan Alumni House at the University of Maine at Orono. It began with a Native American Smudging Ceremony (a blessing to remove negative energy through smoke cleansing). At the Consultation, Deputy Administrator Zufolo and State Director Manuel met with Chiefs, Governors, and key staff from Maine's four Native American tribes for a discussion regarding the Substantially Underserved Trust Areas (SUTA) lands. The purpose of the visit was to discuss with the tribes whether they felt that programs under RUS were being maximized on tribal lands. Programs of focus are:\nRural Electrification Loans and Guaranteed Loans including the High Energy Cost Grant\nWater and Waste Disposal Loans, Guaranteed Loans, and Grants\nTelecommunications Infrastructure Loans and Guaranteed Loans\nDistance Learning and Telemedicine Loans and Grants\nBroadband Loans and Guaranteed Loans\nA discussion of key SUTA questions was held, with candid suggestions made by members of the Tribes. The comments will be shared with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to help improve the availability of RUS programs on tribal communities and in advance of the drafting of the   Farm Bill. The Deputy Administrator was also given a tour of USDA Rural Development funded projects on Indian Island by Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis.\nDeputy Administrator Zufolo said, “I am so pleased to have this opportunity to speak with  tribal leaders about serving the Substantially Underserved Trust Areas in Maine. The programs administered by the Rural Utilities Service are vital to the future of tribal communities nationwide, and meetings like this ensure the RUS programs are responding to the needs of Native American tribes in Maine and across the county and utilized to their fullest potential.”\nState Director Manuel agreed with the Deputy Administrator adding, “It is a priority of mine, and our dedicated Maine staff has a long history of working closely with the Micmac, Maliseet, Passamoquoddy, and Penobscot tribes to provide quality water and wastewater infrastructure, community facilities, homeownership and affordable housing, and economic development through our programs.  This meeting reinforces our steadfast commitment to providing opportunities to Maine’s Native American tribes.”\nFor more information about USDA’s tribal consultation efforts click here (, 323 ).\nAroostook Band of Micmacs Chief Victoria Higgins makes a comment on SUTA during the Tribal Consultation\nFront Row: USDA Rural Development Housing Programs Director Dale Holmes; Aroostook Band of Micmacs Cultural Director John Dennis; Passamaquoddy Tribe at Pleasant Point Governor Clayton Cleaves; USDA Rural Development Deputy Administrator for Rural Utilities Service (RUS) Jessica Zufolo; USDA Rural Development State Director Virginia Manuel; Aroostook Band of Micmacs Chief Victoria Higgins; Houlton Band of Maliseets Grant Writer Rosa McNally; Back Row: USDA Rural Development Secretary to the State Director Jeffrey Bergeron; USDA Rural Development Community Programs Director Ronald Lambert; USDA Rural Development Native American Outreach Coordinator Milton Ross; USDA Rural Development Business Programs Director Dean Churchill; Passamaquoddy Tribe at Indian Township Tribal Planner Dana Altvater; Passamaquoddy Tribe at Indian Township Tribal Planner Bob Tyler; USDA Rural Development Area Director Ray Roberts; USDA Rural Development Utilities Programs Specialist Gary Vanidestine; USDA Rural Development Area Director Tom Stevens\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Aroostook Band of Micmacs\n Dale Holmes\n Dean Churchill\n Gary Vanidestine\n Houlton Band of Maliseets\n Jeffrey Bergeron\n Jessica Zufolo\n Maliseet Tribe\n Micmac Tribe\n Milton Ross\n OTR\n Passamoquoddy Tribe\n Penobscot Tribe\n Ray Roberts\n RD\n Ronald Lambert\n Rural Development\n Tom Stevens\n Tribal\n USDA\n Victoria Higgins\n Virginia Manuel",

We’ve heard of such farm to summer activities – the embedding of farm to school principles within summer meals programs – from practitioners all around the country. Here in the Northeast, summer brought a wave of coordinated programming, and National Farm to School Month is the perfect time to celebrate this trend that is supporting healthy kids and communities all year long!\nVermont: Farm to School 12 Months a Year \nLast year, VT FEED secured funding from a local philanthropic partner, and embarked upon a mission to extend its robust farm to school training, coordination, and professional development services beyond the school year. The Farm to School 12-Months of the Year project provided local procurement training and guidance for summer sponsors, piloted summer meals sites over the weekend at two farmers markets, and ran food and nutrition-related activities at 10 summer sites. By continuing the strategies that have built robust farm to school programs over many years throughout the summertime, Vermont is creating consistent learning opportunities and year-round access to nutritious foods for kids across the state.\nMassachusetts: Farmers Markets as Summer Meals Sites \nFarm to summer strategies picked up steam elsewhere in the Northeast, as the Massachusetts Farm to School Project secured funding to support the opening of additional summer meals sites at natural access points for local foods and fun, healthy community activities: farmers markets! With additional planning and support from the Child Nutrition Outreach Program and Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, farmers market sites were piloted in five different communities across Massachusetts. By setting up a new site at the Greenfield, Mass., market, Greenfield Public Schools was able to add local fruits and vegetables to their menu from market producers and serve kids on Saturdays.\nConnecticut: Service Members Launch Farm to Summer Programming \nBuilding new elements of programming – like finding and buying local foods, promoting healthy menu items, running taste tests or gardening activities that get kids excited about summer meals – all take additional time and coordination. Partners in Connecticut tapped a school year resource to help sponsors make this programming possible. Fifteen FoodCorps and ten AmeriCorps service members were trained and supported by UCONN Extension, End Hunger CT!, and FoodCorps CT, with help from a USDA Farm to School Grant, and were perfectly positioned to run farm to summer activities at summer meals sites throughout the state. Local blueberry smoothies were a hit at Anna E.

(U.S. Forest Service/Sybill Amelon)\nSybill Amelon is trying to repair the damage Bram Stoker did to bats’ public image.\nA research wildlife biologist with the U.S. Forest Service’s Northern Research Station in Columbia, Mo., Amelon has introduced bats to more than 20,000 primary, secondary and college students and teachers. Over the past 20 years, she has explained bat biology and lifecycles to master naturalist classes, Audubon clubs, garden clubs and native plant societies. Through her research and conservation efforts, she has raised awareness about bat species, while inspiring people to save them.\nAmelon’s work was recently recognized with a regional Gifford Pinchot Excellence in Interpretation and Conservation Education Award, a national accolade given to Forest Service employees for achievement in environmental interpretation and conservation education. The annual award is named in honor of the first Forest Service chief.\nLong before she became a scientist, Amelon was fascinated with bats.\n“They’re such an amazing group of species,” she said. “They eat every kind of diet in the world, and they’re found everywhere but Antarctica. They’ve adapted to a niche that nothing else has adapted to.”\nWhile they amaze some of us, they have not had universal appeal, thanks in part to Mr. Stoker and the less-than-positive depictions of bats in his enduring novel “Dracula.”  Amelon tries to set the record straight:  Bats are not blind, they are no more likely to be rabid than other mammals, and getting themselves tangled in long hair is something they do mostly in summer camp mythology.\nTwo years ago, Amelon’s presentation to a group of master naturalists in St. Louis, inspired some to volunteer to help with research. Amelon outfitted them with acoustic monitoring equipment to track bats in the city’s’ urban areas. The results were surprising: the group identified active gray, red, Indiana and big brown bats in St. Louis during the summer months. The success of the project has allowed Amelon to expand her research collection to other cities, including Kansas City, Mo. and Springfield, Mo., again with the help of citizen scientists.\nAmelon says that it’s important to track bats in places where they are thriving because it may help scientists monitor the impact of white-nose syndrome. Caused by a fungal pathogen, the deadly disease was first identified in New York in and has killed thousands of hibernating bats in ates and five Canadian provinces.  “We’re losing so many bats in caves,” Amelon said. “We need to know what other habitat they are using, including urban habitat, and where they are thriving.”\nForest Service research biologist Sybill Amelon’s work on behalf of bat conservation and educational outreach was recognized this year with the Gifford Pinchot Excellence in Interpretation and Conservation Education Award.

The Tohono O’odham or “Desert People” live in the Sonoran Desert on tribal lands in the southern part of the state, bordering Mexico. The terrain is flat, dry desert and presents numerous agricultural challenges that USDA helps students address through research and hands-on training, teaching traditional scientific disciplines – but through the lens of the tribe’s needs and culture.\nThe college is doing a lot of work to keep their tribal language alive, providing language classes for all students. But science professor Dr. Teresa Newberry has taken that to a whole new level by building a Web-based database of plants that is built in three languages: English, Latin and Tohono O’odham. It’s the kind of project that integrates the native culture into learning in a practical, living way.\nThey’re also looking for ways to guarantee they’ll always be able to grow their traditional foods even in the hotter and drier climate that may lie ahead. Faculty and staff are gathering over 30 different varieties of tepary bean and working with the NRCS plant material center, propagating these varieties so they can be planted out in the field. This is a real example of connecting traditional knowledge, science and providing options to adapt to a changing climate.\nIn another study funded by USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture, students from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell are working with Tohono O’odham students and local plumbers, electricians, and others from the reservation to build a house that is totally powered by solar energy. The house has been a great success, proving to be so energy-efficient that it’s feeding energy back to the grid.\nStudents at Tohono O’odham Community College are happy that they have an option to get an education in science, and in other professions that affect agriculture, right there at home and can take the skills they learn back to their community to help solve local problems.\nMy visit to Tohono O’odham Community College was a good reminder of how our work at USDA is really woven into the fabric of the communities we serve. It also showed me how valuable it is to enhance the culture that exists in every corner of the country we touch with the advanced education, training and research support that USDA offers every day.\nUSDA Deputy Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics, Dr. Ann Bartuska, gets a tour of the solar-powered house that students from the Tohono O’odham Community College built with students and faculty from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell as part of a project funded by a USDA grant.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Massachusetts\n REE\n Science\n solar power\n Tohono O’odham Community College\n Tribal\n University of Massachusetts",

While driving for work, Enoe stopped to deliver life-saving aid to a tractor trailer driver lying on the side of the highway.\n“Myself and four other drivers pulled over to help,” Enoe said. “Together we took turns providing chest compressions for about 30 minutes. Since no one had a disposable CPR mask, we couldn’t safely provide rescue breathing but we kept the man alive until emergency medical services (EMS) arrived and took over.”\nAt the scene, EMS personnel used an automated external defibrillator (AED) to shock the man multiple times before transporting him to a nearby hospital. Enoe credits the CPR courses USDA offers and tree climber rescue drills for his lifesaving knowhow. He takes a refresher course every two years to maintain his CPR certification and every month his climbing crew stages a mock emergency rescue to keep their skills sharp.\nFour years earlier while driving to inspect a tree, Enoe’s life-saving skills were tested then too. He and Tree Climber Treavor Fry arrived moments after an elderly woman lost control and flipped her car—she was pinned inside.

Strong winds from the Pacific Ocean are a major and persistent natural disturbance. With such heavy precipitation and steep terrain, streams fill with erosion material and have the potential for unstable channel banks and upslope slides, creating challenges for scientists.\nConservation management strategies for the forest focus on restoration and maintenance of habitats that support salmonids, the northern spotted owl and marbled murrelets. The habitat conservation strategies for the Olympic are based on an experimental concept of an unzoned forest—that is, a landscape without specific areas set aside for timber management.\nOld-growth forests that once dominated the landscape still grow on some state trust lands in the Olympic as well as in the adjacent Olympic National Park and Olympic National Forest.\nBecause the area is characterized by a very high rate of tree growth, the Olympic was designated to test innovative approaches to integrate conservation and commodity production of trees.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n experimental forests\n Forestry\n FS\n Olympic Experimental State Forest\n Olympic National Forest\n Washington Department of Natural Resources",

I am going to update you on the Wastewater Treatment Plant in Port Wentworth, Georgia.\nThis Wastewater Treatment Plant is being built so that water will be clean enough to go into the Savannah River. The cost for this project is about $11,500,000. USDA Rural Development provided a low interest loan of about $4,000,000 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided $4,000,000 in grant money. The project was designed by Port City Design Group in Savannah.\nI went to the plant on Friday, September 3. When I went to visit, I met Jack Smith of Choate Construction. I toured the construction site and watched the men finishing concrete that was just poured. When he is through with the construction, the plant will treat two million gallons per day of raw sewage.\nI also went to another treatment plant near Port Wentworth to see what a plant will look like when it is finished. It was more spread out and was built a little differently but still does the same thing Port Wentworth’s plant will do. It really didn’t smell as bad as I thought it would. It still smelled; just not very bad.\nThe new plant was started in November of and should be complete in February .\nNote: Sarah Burk’s father works at the plant.  \nConstruction worker Gregory Newton at the Port Wentworth site.

We have made substantial progress towards these goals, and civil rights will remain a priority at USDA until we have truly moved into the new era I envision.\nBut for our work on civil rights to be successful and lasting, it must be part of a broader cultural change at USDA.  We began this process last year when I created a task force to build a more open, responsive, collaborative, transparent, and effective USDA.\nSo there is irony in the fact that my commitment to civil rights was a factor in the run-up and decision to ask for and accept Shirley Sherrod’s resignation as USDA State Director for Rural Development in the State of Georgia.\nFollowing that incident, I directed the USDA Acting General Counsel to conduct a review of what took place.  I wanted to determine what mistakes were made to ensure that the USDA could learn from the incident and avoid similar pitfalls in the future.\nToday, I met with Mrs. Sherrod to discuss, among other things, the review we completed of this incident and how USDA will be moving forward to address the recommendations it contains.\nThis review identified a handful of significant lessons.  Among them is that we need to improve protocols for internal communications at the Department, and create a set of safeguards to avoid the sort of hasty action which led to the mishandling of the matter with Mrs. Sherrod.  I have accepted all of these recommendations and asked that they be implemented immediately.  I know that they will help us build a more inclusive and deliberative decision-making environment and prevent similar mistakes from occurring again at USDA.\nThis experience provides an opportunity to learn from our mistakes.  But it also provides an opportunity to build a Department that empowers and respects its employees and customers.  And at the end of the day, I know that we will build a stronger Department and better serve the American people.\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack meets with Shirley Sherrod in his office at the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, August 24, .

(U.S. Forest Service photo)\nSince the second week in July, locals and visitors alike have congregated on the viewing platforms above Steep Creek near the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center in Juneau, Alaska to enjoy the sockeye salmon migration.\nFrom mid-July through the end of August, the sockeye salmon enter the creek to dig redds (nests), find mates and spawn. For thousands of viewers this annual show is seen not in person but on the screens of their computers or smart phones, thanks to the Steep Creek salmon cam.\nThe first salmon cam installation at Steep Creek was a summer project for Eagle Scouts. With the unexpected popularity of the live video stream, fisheries biologist Pete Schneider and other employees of the Tongass National Forest have made significant improvements to the original setup. A closet in the center’s pavilion was used to house electrical equipment. New trenches were dug through the woods and coaxial cables were run through hard conduit so the camera could be hard wired and not have to depend on batteries. A new, high-resolution analog camera made for divers replaced the old camera. The camera was attached to rebar similar to a tent stake and pounded into the substrate of the creek bed in only 18 inches of water, although it can appear much deeper in the video.\nPete Schneider, fisheries biologist at the Tongass National Forest, conceals the conduit leading to the Steep Creek salmon cam with rocks. (U.S. Forest Service/Teresa Haugh)\nFor Schneider, the salmon cam is more than an opportunity to entertain the public. His desire is to call attention to the unique qualities of the fish habitat of Steep Creek.\n“Steep Creek is a natural system with minimal impact from development,” Schneider said. “The importance of that cannot be overemphasized.”\nHe said that all stages of the salmon’s lifecycle can be observed at Steep Creek. Although the spawning ground is small compared to bigger systems in Alaska, at only two-thirds of a mile long, it produces a comparatively large number of fish. The lush vegetation along the stream banks is due to the constant return of the nutrients to the soil from the fish carcasses that are transported by bears and eagles.\n“Sometimes people give value to the big systems like the Mendenhall River, the Taku River, or Montana Creek,” Schneider said. “The small systems can be undervalued and overlooked. But look at what Steep Creek produces.”\nAlthough the amount of salmon currently spawning will wind down, numbers will increase again at the end of September.\n“Once the sockeye run winds down in early September, the stream will be fairly quiet,” Schneider said. “Coho (silver) salmon will then﻿ enter towards the end of September, along with Dolly Varden.”\nSteep Creek at Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau, Alaska serves as an excellent spawning ground for sockeye salmon. It is a natural system that has minimal impact from development.

The people are known for growing apples and holding the Annual Apple Festival.\nThe small village of 625, nearly flooded off the map twice in the past few years.\nNormally the river runs its course but in the Kickapoo flooded, reaching record levels of almost 20 feet. All was quiet until August, . Extensive rain in the areas upstream from Gays Mills caused flash flooding and overnight the town filled with water. Homes and businesses filled with water and many people lost everything. The river crested just below the record level of , and 75 homes were damaged.\nThen in June Gays Mills was dealt another blow. This time, the river broke its previous record and crested at 20.1 feet, seven feet above the flood stage level. During both the and floods, the water on Main Street submerged cars.\nIn October , the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) asked residents and businesses to relocate to a new site. About 150 of the village's 230 houses lie in the flood plain.\nThe planned layout of the new development outside the flood area calls for village offices and a library, along with space for a farmer’s market. Local businesses that move are expected to retain 41 jobs, and new businesses are expected to create 18 jobs within the first year. The relocation project also includes the construction of 10 townhouses and 34 single family homes for the residents.\nUSDA is a partner in the effort to help local residents.  In Rural Development awarded nearly $100,000 in a Rural Business Enterprise Grant to help businesses move. In addition, USDA Rural Development awarded the Redevelopment Authority a $1,081,500 Community Facilities Loan for the relocation/construction of a new Village Community Center in the Central Business District. The community center will house the village offices, library, a meeting room, office for the Commercial District Manager and facilities for a farmer's market.\nUSDA also awarded two Community Facilities Disaster Assistance Grants to the town. A $67,100 grant will be used to buy a previously owned pumper truck for the Fire Department, replacing a truck that is almost 40 years old. The second grant of $35,200, will help to purchase a new one-ton pick-up truck with plow to assist with snow removal, and a new trailer mounted 4-inch pump for use at the wastewater treatment plant and to help with water removal from properties during high water events.\nOther Federal and State agencies have also pitched in. In March of , a grant of $4.31 million was awarded by the Economic Development Administration to prepare a strategy for relocating the Village’s commercial district outside of the floodplain. Also in March, the Village received a $640,000 grant through the Community Development Block Grant-Emergency Assistance Program (CDBG-EAP) from the Wisconsin Department of Commerce (Commerce) to help with relocation costs.\nMore construction is expected in Gays Mills over the summer.\nThe downtown of Gays Mills was flooded when the local river jumped its banks.\nFlooding of Gays Mills shown from the air.\nGays Mills, the Apple Capital of Wisconsin\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n FEMA\n Gays Mills\n Grant\n loan\n RBEG\n Rural Business Enterprise Grant\n Rural Development\n Wisconsin",

Blake investigated a deeply incised creek behind a pile of beach drift where he found a standing burnt tree embedded in a tall bank of pumice.

(U.S. Forest Service)\nFor some, it can be a bit challenging to get in the holiday spirit in Redding, Calif., because the area typically has warm winter temperatures. But this year, residents were treated to a Dec. 6 snowstorm, which offered the Shasta-Trinity National Forest a wintery-white backdrop for its annual Operation Christmas Tree event.\nWorking in partnership with Shasta County Youth and Families Foster Care, OneSAFE Place (a women’s refuge), and the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Center, the forest invited 62 local, disadvantaged youth on Dec. 7 to kick off their holiday season on the forest.\nAbout 40 volunteers from the U.S. Forest Service and multiple partners, including the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service and Shasta College, braved the snow to help make the event a big success and bring some cheer to the children’s holiday season.\nVolunteers cooked lunch in Dutch ovens and helped with arts and crafts as they guided small groups of children through the day’s activities. Children made ornaments for the Christmas trees they received. The trees were cut off the Shasta-Trinity National Forest and provided for the event at no cost. Volunteers led the children on a tour of the smokejumper base. The children caught candy that was thrown to them by smokejumpers, who jumped from a training tower. To wrap up the day’s festivities, as with most Christmas holiday events, Santa Claus came to town complete with presents, which were provided by Toys for Tots.\n“We understand that most of the children who attend this event have seen far more than their fair share of hardship and that the Christmas trees they take home with them might be the only holiday decorations they have,” said Andrea Capps, interpretive specialist and event coordinator for the forest. “This event takes weeks to plan and certainly a lot of energy, but creating an experience like this for these children is a reward that can’t be measured. It is an honor for the Shasta-Trinity National Forest to be the host.”\nThe Shasta-Trinity National Forest has hosted Operation Christmas Tree since .\nSanta Claus visits with a group of local, disadvantaged youth during Shasta-Trinity National Forest’s annual Operation Christmas Tree event on Dec. 7.

        "content": "in\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Oct 02, \n This October, just like every other month during the school year, school menus will feature an array of products from local and regional farmers, ranchers, and fishermen. Kids of all ages will dig up lessons in school gardens, visit farms, harvest pumpkins, and don hair nets for tours of processing facilities. Science teachers – and English, math, and social studies instructors, too – will use food and agriculture as a tool in their classrooms, so that lessons about the importance of healthy eating permeate the school learning environment.\nAn investment in the health of America’s students through Farm to School is also an investment in the farmers and ranchers who grow the food and an investment in the health of local economies. In school year -, schools purchased $386 million in local food from farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and food processors and manufacturers. And an impressive 56 percent of school districts report that they will buy even more local foods in future school years. Farm to school programs exist in every state in the country.\nFor example, the Lake County Community Development Corporation in Ronan, Montana a 40 percent increase in revenues to farmers based on school sales alone. The Southwest Georgia Project, a community development non-profit, notes that “We’re actually seeing our farmers have hope. The farm to school program allows them to see an opportunity for a sustainable living for themselves and their families.” Testimonials in a USDA video released this week highlight the degree to which farm to school programs support healthy eating behaviors among children and provide positive economic impacts to local communities.\nStrengthening local food systems is one of the four pillars of USDA's commitment to rural economic development, and Farm to School programs can play an important role. To support the expansion of Farm to School programs into more schools and expand opportunity for farmers and ranchers, USDA offers grants, training, and technical assistance. Since the start of our Farm to School Grant Program in fiscal year , for example, USDA has awarded grants to 139 projects spanning 46 states and the District of Columbia, serving more than 16,200 schools and 4.55 million students, nearly 43% of whom live in rural communities.\nJust this week, I visited the George Washington Carver Elementary School in Richmond, Virginia and the Virginia State Fair to announce more than $52 million in new USDA grants nationwide to support the development of the local, regional and organic food sectors. You can learn more about USDA’s investments at www.usda.gov/results.\nAt USDA we’re transforming school food and creating a healthier next generation. We’re happy to celebrate in October, but we’re going to be cheering for schools with farm to school programs all year long. When students have experiences such as tending a school garden or visiting a farm, they’re more likely to make healthy choices in the cafeteria. I see the change every time I visit a cafeteria; students light up when meeting their farmer. They are piling their trays full of healthy foods, they are learning healthy habits that they will carry with them for life, and they are learning an appreciation for the American farmer that they will carry with them their entire lives.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n Farm Bill\n Farm to School\n Farm to School Census\n Farmers\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n Georgia\n HealthierNextGen\n KYF2\n Montana\n Nutrition\n Ranchers\n Rural Economy\n school meals\n Secretary's Column\n Tom Vilsack\n Virginia\n Washington DC",

Yesterday, I walked the grounds of the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines. The fair is refreshingly the same each year, but also a snapshot of changing rural America. The food stands, midway and cattle barns are in the same place that they’ve been for years. We’ve sculpted a \"Butter Cow\" since the early s, but now the young people all have iPods and Blackberry phones. Their parents have cell phones.\nLike the state fair, rural America is changing each year in subtle ways. Many of our grandparents and great grandparents made their homes on small farmsteads and made their living directly from the land. Today, farming is more mechanized. Farms are larger, and fewer Americans call them home. Most people who live in small towns in rural America still feel connected to the land, but they don’t necessarily depend on it for their livelihood. The demands of rural America are changing, along with the drivers of the rural economy.\nWhile at the fair, I participated in a roundtable on rural revitalization. The roundtable discussion featured some of Iowa’s top rural leaders, including Iowa Farm Bureau President Craig Lang. We discussed our vision for developing a new, strong, vibrant rural economy; one that supports food production, but also generates renewable energy while safeguarding our environmental heritage. To help drive this rural renaissance, the Obama Administration supports quality health care and educational opportunities for all Americans, availability of broadband, and safe, sanitary rural housing. It’s what rural America wants.\nAt USDA, we are moving forward to meet the changing demands of rural America. Yesterday, I announced a major USDA investment toward the Administration’s goal: loans and grants to allow farmers, ranchers, business owners and producers improve energy efficiency, develop renewable energy and cut costs. Today, I will join Commerce Secretary Locke in announcing additional projects to bring broadband to rural America.\nWhile USDA is adapting to meet the expanding needs of all of rural America, our primary purpose remains the same: to help those who live there prosper. Like the Iowa State Fair’s cattle barns and butter cow, some things at USDA remain constant, but we know that to remain vital to rural residents, we need to assist them when they ask for broadband and cell phone service, too.\n Category/Topic:\n USDA Results\n Rural\n Tags:\n Rural America\n Secretary Tom Vilsack",

The HBEER initiative has created green jobs and is bringing back 575 skilled workers and 1,000 related jobs that were lost in the houseboat manufacturing and marine industries due to the economy.\nHBEER is a partnership between the UK College of Design, the Center for Applied Energy Research at UK, the Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation (KHIC) and the Kentucky Housing Corporation (KHC). HBEER has received financing from the U.S. Department of Energy through the Kentucky Department of Local Government and the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Appalachian Regional Commission, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Economic Development Administration, Rural Local Initiatives Support Corporation and UK.\nUSDA Rural Development has worked with KHIC throughout the project, awarding the company a Rural Business Enterprise Grant which was used to establish a revolving loan fund.

And now it’s easier than ever because APHIS just made its gypsy moth inspection checklist a fillable (page 2 of our gypsy moth factsheet) that can be digitally signed, making it acceptable in all situations where the form is .\nThe gypsy moth caterpillars here in Massachusetts are ruining thousands of trees, changing the way the landscape looks.  The crabapple tree I planted two years ago didn’t bloom this year, and it may not survive these gypsy moth caterpillar attacks.  Please help prevent this insect from moving to other areas by visiting www.HungryPests.com to learn more about gypsy moth and other invasive pests we don’t want in the United States.\nGypsy moths can lay their masses on just about any outdoor item—like this lawnmower—which people could move to uninfested areas, accidentally causing great harm.\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Tags:\n APHIS\n Asian gypsy moth\n caterpillar\n European gypsy moth\n Gypsy moth\n Hungry Pests\n invasive pests\n invasive species\n Massachusetts\n moths\n Rhonda Santos\n Very Hungry Caterpillar",

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nChina is often noted for its dominant export presence in the world market. The ubiquitous “Made in China” label, found on everything from pens to smart phones has made China’s export prowess acutely visible and at times overshadowed the other side of the country’s trade relationship with the world. But in recent years, China’s potential as a significant market has drawn increasing attention.\nA new Economic Research Service (ERS) report examines China’s emergence as a major importer of agricultural products over the past decade. Between and , China’s agricultural imports grew from US$ 10 billion to about US$ 123 billion. The surge in imports has been driven by rising incomes and changing consumer preferences as well as growing demand for industrial raw materials. While bulk commodities such as soybeans and cotton remain predominant in China’s agricultural imports, consumer preferences and increased purchasing power have broadened the scope of these imports.

(NASS)\nOf the many factors that make farming risky, weather is particularly important. With this year’s unseasonably warm March, some farmers are taking a risk they hope pays off in a big way. Despite the peril of a spring frost, many farmers are planting corn almost a month earlier than the usual mid-April planting dates.\nAs they wait to see what happens with the weather, these farmers, along with analysts, policymakers and others interested in U.S. agriculture, will pay close attention to the Crop Progress report issued weekly by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS).\nThe Crop Progress report collects input from nearly 4,000 individuals whose occupations give them opportunities to make visual observations nationwide. These respondents report the progress and condition of crops weekly through various stages of development from early April through the end of November. They receive training at the beginning of each season and NASS field offices contact them routinely to ensure proper reporting.\nEach Monday morning, respondents complete the questionnaires and submit them to the NASS field offices in their states. Field office staff review the for reasonableness and consistency by comparing them with reported the previous week, reported in surrounding counties for the current week and historical averages.\nMajor weather events play a big role in determining crop progress and condition estimates. We often think of major weather events as destructive (for example, flooding rains, heavy snows or devastating droughts). But many farmers view this year’s warm March weather as a good opportunity to get in the field early and plant some corn. If the early planted crop makes it through without any late spring frosts, we could see early pollination and an early harvest. But only time, weather and the Crop Progress report will tell.\nNASS released the first weekly report on crop progress and conditions on Monday, April 2.

To embrace the 9th African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Forum’s theme, “New Strategies for a Changing World,” the organizers made some innovative changes, splitting the forum between Washington DC and Kansas City, Mo. Why Kansas City?\nAs a major agricultural hub, Kansas City was ideal for bringing American and African agribusinesses and investors together. It also took the forum beyond policy discussions and into the field, literally. It was the perfect place to demonstrate the close relationship between American farmers and “the people’s department,” as USDA was originally named by Abraham Lincoln.\nTom and Karla Waters explained how they plant, harvest, store, and sell crops in their seventh generation farm operation. USDA Farm Service Agency’s county director and an extension agent discussed how the Department supports smallholder farmers and large scale operations such as the Waters’ 5,000 acres through research and training at land-grant universities, and marketing and credit programs. In the Foreign Agricultural Service, I oversee capacity building and development programs, many in Africa. I talked about how our technical assistance programs help give farmers in Africa the same knowledge and tools available to farmers in the United States, through partnerships and coordination with farm groups, governments, and other public and private organizations.\nThe ministers and delegates asked questions about purchasing seeds, planting cycles, irrigation, value-added end products, how prices are determined, and how to make a profit. On the policy side, they gained valuable insight about the Farm Service Agency’s network of service centers where farm loan managers, rural development officers, and extension agents serve the agricultural needs of communities throughout the United States. By seeing the producer-government relationship in action at the farm, I hope the ministers and delegates will take some new ideas and practices to use back home.\nPat Sheikh- Deputy Administrator for Capacity Building and Development.

USDA photo\nAll this month we will be taking a look at what a changing climate means to Agriculture. The ten regional USDA Climate Hubs were established to synthesize and translate climate science and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers that are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA's Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate.\nIn the Northeast and Midwest U.S., a changing climate is expected to continue impacting agriculture for the foreseeable future.  From Minnesota to Maine and Maryland to Missouri, increasingly severe weather, variable temperatures, and at times droughty soil conditions are exacerbating the existing challenge of managing productive lands without degrading natural resources.  To help farmers adjust their practices or even transform their operations (“adapt”) to meet these challenges, the USDA Northeast, Midwest, and Northern Forests Climate Hubs collaborated to develop “Adaptation Resources for Agriculture,” a compilation of information about climate change considerations and responses.  Authors from the U.S. Forest Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the Agricultural Research Service teamed up to review climate change literature and develop easy to understand guidance for on-farm decision-making.\n“Adaptation Resources for Agriculture” includes a regional summary of climate change effects on agriculture, a compilation of adaptation strategies and approaches, and a workbook to identify farm specific response options leading to flexible adaptive actions.  The workbook is intended for use in a small workshop setting to enable farmer engagement in understanding how climate change impacts their enterprise and natural resources and how to respond for the benefit of current and future generations.\nBased upon the “Forest Adaptation Resources” developed by the U.S. Forest Service and Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science in and Adaptation Workbook demonstrations completed by hundreds of users across a wide variety of projects on public and private lands, “Adaptation Resources for Agriculture” has been developed specifically to meet the unique needs of agricultural producers.  Many climate science concepts apply to both agriculture and forestry anywhere in the nation, including sustaining the fundamental functions of soil and water resources, reducing the impacts of biological stressors or extreme weather, and managing the enterprise as part of a larger landscape.\nIn each region, agricultural producers will experience different types and degrees of climate change effects depending on their site specific conditions and capacity to cope with impacts or to take advantage of opportunities.   For example, the Midwest and the Northeast have experienced a significant increase in extreme precipitation since the mid-’s resulting in delayed planting, increased soil erosion, loss of nutrients, flood damage, and resulting increases in expenses or decrease in yields.  Three examples of typical farms in the region highlighted in the publication: corn and soybean production in Iowa; beef grazing in Missouri; and confined dairy in Pennsylvania, demonstrate how an adaptation perspective helps farmers overcome ever increasing challenges of climate change, as well as take advantage of possible opportunities.\nThe publication is intended to serve as a template for other regions to create adaptation strategies and approaches relevant to their expected climate change conditions and typical agricultural commodities.  It is currently under review and scheduled for public release later this year.   Several workshops are planned to introduce “Adaptation Resources for Agriculture” to educators, conservationists and producers, including a session at the Soil and Water Conservation Society annual conference in Louisville, KY in July and the National Small Farms Conference in Virginia in September.\nWhether you’re able to attend these workshops or not, you can discover more updates like this from the Northeast Climate Hub by signing-up for their newsletter and by following them on Twitter at @USDAClimateHubs.

This week we will meet them through their USDA Regional Climate Hub, today featuring California’s Jesus “Jesse” Sanchez.\nCalifornia is the nation’s number one agricultural production state with revenues of over $46 billion in . State farmers and ranchers produce a diverse array of specialty crops, field crops, and livestock products. The top five by value in were milk, almonds, grapes, cattle and calves, and strawberries.\nCalifornia is also home to more than 30 million acres of forested land, including many ecologically unique and economically important forest types as well as more than 40 million acres of rangeland. The state’s forests and grasslands, like those of other Western states, have long been shaped by fire and drought. California’s precipitation is highly variable from year to year and ranges from 60” on the North Coast to just a few inches in the southern deserts.\nCalifornia agriculture, concentrated in the Central Valley, depends heavily on irrigation from a combination of groundwater wells and surface water delivered by state and federal projects. Since , California has been in the grip of its worst drought on record.\nThrough the California Regional Climate Hub, USDA is working to bring land managers the science and tools that can help them adapt to changing weather and climate conditions. Many farmers, ranchers and land managers are already leading efforts to develop and demonstrate sustainable agricultural practices that benefit soil, air, and water quality while helping to mitigate climate change by reducing emissions.  Educators and advisors have also been crucial in bringing science-based, sustainable, and climate-informed agricultural practices to the agricultural community.\nThese trends are expected to continue and become more unpredictable in the future. The Southwest Regional Vulnerability Assessment presents an overview of current conditions and trends, and provides adaptation and mitigation strategies for land managers and advisors with the best available information. The Hubs also support the implementation of climate-informed agricultural practices so rural communities and businesses can help slow the effects of climate change while creating jobs, growing the economy, and providing the quantity and quality of food, fuel and fiber needed to meet the needs of the region, nation and world. \nThe hubs rely on the support of early-adopters to help lead the agricultural community toward sustainable and productive practices that also conserve our nation’s natural resources.  Jesus “Jesse” Sanchez was honored by the White House for his work in California.\nSanchez serves as the Farm Manager for Sano Farms, a diversified tomato, almond, wheat, garbanzo, and garlic farm spanning 4,000 acres in Firebaugh, California.  Firebaugh is a small town of about 8,000 people in the heart of the West Side of the San Joaquin Valley.  For over ten years, Sanchez has implemented innovative conservation agriculture practices including the use of cover crops and strip-tillage at Sano Farms.  These practices have resulted in considerably less use of diesel fuel, lower emissions of dust, increased soil carbon, and reductions in soil water evaporation; all of which contribute to the farm’s resilience and sustainability. He has also been an eager spokesperson for these conservation farming practices, has hosted numerous tour groups and provided many presentations to farmers from all over the world who are eager to learn from him.\nThe Champions of Change like Sanchez are making a difference in California and we look forward to working with them and others like them to pave the way to a more resilient future.\nJesse Sanchez on his farm.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n adaptation\n California\n Champions of Change\n Climate Change\n climate hub\n vulnerability\n White House",

Do you want to learn more about how to conserve as much as possible, while cultivating a thriving garden?\nThe Peoples' Garden at USDA was conceptualized to help Americans learn more about all things gardening -- and this summer, we're putting on weekly Healthy Garden Workshops to help everyone learn the ins and outs of a great garden.\nJuly 3 Kickoff Workshop\nAt the July 3 Healthy Garden Workshop, “Watering Your Lawn and Garden,” USDA experts offered a few of the scientific tricks to ensure that your plants and lawn get enough water, but not too much as well as how much water plants “drink” from the soil every week.\nFor example:\nIt helps to create a weekly watering plan, and to monitor the rainfall in your lawn/garden and subtract that amount of water from your weekly watering plan.\nPlants use approximately one inch of water from the soil each week during the summer growing season. Therefore, this amount needs to be replenished for plants to continue to grow and thrive. Depending on where we live, nature takes care of this for us by providing rain and we supplement with additional water as needed. Watering is a delicate balance for gardens. Too little water causes plants to wilt and die. Too much water means the plant cannot breathe; this can cause rotting and make the plant susceptible diseases.\nAnd that's just a sample. For more information about these tips, and to learn more about gardening, visit the the Peoples' Garden page.\nUpcoming Events\nAt tomorrow's Healthy Garden Workshop, you can learn about gardening in containers and window boxes (especially helpful for Americans living in cities and urban areas). The workshop will include discussion on finding the right container for the job, getting good soil, and nursing the container garden over time. Next week, on July 24, we'll show you techniques for weeding and removing invasive plants.\nAt both of these activities, a \"Sprouts\" workshop for kids will focus on a series of activities for children that demonstrate how the food system works, from farm to fork.\nIf you can't make a workshop, consider a garden tour -- they're held every Tuesday and Thursday at 1 p.m. at the Garden.

To advance this work, USDA supports a diverse community of organic stakeholders.\nNonprofits, businesses, universities, state governments and other organizations lead a range of technical assistance, training, outreach and certification programs for organic farms and businesses.  These organizations provide the National Organic Program (NOP), part of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), with valuable feedback about how to keep organic certification sound and sensible and how to meet the needs of new and transitioning organic farmers. To support their work, USDA is awarding project contracts to 13 organizations that will advance the NOP’s Sound and Sensible initiative by identifying and removing barriers to certification and streamlining the certification process.\nHere’s a summary of the exciting projects in store for the organic community:\nThe Agriculture and Land-Based Training Association (ALBA) will use a blended teaching approach to help farmers understand the alignment between organic practices and food safety requirements.\nCalifornia Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF) will conduct focus groups to explore barriers to certification with disadvantaged groups, develop a “10 Steps to Certification” reference guide and self-assessment, and conduct outreach sessions to candidate organic businesses.\nFlorida Certified Organic Growers and Consumers will produce videos for producers to outline the steps to organic certification.\nThe International Organic Inspectors Association (IOIA) will produce a range of materials to support organic inspectors and farmers, including training modules that integrate sound and sensible principles into organic inspections and certification activities.\nMassachusetts Independent Certification Inc., associated with Baystate Organic Certifiers, will develop training videos to dispel certification myths, an organic system plan consultant pilot program, training workbooks and information sheets, and a set of model organic system plans.\nNational Center for Appropriate Technology (NCAT) will lead two projects. The first will focus on technical assistance support for organic farmers and will include a workshop series. The second project will result in a streamlined organic system plan template for organic farms, a compliance checklist and model inspection report, and tip sheets related to organic transition.\nNortheast Organic Farmers Association – Vermont (NOFA-VT) will develop an organic mentoring program, provide technical assistance, and implement outreach activities.\nOhio Ecological Food and Farm Association (OEFFA) will share materials and approaches that address the unique cultural and communication needs of Plain and Amish farmers seeking organic certification.\nOregon Tilth Certified Organic (OTCO) will develop a pocket guide for organic certification and develop and implement an organic outreach and education program.\nOrganic Services will work with the NOP to develop for setting up, administering, and managing an internal control system for grower groups engaged in organic certification.\nPennsylvania Certified Organic (PCO) will engage in a technology project to develop a standardized tool for capturing the key elements of an organic system plan.\nWILL Interactive, partnering with the Carolina Farm Stewardship Association, will develop an interactive scenario-based video training program to help farmers navigate the elements of organic certification.\nWashington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) will develop videos to illustrate the organic certification process for small and direct marketing farmers.\nAll of these projects will be completed by September , and any materials developed under these contracts will be available through each organization’s website, via other organic partner sites and from the National Organic Program.  Organic certification ensures the integrity of organic products around the world.  We’re excited to launch these initiatives to ensure the process is accessible, attainable and affordable for all.\nVisit our website for more details about all of the sound and sensible projects.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n AMS\n California\n Carolinas\n Certification\n farming\n Florida\n handling\n Massachusetts\n National Organic Program\n NOP\n Ohio\n Oregon\n organic\n Organic 101\n organic certification\n Organic Literacy Initiative\n Partnerships\n Pennsylvania\n sound and sensible\n USDA Organic\n Vermont\n Washington State",

The organization serves rural businesses in 10 counties that have been designated as Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) communities, which are characterized by high unemployment rates, poverty and low per capita income.\nThe Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation in London, Ky., was selected to receive a $500,000 loan and a $100,000 grant to provide employment opportunities in southeastern Kentucky through investments, training and management assistance.\n“We need to be putting our programs to work for small businesses. For us at USDA that means small businesses in Rural America,” said Merrigan. “The importance of small entrepreneurship is particularly profound in the most rural areas.  We need micro lending in rural areas and Congress addressed this issue in the Farm Bill by giving the USDA’s Rural Development Mission Area a brand new program, the Rural Microentrepreneurship Program.

One way we are doing that is a new program that we recently piloted in Mississippi that provides free training through a partnership with the National Food Service Management Institute (NFSMI). The Team Up For School Nutrition Success Training (Team Up) is tailored to schools and covers topics like menu planning, financial management, procurement, meal presentation and appeal, as well as youth engagement tactics, and strategies to reduce plate waste.  \nAnother partner in this initiative is First Lady Michelle Obama. Mrs. Obama is grateful for the hard work being done in our country’s school cafeterias, but also recognizes that some may need a little help. When she heard about our initiative, she took the time to make a video to not only thank and encourage the dedicated school food service professional around the country, but to encourage them to take advantage of Team Up. Hear with the First Lady had to say about Team Up: \nThe name Team Up really says it all. This unique learning experience provides not only professional training and resources, but peer-to-peer mentoring. Schools have the opportunity to learn from each other, in order to make positive strides toward providing healthy school environments with financial stability and strong student participation. It isn’t a one-off experience. The peer-to-peer mentoring will continue after trainees return to their districts, and NFSMI will conduct 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups to gauge the success of the plans the schools developed after the training.  If additional training is needed, NFSMI will recommend options based on the schools progress.  The state agencies and USDA Food and Nutrition Services will also provide support and feedback. \nI couldn’t be more pleased with what I have heard about the how the first training class went, which was attended by 53 participants and 27 mentors. Participants told us that it was helpful to have a chance to discuss their individual challenges, as well as those that participants had in common. They said that hearing their colleagues and mentors talk about how they have handled some of these challenges in their schools was especially helpful.  Some participants even said that it was the best training they had ever attended!  The Kentucky Department of Education staff was so inspired that they created a video to say what a great experience they had.\nWe look forward to continuing our relationship with the White House and all the trainees. Together we can ensure that America’s students are getting and eating the healthiest food possible during the school day.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Child Nutrition\n Food and Nutrition\n HHFKA\n NSLP\n Nutrition\n Partnerships\n SBP\n School Lunch\n schools\n training",

USDA photo.\n“Water conservation begins where the first drop of rain falls…most likely on private working lands.” This is a favorite saying of Tom Vandivier, a Texas cattle rancher and recipient of the Sand County Foundation’s Leopold Conservation Award (LCA).\nTom was one of more than two dozen recipients of the LCA – which recognized landowners for achievement in environmental improvement on agricultural land – in Washington, D.C. last week.  I was fortunate to meet with them here at USDA headquarters to talk about the importance of conservation and the need to spread the message that investing in conservation practices on our farm and ranch lands not only protects water, air and wildlife – it also makes economic sense.\nJill Giacomini Basch is a LCA recipient who, with her father and three sisters, owns a family dairy in Marin County, Calif.  I had a chance to meet with the Giacomini family during my tour of several California farms last month. Jill explained that conservation improves the way they run their business. Partnerships with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and others have helped them protect their land and water resources, and ensure their dairy will be prosperous for the next generation.\n“We have very close ties with NRCS and other programs,” Jill said. “They have helped us with our water allocation -- above ground storage pond facilities and spring well drilling.  With the USDA we were able to utilize new technology to install a methane digester to help mitigate waste run off into the nearby lagoon, but also eventually the Point Reyes National Seashore.  Because of the methane digester, we generate about 65 percent of our on farm energy needs.”\n“Much of the work we’ve done has been through NRCS programs,” Tom added. “NRCS is very important to us.  We’re very much about conservation. The stewardship practices that we’ve accomplished on our property have enhanced water resources in the state of Texas.  I think it’s a message that needs to be spread so others can take similar stewardship practices and hopefully have the same results in their perspective states.”\nJon Bednarski, LCA recipient, shared his story as well.  He started farming 12 years ago outside of Louisville, Ky.  After meeting with NRCS, he discovered he was farming a “sensitive” piece of land, upstream of Louisville’s drinking water source. Since then he has managed his operation to help protect water quality.\nThe group discussed the need for conservation in the face of extreme weather – including the significant drought conditions in 11 western states.  As we were meeting, the U.S. Senate was in the process of voting on the Agricultural Act of . I talked about how important this legislation is to providing the tools and programs necessary for USDA to help farmers, ranchers and forestland owners manage the risk and uncertainty associated with extreme weather and climate change.  Conservation programs will be streamlined to better target limited resources to areas of highest need, while building on record conservation and stewardship efforts already underway.  I also previewed Secretary Tom Vilsack’s announcement of USDA’s new regional hubs to help agriculture and forestry mitigate the impacts of a changing climate.\nThe group also discussed the importance of passing on to the next generation the passion for agriculture and land stewardship.  There is a new energy in America around opportunities in agriculture. The Agricultural Act of will provide our communities with additional support to attract new economic opportunity and create jobs.  We all agreed that outreach and education is crucial.  USDA will continue to work with the LCA recipients and other partners to make that happen.  To view a video about the meeting click here.\nDeputy Under Secretary Ann Mills (center) addresses Leopold Conservation Award Winners at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

He’s dedicated to connecting the communities of Southeast Alaska to the stunning, natural world that surrounds them including the Tongass National Forest.\nSitka Conservation Society’s charge is to protect the forest’s natural environment while supporting sustainable development of surrounding Southeast Alaska communities. As director, Harris has worked for the last seven years to bring these communities together with those responsible for managing the landscape. The society and the forest partner together for work focused on ecological monitoring projects. For the past five years, they have worked with the Sitka Ranger District and local young students to monitor the effects of stream restoration projects. Harris has focused on increasing the number of interns in resource management during the past several years.\n“Our internship program benefits both the interns and the organization,” said Harris. “We are often able to hire people who grew up in Alaska who just finished college or are looking for summer work. They want to do so something in their field of interest and we give them that opportunity.”\nThe injection of youthful energy that the student interns bring to the projects also assist his long-term goal to motivate the students to stay involved in natural resource management on a professional level.\n“Some of the interns may decide to go on to college,” Harris said. “This would prepare them to work for the Forest Service as a technician, biologist or researcher. But even if they don’t do that, they will still have knowledge of what’s going on in the woods in their backyards.”\nThe interns are savvy with social media tools and create outreach videos and blogs for the internet. They also employ traditional media like newspapers and radio.\n“They’re all over it,” said Harris. “They help spread the word and they are excited about it.”\nKelly Petty, a fisheries technician intern with Sitka Conservation Society, learns how to measure fish smolt on Twelvemile Creek on Prince of Wales Island.

As the largest national forest and the largest remaining temperate rainforest on earth, the Tongass is also home to many rural communities that depend on the forest’s natural resources including the five salmon species that swim its waters.\nLast summer, a statewide citizen science initiative called Stream Team sponsored by the society, Forest Service and National Forest Foundation involved students in work with fisheries technicians and researchers at Twelvemile Creek on Prince of Wales Island. Students honed their math and other academic skills to learn more about forest management, salmon habitat, and restoration efforts on the forest.\nThe Sitka Conservation Society created an inspiring video of the Twelvemile Creek story profiling the students in action.\nFor Harris, this is another successful chapter in the Society’s role to connect young people to the outdoors and encourage development of future scientists and technicians. It’s often an inspiring opportunity for local youth to help and learn from natural resource management decision makers including those on the Tongass National Forest.\nSteve McCurdy pulls pink salmon smolt from the screw trap on Twelvemile Creek.

MyPlate itself is divided into five major food groups – vegetables, fruits, grains, protein foods, and dairy and fortified soy alternatives. But do you ever wonder where your food comes from, and how much our hardworking farmers and ranchers produce in a year?\nHere are facts about some of America’s favorite, nutritious foods:\nAccording to USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS), the tomato is one of the most commonly eaten vegetables in the country. In , U.S. farmers produced 24.1 billion pounds of tomatoes with California producing more than 97%.\nApples are also a big hit in the U.S.. In , our growers produced nearly 11 billion pounds, nearly 69% of which came from Washington state. The average yield from each of Washington’s 172,000 total apple bearing acres was 44,200 pounds! For , check out the Non-Citrus Fruits & Nuts Annual Report.\nWheat, a health-promoting grain found in many foods, is one of our largest field crops. In , U.S. farmers produced 1.8 billion bushels of it, with North Dakota producing more than 17% of the total.\nFor animal protein, according to ERS, chicken still tops the list in American diets. In , 58.3 billion pounds of chicken were produced in the U.S., more than 14% or 8.3 billion pounds in the top producing state of Georgia. New will be available on April 29 in the Poultry Production and Value Report.\nFinally, there is dairy.

From farmers to financiers to schools and hospitals, there is a lot of passion for sharing good food by supporting strong local and regional food systems. I experienced this firsthand during my trip to Chicago, Ill., where I spoke at last week’s Good Food Festival & Conference.\nThe trip came on the heels of a recent announcement that USDA is making $97 million available to expand access to healthy food and support rural economies.  Grants from my agency -- the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) – make up over $90 million of that funding.  AMS was a sponsor and exhibitor at the trade show, where we shared information with stakeholders about the many resources we have to support local and regional food systems. Through our Specialty Crop Block Grant Program and Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program (comprised of the Farmers Market Promotion Program and the Local Food Promotion Program), AMS supports producers, local food entrepreneurs, and rural and urban communities across the country.\n Anne L.

We see a key role for each of these sectors in meeting our global and domestic food needs, increasing sustainability, and enhancing farm profitability and economic development. All three segments are vital, important, and a part of rural America's success. All three sectors should be able to thrive together.\nOver the last two decades, there has been rapid adoption by farmers of new technologies, like biotechnology. Biotechnology holds great promise for agriculture here in the United States, and around the world. USDA's regulatory system has done a very good job of safely bringing genetically engineered (GE) agricultural products to market.\nThere has also been strong growth in the organic sector and in identity preserved markets. These identity preserved markets include meeting requirements of trading partners who don't accept GE products and the organic market. It also encompasses other products with particular, non-GE, but not organic, characteristics.\nThe rise and growth of all these sectors is great for U.S. agriculture. It means farmers have a range of ways to meet consumer needs and preferences both here and around the world. It means they can grow their operations and contribute to the success and vitality of rural America.\nBut it also presents challenges. The developers and users of GE products want the ability to use the technology to help us feed our country and the world. And the organic and identity preserved sectors are sensitive to the unintended presence of GE material in those product streams.\nCoexistence is an important challenge facing U.S. agriculture today. Farmers and others in the food and feed production chain have an important role in collaborating to make coexistence work. USDA is working to increase awareness of the need for coexistence, as well as information on practices that can help support it. USDA is also working to help different sectors of agriculture exchange information, build coalitions, and make decisions that contribute to or directly support coexistence.",

This past summer, the couple designed and built a portable demonstration house to educate the public about the benefits of rain barrels and rain gardens at exhibits and fairs.\nBut the Viafores didn’t put this exhibit together just for fun—they are contributing their crafty skills as Earth Team volunteers. Earth Team is the name given to USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service volunteers. Earth Team volunteers work side by side with Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) employees on conservation projects to improve their local environment.\nThe NRCS Pierce Conservation District Stream Team uses the shed-sized structure the Viafores built as a conservation education tool in the Seattle, Wash., area.\nWith the easily transported house, Stream Team volunteers can now show people ways they can minimize the impact of stormwater on local streams using rain barrels and rain gardens.\nRain barrels take rainwater from roofs and divert it into a barrel. The captured water can then be used to water gardens and landscapes during dryer periods.\nRain gardens are attractive landscape features that take stormwater from roofs and other impervious surfaces and filters pollutants out as the water percolates down through the soil into the groundwater to help recharge aquifers.\nStream Team personnel say the Viafore–built house allows them to better demonstrate the importance of using conservation practices to protect local streams, lakes and the nearby Pacific Ocean.\nEarth Team volunteers Jill and Mike Viafore stand in front of a portable demonstration house they built in Washington State. The structure is being used to exhibit the benefits of urban conservation practices to residents near Seattle.\nIn , more than 32,000 Earth Team volunteers donated 641,549 hours of service to NRCS estimated to be worth $13.4 million.

        "content": "Natural Resources Conservation Service in\n Conservation\n Feb 23, \nThe SGI Interactive Web Application enables conservationists to help plan the best conservation efforts to restore sage grouse habitat. (Click to enlarge)\nThe saying “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts” is often attributed to the Greek philosopher Aristotle, and that couldn’t be more true when it comes to doing conservation planning across 11 states, multiple federal agencies and millions of acres of public and private land.\nThe Sage Grouse Initiative (SGI), led by USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), introduces the SGI Interactive Web Application, a tool that will take habitat restoration efforts for sage grouse to new heights — both visually and on the ground. The tool graphically layers vital pieces of information to paint a more cohesive picture of connected landscapes, so state and federal agencies and their partners can make more effective and targeted decisions.\nFor instance, the web application includes a brand new high-resolution map of conifer encroachment across 100 million acres of sagebrush-steppe landscape. Invading conifers degrade the sagebrush landscape by crowding out native plants, that’s why NRCS and its partners target their removal when they’re young.\nConifers are just one layer. Each layer added will help address threats that NRCS is prioritizing through the Sage Grouse Initiative 2.0 investment strategy, a four-year $211 million effort to help conserve sagebrush habitats in 11 Western states. A second layer available depicts the ecosystem’s resilience and resistance based on underlying soil temperature and moisture,” said Jeremy Maestas, NRCS regional biologist.\n“Someone using the application will be able to visualize which areas are more or less likely to rebound after wildfire and resist cheatgrass invasion,” Maestas said. “By putting these cutting-edge products at the fingertips of practitioners and landowners, it helps us more quickly apply science and technology into targeted action on the ground.”\nThe SGI partnership is in the process of adding more layers to the web application and layers will be periodically updated to reflect the most recent scientific information.\nBrady Allred, a rangeland specialist with University of Montana, developed the tool for SGI using Google Earth Engine, a platform for petabyte-scale scientific analysis and visualization of geospatial datasets, both for public benefit and for business and government users.\n“By using Google Earth Engine, we are able to do range-wide science and conservation planning that was functionally impossible before,” Allred said. “And because Google Earth Engine is built for the web, we can immediately implement that science into planning and decision making.”\nSoon the web application will be completely interactive, allowing the user to change analysis parameters, input new , or specify an area of particular interest for a more detailed analysis. It gives the user the ability to get the exact information he or she needs.\n“Geography is not a barrier here,” Allred said. “By focusing on the entire western half of the country, we are able to get the whole picture—a better view of what is occurring. This improves conservation planning for all western rangelands.”\nSince , NRCS has worked with ranchers to restore and protect more than 5 million acres of sage grouse habitat through SGI. This work was part of a large landscape-level effort that led the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to conclude last year that the sage grouse did not warrant protection under the Endangered Species Act.\nLearn more about NRCS’ conservation efforts for sage grouse.

We thank them for sharing their stories!\nBy Bea Zuluaga, Food and Nutrition Director, CentroNía/DC Bilingual Public Charter School, Washington, DC\nChildren living in Washington, D.C., and across the country spend a large part of their day in school and rely heavily on their educational institutions for nourishment. As educators, it is imperative that we expose children to a variety of healthy, nutrient-rich foods early on in their development, and CentroNía does just that! We prepare various meals and snacks to support children’s learning thanks to programs such as the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act of .\nWith more than 260 employees who serve 2,500 children, youth, and families in the District of Columbia and Maryland, CentroNía’s mission is to educate children and youth, and strengthen families in a bilingual, multicultural community. We cook meals and prepare snacks on the premises that incorporate whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, more vegetarian proteins and local produce.  By eliminating processed foods and juices from our institution, we drastically reduced the sugar and sodium on our menus.\nOur menus are creative and have a variety of healthy foods that our children have learned to enjoy. Children love the tofu in their vegetarian chow-mein. We’ve even replaced fish sticks with baked tilapia. We are proud to offer our children five different fresh fruits and vegetables daily and have found that our children's love for local fruits facilitated the elimination of juices from our menus. Likewise, with salad bars, children feel empowered when they are able to serve themselves their own food.\nMany teachers and parents expressed skepticism at first of the menu changes and convincing them was our biggest challenge. To the delight and surprise of teachers and parents alike, children have embraced these changes because we consistently offer them healthier food choices.\nAs a result, we created the campaign, “Eat Healthy, Live Healthy” and launched innovative basic nutrition workshops with teachers, highlighting the importance of exposing children to a variety of foods.\nOur curriculum, called “I Want to be Healthy,” teaches about selecting healthy foods, increasing physical activity, and drinking more water.  We've reached even further, availing ourselves of all opportunities to expose parents to our nutritious meals, inviting them to workshops and cooking demonstrations, and encouraging them to join in our efforts.\nSeven years into our program, our hard work has shown great results! Our teachers are now convinced that good foods are essential to each child's success, and they implement this nutrition foundation into the curriculum. In addition, our school nurse a decrease in the incidence of children complaining of stomach aches; and parents are telling us that their children are demanding salads at dinnertime.\nWe are very excited with all of these outcomes and are delighted to be working with partners, such as Let’s Move!, to promote healthy eating habits for children and families across the country.\nFor more information on supporting healthy choices at school, please visit: www.usda.gov/healthierschoolday.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n cafeteria stories\n childhood nutrition\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n HealthierNextGen\n Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act\n Let's Move\n school meals\n Washington DC",

For every British Thermal Unit (BTU)  (unit of heat equal to the amount of heat to raise one pound of water one degree  Fahrenheit at one atmosphere) of energy to make ethanol, 2.3 BTUs of energy are produced (energy output/energy input). The ratio is somewhat higher for some firms that are partially substituting biomass energy in processing energy (thermal and electrical energy in the plant to convert corn to one gallon of ethanol). Since the last study in , the net energy balance of corn ethanol has increased from 1.76 BTUs to 2.3 BTUs of energy.\nAccording to the report, overall, ethanol has made the transition from an energy sink (more energy used than energy produced), to a moderate net energy gain in the s, to a substantial net energy gain in the present. And there are still prospects for improvement. Ethanol yields have increased by about 10 percent in the last 20 years, so proportionately less corn is . In addition to refinements in ethanol technology, corn yields have increased by 39 percent over the last 20 years, requiring less land to produce ethanol.  The report can be found here.\n Category/Topic:\n Energy\n Tags:\n Energy Balance for the Corn-Ethanol Industry\n ethanol\n fossil fuels\n OCE\n Office of Energy Policy and New Uses\n USDA",

Heart-healthy pecans are the focus of a project in Georgia to help educate health-conscious consumers on the nutritional values of tree nuts. Photo by Judy Baxter.\nThis Saturday is National Nut Day, a perfect opportunity to honor nature’s nutritional dynamo– the nut.  It seems that Americans are more than a little nutty about nuts, which are considered specialty crops.  Nearly one out of every 10 of us eats nuts, or a nut product, at least once a day.  Almonds, walnuts and pecans are the top three nuts consumed in the United States* and the production of almonds, walnuts and pistachios has more than doubled in the last decade.\nTree nuts – which include almonds, walnuts, pecans, pistachios, hazelnuts, and macadamia nuts – are a great source of plant protein.  Several nuts play a role in preventing heart disease or lowering cholesterol.  Although they are high in calories, nuts are a fiber-rich, phytonutrient, antioxidant (i.e.-Vitamin E), highly portable food that can enhance dinner, compliment dessert or stand alone as a tasty snack.\nCalifornia is the country's leading producer of tree nuts. Nearly 90 percent of each year's tree nut production is harvested from the state's orchards, including almost all almonds, pistachios and walnuts. Together, Georgia, New Mexico and Texas produce 75 percent of the U.S. pecan crop.  U.S. tree nut production since the mid-s has generated, on average, nearly $4 billion in annual farm cash receipts, with almonds, walnuts, pistachios, and pecans accounting for most of the sales.\nEarlier this month, we announced the award of ates and its territories.  In one project, the Georgia Department of Agriculture will partner with the state’s Agricultural Commodity Commission for Pecans.  They will promote pecans and educate health-conscious consumers on the importance of its antioxidant and health benefits by placing heart healthy billboards in strategic locations throughout the state.  Their outreach efforts will also include two minutes of pecan in-flight video on all Delta flights in November.\nIn California, the Department of Food and Agriculture will partner with the Center for Produce Safety at the University of California to develop and implement new strategies for preventing salmonella contamination in almonds and pistachios.  The science-based strategies will focus on the transfer of the microbial dust and contaminants carrying salmonella from livestock farms and ranches to nearby almond and pistachio orchards.  They’ll also take a look at the contaminants found in places that handle almond and pistachio shelling/hulling.\nThese projects along with several others will help strengthen the market for specialty crops, such as fruits, vegetables, dried fruits, horticulture and nursery crops, including floriculture, and tree nuts.  Find out what projects were funded in your area.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n AMS\n ERS\n NASS\n National Nut Day\n Nuts\n Specialty Crop Block Grants",

(USDA photo by Bob Nichols)\nA major war was fought in -, with more than ates alone. You may not have seen much of it on the news, but there’s a good chance your wallet felt it.\nThe outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in 17 states caused the American poultry industry to lose about 51.5 million chickens and turkeys. During this outbreak, the infected flocks cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1 billion in depopulation, cleanup, disinfection, and insurance payments. This also caused the egg-laying population to dramatically decrease. Poultry producers lost $1.1 billion in broiler exports (a 26-percent decrease from the previous year), $41 million in lost egg export income (down 13 percent), and $177 million in turkey export income (a 23-percent decline). The law of supply and demand, naturally, caused consumer prices to increase at grocery stores and restaurants.\nThe danger of infectious disease outbreaks in the agricultural community is real and preventing them is critical for maintaining the supply of safe, nutritious, and affordable food. This is where biosecurity comes into play.\nUSDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supports agricultural biosecurity by providing funding and national program leadership to projects that secure and protect the integrity, reliability, sustainability, and profitability of the American food and agricultural system against catastrophic hazards, whether natural, emerging, accidental, or deliberate.\nNon-animal agricultural biosecurity issues include spotted wing drosophila, which caused $715 million of damage in berry and stone fruit crops, and the brown marmorated stink bug, which caused $37 million in damage to the apple industry across the mid-Atlantic region. Citrus greening disease, arguably the greatest current threat, is devastating the citrus industry in Texas, Arizona, California, and Florida, where about 80 percent citrus trees are affected.\nNIFA’s fight against citrus greening began in February with a $20.1 million investment in research and extension. The projects included the University of Central Florida testing a bactericide to kill the citrus greening bacteria and the University of California, Riverside developing disease resistant varieties of citrus.\nNIFA-funded projects advance our understanding of biosecurity and provide solutions for protecting the food supply from intentional and natural threats and hazards. The National Animal Health Laboratory Network, National Plant Diagnostic Network, and the Citrus Greening Research and Extension manage many of these projects.\nNIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n National Institute of Food and Agriculture\n NIFA\n agricultural biosecurity\n citrus greening\n avian influenza\n National Animal Health Laboratory Network\n National Plant Diagnostic Network",

Last December in Paris, delegates from 196 countries signed an agreement to work towards curtailing greenhouse gas emissions and to keep global warming to “well below” 2 °C degrees. This is a big step, but there is still much work to be done and the agricultural sector has an important role to play. Agriculture, forestry, and land degradation contribute just under a quarter of anthropogenic GHG emissions, mainly from deforestation and agricultural emissions from livestock, soil and nutrient management.  Climate change also poses a great challenge for food security and nutrition. It can reduce yields and affect where and how food is produced.

But the nearby community gathered together to improve water quality by preventing runoff of sediment and nutrients. Now, oysters thrive. NRCS photo.\nTwo years ago, the Nisqually Shellfish Farm south of Belfair, Wash. didn’t have a chance. Runoff from surrounding homes and dairy farms polluted Henderson Inlet, and the state declared the water unfit for raising shellfish for human consumption.\nWorsening the problem, the place was overrun with an invasive species, the Japanese oyster drill, which feeds on and kills shellfish.\nBut water quality in the inlet, which flows into Puget Sound, is improving. Last year, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) began working with a nearby tribe and shellfish producers to monitor and remove the Japanese oyster drill.\nNRCS also worked with the dairy farm to put conservation practices into place to contain runoff. Meanwhile, local homeowners working with Thurston County followed suit by striving to manage runoff from their lawns and, septic and storm water systems. It was neat to watch how conservation principles can be put to work to make a difference, whether we’re talking in acres or backyards.\nThe work of both homeowners and the dairy led to good news for the inlet’s water quality: it was safe for shellfish operations.\nOnce water was clean enough, NRCS assisted partners in rebuilding dense breeding populations of the Olympia oyster to restore ecosystem function. To do this, they had to restore prime habitat near the shoreline on which oyster larvae depend.\nSue Shotwell with Nisqually Shellfish Farm and NRCS Assistant Chief Kirk Hanlin look at an oyster harvest at Nisqually Shellfish Farm. NRCS photo.\nBecause of this work, the Nisqually Shellfish Farm is able to grow high quality oysters that not only feed the local community, but communities across the nation. This led to the creation of a new business where oysters are harvested daily, cleaned, put on ice, packed and shipped by air to New York City, where they’re showcased at top oyster bars.\nAt the end of the day, I realized I had witnessed an effort that would be perfect for the new Regional Conservation Partnership Program. RCPP was created by the Farm Bill, and this new program aims to leverage bigger results by matching federal dollars with those of partners.\nThe program looks to projects with definable goals, a variety of engaged partners and quantifiable results. RCPP can be the solution, leading to cleaner air and water, healthy soil and viable wildlife habitat.\nNRCS has already taken applications for fiscal funding for the program, but it’s not too late to look at the program for next year. The agency is in the process of requesting groups with stronger pre-proposals to prepare a full proposal.\nAt NRCS, we’re proud we worked with a community to help restore an ecosystem and improve water quality while also creating jobs. That’s the win-win that we look for in conservation. But without the help of the local community none of this would have been possible.\nNisqually Shellfish Farm south of Belfair, Wash. raises oysters that are eaten locally and as far away as New York City.

Their work began in in a small USDA field laboratory in Orlando, where scientists made key discoveries about new chemicals for controlling these pests. At the time, the most effective repellents lasted only 2 hours, and the U.S. military needed a repellent that could protect for 10 hours. In , testing in Orlando confirmed DEET was an effective repellent; it was soon adopted for use by the U.S. Army, became commercially available by —and is still used widely today.\nScientists at the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), USDA’s chief in-house research agency, have continued their search for better repellents ever since. They used the USDA database of 30,000 compounds to develop a model that used chemical structure for predicting how long a repellent would keep pests away. This model predicted that some compounds would be more effective than DEET, and subsequent research confirmed some compounds did indeed repel pests more than three times longer than DEET.\nIn , the Department of Defense initiated a partnership with USDA and others as part of the Deployed War-Fighter Protection (DWFP) program. Its' mission: to develop and test management tools for pest and vector species that transmit diseases to deployed U.S. troops. ARS scientists in Gainesville, Florida; Beltsville, Maryland; and Oxford, Mississippi, have contributed discoveries about repellent as part of the DWFP research and accomplishments. ARS has also collaborated with the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Systems Center since to optimize the arthropod bite protection of factory-produced permethrin-treated uniforms. Treating uniforms became standard practice in the s, first with a miticide, and starting in with permethrin.\nARS National Program Leader Uli Bernier has been responsible for developing protocols to evaluate uniform protection against mosquitoes, and in conducted a study that led to the registration of etofenprox as an alternative clothing repellent. He recently staffed an ARS information table at the 5th USA Science & Engineering Festival Expo, where he said visitors wanted to learn more about a new pest-resistant tropical lightweight uniform on display. Visitors were also fascinated by a cage of mosquitoes used for research—but unlike USDA researchers, they were reluctant to place their hand in a cage full of mosquitoes!\nThis Military Appreciation Month, we pay special tribute to the efforts of our servicemen and women.

Should you have frozen it, given it away, or composted it? Maybe these aren’t even the right questions. Should you have bought a smaller bird? What would you have done if you were in the country of Turkey? Or if you were in Japan?\nYou may never have thought that everyday questions like these could come up in international organizations, but they do. Food loss and waste (FLW) is a major global issue with far-reaching impacts on food security, resource efficiency and the environment. USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) estimates that in the United States, 31 percent of food available for human consumption at the retail and consumer levels goes uneaten. The U.S. approaches FLW in its own way, but it can benefit from teaching, learning from, and exploring collaborations with other countries. \nFLW was one theme on the agenda for the recent Group of 20 (G20) Meeting of the Agricultural Chief Scientists (MACS) hosted by Germany. The G20 emerged as a forum for the governments and central bank governors of the 20 largest economies in the world. The G20 MACS was established in “to better coordinate agricultural research systems and to seek and apply common solutions strategies” in the fields of agriculture and nutrition across G20 countries. Since then, the G20 Agricultural Chief Scientists have gotten together annually to discuss important issues that can benefit from sharing information and approaches, and leveraging national agricultural research with efforts in other countries.\nUSDA represents the United States at the MACS. Dr. Chavonda Jacobs-Young, Acting USDA Chief Scientist, led the U.S. delegation during two days of pre-meetings followed by two days of formal presentations and discussions. In this role, she represented U.S. national agricultural research priorities and the breadth of USDA agricultural research.\nIn the case of FLW, USDA has robust research and outreach efforts. Through this international forum, the U.S. can share its efforts, learn from those in other countries, and leverage its research with complementary work of others. We learned that Turkey, for example, has focused its FLW efforts on reducing over-purchasing and creative reuses of stale bread, while Japan promotes waste reduction by requiring businesses to manage their own waste.\nBased on U.S. research, it turns out the best solution to too much leftover turkey may not be in creative reuses at home, but in reducing FLW at the source – improving storage and distribution efficiencies earlier in the supply chain (see the U.S. Food Loss and Waste Reduction Hierarchy).

USDA photo by Alice Welch.\nAll this month we will be taking a look at what a changing climate means to Agriculture. The ten regional USDA Climate Hubs were established to synthesize and translate climate science  and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers that are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA's Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate.\nThere are many reasons landowners value forests - their iconic beauty, cultural connections, wildlife, recreation, and economic opportunities.  More reasons and in-depth information can be found in the USDA Forest Service National Woodland Owner Survey. The bottom line is forests help to sustain our local communities: ecologically, economically, and culturally, and many forests are vulnerable to climate change. These ecosystems are already responding to changing conditions, and climate change is anticipated to have a pervasive influence on forests over the coming decades.\nCareful forest stewardship involves long-term planning, which naturally includes the consideration of these changing climate influences. This is especially true in northern forests that formed in cold climates, but are now beginning to experience rapid change. Our northern neighbors in Canada manage 397 million hectares of forests and woodlands (approximately 10% of the worlds forest cover), which face many of the same climate change impacts and challenges that we are grappling with in the United States.\nBecause each country shares a similar set of values and challenges related to climate impacts on forests and agricultural lands, the USDA Northern Forests Climate Hub is actively working with Natural Resources Canada and the Canadian Forest Service to share scientific and technical expertise pertaining to climate change adaptation, resources and tools. The purpose of this work is to build meaningful connections and partnerships that will aid natural resource professionals to make climate-informed decisions in their management and planning activities regardless of which nation they work in.\nRecently, Dr. Chris Swanston, Director of the USDA Northern Forests Climate Hub was invited by Natural Resources Canada to speak to a variety of groups, including presenting at the Adaptation Canada conference. While visiting, Dr. Swanston shared forest adaptation tools and real-world examples developed through the Climate Change Response Framework, which is led by the Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science. He also actively learned from the Canadian Forest Service’s Forest Change Initiative, which has developed climate indicators, assessment, and tools for northern forests.\nNationally, the USDA Climate Hubs could be a platform for science delivery between both countries, sharing not only resources created in the U.S. but also Canadian approaches to climate adaptation planning and implementation strategies. The strategy to bridge science and management as an approach to considering climate change impacts on public and private lands was by all accounts well received, and the USDA Northern Forests Climate Hub looks forward to future engagements and collaborations. The pace of change in our northern forests dictates that we learn quickly and learn together.\nPer Capita forest area (hectares).

What are organizations doing to increase composting in the United States? In observance of International Compost Awareness Week (May 2-8), this interview features insights with Frank Franciosi, executive director of the U.S. Composting Council.\nBuzby: What’s the mission of the U.S. Composting Council?\nFranciosi: We believe compost manufacturing and compost use are central to creating healthy soils, clean air and water, a stable climate, and a sustainable society. Our sister organization the Compost Research & Education Foundation funds initiatives that enhance the stature and practices of the composting industry by supporting scientific research, increasing awareness, and educating practitioners and the public to advance environmentally and economically sustainable organics recycling.\nBuzby: What are the benefits of composting food waste?\nFranciosi: By investing in compost manufacturing infrastructure, training, and policy, 13.8 million tons of food scraps can be diverted annually from landfills through compost manufacturing, reducing an estimated 4.94 million tons in greenhouse gas equivalents, while creating over 14,200 new jobs.\nBuzby: Why does composting matter for climate change?\nFranciosi: Methane is 25 times more potent of a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Methane is generated in open landfills from decaying organic matter. The EPA that municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills are the third-largest source of human-related methane emissions in the United States, approximately 15.1 percent of these emissions in . When properly managed, the aerobic process of composting does not produce methane because methane-producing microbes are not active in the presence of oxygen. Compost also sequesters carbon and returns nutrients and minerals from food scraps to the soil.\nBuzby: How do you spread the word about the benefits of composting?\nFranciosi: We welcome anyone interested in composting – backyard composters, municipal programs, and large-scale centralized operators – to visit our websites for resources training, and certification. In June, we are launching a Target Organics Hub, a one-stop resource for municipalities to access information on how to start an organics recycling program for their community.\nBuzby: Do you see changes in how much people are composting?\nFranciosi: Over the past five to ten years, there has been an increase in food scrap composting. Municipalities like San Francisco were the early pioneers. Boulder, Austin, Phoenix, and Minneapolis all have successful curbside collection programs. There is a nationwide surge of growth of community composters: some manage household subscription programs and some have expanded into restaurants and food services. Consumers are also demanding a more sustainable way of handing their organic waste. California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and just recently Maryland, all have regulations on food scrap collection and mandates on keeping organics out of landfills and incinerators.\nBuzby: What is the most important take-away for the people to know about composting food waste?\nFranciosi: Food scrap is an untapped resource. It can and should be diverted from landfills and composted. The existing waste management infrastructure in the U.S. needs to be reconfigured so that this valuable resource can be returned to our soils. I urge you all to support source separated composting in your community at all levels.\nRead more blogs on the topic of food loss and waste.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Health and Safety\n Tags:\n Food Waste\n You May Also Like\n Helping Reduce Methane Emissions by Solving a Sticky Problem for U.S. Produce Exporters\n Revolutionizing the Ice Cube\n Food Waste Reduction through Farm to School Programs",

(Photo courtesy of The National Science Foundation, Durelle Scott)\nDay after day we’re seeing more impacts from climate change, and many concerned folks want to know what exactly their government is doing about it. In other words, who’s keeping score on what we’re doing as our climate warms?\nWith this in mind, the U.S. Forest Service has developed something it calls the Climate Change Performance Scorecard. The scorecard was created as a way for the Forest Service to measure how well it was responding to climate change and to keep track of experiences and best practices so others could learn from them.\n“Given our role in managing our country’s natural resources, we have a particularly unique opportunity to respond,” said Dave Cleaves, U.S. Forest Service Climate Change Advisor. “The Scorecard is helping more forest land managers develop an understanding of how climate change will impact rivers, tree health, wildfire activity, and more … and what to do about it.”\nAnd, importantly, the Scorecard helps implement the Forest Service’s National Roadmap for Responding to Climate Change.\n“The Roadmap is our strategic guidance for pulling climate change into the Forest Service’s daily operations, and the Scorecard helps implement this guidance by focusing national forests’ efforts and tracking success,” said Cleaves.\nThis is because the Scorecard is organized around areas like integrating climate change into employee education, program management, and partnerships. The Scorecard also encourages national forest land managers to better understand which of their natural resources are most vulnerable to climate change, how forests can operate more sustainably, and more.\nSince the Roadmap and Scorecard were released in , the Forest Service has accomplished impressive results. The majority of the Scorecard is now being successfully achieved by our national forest land managers. But this is just the beginning. National forest land managers are expected to continue to push, to achieve even greater successes around climate change issues in the near future.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Climate Change\n Climate Change Performance Scorecard\n Dave Cleaves\n Forestry\n FS\n National Roadmap for Responding to Climate Change",

There, they were able to see some Vietnam’s local produce including rambutan and dragon fruit. This was one of many stops on the first-ever USDA agricultural trade mission to Vietnam, which Scuse led in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City Sep. 25-20, Photo By Le Nguyen-Binh\nUnder the Obama Administration, USDA has continued to expand markets for American goods abroad, worked aggressively to break down barriers to trade, and assisted U.S. businesses with the resources needed to reach consumers around the world. And by organizing and executing agricultural trade missions, USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) is helping U.S. businesses reach the 95-percent of consumers who live outside the United States.\nOver three years, more than 1,000 U.S. companies and organizations—about 70 percent of them small and medium sized businesses—participated in 87 USDA-endorsed trade shows in 20 countries. On-site sales totaled more than $350 million and 12-month projected sales reported by exhibitors were estimated more than $2.7 billion. The companies made over 42,000 business contacts and displayed nearly 20,000 new products in various markets on all continents.\nActing Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services Michael Scuse and other members of the U.S.-Peru-Ecuador agricultural trade mission to Lima, Peru tour a greenhouse in February where aeroponics is used to grow potato varieties at the International Potato Center in Lima. Photo by Victor Malpica\nThe goal of USDA trade missions is to provide U.S. agricultural businesses with firsthand market information, access to government decision makers and one-on-one meetings with business contacts, distributers and importers so they can position themselves to enter or expand their presence in foreign markets. Often, trade missions correlate with USDA-sponsored international food and trade shows, which was the case this past year during the trade missions to Peru, Indonesia and Vietnam. Trade shows give companies even more opportunities to make business contacts and share their products with potential buyers and consumers.\nA full range of agribusinesses participate in these missions, including large companies with production sites around the United States and the world, as well as small- and medium-sized businesses, some of which are are just beginning to export internationally. The companies who participated in trade missions represented a variety of products including feed, meat, dairy, poultry, wood and forestry, rice, grain, seafood, fruits and vegetables, consumer-ready products, agricultural equipment and more.\nActing Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services Michael Scuse meets with Magaret Say of the USA Poultry Export Council's Singapore office at the 11th Food and Hotel Indonesia show in Jakarta April 6, .

Photo By Rifky Suryadinata, U.S. Embassy, Jakarta\nThe countries USDA selects as destinations for trade missions are usually booming or emerging markets where companies can expect to achieve export success. Indonesia, for example, is the United States’ largest agricultural market in Southeast Asia and Vietnam is the fastest-growing market in that region. USDA’s trade mission to Colombia and Panama came just weeks after congressional ratification of free trade agreements with these countries, which will stimulate and increase our bilateral trade immediately upon implementation.\nBeyond the benefits going to participating agribusinesses, trade missions allow the USDA representatives leading the missions to meet with government and agricultural officials, and to visit agricultural production sites, markets and retail establishments around the world.\nActing Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services Michael Scuse, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam David Shear, and Consul General An Le of the U.S. Consulate in Ho Chi Minh City cut the ribbon to open the USDA-endorsed USA Pavilion at the Food and Hotel Vietnam trade show in Ho Chi Minh City on Sept. 28, . The USA Pavilion was the largest ever at this trade show, featuring 28 U.S. companies representing a wide variety of agricultural goods and products. Scuse is in Vietnam leading USDA’s first-ever agricultural trade mission there. Photo by Le Sy Hoang Chuong\n is shaping up to be another great year for USDA agricultural trade missions. A mission to China is scheduled to take place from March 23-28 in the cities of Chengdu and Shanghai. With this trade mission, participating companies will have access to what is now the United States’ largest market for agricultural products.\nCurrently, the American brand of agriculture is surging in popularity worldwide. Farm exports in fiscal year reached a record high of $137.4 billion—exceeding past highs by $22.5 billion—and supported 1.15 million jobs here at home. The agricultural trade surplus stands at a record $42.7 billion.\nFor more information, visit the USDA agricultural trade mission website.\nJuan Carlos Cadena (left), Colombia’s Director of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism, and Bryce Quick, Associate Administrator for USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service, participate in a welcome plenary session for a USDA trade mission with Panama and Colombia, which took place in Bogota Nov. 14-17, .

As you prepare to welcome a large gathering of family and friends, keep these core food safety practices in mind:\n Clean—Wash hands and surfaces often. Hands should be washed for 20 seconds with clean water and soap. If no running water is available, use hand sanitizer or moist towelettes that contain at least 60 percent alcohol.\n Separate—Separate raw meats from other foods to avoid cross-contamination of harmful bacteria. Use separate cutting boards when preparing raw meat and poultry and other foods that are ready to eat, and use different utensils and platters when placing raw foods on the grill or smoker and taking cooked foods off.\n Cook—Cook food to the safe minimum internal temperature as measured with a food thermometer. Burgers and other thin foods, such as sausages and boneless chicken thighs, should have the thermometer inserted through the side and into the center to get the most accurate thermometer reading.\n Chill—Refrigerate food promptly within two hours (or one hour if the temperature is over 90 F). Keep hot foods hot above 140 F and cold foods cold below 40 F to avoid the Danger Zone. Hot foods like burgers, hot dogs, and chicken can be kept hot by placing them on a grill on low, in heated chafing dishes, or in a slow cooker, and cold foods like deviled eggs, salads, and guacamole can be nestled in a bed of ice.\nFor more information about food safety, call the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline , email MPHotline@usda.gov, or chat live at ask.usda.gov from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday to reach a food safety specialist in English or Spanish.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n Tags:\n Food Safety and Inspection Service\n FSIS\n Food Safety\n Fourth of July\n Meat and Poultry Hotline\n You May Also Like\n USDA Process Verified Program: Transparency from Farm to Market\n Pack It Safe, Pack It Smart: Back-to-School Lunchbox Packing Essentials\n Food Safety: Prepare for the Unexpected",

        "content": "Natural Resources Conservation Service, Massachusetts in\n Conservation\n Oct 29, \nAl Rose discusses his fourth-generation Red Apple “green” Farm with NRCS’ Soil Conservationist Dave Bacon.\nNOTE: This week on the USDA Blog, we'll feature the stories of America's Harvest Heroes who, like farmers across the nation, are working this harvest season to secure the bounty of healthy food American agriculture is renowned for. From laying the foundation for the next generation of farmers putting down roots in rural America, supporting the fruit and vegetable growers who are helping to build healthier communities, bolstering new markets for the products of agricultural innovation, to harvesting renewable energy that is made in Rural America, with USDA's support our farmers are yielding strong results for every American. For these reasons and more, America’s Harvest Heroes deserve our thanks.\nA towering, craggy McIntosh apple tree in the center of the orchard at Red Apple Farm in Phillipston, Massachusetts, has weathered 113 winters, borne many tons of crisp, tart apples and fed generations of customers. Planted in , it’s the oldest commercially planted McIntosh tree in New England and possibly the country. Thanks to care by generations of the Rose family, that ancient apple tree still produces fruit today.\nAl Rose and his wife Nancy, who operate the fourth-generation farm, have introduced an innovative, modern growing system just a stone’s throw from the century McIntosh. To ensure success in an area that sees its share of dry summers, the Roses sought the help of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).\n“It may be challenging, but I think we’ve got a natural environment that’s conducive to growing great apples,” said Al Rose. “We have cold nights for a good part of the growing season, which are great for the color of the apples. Fall without apples in New England just wouldn’t be the same.”\nA micro-irrigation system was installed to deliver water from the pond directly to the young trees. This type of watering system conserves more water than a conventional overhead sprinkler system.\n“We’re at one of the highest elevations for orchards in New England – 1,250 feet,” said Rose, standing in the orchard on a windy day. “We have a wind turbine that’s been cranking today. Between that and our solar panels, we’re a red farm and a ‘green’ farm.”\nRed Apple Farm is protected under the state Agricultural Preservation Restriction (APR) program.  Through a state grant program to help the viability of APR farms, Rose developed a business plan that called for planting an acre of trees in a new trellis system.\n“We’re not creating more land here; we have to be more productive on the land that we do have,” explained Rose.\nThe “fruit wall” is small trees, shallow-rooted and spaced as close as a foot apart. “It’s the most productive way and, from a cost standpoint, it’s easier to maintain,” said Rose. “But, to do that, you have to have a pond in place.”\nSo, Rose reached out to NRCS for help with irrigation. “I know they have the technical expertise to do it right and give us advice,” said Rose, who also got financial help through the federal Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) program.\nDave Bacon, NRCS Soil Conservationist, has been assisting Red Apple Farm for more than a decade. He explained that, in Massachusetts, the AMA program is used for drought mitigation. “We didn’t want to have an acre’s worth of apple trees fail because there was no irrigation water available,” said Bacon.\nAl Rose stands near the McIntosh tree, planted in .\nBacon explained that soil indicated that there was adequate ground water to create a pond, a more reliable water source than drilling a well. With well drilling, there is a risk that there won’t be enough water to meet the plants’ needs.  A micro-irrigation system was installed to deliver water from the pond directly to the young trees. This type of watering system conserves more water than a conventional overhead sprinkler system.\n“As we slowly change to the newer high production, higher density plantings, it’s going to make us a lot more successful for the current generation and future generations,” said Rose.\n“If you want to do something right, get the experts involved,” said Rose.  “NRCS has experts; they know how to do it and they know how to do it right. You’re going to get great advice and great people are there to support you.”\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n apple orchard\n Conservation\n harvest heroes\n NRCS",

        "content": "USDA Economic Research Service in\n Research and Science\n Jun 10, \nBook cover: \"Rural Wealth Creation\" edited by John Pender, Bruce A. Weber, Thomas G. Johnson, J. Matthew Fannin \nThis post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nEconomic Research Service (ERS) economists may not wear trench coats and fedoras, but we are investigating significant developments affecting rural America.  In a new book, Rural Wealth Creation, which I co-edited with Bruce Weber, Tom Johnson, and Matt Fannin, we examined the role of wealth, which includes physical, financial, human, natural, social and other forms of assets, in achieving sustainable rural prosperity.\nStrong communities depend upon strong local and regional economies, and prosperous local and regional economies depend on the creation, retention, and distribution of wealth, broadly defined. Wealth contributes to people’s well-being in many ways beyond increasing income. For example, many forms of wealth can provide resilience in tough economic times or enhance the ability of rural people to pursue innovative new opportunities.\nRural communities across the United States lose wealth due to a variety of factors. For example, when people leave their communities to pursue opportunities in metropolitan regions, they take with them knowledge, skills, and labor resources that might have otherwise been reinvested in the rural setting. Research shows that creating and retaining wealth in rural areas is essential for achieving sustainable and broadly shared rural prosperity; one of USDA’s strategic goals. So how do communities retain and grow their wealth?\nWe don’t have all the answers yet, but we are working towards solutions. Creating and maintaining a broad portfolio of wealth may be central to sustainable rural prosperity. Physical infrastructure, natural amenities, and human and social capital can attract people and businesses to rural areas. As reported in Amber Waves, communities are developing wealth creation plans to match their own needs and resource requirements.\nUSDA administers wealth creation strategies such as providing small business loans and housing assistance and managing rural conservation programs to promote rural prosperity. Since wealth is an important gauge of rural economic well-being, understanding how wealth is changing and is distributed helps community leaders and federal policymakers manage and evaluate these programs and their alternatives. We still don’t fully understand how to achieve wealth creation or how to measure it in all rural contexts, but ERS researchers and their university-based colleagues are working to fill the information gaps.\nNo wealth creation strategy will work in every situation. Rural regions and communities benefit from being able to identify strategies best suited to their own means and priorities. Rural Wealth Creation proposes a new framework for measuring wealth and for understanding and classifying different rural wealth creation strategies, the factors affecting them, and their implications.\nRural Wealth Creation is an outgrowth of the National Conference on Rural Wealth Creation and Livelihoods, co-convened by ERS and the Ford Foundation, and supported financially by a grant from the National Institute for Food and Agriculture and by the Ford Foundation. The related ERS report, Rural Wealth Creation: Concepts, Strategies, and Measures, was released in March on the ERS website.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Amber Waves\n ERS\n NIFA\n Rural America\n rural communities\n Science Tuesday",

Farmers, local and regional media listened and questioned Secretary Vilsack on the cause of the floodwaters along the Missouri River affecting Iowa and Nebraska. Secretary Vilsack offered advice and assistance available through the United States Department of Agriculture and other federal agencies.\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack met face-to-face last week with about 40 farmers, ranchers and producers from Iowa and Nebraska impacted by flooding along the Missouri River.  The Secretary promised the group he would stay until every question had been answered and every concerned voiced – and he did just that, engaging in a dialogue that lasted more than two hours.\nThe producers, who are watching floodwaters approach – and in some cases, inundate their fields – expressed concerns about USDA’s ability to help them weather the disaster. Vilsack promised USDA would do all it can. He pointed to the Farm Service Agency and its disaster assistance program that helps producers recover from production and physical losses due to natural disasters. The Secretary also highlighted federal crop insurance programs and their ability to reimburse producers for disaster-related losses.\nAsked by one farmer if he understood the broad implications of the flood, Vilsack responded by describing his experiences dealing with disasters as the governor of Iowa and his recent trips to tornado-stricken areas in the South and flood-ravaged areas in the Midwest. Moreover, at the direction of President Obama and Secretary Vilsack, USDA’s top officials have traveled to areas impacted by flooding, fires and tornadoes across the country.\n“America’s farmers and rural communities are vitally important to our nation’s economy and our values, and my heart goes out to all who are facing hardships because of severe weather and natural disasters,” said Vilsack. “I know this is a hard, frustrating time for folks, and I want all residents, farmers, ranchers and businesses to know that USDA will be working to make sure folks have food, shelter and necessary resources to recover from these challenges. We will continue to work with state and local officials, as well as our federal partners, to get you back on your feet.”\nProducers highlighted challenges with failing levees and the potential for flooded fields that could last all summer.  One Iowa farmer said there was a chance his fields may be unsuitable for planting until .  Vilsack stressed USDA’s readiness to assist and the role the federal government has already played in disaster recovery across the nation.  For instance, USDA has provided over $110 million in disaster-related food assistance to help more than 660,ates and 184 counties. To date, USDA has also provided 10 states a total of $9.6 million to restore land damaged by flooding.\nThe Secretary also stressed his concern for the rural communities along the river and the economic impact of the flooding.  He reminded those in the room that USDA Rural Development has the ability through its Community Facilities program to assist in the construction or repair of a levee that serves to protect the general public.\nVilsack also urged those in the room to be proactive.\n“This is the reality,” he said. “I don't think this is the last wet year we're going to have. I think these extreme weather conditions are part of our future.”\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Rural\n Tags:\n Community Facilities\n Disaster Assistance Program\n federal crop insurance program\n flooding\n FSA\n Joplin\n Missouri\n Rural Development\n Tom Vilsack",

This spring will see the return of the large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. (U.S. Forest Service photo/ Bob Rabaglia)\nThe buzz this spring has started, and some people may think it’s fodder for a new sci-fi movie. But this year’s spring brings a drama closer to home than you think - the pending emergence of brood II of the periodical cicada.\nCicadas are large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. As the male cicadas sing their intense mating songs, some brand it as the sound of summer.\n“Annual cicadas, known as dog-day cicadas in the U.S., are found throughout the world,” said Sandy Liebhold, a research entomologist with the U.S Forest Service’s Northern Research Station. “But the periodical cicadas emerge in massive groups known as “broods” once every 13 or 17 years and are completely unique to North America.”\nThere are 15 brood cycles, each designated by roman numerals. In the U.S., brood II is on track to crawl out of the ground very soon after a 17-year hiatus. They’ll emerge into one of the most densely populated urban/suburban forests in the world.\nThe mass emergence of brood II into the state and private forests of the tri-state area of eastern Connecticut, upstate New York, and northern New Jersey will sound a bit different than the familiar dog-day cicadas. Male cicadas use a special membrane to echo a series of clicks through its abdomen to attract females for reproduction. In chorus, the brood may sound like an insect-sized fleet of jets preparing for lift off, but the sound should be enjoyed as a wonderful spectacle of the mating ritual in the animal world.\nOnce mated, females will lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind, known in the scientific world as oviposition injury, can be quite striking and lead to “flagging” -- the dieback of small limbs.\nForest health aerial surveys conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation reported more than 8,700 acres with flagging left behind from the brood XIV emergence on Cape Cod in . The scarring is mostly superficial but can have a mild impact on the growth of individual host trees. However, the mass emergence can benefit the longer, overall health of eastern forests.\nAfter mating and laying eggs, adult cicadas die and fall to the forest floor. The nutrients released from the mass decay of the brood create a jolt of healthy nutrients available to forest organisms. Researchers have shown that this pulse of nutrition leads to an increase of beneficial microbes and nitrogen in soil, increased tree growth and more robust wildflowers.\nFinally, after three to four weeks, the eggs hatch, the larvae wander under the forest floor where they feed on roots and start the process over again.\nSo, why every 13 to 17 years? Scientists have been pondering this ecological phenomenon for centuries.\n“There is no doubt that by simultaneously emerging at those long intervals, periodical cicadas are able to saturate predators thereby maintaining high population levels,” said Liebhold.\nRecent research also hypothesizes that periodical cicadas emerge when predator birds are at a lower density, suggesting that these amazing insects have queued into a larger ecological cycle – wow!\nThis is what we know but there is still a lot of mystery surrounding these time-travelling bugs. So if you find yourself one of the lucky ones to experience their visit, just sit back and enjoy this remarkable wonder of eastern forests.\nMichael Bohne is an entomologist and forest health group leader with the U.S. Forest Service in Durham, N.H.\nAfter mating, female cicadas lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind can lead to the dieback of small limbs called flagging. Such was the case for these bur oak trees in central Iowa in after a brood emergence of the 17-year cicada.

        "content": "in\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Apr 19, \n As I talk to farmers across the country, regardless of what they produce or where, they all share one common challenge:  how to best move product from the farm to the marketplace.  This is especially crucial for small and midsize farmers who may not have enough capital to own their own trucks, their own refrigeration units, or their own warehouse space.  They might not have the resources to develop sophisticated distribution routes, build effective marketing campaigns or network with regional buyers and customers.\nWithout infrastructure, logistical and marketing support, these producers might be growing the sweetest strawberries or raising the most tender beef, but they lack the infrastructure support to get their exceptional products to your table.\nThat’s why I was delighted to be in Detroit at the Making Good Food Work conference with Senator Debbie Stabenow today announcing the USDA’s most recent findings about food hubs.  Food hubs are innovative business models emerging across the country specifically to provide infrastructure support to farmers. While food hubs are a nascent industry, and many operational food hubs are less than 5 years old, they are based on a time-proven business model of strategic partnerships with farmers, distributors, aggregators, buyers and others all along the supply chain.  The models rely on cooperation instead of competition, and ensure that the regional small and midsize producers get access to the infrastructure they need.\nAn example of a food hub is Detroit’s own Eastern Market, which is buying directly from some of Michigan’s finest small and midsize producers and then distributing that same product across Detroit’s food deserts, into Detroit’s school and directly to consumers at one of the country’s oldest operating farmers markets. Cherry Capital Foods in Traverse City, Michigan is building sound distribution,  aggregation and marketing services for nearly 100 producers and is creating new jobs in Northwest Michigan.  Grasshopper Distribution, a farmer owned food hub, has been building a centralized distribution and aggregation service for Appalachian farmers to sell local products directly to consumers and also to regional groceries and other wholesale customers.\nEastern Market, Cherry Capital Foods and Grasshopper Distribution are just three examples of nearly 100 operating food hubs in the country.  With the help of the Wallace Center at Winrock International, the National Association of Produce Market Managers, and Project for Public Spaces, the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Subcommittee on Food Hubs interviewed and analyzed nearly 70 of these innovative businesses. Our preliminary findings show that food hubs are creating economic opportunity and jobs in their communities, in addition to providing new market opportunities for producers.  There are significant clusters of food hubs in the Midwest and Northeast. The median number of small and midsize suppliers served by an individual food hub is 40, and over 40% of existing food hubs are specifically working in food deserts to increase access to fresh, healthful and local products.\nBut here’s the most exciting part: nearly 40% of food hubs surveyed were started by entrepreneurial producers, non-profits, volunteer organizations, producer groups or other organizations looking to build a strong distribution and aggregation infrastructure for small and midsize producers.  This demonstrates that producers are helping producers. Processors are helping processors. Distributors are helping distributors, and so forth and so on. Moreover, while the USDA has been proud to offer support to nearly 30% of the nation’s operating food hubs, we are even more excited to find that food hubs are business aware and are trying hard to become economically self -sufficient and viable on their own.\nIn short, food hubs are not a flash in the pan.  They are incredibly innovative business models specifically addressing some of our producers’ most overwhelming challenges.  This research is part of USDA’s commitment to understanding food hubs, how they serve communities and what we can do to help them succeed.\nWhen the Food Hub Collaboration completed this survey in March, we knew of over 70 food hubs. Since then, the number of identified food hubs has grown to easily over 100.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n Debbie Stabenow\n Detroit\n Food Hub\n Food Hub Collaboration\n Kathleen Merrigan\n KYF2\n Michigan",

Our interviewers will go door to door and make phone calls to collect the most accurate information possible about farmland in each state. In addition, we’ll ask farmers to report their acres planted by crop, and total grains & oilseeds stored on their farms. We will then spend several weeks processing and analyzing the responses we receive so that we can publish some of the most anticipated by the end of the month. Let’s just say we keep things busy in June!\nPersonally, I’ve gone through all aspects of NASS surveys. Growing up on our family farm in Kansas, I saw my father fill out surveys he received from USDA’s statistical agency. Later I joined NASS myself and got a chance to work with and survey farmers in Kansas, Indiana, and North Dakota. Over time, my career brought me to NASS’ Washington, D.C. office where I lead teams of statisticians who analyze survey and other information to publish official U.S. crop estimates.\nWith this background, I understand how important accurate information is to many people in agriculture. And the best way to have good information is to get it directly from the source – farmers and ranchers. I saw my family make marketing decisions after looking at crop production numbers and reviewing local . Of course it wasn’t just my family. I have heard from many producers how help them make decisions on their farms. In fact, statistics have become a crucial tool in today’s agriculture.\nThese days I don’t interact with individual farmers as much as I used to but I still see the impact of our , as I now get to talk to many ag industry groups whose representatives always point out their need for NASS . These groups rely on the numbers to demonstrate the need for policy changes and make sure that USDA and other decision-makers have an accurate picture of agriculture in every state.\nThis year, I’ve been holding a monthly on Twitter (@usda_nass) as a newer way to answer questions following our key crop releases. It’s a great way for me to reconnect with farmers across the country, answer their questions, and witness firsthand that the interest in agricultural remains ever-strong among today’s farmers.\nI hope everyone contacts NASS for surveys to understand the impact their response can have on their industry both locally and nationally and takes the time to respond. I also encourage everyone to join me for our next on June 30 at 1 p.m. I’ll be online answering your questions about the highly-anticipated Acreage and Grain Stocks .\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Farmers\n NASS\n Ranchers\n statistics\n surveys",

We capture for everything from cotton, fruits, vegetables and specialty crops, livestock, meats, poultry, eggs, grain and hay, to milk and dairy, and tobacco.\nAt some point in our lives, we all wonder what it would be like if we didn’t exist.  How would things be different?  Last month, American farmers and businesses experienced what it was like to live without USDA Market News.  While the markets continued to operate, we received several phone calls and heard stories of how so many small and mid-sized producers struggled without the valuable information we provide.\nIn the 100-year history of Market News, this was only the second time that the were not available.  The give farmers, producers and other agricultural businesses the information they need to evaluate market conditions, identify trends, make purchasing decisions, monitor price patterns, evaluate transportation equipment needs and accurately assess movement.  The information, gathered by the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and provided for free,  captures for everything from cotton, fruits, vegetables and specialty crops, livestock, meats, poultry, eggs, grain and hay, to milk and dairy, and tobacco.\nThe is released within hours of collection, allowing producers and marketers to quickly see which of their commodities are in the greatest demand at which markets.  As an unbiased agricultural resource, USDA Market News helps encourage market stability by promoting healthy competition within the marketplace and providing equal access to market information for small and mid-sized growers trying to get the best prices for their commodities.\nBut for those few weeks in October when the wasn’t available, producers – especially small farmers and ranchers – were left without a benchmark to accurately evaluate the market.  Their risk of over-paying or under-pricing their own goods increased dramatically.\nThe loss of Market News also disrupted other agricultural stakeholders and businesses.

(Courtesy photo Sandra Cummings)\nSandra Cummings is an African American woman who is a part owner of two forested landscapes in Georgia. Her first property, 325 acres of land with a home in the city of Madison, was passed down by her maternal great-grandmother, who was born a slave. The second property consists of 165 acres of land in the town of Portal, which was passed down by her paternal grandfather.\nTo ensure that the family’s ancestral land remains intact, Mrs. Cummings and her family decided to put it into an irrevocable trust to prevent their children and grandchildren from dividing and selling it. “You see, they didn’t grow up in the dirt like we did,” she said. “We grew up working those farmlands, picking cotton, tobacco, planting watermelon. We were able to see the benefits of having this land. My children and grandchildren did not.”\nMrs. Cummings wanted to encourage long-term stewardship of her land, and sought out resources to help achieve this goal. Amadou Diop, an Atlanta-based outreach liaison for the US Forest Service, helped Mrs. Cummings find information about forest management and stewardship plans.\n“If it wasn’t for Amadou’s wealth of knowledge, willingness to help people, and putting me in touch with the resources directly, I would have never been able to get any of this done,” said Mrs. Cummings. “He made sure that I was taken care of, and he deserves a lot of credit.”\nThe Forest Service’s Forest Stewardship Program encourages long-term stewardship of important state and private forest landscapes by assisting landowners to more actively manage their forests and related resources. The Forest Service helped Mrs. Cummings through a forest management and stewardship plan created by the Georgia Forestry Commission, which laid out a 10-year plan for managing the land.\nUnder the plan’s guidance, Mrs. Cummings now uses the land in Madison for timber management, grazing for cattle, and wildlife habitat. She manages the land in Portal for forestry, wildlife, silvopasture (with assistance from the NRCS), and a pine straw operation. As a result, she obtains additional earnings from her land by leasing it out for deer hunting and harvesting pine straw.\nShe is enjoying the benefits of being a forest landowner.\n“One of the benefits for me is the extra income from the pine straw operation —extra income is always good, you know,” she said.\n“It also gives you some self-sufficiency,” she continued. “I will say this: if something were to happen in Atlanta—where we are living now, then we always have a place to go. If we needed to build another house or something….we can do it! So both lands give us some stability.”\nMrs. Cummings intends for her family’s legacy to continue. She hopes to renovate her parents’ home into a historic site and to build a walking trail for guests, and she is exploring the potential for solar power generation on her property in Portal.\nCattle like these graze Mrs. Cummings property in Portal, Georgia.

According to school nurse Virginia Noe, the students “gobbled up” the cauliflower, with and without the dip.\nRecently, an interesting letter came across my desk. The letter was from an Ohio school nurse who wanted USDA to know that students at E. J. Brown Elementary School in Dayton, Ohio, LOVE their USDA-funded Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), now in its second year.  And that makes E.J. Brown’s school nurse Virginia Noe, who wrote the letter, a huge fan of the program and its many positive effects on student eating behavior, health and learning.  Noe shared her thoughts in the enthusiastic and heartfelt letter.\n“The positive response of our student body, staff and parents has been overwhelming. Many tasted pears, plums, jicama and spinach for the first time. Students learned that not all apples are red!” said Virginia.\nBesides expanding their healthy food options, the students researched where produce is grown and, with the help of school staff, started a school garden.\nAs with some other urban districts, many E. J. Brown students have limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables. Thus, they highly value the program and are eager to see what produce is being served each day. Noe that students who were at first hesitant to try new varieties gradually became more adventuresome. And when their first year’s funding ended in March of last year, the students’ disappointment was “palpable.”\nOne parent said, “I would rather they ran out of money for field trips than the fruits and vegetables,” adding, “No more canned pineapple for us because the fresh tastes so much better.”\nE.J. Brown is one of 20 schools in Dayton and 111 in the state of Ohio to receive a Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program grant this school year. Noe is grateful that the school received FFVP funding for a second year. She believes the FFVP is money well spent, as it positively affects the entire student body. “As our country struggles to fight childhood obesity, the impact of learning about and experiencing healthy snacks can be lifelong.” She notes that the FFVP is aligned with key national health and wellness initiatives, including Healthy People /, school wellness mandates, and the First Lady Michelle Obama’s Lets Move! initiative.\nPlease follow USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service on Twitter.\nFirst graders at E.

Photo courtesy NRCS.\nWhen USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded a Conservation Innovation Grant to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in , the notion of administering the nation’s largest water quality trading program in the Ohio River Basin was a twinkle in the eye of EPRI scientist Jessica Fox.\nFast forward to —the multi-state water-trading program is a reality, and the Institute was one of three entities to be awarded this year’s Water Prize by the U.S. Water Alliance.\nThrough Conservation Innovation Grants, NRCS funds projects that develop innovative approaches and technologies for natural resource conservation on agricultural lands. These grants have funded more than 60 environmental markets projects, including a number of the nation’s leading market efforts.\nEPRI’s program, launched when the states of Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana signed a multi-state compact in , works with agricultural producers who voluntarily implement conservation practices that reduce nutrient runoff into local waters. Through the program’s first trades in March , three energy companies purchased these credits and retired them for associated nutrient and ecosystem benefits.\nOn April 13, In front of a crowded auditorium at the National Geographic Society in Washington, DC, Former EPA Deputy Administrator Bob Perciasepe awarded the prize to Fox who accepted on behalf of EPRI. Perciasepe expressed admiration for EPRI’s ability to innovate and engage stakeholders from Duke Energy to the Ohio Farm Bureau, and everyone in between.\nIn her award acceptance remarks, Fox noted that part of the project’s success is that EPRI was never satisfied with developing the nation’s largest water quality trading program, or executing the first trades. “We are always pushing and striving, looking forward to the next chapter.”\nThe next chapter for the Institute begins on May 20 when it holds a public auction for nutrient credits in New York City. These credits were generated through the installation of cover crops, livestock fencing and other conservation practices on 30 farms last summer.\nClick here for a video of Fox describing the project and what it means to win the U.S. Water Prize.\nFind out more about NRCS Conservation Innovation Grants.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Bob Perciasepe\n Conservation\n Conservation Innovation Grants\n EPA\n Indiana\n Kentucky\n NRCS\n Ohio\n Washington DC\n water quality",

        "content": "Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in\n Food and Nutrition\n Aug 25, \nRecent news articles have reported that a healthy diet is expensive if one were to consume the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables.  As the senior economist with the USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) with over 20 years of experience in the area of food economics developing food plans and market baskets, I agree.  Depending on the food choices, a healthy diet can be relatively expensive.\nHowever, there is a compelling fact that these news fail to highlight -- a healthy diet can be relatively inexpensive.  Now some readers of this blog may think that this is another case of economic double talk or spin, but healthy foods come in a variety of forms and a range of prices that likely fit just about anyone’s budget.\nTo help consumers choose a diet that conforms to the Dietary for Americans, CNPP recently introduced a 7-day menu plan to help consumers improve their diet; you can find it at ChooseMyPlate.gov.  Averaged over a week, this menu provides food choices that meet the recommended amounts of key nutrients.  Based on national average food costs, adjusted to prices, the cost of this menu is less than the average amount spent for food, per person, for a 4-person family.  For example, the average food cost for a 2,000 calorie diet is $6.65 per person per day.\nAccording to a USDA study, the total costs for satisfying the USDA food pattern quantity and variety recommendations for fruits and vegetables in the Dietary vary from day-to-day, but average just under $2.00 per day or, approximately, 40 to 50 cents per cup-equivalent, using prices for commonly consumed fruits and vegetables.\nMany of the most commonly consumed fruits and vegetables - such as apples, bananas, navel oranges, fresh whole carrots, onions, and potatoes -- cost less than 40 cents per cup-equivalent.  A recent Produce Marketing Association report “The Cost of the Recommended Daily Servings of Fresh Produce” shows people can meet vegetable and fruit recommendations for about 50 cents per cup. The average price per cup-equivalent across all fresh produce is 42 cents for vegetables and 56 cents for fruits (based on -10 ).  Nationally, the average retail price for fresh vegetables and fruits recommended for a calorie diet is $2.18.\nIn the total U.S., the least expensive fresh vegetables were potatoes, lettuce, eggplant, greens, summer squash, carrots, and tomatillos.  The least expensive fresh fruits were watermelon, bananas, apples, pears, pineapple, and peaches.  According to a USDA study, opting for frozen or canned vegetables and fruits may also lower costs.\nThese studies show it is possible to eat a healthy low-cost diet or one that costs less than what people are presently spending.  In fact, some of the studies showing that a healthy diet is expensive, also admit in their discussion section that a healthy diet can be inexpensive, depending on the food choices a person makes. This is the key - choosing healthy, low-cost foods.\nFor guidance, USDA has a website that helps people make these choices.  It’s called The Recipe Finder Database.  The site contains numerous recipes that are low cost and follow dietary recommendations.  Weekly household menus can be built from these recipes.\nIn addition to selecting healthy, low-cost foods, I find that people need to build good shopping skills.  These skills include doing comparison pricing, using coupons,  buying fruits and vegetables in season, and storing produce bought in bulk in a way that preserves them safely for use over a longer period of time.\nOf course, the selection of healthy foods, whether they be the higher or lower cost options, depends on people having access to such foods.  This is an area of concern and one that USDA continues to address.   In addition, many people in the United States have no income or fall below the poverty threshold.  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly Food Stamps) provides these people with the means to choose low-cost healthy foods.\nTo learn more about healthy eating, go to www.chooseMyPlate.gov.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n CNPP\n DGA\n MyPlate\n SNAP\n SNAP-Ed Connection’s Recipe Finder database",

Check out the NASS Vegetables Summary for the behind the California veggie tour.\nGet your foodie passport ready to tour scrumptious California veggie country! With over 970 thousand acres of harvested vegetables, melons, and strawberries, the just released USDA NASS Vegetables Summary places California at a whopping $7.85 billion in vegetable production – over half of the U.S. total of $13.8 billion. Where are all of these amazing crops grown? Let's take a trip through some of the most delicious and prosperous rural regions in the Golden State.\nJust as the treasured garlic clove rests behind pale, papery covers, the small farming community of Gilroy waits to be discovered off the 101 and 152 travel corridors. Gilroy is centrally located at the southern gateway to Silicon Valley, about 30 miles south of San Jose. California produced over $322 million worth of fresh market garlic. Wowzers! Gilroy may not be in the largest garlic-producing county, but its farmers might claim to be the proudest. Look closer to discover an amazing world-class garlic community touting the internationally renowned Gilroy Garlic Festival and continual celebration of all things \"garlicky.\"\nThe NASS Vegetables Summary positions California as a leading example of rural prosperity. The Golden State is the top producer of artichokes, head lettuce, leaf lettuce (yeah, it's different from head lettuce), romaine, broccoli, spinach and more. Weather, alternating between a moist marine layer from the nearby ocean and cool sunny days, provides the perfect climate to grow everyone's favorite smoothie superfoods in its verdant valleys.\n'Lettuce' head over the 152 to Highway 101 for more tasty fun in Monterey County, an area often referred to as the “Salad Bowl of the World.\" First stop is a Fibonacci favorite, the butter-loving artichoke (it grows according to the mathematical sequence discovered by – you guessed it – Fibonacci). Northern Monterey County features the U.S. artichoke capital in the prosperous rural town of Castroville. From bold artichoke sculptures to daring recipes, the annual Artichoke Festival celebrates California's official state vegetable. According to the Vegetables Summary, California is the sole U.S. producer of artichokes, with production valued at more than $65.5 million in .\nMonterey County boasts some of the most beautiful farmland east of Highway 1. Literary aficionados may know Salinas for the annual Steinbeck Festival (you may have heard of John, great American author and all that), but did you know the Salinas Valley is also recognized as one of the top leafy green producing areas in California? Some of your favorite green superfoods grew up the Salinas Valley of Monterey County. California produced over $850 million of the nation's $926 million broccoli crop and more than half, $242 million, of the nation's $401 million spinach crop. What a vegetable delight!\nScrumptious strawberries make salads, cakes, and even the annual NASS Vegetables Summary more delicious. Take Highway rawberry Festival held in Oxnard. The festival celebrates the $3.1 billion California strawberry industry (out of the U.S. total of $3.5 billion).\nAs you complete your culinary loop back north, consider a drive up Highway 5 or 99. This is the famous Central Valley, where California farmers work hard to feed the country and the world the best foods. If it's tomato harvesting season, don't be surprised to see a few tomatoes strewn along the roadside. Sometimes they fall out of the steady stream of overflowing trucks on their way to the processing plants. The Vegetables Summary suggests everyone loves tomatoes – it’s a billion-dollar crop for California and the United States.\nNo matter which direction you drive in California, you will see a great variety of vegetable crops and a range growing conditions and seasons. You may see small organic farms supporting the burgeoning farm to fork movement. Down the road, you may come across larger farms that grow vegetables that end up on people's plates across America and the world. No matter which way you turn, you will be amazed at what California farmers can grow and thankful for their bounty. Do you have a favorite vegetable stop in your state?

They were fun calls to make as I was letting this year’s awardees know their project had been selected for funding.\nToday USDA announced awards for 71 projects spanning 42 states and the District of Columbia that support USDA’s efforts to connect school cafeterias with local farmers and ranchers through its Farm to School program.\nUSDA Farm to School grants help schools respond to the growing demand for locally sourced foods and increase market opportunities for producers and food businesses, including food processors, manufacturers, and distributors. Grants will also be used to support agriculture and nutrition education efforts such as school gardens, field trips to local farms, and cooking classes. Selected projects will serve more than 13,000 schools and 2.8 million students, nearly 45 percent of whom live in rural communities. Projects are diverse:\nSustain Floyd Foundation in Floyd, Virginia, will expand existing farm to school programs to all schools in Floyd County, and develop and implement promotional campaigns in support of farm to school initiatives while creating a model for rural communities that face particular challenges in food procurement and experiential food-based education. The project will also install a central food storage facility and hydroponic winter growing system.\nAlaska Gateway School District in Tok, Alaska, will enhance an existing greenhouse and garden project to increase on-site food production, as well as work with an agricultural consultant to maximize quality and quantity of food production during Alaska’s short growing season.\nFirstLine Schools Inc. with Edible Schoolyard New Orleans in New Orleans, Louisiana, will expand existing efforts to connect urban kindergarteners and their families to local food sources through healthy, locally procured cafeteria meals and hands-on gardening and cooking activities.\nThe New York Botanical Garden in New York, New York, will integrate school gardening activities with hands-on workshops that are complemented by nutrition education, standards-based curricula, and farmer’s market exercises. The project will also offer professional development for teachers and workshops for parents and administrators.\nCenter for Rural Affairs in Lyons, Nebraska, will train farmers and school food service personnel in farm product safety and usage, provide individual farm to school facilitation for ten pilot schools, and raise awareness of farm to school to lay the foundation for future expansion in Nebraska.\nFor a complete list of FY14 Farm to School grant recipients, please see: \nWithout exception, people on the receiving end of my calls told me I’d made their day and thanked me profusely. USDA is very pleased to be supporting these projects. We know all the credit goes to the award recipients and we thank them for all the great work in improving the health and nutrition of the nation’s children.\nEditor’s Note: USDA recently released the results of the first-ever Farm to School Census, which showed that in school year -, school districts purchased and served over $350 million in local food, with more than half of participating schools planning to purchase more local foods in the future. School districts that missed the opportunity earlier in the year to respond can submit information regarding farm to school practices through November 30, .\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n Alaska\n Farm to School\n Farm to School Census\n Farmers\n KYF2\n Louisiana\n Nebraska\n New York\n Nutrition\n Producers\n Ranchers\n rural communities\n school meals\n schools\n Virginia",

This annual gathering is an opportunity for tribal leaders from around the region to exchange information about current issues in Indian Country.\nWhile there, I discussed the importance of the recently-appointed Council for Native American Farming and Ranching.   The Council was selected by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to suggest changes to USDA regulations and to provide internal guidance or propose measures that would promote the participation of American Indian farmers and ranchers in USDA programs and support government-to-government relations between USDA and tribal governments. The Council is a discretionary advisory committee established in furtherance of Keepseagle v. Vilsack, which was a lawsuit alleging past discrimination by USDA against Native American farmers and ranchers in the way it operated its farm loan program.\nI also met with Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Charles Murphy and shared that USDA will fund a water quality project to rehabilitate and expand a failing sewage treatment system serving members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.\nAt the United Tribes Tribal Leaders Summit , Senior Advisor to Secretary Vilsack Janie Hipp meets with the Commission on Indian Trust Administration and Reform: (Left to right) Dr. Peterson Zah; Fawn Sharp; Janie Hipp; Robert Anderson; and Commissioner Tex Hall ,Tribal Chairman, Three Affiliated Tribes, North Dakota.

This project builds on the commitment of the Obama Administration and Secretary Tom Vilsack to improve the quality of services being provided to Native Americans and Alaska Natives. This project will greatly improve public health, and allow for future expansion of homes and businesses in the area.\nThe Tribe will receive a grant which will be used to rehabilitate and expand an existing lagoon treatment system and construct a 24 acre wetland. The new system will meet Environmental Protection Agency standards and replace a deteriorating 40-year old lift station.

A record drought impacted much of the country and many were impacted by a major hurricane, flooding and severe storms. However, thanks to the resilience of rural Americans, our communities are still going strong.\nOver the course of this year, USDA continued our record efforts to help folks across our nation, and I am proud of the work we carried out.\nWe supported agriculture. This summer, USDA convened the White House Rural Council to help America’s farmers and ranchers overcome drought. We provided unique flexibility for crop insurance that saved producers more than $20 million, expanded emergency lending for producers, opened more than 2.8 million acres of conservation land for emergency forage and more.\nWe promoted exports, with agricultural exports hitting a near-record level this year, and staying on track to set a new record in . New, fully implemented trade agreements promise more than $2 billion in additional agricultural trade every year, and over the course of we broke down even more unfair trade barriers to U.S. products.\nWe supported conservation efforts. In America’s National Forests, we adopted a modern planning rule that will conserve the forest while creating more jobs. We protected more communities, clearing more than 4 million additional acres of flammable brush from forests. We continued our work with more than half a million private landowners to conserve America’s soil and water.\nWe built up communities. USDA provided an additional 10,000 loans and grants for rural businesses.  We helped 150,000 more families achieve the dream of homeownership and carried out more than 1,500 new community facility projects. Meanwhile we expanded our efforts to improve rural infrastructure, with 10,000 new miles of electric line and more than 1,500 water improvement projects.\nWe ensured a safe food supply, and nutritious food for Americans. USDA took historic action this year to further inspect ground and raw beef products, and tighten standards for poultry. We continued our efforts to help one in four Americans put food on the table, while maintaining the integrity of food assistance programs. And we helped provide emergency food assistance for Hurricane Sandy victims – just one of more than 100 disasters for which we have provided this assistance since .\nI’m proud of these efforts. From supporting farmers to furthering business, our wide range of accomplishments stand as proof that USDA touches the lives of every American, every day.  Since , we’ve achieved record results in almost every part of what we do – and I look forward to accomplishing even more in the year to come.\nFor an audio version of this column, click here. \n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Rural\n Tags:\n disaster\n drought\n Forestry\n Hurricane Sandy\n Rural America\n Secretary's Column\n White House Rural Council",

A key indicator is the number of food-insecure people (those who each consume less than a nutritional target of 2,100 calories per day). In the latest report, we estimate food security in 76 countries, in four regions.\nFor , we estimate the situation overall to improve slightly, with the number of food-insecure people declining to 802 million people, from 814 million in .  The decade ahead presents a different picture, with food-insecure numbers rising by 37 million, although this 4.6 percent increase is below the 16.7-percent rise in population.\nThe key factors we measure in determining the level of food security are countries’ domestic food production and their import capacity. In the Asian and Sub-Saharan African regions studied, domestic food production generally plays the most critical role in food security, so increasing output of staple crops will be crucial in improving food security. The countries studied in Latin America and North Africa import a large share of their food supplies, so the capacity to pay for imports is more significant.\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, the region where food insecurity is generally more concentrated, the number of food-insecure people is estimated to decline by 4.3 percent between and .  That slight improvement can be almost entirely attributed to higher expected food production levels. But over the next decade a sizable increase in food insecure people – 15 percent - is projected for the region. The bright spot for the decade is that the share of the population that is food insecure in sub-Saharan Africa is projected to fall from about 42 percent in to 38 percent in .\nConditions vary within regions, and even within Sub-Saharan Africa, the food security situation is expected to improve for some countries. Among the factors in raising food production levels are a country’s ability to make needed investments in new technologies, and farmers’ skills and willingness to adopt the provided technologies.\nOur latest International Food Security Assessment contains on another key indicator of food security: the distribution gap, or the quantity of food needed for each income decile within a country to reach the nutrition target of about 2,100 calories per day. Overall, the distribution gap is projected to hold constant over the next decade. Our report also points out differences among and within regions.\n Category/Topic:\n USDA Results\n Health and Safety\n Tags:\n Economic Research Service\n ERS\n Global Food security\n International Food Security Assessment\n Science",

However, one residential backyard, nearly 6 miles from downtown Atlanta, calls into question whether this is suburbia at all. There were swings, a tree house, and even patio furniture. Yet one feature certified this was not your mother’s suburban home: over a dozen chickens living comfortably in a custom made “Coop de Ville.”   \nThe rise of “backyard poultry” is one of many agricultural phenomena tied to a growing food consciousness and increased urbanization. And while USDA’s fundamental job doesn’t change, the Department does because the challenges do.  The recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at increasingly popular backyard chicken coops underscore this. While this concern was not clearly expressed in the Act of Congress that created the Department, the mandate was. USDA still works to “acquire and to diffuse…information” towards facilitating the protected growth of American agriculture. That service is what brought Research, Education, and Economics Undersecretary Dr. Catherine Woteki to this residence in Decatur, GA. Accompanied by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service officials and a man known best as the “Chicken Whisperer,” Dr. Woteki toured the site and helped to shed light on current HPAI research and important biosafety measures.\n Melvin Washington, Confidential Assistant, Research, Education and Economics Mission Area\n Posted in\n Initiatives\n Animals\n Plants\n Apr 29, \n 1 Response",

Many businesses along the trail have received funding through The Progress Fund, a non-profit community development lender.  The Progress Fund is the recipient of several Rural Development Business Program loans and grants which were passed on to the trail town businesses to help spur economic development in distressed rural areas.\nThe trail affects the local economy in many ways, including an increase in property values, jobs, investment and general consumer spending. According to the Great Allegheny Passage Economic Impact Study, approximately 800,000 trips are taken on the GAP annually, 76 new trail-related businesses have opened and over 93 new jobs were created. In addition to the economic impact, trail towns are vibrant places where people come together. Some travelers pass through on short day trips and others are on multi-day trips, including a bicyclist from Vancouver who shouted, “Hello” to O’Brien as he headed South on the GAP toward Maryland.  A cycle shop in Confluence proudly displays the hometowns of cyclists who stop while travelling through the small town. For several years, a U.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research profile.\nUSDA honors the achievements of American Indians during Native American Heritage Month and year-round.  With educational funding and support from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), Navajo Technical College in Crownpoint, N.M., is one of the many tribal colleges and land-grant institutions doing considerable work in the scientific fields.\nWhen veterinarian Germaine Daye became a professor at Navajo Tech in , the teaching veterinary clinic had been closed for a long time. Recognizing its importance to farmers and ranchers in Navajo Nation, Daye re-opened the clinic’s doors to 50 Navajo Tech students majoring in animal science.\nLast year, six Navajo Tech Veterinary Technology Program students passed their internship training last year, gaining invaluable veterinary technician experience in three clinics throughout the Navajo Nation.   So far, the program has graduated 10 students, some of whom are pursuing college programs that will lead them to vet school, and sparked the interests of 16 excited, new students enrolling this year.\nThe reservation has a  shortage of veterinarians, the clinic’s small animal care supports many people bringing sick animals and also offers ranch calls to ranchers in need.  Daye plans to keep the momentum going by starting a high school animal science program in the future so more American Indian youth can begin a career of caring for animals.\nThe Navajo Tech Veterinary Technology Program is supported in part through NIFA’s Tribal College Equity Grant program. “The Equity grant allowed us to purchase small animal scales, radiology equipment, and materials for comparative anatomy and physiology courses for student use and instruction,” she said. “We also purchased ultrasound and anesthesia equipment and our student are learning to use them in our working teaching hospital. In addition, we purchased patient warmers for the animals that come to us for care.”\nThe Equity Grant program provides the Tribal Colleges with funding to provide students with quality education in the food and agriculture sciences. The nation’s 32 tribal colleges take pride in the hands-on learning they provide students through this grant and Navajo Tech is no exception. You can see a video of the students on an actual farm on NIFA’s website.\nThrough federal funding and leadership for research, education and Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

Recent studies published in Childhood Obesity and Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior indicate that strong farm to school programs can impact consumption of fruits and vegetables, leading to reductions in plate waste.\"Farm to school partnerships have a proven track record of encouraging kids to eat more healthy foods and creating new market opportunities for the farmers that grow them,\" said Vilsack. \"Congress should act quickly to reauthorize the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act to build on the success of farm to school and the healthier school meals and continue our momentum towards a healthier next generation of Americans.\"Through its Farm to School Grant Program, USDA has awarded ates, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands over the past three years. Fifty percent of funded projects included expanding healthy menu options offered in the cafeteria; 46 percent included training for food service staff about menu planning, meal preparation, and cooking with local and regional foods; and 65 percent included nutrition education activities. Forty percent of farm to school grants were awarded to rural schools or districts, and rikeForce states and territories to address challenges associated with rural poverty.Nationwide, more than 40,300 schools have farm to school programs that impact 23.5 million children. According to USDA's first-ever Farm to School Census, released in , school districts participating in farm to school programs purchased and served over $385 million in local food in school year -, with more than half of participating schools planning to increase their purchases of local food in the future. Later this fall, USDA will release updated Farm to School Census .Under the new standards, children are now eating healthier meals at schools. Farm to school programs are one of many tools and resources USDA offers to help schools successfully serve healthier meals. For example, USDA recently launched an initiative called Team Up for School Nutrition Success that allows the schools that still face challenges to pair up and learn best practices from schools that are already successfully serving healthier meals. The program has provided training for more than 3,500 individuals and has been enthusiastically received by schools and school officials.For the past three years, kids have eaten healthier breakfasts, lunches and snacks at school thanks to the bipartisan Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, which made the first meaningful improvements to the nutrition of foods and beverages served in cafeterias and sold in vending machines at schools in 30 years. Over 95 percent of schools report that they are successfully meeting the updated nutrition standards, and a recent poll shows that more than eight in ten Americans support the healthier school meals.Factsheet: Schools Serving, Kids Eating Healthier School Meals Thanks to Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

Rural Development provided $8.7 million in Tribal Set-Aside Water and Environmental Program funds for the project.  When completed in two years, the water line will stretch 70 miles across four counties to provide clean, healthy water to those living in this remote area of New Mexico.\nDuring the dedication ceremony, Earl Herrera the Hataalii (medicine man) asked the officials from each of the agencies, including RD State Director Terry Brunner, to participate in the traditional blessing of the water system.  Each sprinkled corn pollen on themselves and the earth to give thanks for the construction of the water system.\nA weaver from the Pueblo Pintado Navajo Chapter created a USDA rug commemorating the ceremonies that said “Ahehee” or “Thank you” in Navajo.\nA Navajo rug was presented to State Director Terry Brunner during the dedication and blessing of the Eastern Navajo Waterline ceremonies.

They come in a variety of sizes, shapes, , textures, and flavors and can be worked into every meal. On their own, mushrooms are pretty healthful – very low in calories, free of cholesterol and (almost) free of fat. They are also naturally low in sodium, high in potassium, and are generally high in vitamins and minerals.\nStuffing mushrooms just makes something wonderful ever better!  But what you stuff in these tasty little vegetables can make or break the dish. Typically, mushrooms are stuffed with foods containing saturated fats and sodium. So, if you’re trying to watch one or both of these in the New Year, consider various herbs and spices!\nHerbs and spices do a nice job of seasoning many of my favorite foods. When I decided long ago to reduce my intake of saturated fats, I knew that my taste buds would miss the flavors of these fats and the foods that contain them, but I didn’t want to settle for a bland diet. So, I invested in several healthy cookbooks and read (and reread) the chapters on herbs and spices. The results have been quite impressive.\nThey say that “variety is the spice of life,” but I like to think that “spices add variety to life.” Along with the spices came exciting and unlimited flavor combinations. Now, I choose whatever suits my mood. (Is there anything more inviting than a kitchen that smells of sautéed fresh rosemary?)\nStart adding more flavor to your plate in and you’ll see what I mean. Enjoy the Herb-Stuﬀed Mushrooms!\nBe sure to check out the rest of our MyPlate Holiday Makeover Series and visit www.ChooseMyPlate.gov for more ideas, nutrition advice, and recipes.\nDave’s Herb-Stuﬀed Mushrooms recipe\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n choosemyplate.gov\n CNPP\n family\n Food and Nutrition\n Foods\n herbs\n Holidays\n mushrooms\n MyPlate\n MyPlateHolidayMakeover\n Nutrition\n Recipes\n spices",

Their School of Agriculture and Environmental Science has embraced the Obama Administration’s commitment to protecting the air we breathe, water quality, and land that supports and sustains us.\nThe President has taken unprecedented action to build the foundation for a clean energy economy, tackle the issue of climate change, and protect our environment.  He stated that “As we recover from this recession, the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of jobs - but only if we accelerate that transition. Only if we seize the moment.\"\nAs the Risk Management Agency’s Associate Administrator, representing USDA, I recently carried the message to A&T that we recognize and applaud the innovation and technology used on their research farm to safely and responsibly develop biofuels from animal waste solids, and for using that fuel to power vehicles used on the farm.  On the university farm biofuels are used extensively as replacements or additives for gasoline or diesel, and the educational value it provides is proving to be beneficial to producers and end users alike, thus strengthening small farm communities.\nAs hog operations in North Carolina increase in size, so does the amount of waste and the need for innovative strategies for its disposal and treatment, particularly as water quality regulations improve. Additionally, with the state’s growing population, more people are living near swine operations which increases the level of concern about environmental issues like water pollution and odor.\nIn step with the Chancellor’s vision for an institution that is ‘outwardly engaged,” the university farm uses “constructed wetland cells” containing plant life such as cattails and bulrushes to remove nitrogen, phosphorus and ammonium from swine wastewater, while water in the cells coverts nitrogen to nitrogen gas which is released harmlessly into the air.  Before reaching the wetland cells, swine wastewater flows through two anaerobic lagoons.  After treatment in the cells, wastewater is held in storage prior to land application.  The water is then filtered to the point that it can be used for land application or for washing down swine parlors, the effluent can be applied back onto the fields, and the solids used for Biofuels, essentially completing the renewable cycle.\nWetlands remove excess nitrogen and other waste from the water through filtration, plant uptake, sedimentation and other biological processes.  With soil and plant resources occurring naturally in the wetland environment, wetlands provide a natural buffer between waste and the valuable resource of clean water.\nI was very impressed with the accomplishments at North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University in Greensboro, NC and applaud their efforts. With the considerable environmental challenges our country faces, it is encouraging to meet a talented group of people committed to doing something about it.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Barbara Leach\n Environment\n North Carolina\n RMA",

The ways they accomplish this include: smoke monitoring; providing input in developing and maintaining state smoke management programs; providing input and analysis to projects with activities that could affect air quality; air quality monitoring; and ensuring that forest management plans include activities to meet national standards set by the Clean Air Act.\nAnd, we are seeing results.\nIn the midst of news about worsening environmental degradation due to climate change, air quality in the Eastern and Southern regions is improving. compiled by the Air Program from to shows that rain became less acidic, wilderness views became clearer, and tropospheric ozone levels dropped on our national forests. That means residents from Minnesota to Missouri to New Hampshire in the East, and from Virginia to Florida to Puerto Rico in the South are breathing easier and enjoying more scenic views.\nThese findings are attributed to decades of work by the Forest Service and partners from state and federal air regulatory agencies.\nIt’s hoped that additional positive findings will stem from this, such as improvements in soil productivity and health of aquatic organisms. Environmental scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have already collected showing improvements in acid neutralizing capacity in some Adirondack and Catskill streams and lakes, a key environmental indicator of aquatic health. We expect similar findings will soon be discovered in streams in the Eastern Region.\nWe can all celebrate by looking for opportunities to contribute to clean air in our communities.

USDA Photo. \nWOW! The word “wow” only moderately conveys the historic events that unfolded this summer during the Department of Navy’s Rim of the Pacific Exercises (RIMPAC) Great Green Fleet (GGF) demonstration. The might and power of the United States Navy coupled with that of scores of other Pacific Rim counties was impressive, but moreover a number of the great ships and aircraft were fueled by a mix of algae and animal fats.\nYes, advanced biofuels produced from American grown algae and waste animal fats powering the all-powerful military platforms! The man with the vision behind this innovation, Secretary of Navy Ray Mabus, would proudly note the Navy’s continuing global leadership as an innovator – having led maritime vessels from sails to coal-fired steam, from coal to oil and nuclear; and now the transition to advanced biofuels. Tom Vilsack, Secretary of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) would later expounded upon that message of innovation, “We can, as a nation, change the fuel production and distribution paradigm in the world, if we are consistent in our efforts to increase our production and use of domestic biofuels which are important to our energy and national security as well as create jobs.”\nFor nearly four years, Secretaries Mabus and Vilsack have made a coordinated and concerted effort to support the development and stand-up of a domestic biofuels sector. The USDA has lent support to furthering research and business start-ups for biomass production and waste stream diversion, and the Navy has sought to test, demonstrate and accelerate investments in advanced biofuels for use in its many platforms. Both secretaries have identified the importance of establishing geographically diverse supply sources of biomass and biofuels and noted that the State of Hawaii has a strategic role to play; hence, the RIMPAC exercises off-shore from Honolulu Hawaii was a perfect match to demonstrate the capacity advanced biofuels in the GGF.\nOn the designated day for the GGF demonstration, I represented the USDA and traveled with navy and congressional staff and representatives of the several airlines; assembling before daybreak for briefings and preparations for transport on a propeller-driven aircraft out to the USS Nimitz, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. We donned military issue life jackets, goggles and cranial helmets with ear muffs; yet, the ear protection only afforded limited attenuation of the excessive noise throughout much of the day.\nWe headed out onto tarmac of Hickam Air Force Base and took seats facing the back of the no-frills plane. Squinting to see in the suddenly dark space as the back hatch closed, a mixture of 50 percent biofuels and fossil fuels raced through the aircraft’s engines, and the roar became deafening. The engines, gorged with the algae and animal fat mix; and the plane roared down the runway and into the sky.\nTraveling 45 miles due north of Honolulu, through the aircraft’s single viewing pane, naval vessels could be seen dotting the sea and the horizon. Cruisers, destroyers and then the USS Nimitz came into view.\nShips and planes off the coast of Hawaii, participating in the Great Green Fleet demonstration.\nAfter we landed on the Nimitz and scrambled out of the aircraft, we were hit by the full might of steel upon the sea – the carrier’s deck 1,100 feet in length and 250 feet wide with a 10-story high bridge for observation and traffic control. Jets everywhere, attended to by squadrons of seamen grabbed in Navy Working Uniforms, colored light-weight turtle necks defining each squad’s role in the GGF demonstration.\nKeeping to an aggressive schedule, we viewed various operations including radar and navigation rooms; a tactical operation room for RIMPAC led this year by the Chilean Navy; and anchors the size of an office.\nSecretary Mabus heralded the multi-day GGF demonstration, which was supported with the purchase of 450,000 gallons of non-food waste (used cooking oil) from Louisiana-based Dynamic Fuels LLC, included algae produced by Solazyme. Meeting the Navy’s criteria, the fuel was: 1) “drop-in” and compatible with existing technology; 2) derived from non-food sources; and 3) its combustion would not increase the carbon footprint.\nBack at the Flag Deck, the GGF demonstrations ramped up with a dozen jets in high idle, rocking and trembling with a deafening roar of engines each waiting to be catapulted from the deck of the USS Nimitz. Once air-born, the 50/50 biofuel blend kicked in and the jets soared and flashed by the carrier at great speed and in tight formation. Flying the world’s most advanced aircraft with precise precision, the pilots accomplished mid-air refueling and touch and go maneuvers. The crew on deck and the spectators were enveloped fumes from fuel, oils and metallic dust; combined with heat emanating from the engines and the thunderous rumble, and everyone agreed that this was as Secretary Mabus stated, “A historic day.”\nFor more about the Navy’s Great Green Fleet visit the Green Fleet website, or to read or listen to secretaries Mabus and Vilsack debrief on the Great Green Fleet visit the USDA website.\n Category/Topic:\n Energy\n Tags:\n biofuels\n Clarence W.

Because the samples taken for E. coli testing are much larger than those we have taken in the past for Salmonella, there is higher likelihood that we will be able to detect the bacteria if it is present.\nOnce FSIS has collected enough about the prevalence of Salmonella in ground beef, we will create a new standard to encourage ground beef processors to strengthen their Salmonella controls, resulting in safer products and fewer foodborne illnesses.  The collection process will take some time, but it is critical that the new standard is supported by meaningful .  Of course, we will continue to analyze any positive samples for multi-drug resistance and specific serotypes to determine whether they are contributing to human illnesses.\nSalmonella is the most urgent issue facing FSIS when it comes to protecting consumers and it is why we developed our Salmonella Action Plan.  This plan details our strategy for reducing the number of Salmonella-related illnesses, and this enhancement to our sampling and testing programs is part of that comprehensive effort.  Another part of our war on Salmonella is encouraging consumers to take steps to protect themselves from illnesses, including cooking all ground beef to 160 °F (poultry should be cooked to 165 °F).  For more information on ways to keep your family Salmonella-free this summer, we invite you to check out FoodSafety.gov or AskKaren.gov before your next cook out.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n Tags:\n Ask Karen\n beef\n Food Safety\n foodborne illness\n FSIS\n Grilling\n Salmonella",

By remaining connected to both customers in the field and to regional and national government leaders, the on-the-ground knowledge of customer needs can much more quickly drive needed changes in policies and procedures that make USDA’s programs more accessible to the American public.\nThese tools also make it possible for employees to more effectively work outside the normal office environment. Increasingly, employees are “tele-working” on a regular basis, which drives down the cost of government facilities leases and transit subsidies, and also enables managers and employees to continue their service during inclement weather conditions that force government offices to close.\nJust a few of the innovative tools in use today at USDA include:\nYour Two Cents, an online platform developed by USDA to serve as a virtual space for employees to talk about innovative solutions to difficult challenges, leading to the increased efficiency and effectiveness of program processes. Your Two Cents and other USDA sites like it are enabling leaders to better harness the collective experience of employees, and to foster an exchange of knowledge between co-workers who might not otherwise have had the opportunity.\nUSDA Connect is a collaboration tool available to all USDA employees. Equipped with powerful social networking capabilities, it enables teams to work collaboratively on projects, regardless of location. When employees in the field work virtually with colleagues, they are better stewards of taxpayer dollars, saving on travel without sacrificing the ability to share knowledge in the pursuit of innovative solutions.\nAgLearn, a virtual university for USDA’s employees, is a low cost, one-stop shop for employee development and training that can be accessed from anywhere in the world. Employees are encouraged to set individual development goals and to take advantage of the more than courses, 20,000 professional development books, and hundreds of videos that are available at a cost of less than 10 dollars per employee per year.\nThese and many other innovative tools helped develop the modern USDA for a stronger rural America.

These resources have helped the community generate above-average economic growth through its agricultural, food processing, manufacturing, and shipping sectors. As these industries have grown, however, a significant shortage of affordable workforce housing has made finding and keeping skilled employees difficult and hinders further economic development in this promising community.\nIn order to secure affordable housing, many who work in Boardman have had to endure long commutes from outlying towns or settle for homes that simply did not meet their families’ needs. Martin Paredes, Olgalibia Rosales Rivera, and their four children are one such family. Due to a lack of rental options in the community, the family was living in a two-bedroom apartment in a part of town that offered few family-friendly amenities and services.\nLast month, the Umatilla County Housing Authority and CASA of Oregon opened the doors to Castle Rock Apartments, with 40 brand-new rental units located adjacent to schools, a grocery store, health care, churches, transportation, a safe playground, and more. To develop a quality housing facility with “built to last” standards, a number of federal, state, local and nonprofit partners worked together to identify financing options that included funding and tax credits provided by the State of Oregon and the federal government. USDA Rural Development provided a $2.4 million low-interest loan through the Farm Labor Housing Program, which offers low-interest financing to develop housing for those working in agriculture and food processing. The program also offers a rental subsidy to ensure housing and utility costs do not exceed 30 percent of a household’s income.\nToday, Martin Paredes and his family live in a new, four-bedroom apartment with plenty of room for the children. In addition, the rent is lower, allowing the family to start saving for the future. “We hope to buy our own home someday,” Paredes said.\nAnother resident, Lisa Garcia Mendez, explains that before the new complex was built, apartments in Boardman were too expensive for farm worker families and, even then, the options were just not good. Moving to Castle Rock has changed things for her family of six. “I just feel safer here with my kids,” Mendez said.\nTo find out more about USDA Rural Development Housing programs click here.\nDancers wearing indigenous Mexican regalia perform a traditional blessing at the grand opening of the Castle Rock Apartments in Boardman, Oregon, where 62 percent of the population is of Hispanic descent.

The bipartisan Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of mandated that the USDA set for what needed to be included in local school wellness policies in areas such as setting goals for nutrition education and physical activity, informing parents about content of the policy and implementation, and periodically assessing progress and sharing updates as appropriate. As part of local school wellness policies, the proposed would ensure that foods and beverages marketed to children in schools are consistent with the recently-released Smart Snacks in School standards. Ensuring that unhealthy food is not marketed to children is one of the First Lady's top priorities; that is why it is so important for schools to reinforce the importance of healthy choices and eliminate marketing of unhealthy products.\"The idea here is simple—our classrooms should be healthy places where kids aren't bombarded with ads for junk food,\" said First Lady Michelle Obama. \"Because when parents are working hard to teach their kids healthy habits at home, their work shouldn't be undone by unhealthy messages at school.\"This action comes after the White House Summit on Food Marketing to Children last fall where Mrs. Obama called on the country to ensure children's health was not undermined by marketing of unhealthy food.\"The food marketing and local wellness standards proposed today support better health for our kids and echo the good work already taking place at home and in schools across the country. The new standards ensure that schools remain a safe place where kids can learn and where the school environment promotes healthy choices. USDA is committed to working closely with students, parents, school stakeholders and the food and beverage industries to implement the new and make the healthy choice, the easy choice for America's young people,\" Secretary Vilsack said.To help schools with the implementation of the school wellness policies, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched a new \"School Nutrition Environment and Wellness Resources\" website, which includes sample wellness policy language for school districts and a dedicated page of resources for food marketing practices on the school campus.These new resources will complement a second announcement which highlights the nationwide expansion of a successful program that was piloted in 11 states with the goal of ensuring children who are in need of nutritious meals are receiving them. Beginning July 1, , more than 22,000 schools across the country—which serve primarily low-income students—will be eligible to serve healthy free lunches and breakfasts to all students. This will help as many as 9 million American children eat healthy meals at school, especially breakfast, which can have profound impacts on educational achievement.

According to new , there are now 21,ates and 31,160 around the world.\"Organic food is one of the fasting growing segments of American agriculture,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. \"As consumer demand for organic products continues to grow, the USDA organic seal has become a leading global standard. The increasing number of organic operations shows that USDA's strong support for the vibrant organic sector is helping to create jobs and opportunities in rural communities.\"According to released by the Agricultural Marketing Service's (AMS) National Organic Program (NOP), the number of domestic certified organic operations increased by almost 12 percent between and , representing the highest growth rate since and an increase of nearly 300 percent since the count began in . The total retail market for organic products is now valued at more than $ates and over $75 billion worldwide.Along with consumer demand for organics, increasingly they are asking for local foods. Under Secretary Vilsack, USDA has supported providing consumers a stronger connection to their food with more than $1 billion in investments to over 40,000 local and regional food businesses and infrastructure projects since between . Industry estimates that U.S. local food sales totaled at least $12 billion in , up from $5 billion in . More information on how USDA investments are connecting producers with consumers and expanding rural economic opportunities is available in Chapter IV of USDA Results on Medium published today.USDA has strengthened programs that support organic operations over the past seven years, helping to make organic certification more accessible, attainable, and affordable through a \"Sound and Sensible\" approach. This initiative includes streamlining the certification process, focusing on enforcement and working with farmers and processors to correct small issues before they become larger ones.USDA has also established a number of resources to help organics producers find technical and financial resources to help them grow domestically and abroad. The site www.usda.gov/organic creates a one-stop-shop for operators, and USDA has made market and pricing information for approximately 250 organic products available free of charge through USDA's Market News. In , USDA made more than $11.5 million available to assist organic operations with their certification costs.The NOP maintains the list of organic operations and leads activities that support organic integrity and market growth. In addition, USDA helps organic stakeholders access programs that support conservation, provide access to loans and grants, fund organic research and education, and mitigate threats from pests and diseases. USDA also administers organic certification cost-share programs that offset the costs of organic certification for U.S. producers and handlers.The announced today are publicly available as part of the recently launched Organic Integrity Database, a modernized system for tracking certified organic operations. In the past, USDA published an updated list of certified organic operations once each year. With the new database, made possible by the Farm Bill, organic certifiers can add new operations and report changes to existing operations at any time, allowing USDA to report updated counts of certified organic operations throughout the year. The modernized system will provide for market research, enable stakeholders to identify market opportunities and make supply chain connections, support international verification of operator status to facilitate trade, and establish technology connections with certifiers to share more accurate and timely .Additional information about USDA resources and support for the organic sector is available on the USDA Organics Resource page.Since , USDA has focused significant and targeted investments in America's rural communities to bring transformative change to millions of rural businesses and families, demonstrating USDA's efforts to help farmers and ranchers bring their products to tables domestically and abroad, build critical infrastructure in America's rural areas, conserve our nation's natural resources through long-lasting partnerships, and continuously work toward improving the lives of all Americans. Those investments have blossomed across the United States with substantial results in the burgeoning bio-economy, an exploding local and regional food system, unparalleled investments in renewable energy, improved nutrition interventions for young people, historic partnerships in conservation and greenhouse gas reduction, and major contributions in rural infrastructure, among some.

Ninety feet away, batters, armed only with a wooden stick, prepare to face them. Many parts of America’s national pastime have changed over the years, but the two key elements – putting bat to ball – have remained at its core.\nUntil recently, though, this was taken for granted. An invasive beetle, the emerald ash borer (EAB), has been bearing down on North American forests like a pitch from Justin Verlander. This pest beetle has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees since they were discovered near Detroit in . Ash is one of the main sources of wood for bats used in Major League Baseball.\nBut there is hope: scientists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Forest Service (FS), and Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) have found and unleashed several predators of the EAB that unsettle the insect like a high-and-tight fastball.\n“We have four parasitic wasps from the pest’s native home (Northeast Asia) approved and released,” said Jian Duan, entomologist with the ARS Beneficial Insects Introduction Research unit in Newark, DE. “The beauty of these wasps is that they are specialized to feed only on the eggs or larvae of the EAB. They do not feed on the ash tree itself, or any other trees or crops, and they haven’t bothered pollinators or other beneficial insects.”\nWhile the wasps alone will not eradicate the EAB, they have controlled them to the point that they are killing far fewer trees. That’s a win for baseball because it may keep bats in the hands of hitters from T-ball through the big leagues for years to come.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Agricultural Research Service\n ARS\n USDA Science\n Forest Service\n Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service\n APHIS\n emerald ash borer\n You May Also Like\n USDA Nutrition Research Fuels Olympians’ Engines\n Meet Mari Gomez—Public Servant at USDA & Leader in Her Community\n Shining a Spotlight on USDA Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area Employees",

Scuse mentioned a new microloan program designed to help small and family operations, beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers secure loans under $35,000. Microloans will help producers through their start-up years by providing needed resources and helping to increase equity so that farmers may eventually graduate to commercial credit and expand their operations. Scuse also spoke about the importance of communicating effectively with rural America.\n“We need to work together to make agriculture strong, to make rural America strong, so that when we speak, our voice is heard,” said Scuse. “That's the message we are trying to get out. That's the message we would ask all of you to get out.”\nFrom -, U.S. agricultural exports alone generated more than $478 billion that supported more than 1 million jobs in communities across the country. According to Scuse, for every 1 billion dollars in trade, 7,800 jobs are supported. “Agriculture has been part of the backbone of this nation’s economy for the last several years,” he said. “Our rural communities faired far better than the big cities did.”\nJami Willard has been attending the forum for the past four years and wants her work in the field to positively impact others.\n“I want to make big changes and help set people up to succeed,” said Willard, a Penn State graduate who grew up on a farm in Pennsylvania but currently works at Northwest Harvest, a non-profit food bank distributor in Washington state. “I understand the complexity of the industry and I can talk to producers and do something to impact people positively. [Through this program] my voice is being heard.”\nParticipants heard from representatives from the Farm Credit Administration, National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and Tyson Food. They also had round table discussions, receptions with congressional leaders and took a trip to Capitol Hill for a Congressional briefing.\nThis is Kathryn Shallenberger’s third year attending the program. An agriculture teacher in Illinois, Shallenberger grew up on a 200-acre corn and soybean farm. “This program has provided a network of people for guidance and support,” said Shallenberger. “It offers an opportunity for me to take back the message to my students that the world is so much bigger than them and what we do in agriculture now won’t only affect them, but their parents and their children.”\n Category/Topic:\n USDA Results\n Tags:\n Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program\n FAS\n FSA\n Michelle Obama\n microloans\n National Young Farmer Educational Association\n RMA\n Rural America",

USDA photo by Stephen Ausmus.\nLess than 2 years ago, the USDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched the U.S. Food Waste Challenge, with the goal of reducing food waste in the United States.  We set an ambitious goal of having at least 400 businesses, schools, and/or organizations join the challenge by letting us know what they are doing to reduce food waste in their operations.  USDA also committed to finding ways in which its 33 agencies and offices could help reduce food waste through policy, partnerships, and research.\nAs of today, we have surpassed our membership goal by signing up 1,313 participants in the U.S. Food Waste Challenge.\nThe number and diversity of participants joining the challenge are indicative of a growing movement to reduce food waste that is spreading across the country.\nFounding members, Rio Farms, Unilever, General Mills, and the Food Waste Reduction Alliance have been joined by members from across the food supply chain.  Hannaford, a supermarket chain in the Northeast, recently joined the U.S. Food Waste Challenge and shared the many ways in which it keeps food from ending up in landfills.  Using the “food recovery hierarchy,” Hannaford tries to reduce food waste at the source by having fresh products delivered on a daily basis instead of 3-4 times per week.  Daily deliveries lead to more accurate ordering, less food waste, and improvements in quality.  Safeway, another supermarket chain participating in the U.S. Food Waste Challenge, donates the wholesome, edible food that goes unsold in their stores to feed hungry people.  In , Safeway recovered and donated 72 million pounds of food to hunger relief organizations.\nOther participants in our challenge like K-12 schools, universities, and sports teams are also involved in food recovery and donation activities.  With the help of organizations like Campus Kitchens and Food Recovery Network, over 120 colleges and universities have started food recovery efforts in their dining facilities to donate wholesome unsold food to local food pantries.  Sports teams like the Milwaukee Brewers and movie studios like NBC Universal have also signed up for the challenge because of their work with Rock and Wrap It Up!, an organization that recovers and donates unsold food at sporting events and movie shoots.\nMoving down the food recovery hierarchy, some participants in our challenge keep food from landfills by converting it to livestock feed.  Four Minnesota schools in the Chisago Lakes School District have their food waste picked up by Barthold Pig Farm, where it is then heated and fed to pigs. The 72 McDonalds’ in Hawaii now sell their used cooking oil to Pacific Biodiesel, where it is then recycled into fuel.\nNot to be outdone by all of our U.S. Food Waste Challenge participants, the USDA also delivered on reducing food waste through our policies, partnerships, and research.  USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) continues to study and provide estimates on how much food goes uneaten at the retail and consumer level.  The estimated pounds, monetary value, and calories of food loss that USDA ERS helps policymakers, the food industry, and nonprofits better explain the food waste issue to the public, make recommendations, and set targeted goals.\nThrough the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the USDA is researching and developing new products that help 1) reduce food spoilage; 2) reuse waste from food processing to produce new value-added products; and 3) recycle food waste into livestock feed or biobased products such as biodegradable plastics. ARS, for example, helped Gorge Delight, a grower-owned business, develop a 100% fruit bar that uses blemished or damaged apples and pears from their orchards that would have otherwise been discarded.  Not only does ARS’s work help reduce food waste, but it also creates new economic opportunities in rural areas.\nFor consumers and families, USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has updated the “Ask Karen” website, which is visited over 10 million times a year, to answer people’s questions on how to safely handle, prepare, and store food.  FSIS, which is responsible for ensuring that the nation’s commercial supply of meat, poultry, and egg products is safe and correctly labeled, recently streamlined procedures for donating wholesome misbranded meat and poultry products.  In April , as a result of this directive, FSIS was involved in the donation of approximately 84,310 pounds of misbranded pork sausage.  The misbranded product was donated to the Westmoreland County Food Bank and Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank.\nFinally, here at USDA headquarters in Washington, D.C., the cafeteria, which serves up to 3,000 people a day, has found some innovative ways to reduce food waste.  The dining service company, IL Creations, holds “Happy Hour” from 2:30 pm – 3:00 pm, at which food is sold at a 30% discount to reduce the amount of unsold leftovers.  For people with eyes bigger than their stomachs, USDA has promoted composting and made it easy for employees by placing composting bins all over the building.   In , USDA headquarters composted about 2,650 pounds of food waste per week.  This represents about a 10% increase from , which is double our original goal of a 5% increase.\nThe goal we had for launching the U.S. Food Waste Challenge was to help inspire organizations and individuals across the food supply chain to start reducing, recovering, and recycling food waste in their day-to-day operations.  What we didn’t expect was how much your energy, passion, and support would push us to do more.  Indeed there is so much more work to be done to reduce food waste in America, and we want to continue working on this issue for years to come.\nUSDA FSIS recently changed on donation of mislabeled meat and poultry products. In April , this new directive led to 84,310 pounds of misbranded pork sausage being donated to local food pantries instead of being dumped into a landfill. \n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n ARS\n Ask Karen\n Compost\n EPA\n ERS\n food loss\n food recovery\n Food Safety\n Food Waste\n FSIS\n Hawaii\n Minnesota\n restaurants\n supermarkets\n U.S. Food Waste Challenge\n Washington DC",

Elizabeth is the granddaughter of the original homesteader and the first in her family to seek NRCS conservation assistance.\nNRCS oversaw the installation of riparian fencing to on the ranch to protect a creek on the property—a tributary of Stemple Creek—from over-grazing and erosion, improving water quality. We also partnered with a local conservation organization to plant native vegetation for improved wildlife habitat, hiring local contractors to do the work.\nWith the $200,emple Creek Watershed improvement, NRCS completed similar work on two other farms, a conventional chicken farm and a small family-run dairy.\nThe Recovery Act, was created by the Obama Administration to boost the economy, in part by developing and improving the Nation’s infrastructure. The Stemple Creek work (on these three properties, but also many others) is part of a continuum of proactive partnership and voluntary conservation that developed after the EPA declared the watershed impaired under Section 303d of the Clean Water Act in due to high sediment loads. The creek flows to California’s northern coast, where it empties into the Gulf of Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. The sanctuary provides habitat for threatened species such as the California freshwater shrimp.\nThe Recovery Act funds granted to these three projects has contributed to the tremendous conservation improvements in the Stemple Creek Watershed over the past 20 years, which have resulted in dozens of miles of restored stream banks and almost every dairy in the watershed completing water quality improvements. Every day, I am inspired and impressed by the work of our local landowners and conservation partners in this watershed.\nLearn more about NRCS Recovery Act Programs here.\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\nCheck out other conservation stories on the USDA blog.\nCharlette Epifanio, NRCS district conservationist in Petaluma, California, visits with landowner Elizabeth Cunningham about her riparian conservation project.\n Category/Topic:\n Initiatives\n Conservation\n Rural\n Tags:\n ARRA\n California\n Clean Water Act\n EPA\n NRCS\n Petaluma\n USDA",

        "content": "WIC Program Integrity Branch Chief, Food and Nutrition Service in\n Food and Nutrition\n Aug 05, \nFNS has taken a range of steps to ensure the highest level of integrity in WIC.\nFor more than 40 years, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has provided supplemental foods and nutrition services vital to the health and nutrition of vulnerable moms, newborns and young children. And throughout those four decades, we’ve had a long-standing history of working with WIC state agencies to ensure program resources and taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently.\nWhile a study found a relatively low rate of improper vendor payments, (representing less than 1.5 percent of WIC food expenses), FNS has and will continue to intervene when problems arise and to require state agencies to improve the integrity of their programs.\nFNS is vigilant about the integrity of all of its food assistance programs, including WIC. That’s why in , FNS established the Program Integrity and Monitoring Branch to oversee WIC integrity initiatives. This new branch plays a key role in WIC monitoring and oversight and it is paying close attention to vendor management practices to ensure the program pays only fair prices to retailers for WIC foods. It provides technical assistance to address areas of concern and to disseminate information about noteworthy initiatives. The branch also supports electronic benefit transfer (EBT) implementation efforts, which vastly improves integrity by simplifying the benefit transaction for participants and cashiers and improving states’ ability to track prices stores are charging and redemption patterns. \nHere’s a list of some of our steps we’re taking to ensure integrity:\nProviding Direct Technical Assistance\nIn September , FNS completed reviews on vendor management practices in each state with a retail food delivery system, including the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.  FNS is working with state agencies to correct all problems identified through these reviews.\nIn December , FNS launched a process to assess the strength of vendor management practices nationwide.  We’re now developing technical assistance materials on paying competitive prices for supplemental foods to help state agencies improve their vendor management practices. The first set of topic-specific tools are expected by the end of June and rolled out later this year. FNS is also developing a comprehensive Vendor Management Handbook to improve the quality and consistency of vendor oversight activities.\nFNS staff have recently provided web-based program integrity trainings in two priority areas—income eligibility and certification, as well as vendor management.  To date, two vendor management webinars have been presented and several more are in the planning stages. \nAddressing WIC Foods Sold Online\nIn , WIC began working with major social media sites (Amazon, Craigslist, eBay and Facebook) to address the potential online sale of WIC foods.  Amazon strengthened its policies on prohibiting certain types of sales not only for WIC, but also for SNAP, as a direct result of our request.  Craigslist also has policies prohibiting the sale of WIC and SNAP cards or foods and eBay has a warning for sellers that it is a violation of federal law to sell food and infant formula obtained through the WIC Program.  We also wrote to every state agency encouraging them to place the following statement on all WIC checks, EBT cards or their accompanying folders or sleeves:  “Buying or selling WIC benefits is a crime.  To report suspected abuse, call 800-424- or visit www.usda.gov/oig/hotline.htm.”  FNS is continuing its efforts to guard against the potential sale of WIC foods.   \nConducting Research\nWe are conducting a range of studies to help inform future integrity efforts. One study examines EBT to identify an approach to develop high-risk vendor indicators in both the current and future (all-EBT) WIC environments. Another looks at effective methods for establishing vendor groups based on common characteristics that affect food prices, competitive price criteria and allowable reimbursement levels.\nFindings from both studies are expected in and will be used to inform future actions. FNS is committed to working with our partners in the 90 WIC state agencies to use evidence to strengthen the integrity of the program.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n EBT\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n food assistance programs\n Nutrition\n program integrity\n SNAP\n vendor management\n WIC",

Today she works as a Public Health Food Safety Analyst with FSIS, analyzing from across FSIS gathered by inspectors in the field, and partner agencies to evaluate FSIS policies and performance. The analyses performed and produced allow FSIS to effectively use science and to understand foodborne illness and emerging trends, respond to those risks and ensure that food safety inspection aligns with decreasing those risks.\nDr. Zablotsky Kufel and her colleagues developed the “All Illness Measure”, a key measure of FSIS’ performance that helps assess whether the work that FSIS employees perform is having an effect on how often people get sick from food that FSIS regulates.\n“We use a public health approach that involves Assurance – Measurement – Refinement to ensure the food supply is safe,” she explained. “FSIS Inspection Program Personnel work to make sure that regulated product is safe and produced in accordance with FSIS policies (Assurance). We then measure FSIS’ impact on the public's health and determine whether our policies and activities are having a positive effect (Performance Measurement). This allows FSIS to evaluate existing policy methodologies and create new and innovative approaches to further prevent foodborne illness (Policy Development/Refinement).” The cycle, incorporated in FSIS’ - Strategic Plan, creates a feedback loop that helps FSIS modernize and better address existing and emerging food safety threats.\nDr. Zablotsky Kufel also works with CDC and FDA analysts on the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration to determine what foods cause human illness. “In the next 5 years, I see CDC, FDA and FSIS working together even more closely to prevent illness and having a more real-time understanding of what causes illness—with the ability to react much more rapidly to emerging trends,” Dr. Zablotsky Kufel explained.\n“I really enjoy working with some of the best minds in public health and food safety to figure out how best to use the we have, identify new sources of , understand why people get sick and learn how we can prevent outbreaks in the future.”\nFaces of Food Safety is an initiative by FSIS to introduce Americans to the real people who work every day to keep the food in their own homes and yours safe.

(Courtesy photo Sandra Cummings)\nSandra Cummings is an African American woman who is a part owner of two forested landscapes in Georgia. Her first property, 325 acres of land with a home in the city of Madison, was passed down by her maternal great-grandmother, who was born a slave. The second property consists of 165 acres of land in the town of Portal, which was passed down by her paternal grandfather.\nTo ensure that the family’s ancestral land remains intact, Mrs. Cummings and her family decided to put it into an irrevocable trust to prevent their children and grandchildren from dividing and selling it. “You see, they didn’t grow up in the dirt like we did,” she said. “We grew up working those farmlands, picking cotton, tobacco, planting watermelon. We were able to see the benefits of having this land. My children and grandchildren did not.”\nMrs. Cummings wanted to encourage long-term stewardship of her land, and sought out resources to help achieve this goal. Amadou Diop, an Atlanta-based outreach liaison for the US Forest Service, helped Mrs. Cummings find information about forest management and stewardship plans.\n“If it wasn’t for Amadou’s wealth of knowledge, willingness to help people, and putting me in touch with the resources directly, I would have never been able to get any of this done,” said Mrs. Cummings. “He made sure that I was taken care of, and he deserves a lot of credit.”\nThe Forest Service’s Forest Stewardship Program encourages long-term stewardship of important state and private forest landscapes by assisting landowners to more actively manage their forests and related resources. The Forest Service helped Mrs. Cummings through a forest management and stewardship plan created by the Georgia Forestry Commission, which laid out a 10-year plan for managing the land.\nUnder the plan’s guidance, Mrs. Cummings now uses the land in Madison for timber management, grazing for cattle, and wildlife habitat. She manages the land in Portal for forestry, wildlife, silvopasture (with assistance from the NRCS), and a pine straw operation. As a result, she obtains additional earnings from her land by leasing it out for deer hunting and harvesting pine straw.\nShe is enjoying the benefits of being a forest landowner.\n“One of the benefits for me is the extra income from the pine straw operation —extra income is always good, you know,” she said.\n“It also gives you some self-sufficiency,” she continued. “I will say this: if something were to happen in Atlanta—where we are living now, then we always have a place to go. If we needed to build another house or something….we can do it! So both lands give us some stability.”\nMrs. Cummings intends for her family’s legacy to continue. She hopes to renovate her parents’ home into a historic site and to build a walking trail for guests, and she is exploring the potential for solar power generation on her property in Portal.\nCattle like these graze Mrs. Cummings property in Portal, Georgia.

FSIS is the federal agency charged with ensuring the safety of America’s meat, poultry and processed egg supply, and we work hand in hand with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as state and local departments of health and agriculture. Over the years, I worked my way up from that entry level position in Dalhart, to managing FSIS' Dallas District, to eventually managing the entire agency as Administrator. In my nearly 40-year career, I have seen major changes in the U.S. food safety system.\n Alfred V.

USDA photo.\n“Water conservation begins where the first drop of rain falls…most likely on private working lands.” This is a favorite saying of Tom Vandivier, a Texas cattle rancher and recipient of the Sand County Foundation’s Leopold Conservation Award (LCA).\nTom was one of more than two dozen recipients of the LCA – which recognized landowners for achievement in environmental improvement on agricultural land – in Washington, D.C. last week.  I was fortunate to meet with them here at USDA headquarters to talk about the importance of conservation and the need to spread the message that investing in conservation practices on our farm and ranch lands not only protects water, air and wildlife – it also makes economic sense.\nJill Giacomini Basch is a LCA recipient who, with her father and three sisters, owns a family dairy in Marin County, Calif.  I had a chance to meet with the Giacomini family during my tour of several California farms last month. Jill explained that conservation improves the way they run their business. Partnerships with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and others have helped them protect their land and water resources, and ensure their dairy will be prosperous for the next generation.\n“We have very close ties with NRCS and other programs,” Jill said. “They have helped us with our water allocation -- above ground storage pond facilities and spring well drilling.  With the USDA we were able to utilize new technology to install a methane digester to help mitigate waste run off into the nearby lagoon, but also eventually the Point Reyes National Seashore.  Because of the methane digester, we generate about 65 percent of our on farm energy needs.”\n“Much of the work we’ve done has been through NRCS programs,” Tom added. “NRCS is very important to us.  We’re very much about conservation. The stewardship practices that we’ve accomplished on our property have enhanced water resources in the state of Texas.  I think it’s a message that needs to be spread so others can take similar stewardship practices and hopefully have the same results in their perspective states.”\nJon Bednarski, LCA recipient, shared his story as well.  He started farming 12 years ago outside of Louisville, Ky.  After meeting with NRCS, he discovered he was farming a “sensitive” piece of land, upstream of Louisville’s drinking water source. Since then he has managed his operation to help protect water quality.\nThe group discussed the need for conservation in the face of extreme weather – including the significant drought conditions in 11 western states.  As we were meeting, the U.S. Senate was in the process of voting on the Agricultural Act of . I talked about how important this legislation is to providing the tools and programs necessary for USDA to help farmers, ranchers and forestland owners manage the risk and uncertainty associated with extreme weather and climate change.  Conservation programs will be streamlined to better target limited resources to areas of highest need, while building on record conservation and stewardship efforts already underway.  I also previewed Secretary Tom Vilsack’s announcement of USDA’s new regional hubs to help agriculture and forestry mitigate the impacts of a changing climate.\nThe group also discussed the importance of passing on to the next generation the passion for agriculture and land stewardship.  There is a new energy in America around opportunities in agriculture. The Agricultural Act of will provide our communities with additional support to attract new economic opportunity and create jobs.  We all agreed that outreach and education is crucial.  USDA will continue to work with the LCA recipients and other partners to make that happen.  To view a video about the meeting click here.\nDeputy Under Secretary Ann Mills (center) addresses Leopold Conservation Award Winners at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Individuals/entities that operate facilities using animals in these ways must provide their animals with proper veterinary care, adequate housing, appropriate nutrition, etc.\nIn Bob Markmann’s own words: “Our job can be smelly at times. I’ve been urinated on by a tiger while inspecting a circus. I’ve been sneezed on by an elephant. I’ve had a chimpanzee throw feces at me. And too often, I come home smelling like guinea pigs and dogs. But the worst was when I came home smelling like a prehensile-tailed porcupine. That smell takes the cake. I have not found a good way to describe it.”\nHazards of the trade, no doubt. But a small price to pay to make a difference in the lives of thousands upon thousands of animals each year.\nAnimal Care’s veterinary medical officers and animal care inspectors cover a particular geographic area across the country. They inspect animals and facilities licensed and registered with USDA under the Animal Welfare Act and Horse Protection Act. These dedicated souls spend a lot of time on the road, driving from facility to facility. Their duties include: observing animals for signs of poor health, abuse, or any kind of mistreatment or inadequate care; determining if animal enclosures are appropriate for the species and will not cause harm to the animals; inspecting horses at horse shows, auctions and sales; responding to complaints at USDA-licensed facilities; interviewing suspected unlicensed operators to determine if they need a license; and educating licensees and license applicants on the proper procedures in the humane care, handling and transportation of animals.\nIt’s a varied job description indeed. And it’s that daily variety, along with an innate desire for the welfare of the animals they regulate, which led these individuals to become APHIS inspectors. Asked why they chose this career, here’s what a few of them had to say.\nVeterinary medical officer Gloria McFadden conducts an inspection at a research facility. \n“I became an inspector to make a difference for animals. Over my 22 years with Animal Care, I have found that, although we can’t help them all, we do make a big difference in the lives of the ones we can help.”\n- Elizabeth Pannill, veterinary medical officer, Texas\n“Previously, I had worked four years in private practice and four years for the Food Safety Inspection Service in a chicken plant in North Carolina. I applied for a position with Animal Care in South Carolina and was hired 19 years ago. We have made a lot of really good changes over the decades, especially in our training and our consistency. In the beginning, I had a licensee who was literally starving his cougars before my eyes, but all I could do was cite him. Today, we would have those cougars confiscated and taken to a better place.”\n- Lisa MacElderry, veterinary medical officer, South Carolina\n“I’ve been with APHIS more than 25 years. I’ve always been interested in animal welfare, and joined the agency hoping to make a difference.”\n- Bob Markmann, animal care inspector, Pennsylvania \n“I’ve been with Animal Care since Dec. 30, . My purpose then is the same as it is today: to provide better environments for animals by helping their owners understand the importance of proper care. I wanted to be a part of an organization that would be searching for and utilizing new scientific approaches to improve the environment and care of the animals that are listed under the Animal Welfare Act.”\n- Nancy Ellifrit, veterinary medical officer, Oklahoma\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Tags:\n Animal Care\n Animal Welfare Act\n APHIS\n Horse Protection Act\n Pennsylvania\n Plant and Animal Health\n South Carolina\n Texas",

He started using basic conservation practices for conserving moisture.\nFor the past decade he’s been sowing cover crops and reaping rich returns.\nWorking closely with the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, Jennings has become a devoted no-till farmer.\nAt the Agricultural Outlook Forum, the North Dakota farmer presented his story to a crowded room at the “Economics of Conservation” seminar. USDA hosts the two-day forum.\n“I’m working towards sustainability by copying Mother Nature, and Mother Nature doesn’t till,” said Jennings, who grows wheat, sunflowers, corn, soybeans, peas, flax, oats, canola, barley and a variety of cover crops.\n“The biological livestock in the ground can do tillage for you,” Jennings said. “There are over a billion organisms in a teaspoon of healthy soil. Tilling destroys them.\nJennings had to overcome obstacles when he switched to no-till. In addition to learning a new way of farming, he faced pressure for trying something different.\n“They told me that’s not the way you’re supposed to farm,” Jennings said. He smiled as he clicked through a series of before-and-after pictures of his land. The results speak for themselves.\nShowing a picture of layered organic matter covering his soil, he said: “This is money in the bank, and dollars sitting on the soil. The exact value might be hard to measure, but it’s very real.”\nMark Jennings plants corn using no-till, and this harvest is the result.\nSince switching to no-till, Jennings has seen increased water holding capacity and better infiltration. He saves money on fuel and fertilizer. He saves time. His soil is healthier, and his yields are larger.\nAsked by a member of the audience how cover crops help soil maintain moisture, Jennings replied:\n“Imagine a wet towel lying on the ground. If you cover that towel with a blanket, the water won’t evaporate nearly as fast. Cover crops are an organic blanket that helps soil retain water.”\nJennings encourages farmers interested in conservation to visit NRCS.\n“They helped me create a conservation plan for my land, and their financial assistance helped me get started by sharing the costs,” he said. “Also, the online Web Soil Survey is a great tool for learning about your soil. I use it all the time.”\nJennings ended his presentation with this advice: “Don’t work the soil, let the soil work for you.”\nMark Jennings plants sunflowers in corn residue on his North Dakota farm.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Agricultural Outlook Forum\n Conservation\n cover crops\n Farmers\n North Dakota\n NRCS\n Web Soil Survey",

They began with gouda and havarti, then added baby swiss and tomme.\nMaking cheese turned out to be as much of an art as a science. Nancy makes small batches that must be tested through each step of the process because they are using raw milk. Local climate, molds, temperature, acidity level and cattle health can make or break a batch. Unlike big cheese companies, a customer may have to wait a while for an order.\nWhen making a new recipe, they first test it at farmer’s markets. If people like it, Nancy and John name it. The loblolly gets its name from the coarseness of the rind that resembles the tree’s bark.  A dry feta-like cheese is named Salty Dog after their dachshund.\nThe two look forward to trying blue, feta and brie next. The newest flavors Cypress Point Creamery offer are a chocolate and cayenne pepper coated cheese, popular at the farmer’s markets.  Another favorite is rubbed with coffee and coconut oil.\nThe word is out about Cypress Point Creamery cheeses. They are sought out by chefs from top hotels and restaurants.  But Nancy and John enjoy the customers they meet face-to-face at the Alachua County and Haile Village Plantation farmers markets because they tell them first-hand what they like and why.\nJohn refers to his free-stall barn where his cows stay as the “Rex Run Resort.” The open-sided barn gives the cows’ freedom to move around and space where they can sleep in clean sand beds. The stalls are outfitted with fans and misters that keep cows at least 20 degrees cooler than the outside temperature in the summer.\n“Happy cows make great cheese,” John said.\nMaking cheese is not an easy job. John and Nancy typically put in a 12-to-16 hour day, seven days a week.  They employ three others who assist with milking, feeding and mechanical operations.\nThe Mims raise brown Jerseys on their farm.

For American agricultural producers and suppliers looking at USDA feeding programs as a potential market, having a clear understanding of the rules, regulations and requirements is the best start on the path to success. USDA encourages new businesses to participate by providing information through our websites, publications, and conferences. Recently, we attended Puerto Rico’s Market Expansion Conference to encourage new businesses to consider our programs.\nMy agency, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), is part of a team of seven USDA agencies that attended this conference to strengthen Puerto Rico’s agriculture sector.\nFrom to , the number of farms on the island decreased by 30%, the amount of land being farmed decreased by 33% and the amount of livestock and poultry products sold dropped by nearly 19%. The agriculture sector also experienced a 33% reduction in hired workers. As a result, Puerto Rico is importing about 85% of its food, driving prices higher for residents.\nThe goal of the conference is to try to reverse these trends. Working together, conference attendees plan to encourage producers and processors to participate in USDA programs, increase local fresh produce in school feeding programs, and strengthen the bond between the community and its farmers. I went to the conference to show Puerto Rican farmers and businesses that AMS commodity purchasing programs are a viable market for their products.\nLast year, the AMS Commodity Procurement Staff purchased nearly $1.6 billion of food from our nation’s producers. These purchases supported USDA feeding programs like the National School Lunch Program. By informing Puerto Rican businesses about the federal procurement processes and how to become approved vendors, we will set them up to compete for contracts to supply one of 250 foods offered in our programs.\nIt appears that the Market Expansion Conference is making a difference. Since the inaugural event in , the island’s local producers have increased business with its schools. There has also been an increase in the number of jobs in the agriculture sector. This progress is especially exciting for me—a graduate of the University of Puerto Rico at Aguadilla who hopes to see even more economic opportunities created for the island.\nI had the pleasure of hearing first-hand what USDA’s programs mean to the island’s producers and businesses. During my presentation, one of the conference attendees thanked me for assisting him during a phone call several months ago. He told the audience that, because of my help he is now one step closer to becoming an approved vendor. It is gratifying to know that I may have opened a door for his business. While it may seem small, each new opportunity strengthens the island’s economy and helps to decrease an unemployment rate that hovers around 16%.\nAMS is committed to supporting our nation’s producers in Puerto Rico and the rest of the country. Through this and other events like the upcoming Industry Meeting, we maintain a continuous dialog about our commodity purchasing programs with vendors, industry organizations and other stakeholders. Together, we will continue to create opportunities for American agricultural producers.\nThe Market Expansion Conference enabled attendees to hear from a panel of experts.

        "content": "Biotechnology Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n1. What is Agricultural Biotechnology?\nAgricultural biotechnology is a range of tools, including traditional breeding techniques, that alter living organisms, or parts of organisms, to make or modify products; improve plants or animals; or develop microorganisms for specific agricultural uses. Modern biotechnology today includes the tools of genetic engineering.\n2. How is Agricultural Biotechnology being used?\nBiotechnology provides farmers with tools that can make production cheaper and more manageable. For example, some biotechnology crops can be engineered to tolerate specific herbicides, which make weed control simpler and more efficient. Other crops have been engineered to be resistant to specific plant diseases and insect pests, which can make pest control more reliable and effective, and/or can decrease the use of synthetic pesticides. These crop production options can help countries keep pace with demands for food while reducing production costs. A number of biotechnology-derived crops that have been deregulated by the USDA and reviewed for food safety by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have been adopted by growers.\nMany other types of crops are now in the research and development stages. While it is not possible to know exactly which will come to fruition, certainly biotechnology will have highly varied uses for agriculture in the future. Advances in biotechnology may provide consumers with foods that are nutritionally-enriched or longer-lasting, or that contain lower levels of certain naturally occurring toxicants present in some food plants. Developers are using biotechnology to try to reduce saturated fats in cooking oils, reduce allergens in foods, and increase disease-fighting nutrients in foods. They are also researching ways to use genetically engineered crops in the production of new medicines, which may lead to a new plant-made pharmaceutical industry that could reduce the costs of production using a sustainable resource.\nGenetically engineered plants are also being developed for a purpose known as phytoremediation in which the plants detoxify pollutants in the soil or absorb and accumulate polluting substances out of the soil so that the plants may be harvested and disposed of safely. In either case the result is improved soil quality at a polluted site. Biotechnology may also be used to conserve natural resources, enable animals to more effectively use nutrients present in feed, decrease nutrient runoff into rivers and bays, and help meet the increasing world food and land demands. Researchers are at work to produce hardier crops that will flourish in even the harshest environments and that will require less fuel, labor, fertilizer, and water, helping to decrease the pressures on land and wildlife habitats.\nIn addition to genetically engineered crops, biotechnology has helped make other improvements in agriculture not involving plants. Examples of such advances include making antibiotic production more efficient through microbial fermentation and producing new animal vaccines through genetic engineering for diseases such as foot and mouth disease and rabies.\n3. What are the benefits of Agricultural Biotechnology?\nThe application of biotechnology in agriculture has resulted in benefits to farmers, producers, and consumers. Biotechnology has helped to make both insect pest control and weed management safer and easier while safeguarding crops against disease.\nFor example, genetically engineered insect-resistant cotton has allowed for a significant reduction in the use of persistent, synthetic pesticides that may contaminate groundwater and the environment.\nIn terms of improved weed control, herbicide-tolerant soybeans, cotton, and corn enable the use of reduced-risk herbicides that break down more quickly in soil and are non-toxic to wildlife and humans. Herbicide-tolerant crops are particularly compatible with no-till or reduced tillage agriculture systems that help preserve topsoil from erosion.\nAgricultural biotechnology has been used to protect crops from devastating diseases. The papaya ringspot virus threatened to derail the Hawaiian papaya industry until papayas resistant to the disease were developed through genetic engineering. This saved the U.S. papaya industry. Research on potatoes, squash, tomatoes, and other crops continues in a similar manner to provide resistance to viral diseases that otherwise are very difficult to control.\nBiotech crops can make farming more profitable by increasing crop quality and may in some cases increase yields. The use of some of these crops can simplify work and improve safety for farmers. This allows farmers to spend less of their time managing their crops and more time on other profitable activities.\nBiotech crops may provide enhanced quality traits such as increased levels of beta-carotene in rice to aid in reducing vitamin A deficiencies and improved oil compositions in canola, soybean, and corn. Crops with the ability to grow in salty soils or better withstand drought conditions are also in the works and the first such products are just entering the marketplace. Such innovations may be increasingly important in adapting to or in some cases helping to mitigate the effects of climate change.\nThe tools of agricultural biotechnology have been invaluable for researchers in helping to understand the basic biology of living organisms. For example, scientists have identified the complete genetic structure of several strains of Listeria and Campylobacter, the bacteria often responsible for major outbreaks of food-borne illness in people. This genetic information is providing a wealth of opportunities that help researchers improve the safety of our food supply. The tools of biotechnology have \"unlocked doors\" and are also helping in the development of improved animal and plant varieties, both those produced by conventional means as well as those produced through genetic engineering.\n4. What are the safety considerations with Agricultural Biotechnology?\nBreeders have been evaluating new products developed through agricultural biotechnology for centuries. In addition to these efforts, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) work to ensure that crops produced through genetic engineering for commercial use are properly tested and studied to make sure they pose no significant risk to consumers or the environment.\nCrops produced through genetic engineering are the only ones formally reviewed to assess the potential for transfer of novel traits to wild relatives. When new traits are genetically engineered into a crop, the new plants are evaluated to ensure that they do not have characteristics of weeds. Where biotech crops are grown in proximity to related plants, the potential for the two plants to exchange traits via pollen must be evaluated before release. Crop plants of all kinds can exchange traits with their close wild relatives (which may be weeds or wildflowers) when they are in proximity. In the case of biotech-derived crops, the EPA and USDA perform risk assessments to evaluate this possibility and minimize potential harmful consequences, if any.\nOther potential risks considered in the assessment of genetically engineered organisms include environmental effects on birds, mammals, insects, worms, and other organisms, especially in the case of insect or disease resistance traits. This is why the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the EPA review environmental impacts of such pest-resistant biotechnology derived crops prior to approval of field-testing and commercial release. Testing on many types of organisms such as honeybees, other beneficial insects, earthworms, and fish is performed to ensure that there are no unintended consequences associated with these crops.\nWith respect to food safety, when new traits introduced to biotech-derived plants are examined by the EPA and the FDA, the proteins produced by these traits are studied for their potential toxicity and potential to cause an allergic response. Tests designed to examine the heat and digestive stability of these proteins, as well as their similarity to known allergenic proteins, are completed prior to entry into the food or feed supply. To put these considerations in perspective, it is useful to note that while the particular biotech traits being used are often new to crops in that they often do not come from plants (many are from bacteria and viruses), the same basic types of traits often can be found naturally in most plants. These basic traits, like insect and disease resistance, have allowed plants to survive and evolve over time.\n5. How widely used are biotechnology crops?\nAccording to the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), biotechnology plantings as a percentage of total crop plantings in the United States in were about 88 percent for corn, 94 percent for cotton, and 93 percent for soybeans. NASS conducts an agricultural survey in all states in June of each year. The report issued from the survey contains a section specific to the major biotechnology derived field crops and provides additional detail on biotechnology plantings. The most recent report may be viewed at the following website: www.ers.usda.gov/-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us.aspx\nFor a summary of these , see the USDA Economic Research Service feature at: www.ers.usda.gov/-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us.aspx\nThe USDA does not maintain on international usage of genetically engineered crops. The independent International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), a not-for-profit organization, estimates that the global area of biotech crops for was 170.3 million hectares, grown by 17.3 million farmers in 28 countries, with an average annual growth in area cultivated of around 6 percent. More than 90 percent of farmers growing biotech crops are resource-poor farmers in developing countries. ISAAA various statistics on the global adoption and plantings of biotechnology derived crops. The ISAAA website is www.isaaa.org\n6. What are the roles of government in agricultural biotechnology?\nPlease note: These descriptions are not a complete or thorough review of all the activities of these agencies with respect to agricultural biotechnology and are intended as general introductory materials only. For additional information please see the relevant agency websites.\nRegulatory\nThe Federal Government developed a Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology in to provide for the regulatory oversight of organisms derived through genetic engineering. The three principal agencies that have provided primary guidance on the experimental testing, approval, and eventual commercial release of these organisms to date are the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Department of Health and Human Services' Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The approach taken in the Coordinated Framework is grounded in the judgment of the National Academy of Sciences that the potential risks associated with these organisms fall into the same general categories as those created by traditionally bred organisms.\nProducts are regulated according to their intended use, with some products being regulated under more than one agency. All government regulatory agencies have a responsibility to ensure that the implementation of regulatory decisions, including approval of field tests and eventual deregulation of approved biotech crops, does not adversely impact human health or the environment.\nThe Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is responsible for protecting U.S. agriculture from pests and diseases. APHIS regulations provide procedures for obtaining a permit or for providing notification prior to \"introducing\" (the act of introducing includes any movement into or through the U.S., or release into the environment outside an area of physical confinement) a regulated genetically engineered organism in the U.S.\nFor more information on the regulatory responsibilities of the FDA, the EPA and APHIS visit usbiotechnologyregulation.mrp.usda.gov.",

Janey Thornton in\n Food and Nutrition\n Initiatives\n Nov 05, \nFNCS Deputy Under Secretary Dr. Janey Thornton eats lunch with Grenada Upper Elementary School Students after their school was awarded the HealthierUS School Challenge Gold Award, Grenada, Miss., Nov 3.\nRecently, I had the privilege of visiting Northern Mississippi to recognize two schools for meeting USDA’s HealthierUS School Challenge (HUSSC). I stopped at Pope Elementary/Junior High School in Pope, Miss. and met with and congratulated the cafeteria and other staff for achieving a Bronze Award.  I then traveled to Grenada Upper Elementary School in Grenada, Miss., for an assembly where I recognized the school for earning a Gold Award.\nI was impressed with these two schools for achieving the HUSSC Awards, but was also impressed by the way the schools were innovative at educating the children about agriculture and where food comes from with the use of a garden and an on-campus green house. Grenada Upper Elementary School even raises funds for the school’s programs through selling the plants they grow in their on-campus green house instead of selling sugary snacks.\nAgain this benefit is two-fold – students are learning about healthy food choices and they are learning important lessons about where their food comes from and the hard work that goes in to producing a safe and reliable food supply.\nAlso of note was Grenada’s physical education program that gets the children moving in a fun way, twice a day, which falls in line with First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! initiative to end childhood obesity within a generation.  We cannot understate the importance of physical activity because our efforts to combat hunger and obesity must also include encouraging our children to get out and get some exercise.\nAs I have traveled around the country in promotion of the HUSSC I have seen so many unique and innovative examples of what schools can do to achieve award status.  And these awards are one of the highest honors a school nutrition program can achieve and reflects a strong commitment to provide students with additional healthy food options throughout the school campus, and to emphasize nutrition education and physical activity in the school curriculum.\nThese two Mississippi schools have set a high standard of excellence for others to follow.  I’m thankful to all who helped make these achievements possible—they are making a positive difference in the lives of our nation’s children. With the help of these Mississippi schools, we are making progress.\nFNCS Deputy Under Secretary Dr. Janey Thornton presents the HealthierUS School Challenge Gold Award to Grenada Upper Elementary School nutrition staff and principal, in Grenada, Miss., on Nov 3.\nFNCS Deputy Under Secretary Dr. Janey Thornton watches as Chasity Fondren, prepares a salad for lunch at Pope Elementary/Junior High School, Pope, Miss.

It all started with USDA’s effort to expand the availability of wireless technology at farmers markets not currently accepting SNAP benefits.\nIt’s sometimes difficult for markets to accept SNAP, because they need Electronic Benefit Transfer equipment and electricity to process benefits from the card. The funding can be used to help markets purchase the processing equipment, and to pay for wireless service so the equipment can be used without a power source.

        "content": "USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Food Safety in\n Health and Safety\n USDA Results\n Jul 05, \nIn nearly eight years, the federal government has spurred a remarkable rise in consumer knowledge.\nJuly is the height of summer grilling season and throughout the month USDA is highlighting changes made to the U.S. food safety system over the course of this Administration. For an interactive look at USDA’s work to ensure your food is safe, visit the USDA Results project on Medium.com and read Chapter Seven: Safer Food and Greater Consumer Confidence.\nBy the time this blog posts today, most readers will have already enjoyed at least one meal. Over their breakfast—fresh fruit, a bacon and egg sandwich, or maybe a grab-n-go energy bar—Americans were probably thinking about all the tasks that meal would fuel them to do for the day, and not whether their food could make them ill. But a strong and diligent network of public servants at the federal, state and local levels were thinking about how to protect you from foodborne illness over their breakfasts this morning, and they’re still thinking about it now. Their job day in and day out is to make sure the food on America’s tables—including yours and theirs—is safe to eat. They are the best in the world at what they do, and they’re constantly getting better.\nI have proudly been a part of this team since , when I accepted a job with USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) as an inspector in a Dalhart, Texas beef facility. FSIS is the federal agency charged with ensuring the safety of America’s meat, poultry and processed egg supply, and we work hand in hand with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as state and local departments of health and agriculture. Over the years, I worked my way up from that entry level position in Dalhart, to managing FSIS' Dallas District, to eventually managing the entire agency as Administrator. In my nearly 40-year career, I have seen major changes in the U.S. food safety system.\nWhen I first began as a food inspector, because of the tools available to us and our understanding of what caused foodborne illness at the time, FSIS relied almost exclusively on visual inspection of animals, products, and plant operations.  With experience and better technology, our focus as an agency has shifted. Today, we're able to prevent invisible hazards, such as bacterial and chemical contamination.\nUnder the Obama Administration, the U.S. food safety system has seen some of the most significant updates since the s, adopting a risk-based, -driven approach to prevent foodborne problems, rather than reacting after something goes wrong. At FSIS, we have accomplished this in the form of tighter and more strategic food safety requirements for food companies, enhanced consumer engagement, and smart innovations to our internal processes. In the past seven years, we’ve adopted a zero-tolerance policy for six dangerous strains of E. coli. We’ve instituted several improvements to poultry inspections that together are expected to reduce Salmonella and Campylobacter illnesses by 67,000 per year. We’ve prevented tons of mislabeled food from entering commerce, and worked with companies to tighten their labeling protocols. And above all, we’ve moved the needle on foodborne illness, watching cases attributed to USDA-regulated product drop by 12 percent.\nAll of this is possible because every day, 7,500 food safety inspection personnel go to work in more than 6,000 regulated food facilities and 122 ports of entry, where last year they inspected 145 million hogs and cattle, and 9 billion chickens and turkeys, verifying that FSIS regulatory requirements are met. Another 2,000 food safety professionals go to work in three public health laboratories, 10 district offices, and our headquarters office. These employees run test results, dispatch outbreak investigators, and unpack to reveal telling trends and inform proactive, prevention-based policies that will lead to safer food and fewer illnesses.\nToday, USDA is highlighting their work, and that of partners outside of FSIS, in the newest chapter of our Results project at  Because their jobs are done largely behind the scenes – at laboratories, alongside private employees in food processing facilities, and sometimes undercover—you may be surprised at the scrutiny given your favorite food products. I encourage you to visit our new chapter to see what we’re doing, and know that we will only continue to improve.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n USDA Results\n Tags:\n Campylobacter\n CDC\n FDA\n Food Safety\n foodborne illness\n FSIS\n Inspections\n Poultry\n Salmonella\n Texas",

The Tohono O’odham or “Desert People” live in the Sonoran Desert on tribal lands in the southern part of the state, bordering Mexico. The terrain is flat, dry desert and presents numerous agricultural challenges that USDA helps students address through research and hands-on training, teaching traditional scientific disciplines – but through the lens of the tribe’s needs and culture.\nThe college is doing a lot of work to keep their tribal language alive, providing language classes for all students. But science professor Dr. Teresa Newberry has taken that to a whole new level by building a Web-based database of plants that is built in three languages: English, Latin and Tohono O’odham. It’s the kind of project that integrates the native culture into learning in a practical, living way.\nThey’re also looking for ways to guarantee they’ll always be able to grow their traditional foods even in the hotter and drier climate that may lie ahead. Faculty and staff are gathering over 30 different varieties of tepary bean and working with the NRCS plant material center, propagating these varieties so they can be planted out in the field. This is a real example of connecting traditional knowledge, science and providing options to adapt to a changing climate.\nIn another study funded by USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture, students from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell are working with Tohono O’odham students and local plumbers, electricians, and others from the reservation to build a house that is totally powered by solar energy. The house has been a great success, proving to be so energy-efficient that it’s feeding energy back to the grid.\nStudents at Tohono O’odham Community College are happy that they have an option to get an education in science, and in other professions that affect agriculture, right there at home and can take the skills they learn back to their community to help solve local problems.\nMy visit to Tohono O’odham Community College was a good reminder of how our work at USDA is really woven into the fabric of the communities we serve.

Photo by David C. Smith, Williams College\nAll this month we will be taking a look at what a changing climate means to Agriculture. The ten regional USDA Climate Hubs were established to synthesize and translate climate science and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers who are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA's Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate.\nHoney bee health and climate change would both rank high on anyone’s list of hot topics in agriculture these days.\nLewis H. Ziska, an Agricultural Research Service (ARS) plant physiologist, with what is part of the Northeast Climate Hub in Beltsville, Maryland, knows this. He also knows that any study involving both honey bees and climate change should be carefully conducted and cautiously interpreted.  Ziska has been studying the effects of climate change on plants since . He has been focusing on how rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels accompanying climate change are affecting a wide range of plants—from important food crops to noxious weeds.\nSo Ziska and his colleagues were extremely thorough in their analysis of how rising CO2 levels are affecting the pollen of Canada goldenrod (Solidago Canadensis), the most widespread source of fall protein for honey bees. It’s considered crucial in helping honey bees survive through winter.\nTo confirm the honey bees’ fall feeding habits, the researchers went out to a field in the Berkshires, identified the number of goldenrod plants there, and then counted honey bee “visits” to each plant. To mimic the effects of climate change over the past 150 years, they exposed goldenrod growing in chambers of undisturbed soil in Texas to graduated levels of CO2. To get an historical perspective, they analyzed goldenrod pollen from across the United States collected as far back as and stored at the National Museum of Natural History.\nStudy results showed that the pollen protein levels have declined by up to a third since the s, when atmospheric CO2 levels began rising, and that the most serious declines have occurred since , when CO2 levels began rising dramatically. It was the first study to document the effects of rising CO2 levels on honey bee diets. The results appeared in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\nScientists say the results are consistent with the rules of basic plant biology. Plants exposed to higher CO2 levels produce more starch and sugar but less protein. Scientists have consistently found the same trend—diminished protein content with increased CO2 levels—in studies of human food crops. In fact, it is precisely the trend in food crops that prompted Ziska to conduct his study.\nBut there could be a silver lining. The results may help scientists address increases in mortality rates in managed honey bee colonies by coming up with ways to improve diets and ensure that the bees get sufficient protein in the fall to survive through winter. Ziska also is working with other scientists on ways to adapt food crops, such as wheat and rice, to climate change by using traditional breeding techniques to tap into the genes that make their wild, weedy relatives more adaptable to rising CO2 levels.\n“We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I think people are more aware of the challenges being presented by climate change, and that’s an important step,” he said.\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Research and Science\n USDA Results\n Tags:\n ARS\n Bees\n Climate Change\n climate hub\n Honeybees\n Maryland\n Northeast Climate Hub",

The Prosperity Gardens are educational, bringing at-risk students to work the ground, grow the plants and sell the produce at local farmer’s markets.\nUSDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) was able to help support this important endeavor through The People’s Garden, USDA’s collaborative community garden initiative with more than 1,300 local and national organizations all working together to establish community and school gardens across the country.\nNicole Bridges, University of Illinois Extension Service employee and local Garden Programmer, oversees the activities at the Prosperity Gardens and has been instrumental in gaining neighbor and community support. Bridges did a lot of research when she first started with the garden. She attended local meetings to become familiar with the people who live there and listened when they said, “Our youth need jobs.”\nNicole Bridges, garden programmer, sits next to one of the many garden beds.\nWorking with a friend from the Ready School, a school for at-risk high school students, a plan was created to get students to the garden as a class project and then, “The project just exploded,” said Bridges.\nJosephine Tritsch, Instructor and Program Coordinator at Ready School, teaches agricultural classes and is expanding the curriculum to include business classes.\n“I am teaching agribusiness this fall, which includes selling vegetables to staff and harvesting for the cafeteria in our nascent Farm2School program,” Tritsch explained.\n“Class content includes marketing, grain and vegetable production, national and international ag practices, and so forth, through guided team projects and the use of Google apps.” Next spring, Tritsch plans to teach a horticulture class and will co-teach classes in job skills and nutrition.\nThe students worked in the garden and sold their produce at markets during the summer and early fall. Tritsch said, “The community seemed to enjoy buying from us at both the downtown Champaign market and through our Mobile Market program.”\nThe Prosperity Gardens staff is also starting a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) option to be managed by students. In addition to the garden contributing agricultural education and business aspects year-round, during the summer the garden serves as a job site.\nWith the help of Master Gardeners and volunteers, the Prosperity Gardens hosted children from the Boys and Girls Club, who call their group the “Garden Club,” for nine weeks in the summer. Each student, ranging from six-to-eight years old, had their own plot about two-foot square. They planted a bean and watched it grow.\n“Each student takes ownership of their plot to understand what is happening during the growing season,” said Bridges. “They learn about bugs, both good and bad.” They also learn about different types of soil and other science facts.\nThe beds were color coordinated and contained “garden maps,” that helped students understand what plants look like from garden to plate. There was a sensory garden full of herbs to stimulate more of their senses and they learned about nutrition.\n“We have kid-friendly knives and they learn how to peel carrots and chop celery, peppers and herbs,” said Bridges. “So each week, they learn to pick, wash and prepare their snack, like toasted wheat bagels and they made the veggie cream cheese.” Some children have been coming for three years and now mentor the younger ones.\nBridges’ goal for these neighborhood gardens is to close the gap between the older generation and younger generation. “The garden club does just that – it gets these kids at a young age and reintroduces a traditional way of life.”\nThe rest of the planting beds, including a lot across the street, are for the students to grow, harvest and sell a wide variety of produce that neighbors could enjoy. “They grew produce that is culturally relevant with the neighborhood taste, such as collards, green beans, okra, jalapeno peppers, and other items that people in the community enjoy,” said Bridges.\nThe Prosperity Gardens are a non-profit and they have received donations and grants from local businesses, hospitals, a church and the University of Illinois Extension Service.\n“With NRCS’ contributions we purchased items we’ve needed for some time,” said Bridges. They were able to purchase produce crates for harvesting, storing and use at the market. “They sanitize well, collapse for storage, and have made us more productive where we meet agriculture food safety requirements to attend the farmers markets,” she adds.\nThey currently lease the two garden lots from the city. A new grant will help build a wash and pack facility and they are searching for another acre of city land to house that facility and potentially install high tunnels to extend the growing season. Bridge’s goal is to establish the city’s first commercial urban farm.\nCurrently the gardens are split between education, nutrition, and marketing the produce. Once the farm and facility is built and functioning, the current gardens will be dedicated to education.\nThe future hope for Prosperity Gardens is to expand the Farm2School Program and include other youth organizations. “The Boys and Girls Club would like to expand their program beyond the six-to-eight-year-olds as well, making it a great place to learn and have fun,” said Bridges.\nGarden Club children and volunteers fix lunch under the pergola at one of the Prosperity Gardens.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n community garden\n Conservation\n Cooperative Extension Service\n Farm to School\n gardens\n HealthierNextGen\n Illinois\n NRCS\n People's Garden",

Photo courtesy Somerset Community College.\nAs Kentucky does its best to battle the spread of COVID-19, state officials and medical providers have been looking for ways to answer the increasing need for medical personal protective equipment. One of those responding in a big way here in Kentucky is a somewhat unlikely source: Somerset Community College.\nSomerset Community College was the first higher education institution in Kentucky to offer a statewide certificate in additive manufacturing, also called 3D printing, and thanks to the passion of Additive Manufacturing Professor Eric Wooldridge and Rural Business Development Grants in both fiscal year and , the program has earned a reputation as a leader in the state in 3D printing education and technical assistance.\nHere in Kentucky, parts manufacturers in both the aircraft and automobile industries are big employers, and additive manufacturing–and the associated jobs–is growing across those as well as many other industries because it has a number of advantages over traditional manufacturing. Eric told me one of those is the ability to quickly transition between products.\nIn fact, it only took a few hours to go from printing student projects to printing and assembling the first face shield prototypes, and when there was a requested design change, an updated prototype was ready in less than 20 minutes with finished versions coming out within the hour. Now that they have a finalized design, they are printing and assembling over 100 face shields per hour. Eric, who is basically living out of his office to continue the process 24/7 with the help of some rotating staff members, said they’ve also shared the specifications with networked additive manufacturers so they could also begin production. This rapid response to a supply chain shortcoming is just another advantage of additive manufacturing.\n“We couldn’t be doing this without the support of the National Science Foundation and Rural Development,” Wooldridge told me. “NSF and Rural Development grants were essential in getting the equipment and materials and training people how to use it all.”\nAt Rural Development, our mission is to improve the economy and way of life in rural America, and partners like Somerset Community College remind me there are good stories like this all across this great country. Time and again, when America is united in attaining a common goal, we band together, and that is part and parcel to rural culture. Whether it’s family helping family or neighbor helping neighbor, rural America knows that together, America prospers.\nPartially completed faceshields await assembly at Somerset Community College’s Additive Manufacturing workshop.

By , their food security situation is projected to improve, leaving 9.2 percent food insecure (assuming rising per-capita incomes, stable or declining food prices, and no new major crises).\nUSDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) recently released the annual International Food Security Assessment -, in which they assess the food security status and outlook for 76 low- and middle-income countries that are former or current food aid recipients. This report presents the number of food-insecure people, the share of the population that is food insecure, and the food gap projected for and based on projected food price and income changes. The ERS food security indicators are forward-looking and provide a measure of expected progress in food security.\nThe share of populations experiencing food insecurity is not spread evenly across the regions and countries included in the study. Projections of food insecurity in the 22 Asian and 11 Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries show it is relatively low at 13.9 and 17.4 percent compared to Sub-Saharan Africa’s (SSA) 35.3 percent. This regional disparity is projected to widen by . Sub-Saharan Africa, while expected to improve, is still projected to have 22.5 percent of its population classified as food insecure.\nThe share of populations that are food insecure is projected to improve, but with widening regional disparity across the four regions studied\nProjections for 76 low- and middle-income countries show that food insecure people in is relatively low in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) compared to 35.3 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This disparity is projected to widen into when Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to improve but still have 22.5 percent of its population classified as food insecure. Photo credit: USDA, Economic Research Service based on results from the International Food Security Assessment model\nSeveral countries are projected to not make significant progress in their food security situation. For these countries, income growth prospects are poor, and food prices are expected to remain relatively high due to ongoing armed conflicts or recent devastation from natural disasters, which tend to displace a large portion of the population and disrupt economic and agricultural activities. This results in limited access to food and increased food insecurity. For example, most of Yemen remains food insecure, and repeated port closures hinder food imports. Over half the populations in Central Africa and parts of East Africa are projected to be food insecure in , following years of civil conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.\nFor more information, please see the report, International Food Security Assessment - and more at www.ers.usda.gov.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Economic Research Service\n Food security\n International Food Security Assessment",

USDA is working to better understand food loss at the farm level and ERS research is an integral part of the process, as ERS adjusts national estimates of food supplies for nonedible parts of foods (bones, peels, etc.) and losses from farm to fork in its Food Availability System.\nThere are several reasons edible crops do not make it to market. In some cases, market prices for those crops may be too low to justify the cost of making additional passes through the field or orchard to harvest crops. In other cases, not being able to find labor to harvest the crops mean that they are left to rot. Finally, since fruits and vegetables ripen at different times across regions, growers may struggle to find buyers for their produce towards the end of their harvest period, as wholesale buyers switch to other suppliers when better quality produce becomes available in other regions.\nFood loss is a particular problem in the produce industry, as produce is more perishable than some crops such as grain crops. Overripe fruit that must be consumed within 1-2 days does not enter the wholesale market, and may be marketed directly to consumers at farm stands. In the absence of these markets, overripe fruit or “cosmetically challenged” fruit can end up in landfills or is simply dropped to the ground by field workers during harvest.\nIndustry and entrepreneurs have come up with various solutions to reduce food loss at the farm level. A market for “seconds” has emerged, referring to crops that do not receive the top grade needed to enter the conventional wholesale market but are still edible. Specialized companies with a mission to reduce food waste have entered the market to collect and deliver to consumers produce that is too big, small, or blemished for the conventional market.\nHowever, when harvested produce is not of high enough quality to be purchased by a wholesaler, diverting crops away from the wholesale supply chain could avoid wasting further resources. In this instance, food loss at the farm level would be preferable to loss at a later stage in the supply chain.\nWhy do people care about food loss? Food that is grown but not consumed uses resources all along the farm-to-fork chain – in its production, transportation, storage, and marketing. Growing food uses fertilizer, arable land, pesticides, energy, and water; and can degrade the environment through nutrient runoff or effects of pesticides on non-target organisms. In addition, an estimated 11.8 percent of American households were food insecure at least some time during the year in , meaning they lacked access to enough food for all household members to enjoy an active, healthy life.\nUSDA is working on solutions. Through workshops, research, and other programs, such as USDA and EPA’s call for a 50-percent reduction in food loss and waste by , USDA continues in its mission to reduce food loss and waste with the goal of ending hunger, enabling farmers to financially benefit from all of the crops they grow, and reducing resources spent on growing food that is not consumed.

(USDA photo by Bob Nichols)\nA major war was fought in -, with more than ates alone. You may not have seen much of it on the news, but there’s a good chance your wallet felt it.\nThe outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in 17 states caused the American poultry industry to lose about 51.5 million chickens and turkeys. During this outbreak, the infected flocks cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1 billion in depopulation, cleanup, disinfection, and insurance payments. This also caused the egg-laying population to dramatically decrease. Poultry producers lost $1.1 billion in broiler exports (a 26-percent decrease from the previous year), $41 million in lost egg export income (down 13 percent), and $177 million in turkey export income (a 23-percent decline). The law of supply and demand, naturally, caused consumer prices to increase at grocery stores and restaurants.\nThe danger of infectious disease outbreaks in the agricultural community is real and preventing them is critical for maintaining the supply of safe, nutritious, and affordable food. This is where biosecurity comes into play.\nUSDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supports agricultural biosecurity by providing funding and national program leadership to projects that secure and protect the integrity, reliability, sustainability, and profitability of the American food and agricultural system against catastrophic hazards, whether natural, emerging, accidental, or deliberate.\nNon-animal agricultural biosecurity issues include spotted wing drosophila, which caused $715 million of damage in berry and stone fruit crops, and the brown marmorated stink bug, which caused $37 million in damage to the apple industry across the mid-Atlantic region. Citrus greening disease, arguably the greatest current threat, is devastating the citrus industry in Texas, Arizona, California, and Florida, where about 80 percent citrus trees are affected.\nNIFA’s fight against citrus greening began in February with a $20.1 million investment in research and extension. The projects included the University of Central Florida testing a bactericide to kill the citrus greening bacteria and the University of California, Riverside developing disease resistant varieties of citrus.\nNIFA-funded projects advance our understanding of biosecurity and provide solutions for protecting the food supply from intentional and natural threats and hazards. The National Animal Health Laboratory Network, National Plant Diagnostic Network, and the Citrus Greening Research and Extension manage many of these projects.\nNIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n National Institute of Food and Agriculture\n NIFA\n agricultural biosecurity\n citrus greening\n avian influenza\n National Animal Health Laboratory Network\n National Plant Diagnostic Network",

Vilsack discussed how this effort is helping grow local jobs by bringing together agricultural producers, processing and transportation entities, refiners and finishers, academics and researchers, and analysts and financial entities. GE Aviation anticipates purchasing up to 5 million gallons of renewable-jet fuel beginning in .\"We have an incredible opportunity to create thousands of new jobs and drive economic development in rural communities across America by developing innovative ways to use agricultural products to help reduce our reliance on foreign oil,\" said Vilsack. \"USDA's collaboration with General Electric Aviation will bring together multiple sectors of Ohio's economy, including agricultural producers, to foster new innovations in the field of renewable fuels while bolstering new economic opportunities in the Midwest. USDA is proud to work alongside private and public institutions to support the research, creation and distribution of next generation energy solutions.\"USDA recently awarded a Value Added Producer Grant to the Ohio Soybean Council to help initiate a pilot project through Ohio State University's Bioproducts Innovation Center to refine bio-jet fuel from soybean oil produced by farmer-owners of Ohio's Mercer Landmark cooperative in western Ohio. Renewable-jet fuel produced from various plant oils (e.g. camelina, pennycress, inedible corn oil, algae) has been certified by the American Society of Testing and Materials for aviation use, and is currently being used in limited commercial service. Such a pilot project could provide the basis for commercializing renewable-jet fuel production for future aviation purchases.In addition, USDA's Farm Service Agency also has a groundbreaking energy crop production initiative underway in northeastern Ohio and northwestern Pennsylvania through the agency's Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP). About 115 contracts are signed to grow nearly 3,700 acres of the energy crop Miscanthus, a perennial grass that grows on previously underutilized lands in the area. Aloterra Energy has agreed to provide farmers technical assistance in planting and to purchase the new crop for future use in energy production-- possibly as a feedstock for Midwest renewable fuel initiatives.Vilsack also highlighted how USDA is working with federal partners like the Department of Energy (DOE), Department of the Navy and the Federal Aviation Administration to improve our country's energy security and provide sustainable jobs in communities across the country. Last August, President Obama announced a partnership between USDA, DOE and Navy to invest up to $510 million during the next three years in partnership with the private sector to produce advanced, drop-in aviation and marine biofuels to power military and commercial transportation.At Secretary Vilsack's direction, USDA is working to develop the national biofuels industry producing energy from non-food sources in every region of the country. Working with private and government partners, USDA is supporting research into innovative energy technologies and processes, helping companies build biorefineries - including the first ever commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol facilities - and supporting farmers, ranchers, and businesses taking risks to pursue new opportunities in biofuels.Creating new markets for the nation's agricultural products through biobased manufacturing is one of the many steps the Administration has taken over the past three years to strengthen the rural economy. Since taking office, President Obama's Administration has taken historic steps to improve the lives of rural Americans, put people back to work and build thriving economies in rural communities. From proposing the American Jobs Act to establishing the first-ever White House Rural Council - chaired by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack - the President is committed to a smarter use of existing Federal resources to foster sustainable economic prosperity and ensure the government is a strong partner for businesses, entrepreneurs and working families in rural communities.Additional information on USDA's energy accomplishments can be found here. is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

Climate change is an active part of that discussion, and has been increasing through development of the new USDA Regional Climate Hubs. The network of Hubs deliver science-based knowledge, practical information, and program support to help natural resource managers, producers, and landowners make climate-informed decisions and then implement those decisions.\nThe Menominee Forest provides one example of this type of support. There, the non-native oak wilt fungus has killed thousands of red oak trees across 220,000 acres of forest managed by Menominee Tribal Enterprises. Over 300 pockets of forest affected by oak wilt have been found and treated so far. The treatment is disruptive to the site because all affected or potentially affected oak trees must be removed completely, and their stumps pulled to avoid transmission of the fungus through roots.\nResponding to the disease also provides opportunities. Some of the sites have been identified as demonstration sites that will be reforested, while also increasing forest diversity and introducing species that are expected to be better-adapted to future climates. Over the past few years, foresters at Menominee Tribal Enterprises have prepared the forest soil and begun planting an array of plant and tree species, informed by a combination of the traditional ecological knowledge and the latest climate change science.\nThe Menominee adaptation demonstration was supported by the Forest Service through its leadership in a collaborative effort called the Climate Change Response Framework. The Framework provides useful information, resources, and tools to help natural resource professionals and woodland owners consider climate change as they make decisions about how to manage their land. Adaptation demonstrations are critical for providing real-world examples of how climate change adaptation actions can be planned and implemented. To date, hundreds of natural resource managers have used the same process that was used at the Menominee Forest—an adaptation workbook—to integrate climate change information into dozens of on-the-ground projects.\nThe project with Menominee Tribal Enterprises is a great example of the kind of climate-informed management that emerges from combining local judgment and traditional knowledge with the latest applied climate science, and it shows how USDA can help land owners and managers respond to climate change.\nThis demonstration project was also featured in the September issue of the Journal of Forestry.  Learn more about Tribal Demonstration Projects using the Climate Change Response Framework.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Forestry\n Tags:\n adaptation\n Climate Change\n Climate Change Resource Center\n climate hub\n Conservation\n forest health\n Forestry\n Forests\n FS\n Menominee Forest\n Menominee Nation\n natural resources\n trees\n Tribal\n Wisconsin",

        "content": "USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service in\n Health and Safety\n Nov 19, \n Uh, oh! Thanksgiving is right around the corner. You bought a turkey on sale last year and froze it. You know it’s safe because you recently read that frozen turkeys are safe indefinitely and keep good quality for a year. But what you don’t know is how or when to thaw it.\nFirst of all, turkey should never be thawed on the counter or in hot water. These methods are NOT considered safe and may lead to foodborne illness. Also, never thaw a turkey in a garage, basement, car, on the kitchen counter, outdoors or on the porch. Turkey, as any perishable food, must be kept at a safe temperature during \"the big thaw.\" If not, once the turkey begins to thaw and becomes warmer than 40 °F, bacteria present before freezing can begin to multiply.\nEven though the center of the bird may still be frozen as it thaws on the counter, the outer layer of the turkey could be in the \"Danger Zone,\" between 40 and 140 °F — temperatures where bacteria multiply rapidly.\nNow that you know how NOT to thaw, let’s talk about the safe ways to thaw a turkey.\nRefrigerator Thawing\nPlan ahead. A frozen turkey will require at least 24 hours for every 5 pounds of weight. After thawing in the refrigerator, a turkey should remain safe and good quality for an additional day or two before cooking. A bird thawed in the refrigerator can be refrozen without cooking, although there may be some loss of quality.\nCold Water Thawing\nThis method is faster than refrigerator thawing but requires more attention. The turkey must be kept in its original package to keep bacteria from the air or surrounding environment from being introduced and to keep the turkey from absorbing water.\nThe turkey should be submerged in cold tap water, changing the water every 30 minutes so it continues to thaw. It should take about 30 minutes per pound to thaw. Once thawed by the cold water method, cook your turkey immediately. Check out the Turkey Thawing Chart for proper timing.\nMicrowave Thawing\nAfter thawing turkey in a microwave oven, cook immediately because some areas of the food may become warm and begin to cook during the thawing process (bringing the food to \"Danger Zone\" temperatures). Holding partially cooked food is not recommended because any bacteria present wouldn't have been destroyed and the food may have reached optimal temperatures for bacteria to grow.\nVisit Let's Talk About Thawing a Turkey video to see the 3 methods for thawing turkey safely.\nQuestions?\nAsk Karen, the virtual food safety representative, is available 24/7 at AskKaren.gov.

U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists are launching a campaign to ask volunteers to count the number of stink bugs in their homes. USDA-ARS photo by Stephen Ausmus.\nCalling all insect enthusiasts and frustrated gardeners!  USDA scientists need your help in documenting Brown Marmorated Stink Bugs (BMSB) in your home. Beginning September 15th through October 15th, we’re asking citizens across the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States to record daily counts of this pest on the exterior of their homes, along with their location and the time of each count. While USDA scientists are focusing on the Mid-Atlantic region, any they can get from other U.S. regions would also be helpful to their research.\nThe quest to find out just how many stink bugs there are, and how they behave, is the brainchild of a consortium of researchers from USDA, the University of Maryland, Pennsylvania State University, Rutgers University, Virginia Tech, the Northeastern IPM Center, Oregon State University, North Carolina State University, Cornell University, the University of Delaware and Washington State University. This project is represented on the website, “Stop BMSB (www.stopbmsb.org),” which was launched in .\nThe project involves more than 50 scientists who are investigating the impact BMSB have on grapes, orchard crops, small fruits, ornamental crops and vegetables, as well as ways to prevent or minimize the pest’s impact. BMSB have been found in 40 states and have caused the most damage in the Mid-Atlantic region. The value of at-risk crops where BMSB have been established or identified exceeds $21 billon.\nBecause landscape features such as woodlands, structures, roads and different land use types affect the spread of the insects, it is important to collect related to BMSB locations. BMSB survive cold winter temperatures near farmland in homes, office buildings and warehouses.\nScientists are just beginning to understand how landscape features will be a key component in combating stink bugs. Volunteers willing to count their stink bugs can contact USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) entomologists Tracy Leskey (tracy.leskey@ars.usda.gov), Doo-Hyung Lee or Torri Hancock at 725-, at the ARS Appalachian Fruit Research Laboratory in Kearneysville, West Virginia.\nParticipant forms to record BMSB counts can be printed by going to \n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n ARS\n Cornell University\n Delaware\n grapes\n invasive pests\n Maryland\n North Carolina\n Oregon State University\n Pennsylvania State University\n pests\n Rutgers University\n Virginia\n Washington State University\n West Virginia",

All are reasons many cooks might look for ways to roast a whole turkey outside the usual oven. Consider the following methods suggested by the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline.\nBut first, a message about food safety. No matter which method you choose to get your turkey to the table, have a food thermometer handy so you can make sure the turkey has reached the safe minimum internal temperature of 165 °F in the innermost part of the thigh, wing and the thickest part of the breast.  If your turkey is stuffed, the center of the stuffing should also reach 165 °F. After cooking, let the turkey stand for 20 minutes before carving.\nOutdoor Methods (from fastest to slowest)\nNOTE: DO NOT stuff turkeys cooked by these outdoor methods. Also make sure the turkey is completely thawed. Follow the appliance manufacturer’s directions.\nDeep Fat Turkey Fryer\nSize of turkey: 12 to 15 pounds.\nCooking time: 3 to 5 minutes per pound.\nRequires 2 ½ to 3 gallons of oil. The appliance should be large enough to hold the turkey without the oil spilling over. Measure the capacity of the fryer first by placing the raw turkey in the cold fryer and filling it with water, which should cover the turkey by 1 to 2 inches. Remove the turkey and measure the amount of water in the fryer. Use that amount of oil and preheat the fryer until the oil reaches 350 °F before submerging the turkey.\nInfrared Oil-less Turkey Fryer\nCooking time: approximately 10 minutes per pound.\nSize of turkey: 16 pounds or smaller.\nThis appliance comes in either an electric or a gas version that must be connected to a 20-pound propane tank.\n\"Big Green Egg\" (Ceramic Egg-shaped Cooker)\nSize of turkey: 12 pounds.\nCooking time: approximately 12 to 13 minutes per pound.\nUse only lump charcoal and always cook with the lid closed. Set the cooker temperature to 350 °F.\nCovered Gas or Charcoal Grill\nSize of turkey: 12 to 15 pounds.\nCooking time: approximately 15 to 18 minutes per pound.\nPlace a pan of water under the grate to insure indirect heat, catch the turkey drippings, and prevent flame-ups. If the grill has two or three burners, turn off a burner and place the turkey away from the flame for indirect cooking.\nSmoker\nSize of turkey: 12 to 15 pounds.\nCooking time: approximately 25 to 30 minutes per pound.\nA smoker may be electric or charcoal. Cooking times depend on the size and shape of the turkey and the outside air temperature. Make sure that the smoker maintains an internal temperature of 225 °F to 300 °F. \nIndoor Methods (fastest)\nMicrowave Cooking\nSize of turkey: 12 to 14 pounds.\nCooking time: approximately 9 minutes per pound on 50% (medium) power level.\nUse an oven cooking bag for more even cooking. Rotate the turkey every 15 minutes. Timing can vary because microwave ovens vary in wattage. Do not stuff the turkey. Cook stuffing in a separate casserole.\nElectric Roaster Oven\nSize of turkey: 12 to 20 pounds.\nCooking time: approximately 3 to 4 ½ hours. Add 30 minutes for stuffed turkeys.\nGenerally, the cooking time and oven temperature setting in this tabletop appliance are the same as for conventional cooking. Set the roaster temperature to 325 °F. Do not lift the lid during cooking or it will increase the cooking time.\nPower Outage\nIf your electricity goes off while you are cooking a turkey indoors, you can transfer the turkey immediately to an outdoor appliance, and continue cooking it until safely done.\nQuestions?\nAsk Karen, the virtual food safety representative, is available 24/7 at AskKaren.gov.

Here, an ARS scientist examines a farmer’s subsurface drain pipe. Photo by ARS.\nThis post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nThere’s no farming without water. Recent droughts in the United States and elsewhere underscore our need to conserve water in agricultural production, and studies have identified agricultural management practices that help protect water quality.  USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) researchers are making key contributions to these efforts.\nFor instance, ARS scientists use moisture information collected by satellites to develop the Evaporative Stress Index.  In , this tool predicted that drought conditions were developing weeks before other drought monitoring networks made the same call. ARS researchers also use satellite to design methods of estimating rainfall amounts in regions where setting up sampling stations would be a challenge, work that has long-range potential for improving precipitation estimates globally.\nOur scientists have improved crop models that farmers can use to manage water more efficiently.  One of these models, the Phenology Modular Modeling System decision support tool, has already been downloaded by more than 1,500 researchers, farmers, and agribusinesses.  ARS scientists also periodically update another model called the Water Erosion Prediction Project; the latest version includes new methods for estimating the movement of water on top of and through the soil, as well as through subsurface tile drainage, which is common in Midwest crop fields.\nProtecting water quality is just as important as tracking how much there is and where it’s going.  One ARS scientist developed a method to identify where growers can use different types of surface and below-ground management practices to reduce the movement of agricultural chemicals and improve water quality.  Other ARS scientists used field studies and computer models to study the movement of the pesticide atrazine in water bodies next to Puerto Rico’s Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, information that can help farmers develop practices to protect estuarine ecosystems from agricultural chemicals.\nFrom the smallest stream to the largest bay, we’re doing everything we can to conserve our precious—and finite—water resources.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n agricultural production\n ARS\n Conservation\n drought\n Farmers\n Puerto Rico\n Research\n Science Tuesday\n water\n water quality",

The healthy soil nourishes and supports the plants that grow from it. In fact, plants and soil feed and protect each other.\nBy alternating between growing and grazing, Roehm fertilizes his land in a natural, sustainable way that improves the health of his livestock, soil, and vegetables. Photo by Bob Stobaugh\nAccording to Roehm, \"By investing in the soil...you see payoffs in lower weed pressure, better fertility, less pest pressure and healthier plants that are able to deal with disease pressure and insect pressure that less healthy plants are not able to deal with.\"\nNon-organic farmers have several short-cuts available. They can apply conventional fertilizers, which directly feed the plants, but that can harm the soil or adversely affect water quality.\nOrganic farmers, restricted from using synthetic fertilizers, must rely on natural systems. That is why Roehm mimics nature by integrating grazing into his practice.\nGrazing is a valuable part of Chris Roehm's soil management plan. Photo by Bob Stobaugh\n\"One of the components of our soil health management plan that we are happiest with is the integration of growing forage crops for grazing animals with our annual vegetable production,\" he says.\nBy alternating between growing and grazing, Roehm fertilizes his land in a natural, sustainable way that improves the health of his livestock, soil and vegetables. The results are impressive.\n\"The first year after that foraged ground has been turned over is like magic, everything just flies up out of the ground, there are hardly any weeds, the bugs don’t know what to do, it’s really fantastic,\" Roehm says.\nOregon organic farmer Chris Roehm and NRCS Basin Resource Conservationist Dean Moberg examine an organically-grown tomato at Square Peg Farms. Photo by Ron Nichols\nWhen you're looking for the best answer on how to grow your crops, think long-term, like Chris Roehm and so many others, and unlock the secrets in the soil. As Roehm says, “If your long-term strategy is to grow organically, the only successful way to achieve that is to work on feeding the soil.”\n\"[Our customers] noticed we have a lot more stuff to sell and that's not because we increased the acreage, it’s because the plants are making more saleable produce for us.\"\nFor more information on NRCS soil health and assistance for organic producers visit www.nrcs.usda.gov/organic.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Conservation\n Farmers\n grazing\n NRCS\n Oregon\n organic\n Producers\n Soil Health",

        "content": "Florida State Statistician, National Agricultural Statistics Service in\n Conservation\n Jun 26, \nThe Sunshine State is seeing spectacular growth in organic crops. Check back next Thursday for more facts from the Census of Agriculture.\nThe Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture.\nAs the new Florida State Statistician, I am excited to start digging into the agricultural here in the Sunshine State. One of the first things anybody would notice upon glancing over our stats is the wealth of fruits, vegetables, and other unique commodities. According to the Census of Agriculture, almost 64% of Florida’s total market value of agricultural products sold comes from three categories: fruits and nuts, nursery, greenhouse, floriculture, and sod, and vegetables, melons, potatoes, and sweet potatoes. We are one of the top three states nationwide in sales in all three of these categories, and Florida is also the top producer of sugarcane for sugar. Thus, the Sunshine State definitely lives up to its bright nickname by harvesting a rainbow of commodities.\nIf one crop defines Florida, it’s oranges. There are over 465,000 acres of orange farms in our state, accounting for almost 70% of all the orange acreage in the nation. To top it off, we are the only state to grow the delectable Temple orange.\nIn addition to oranges, Florida has over 850,000 acres of farmland dedicated to other commodities: over 250,000 acres to growing vegetables, and over 598,600 acres producing more fruits, nuts, and berries. Interestingly, peaches in particular are coming into the Florida agricultural spotlight.  Peach trees require chill hours to jolt their flowering process effectively, and while peach producing states like Georgia and New Jersey receive adequate chill hours for traditional cultivars, Florida usually does not. However, researchers have developed new cultivars with low chill hours which are more conducive to Florida’s growing season.\nOn another note, Florida’s farm demographics clearly reflect the dynamic and diversifying U.S. population. Since the last census of agriculture in , there has been an increase in the number of Asian, black or African American, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino origin operators. Furthermore, while around 20% of farmers nationwide have been operating a farm for fewer than ten years, this proportion is almost 26% in Florida, reflecting a younger group of operators. Finally, about 35.7% of all farm operators in Florida are female.\nFlorida is also keeping pace with the recent trends toward renewable energy and organic products. At over $83 million, Florida’s total organic product sales was almost five times higher than in . In addition, 748 farms in Florida have renewable energy producing systems.\nAs you can see, Florida agriculture is as vibrant as ever, and I am excited to see how our state continues to live up to its bright nickname.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Census of Agriculture\n Farmers\n Florida\n fruits\n Georgia\n NASS\n New Jersey\n organic\n Ranchers\n Renewable Energy\n Sugarcane\n vegetables",

Here at USDA, many of our more than 100,000 employees are doing their part. They are driven to serve, and proud to identify ways to use their skills to support their own communities.\nHere's some work two USDA employees are doing to improve the health of their communities:\nHorseback riding for people with special needs — Mike (Annandale, VA)\nMike and his family have long been involved with the equestrian sport of vaulting (gymnastics on horseback). Over the past year they have hosted a regular outing for special needs children and adults from their church, giving each an opportunity to ride a horse and to learn the freedom of movement and confidence the experience brings. Nothing can compare with the sheer pleasure of seeing these individuals, often initially nervous and scared, beaming as they ride triumphantly...and often for the first time in their lives. Perhaps the most meaningful experience was last October when, during local pony rides Mike was helping with, he saw a mother with an infant whose many tubes and blank stare evidenced the severity of his condition. He asked the mother if her baby wanted a chance to ride and he was soon up on a horse in the secure arms of an experienced rider. After a 5-minute ride his mother thanked Mike and later told him that her baby was normally mostly uncommunicative, but that after riding he seemed to be alert and aware for days!\nRaising money for a cure — Nancy (Steele, ND)\nNancy coordinated the local USDA Service Center’s team for the American Cancer Society’s \"Relay for Life\" fundraiser in Steele, North Dakota. They named their group \"Team USDA\" and over a few short months raised over $. \"Team USDA\" was the top fundraising team from within the 23 teams that participated.

Photo courtesy of Jorge Dubcovsky\nDuring the month of April we will take a closer look at USDA’s Groundbreaking Research for a Revitalized Rural America, highlighting ways USDA researchers are improving the lives of Americans in ways you might never imagine.  Today we look at USDA support for a researcher striving to improve wheat through developing better disease resistance, nutritional value, and yield.\nOne of America’s most renowned agricultural researchers, a man who has already collected two of the USDA’s top honors, has now earned international recognition with the Wolf Prize in Agriculture.  The Wolf Foundation began awarding six prizes – agriculture, the arts, chemistry, mathematics, medicine, and physics – in to recognize outstanding scientists and artists for achievements in the interest of mankind and friendly relations among peoples.\nJorge Dubcovsky, a professor of plant sciences at the University of California–Davis and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute–Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation investigator, is sharing the Wolf Prize with Leif Andersson, from Uppsala University in Sweden.  Dubcovsky’s previous awards include USDA’s National Research Initiative Discovery Award and the USDA Secretary’s Honor Award.  Dubcovsky will receive the Wolf Prize June 1 at Knesset Israel (the Israeli Parliament) from Israeli President Shimon Peres.\nDubcovsky is a plant geneticist who works with wheat to improve disease resistance, nutritional value, yield, and adaptability to a changing environment.  Over the years, USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) has provided more than $15 million to fund more than 20 of Dubcovsky’s research projects.\n“NIFA funding has been the central pillar in the support of my research,” Dubcovsky said.  “These grants support critical crop research and crop improvement and provide valuable resources for the public breeding programs to organize themselves at a national level through Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP) grants.”\nOne of his recent NIFA grants is a $5 million Triticeae CAP (TCAP) project to improve barley and wheat germplasm.  Triticeae is from the family of grasses that includes wheat, barley, and rye.  Wheat products alone account for about 20 percent of calories consumed by humans.\nDubcovsky’s TCAP team used markers to identify the gene variants that control the most desirable of the plant’s traits.  They then created a “Triticeae Toolbox” to provide this information to plant breeders so they can develop improved wheat and barley lines.  Further, the team is developing a national education network to train 29 doctoral candidates in plant breeding.\nTCAP also features collaborations with minority-serving institutions to attract new students to the agricultural sciences, which is important to the professor.  “I hope (that the Wolf Prize) will help my program attract brilliant and enthusiastic young researchers,” he said.\nAs a side benefit, growers of follow-on crops may also profit from Dubcovsky-led wheat research.  According to an article published May 14, , in Crop Science, three bread wheat varieties created by TCAP carry a gene that is resistant to root-knot nematodes (plant-parasitic worms).  The wheat encourages the nematodes to grow, but the worms cannot eat the wheat.  As a result, they starve, do not reproduce, and die out – which allows the next crop to grow in a relatively nematode-free field.\nLooking to the future, Dubcovsky – who was born and raised in Argentina and received his bachelors and doctoral degrees in biological sciences from the University of Buenos Aires – is enthusiastic about employing new high-throughput sequencing technologies.  “We will continue pushing hard to complete the sequencing of most wheat genes across our mutant populations,” he said.  “We expect to have a public database where people can search for available mutations and then request the seeds.  We think this will be a fantastic resource to study gene function in wheat.”\nThrough federal funding and leadership for research, education, and Cooperative Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n California\n NIFA\n Research\n wheat",

He will be there.\nHe knows.\nU.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell will travel to California for the premier of the animated movie Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax, which includes the agency’s first Honorary Forest Ranger Betty White. \nIn the movie, a 12-year-old boy (Zac Efron) tries to win a young girl’s heart (Taylor Swift) by going in search of the Lorax, a grumpy yet charming character who fights to protect the world played by Danny DeVito. Betty White plays the role of the grandmother.\nThe movie is adapted from the book of the same name, written in by Theodor Seuss Geisel, known by millions simply as Dr. Seuss. The book is narrated by the Once-ler, a faceless character who tells a young boy the story of the lost Truffula trees, which are nowhere to be found. But as he tells his story, the Once-ler says to the boy:\nUnless someone like you\ncares a whole awful lot\nnothing is going to get better\nIt’s not.*\nThe Lorax then tosses the last Truffula tree seed, urging the boy to set out and plant the seed and help bring back a forest of Truffula trees as well as the Barb-ba-loots, Swoomee-Swans and Humming-Fish that relied on a healthy forest to survive.\n“Given the many threats to America’s private and public forests due to a changing climate, pests and pathogens, and land conversion, this children’s story can spur conversations about what has to happen today to restore the health and productivity of America’s forests,” Tidwell said. “This is an opportunity to start a dialogue about the inherent value of forests and the importance of sustainable management.”\nThe nation’s 193 million acres of forest and grasslands provide a wealth of public benefits: clean air and water, wildlife habitat, recreation and the wood and paper products Americans use every day.\n“Forests matter to everyone, and we must use and care for them responsibly and sustainably,” Tidwell said. “The Forest Service, our state partners, family forest owners and the many partner organizations we work with are helping to protect more than 751 million acres of forest land in America. Ensuring that trees are part of America’s landscape is a goal we all share with The Lorax.”\nThe Lorax also is an integral part of a public service campaign with the Forest Service and the Ad Council. The two agencies have worked together since on a public service campaign designed to inspire children and their families to unplug and reconnect with nature.\nThe Ad Council helped the Forest Service join forces with Universal Pictures, which created pro bono a series of new English and Spanish television, radio and outdoor public service advertisements that feature characters from the movie, which will open nationwide March 2, Dr. Seuss’ 108th birthday.\nThe PSAs encourage viewers to go Discover the Forest, an online site that helps children learn about how to discover the wonders of forests around them.\n*Excerpt from The Lorax by Dr. Seuss, Random House, .\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Discover The Forest\n Forestry\n FS\n The Lorax\n Tom Tidwell",

A proposed entry of an Inspection Manual by the European-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development Scheme on Agricultural Quality (OECD Scheme) initially threatened specific U.S. grapefruit exports to the European Union (EU), which buys one of every two exported grapefruits in the world.\nThe Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) interpretive brochures serve as the handbook for all national produce inspection agencies within the EU as well as for many other countries. When the new interpretive brochure rejected grapefruit with a certain kind of surface skin defect or discoloring (which naturally occur in tropical and subtropical regions like Florida), U.S. grapefruit growers could have faced a serious challenge. Last year, the United States exported 20 percent of the world’s grapefruit, $47.7 million of which went to the European Union!\nExperts from the U.S. citrus industry have been working with an OECD Technical Working Group to ensure that the brochure included sub-tropical grapefruit. When the draft failed to include photos and explanatory language for surface defects associated with sub-tropical zones (such as Florida), the USDA and the Florida Citrus industry worked closely with the OECD Scheme to plan a meeting in Geneva to revisit the issue in May . \"A technical rule in a brochure could have cost real jobs and exports in the Florida grapefruit industry,\" says U.S. Ambassador to the OECD Karen Kornbluh. \"We could not let this stand.\" At the meeting, the U.S. government and the citrus industry presented its position on the interpretive brochure, and after a lively debate, the U.S. position was adopted.\nThe United States is both a founding member of the OECD, an international organization composed of 32 democratic countries with market-based economies, and of a separate organization - the OECD Scheme - from which the U.S. subsequently withdrew. The OECD seeks to achieve a higher standard of living in member countries as well as engage   non-members to contribute to the development of the world economy. Through its public policy research, ‘soft law,' and peer reviews, the OECD--which turns 50 years old later this year-- provides the U.S. with an opportunity to engage other countries on economic regulatory issues.\n Category/Topic:\n Trade\n Tags:\n FAS\n Foreign Agricultural Service\n Sara Feuerstein",

He’s the head of the Nolan Ryan Guaranteed Tender Beef Program, a marketing program verified by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS).\nAMS relies on university-researched and industry-recognized standards to determine which marketing claims it chooses to verify.\nCompanies like Ryan’s can approach AMS and request the agency verify marketing claims such as “guaranteed tender” to assure customers that the products listed on packaging are exactly what they claim.  This is an important service to consumers who desire a certain quality of beef and want third-party assurance that their beef purchases meet exacting requirements.\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\nUSDA Certified – St. Louis (Cardinals) Style\nIf you bellied-up at a local sports bar and ordered a plate of St. Louis Style ribs while watching the World Series, thank a former USDA employee for naming the cut of pork.\nIn the late s Steve Olson, an agricultural marketing specialist in the USDA Livestock and Seed Program’s Standardization Division, wrote meat standards for the Agricultural Marketing Service’s Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications (IMPS).\nLast June Olson shared his story about naming the cut of meat with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He explained how some butchers fancied carving off the breast bone and brisket bones from pork spareribs. “We did a survey to find out if there was a consensus for what this was called,” Olson told the Post-Dispatch.\nA majority of the respondents called it a St. Louis cut.\n“The only reason I went ahead and put the term into the IMPS is because I happen to be an avid St. Louis Cardinals baseball team fan, and they had just defeated the San Francisco Giants in a playoff,” Olson said.\nFor more specifications, you can view the latest IMPS report.

        "content": "Secretary Vilsack: One of the world's oldest building materials is now also one of its most advanced\n Release & Contact Info\n Press Release\n Release No. .14\n Contact:Office of Communications 720-\n WASHINGTON, D.C., March 18, - At a meeting hosted by the White House Rural Council today, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced a new partnership to train architects, engineers and builders about the benefits of advanced wood building materials, and plans for a forthcoming prize competition to design and build high-rise wood demonstration projects. Innovative use of wood products is already beginning to change the face of construction across the country, and USDA is undertaking efforts to support these advancements. These efforts also support President Obama's Climate Action Plan goal of preserving the role of forests in mitigating climate change.Wood may be one of the world's oldest building materials, but it is now also one of the most advanced, said Vilsack. Building stronger markets for innovative new wood products supports sustainable forestry, helps buffer reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and puts rural America at the forefront of an emerging industry. Presently, the market for wood and other related forest products supports more than one million direct jobs, many in rural America. As these markets expand, so will the economic opportunities.The new training program Secretary Vilsack announced today will include a $1 million investment from the Forest Service and will be done in partnership with WoodWorks, a non -profit organization that provides technical support, education, and resources related to the design of modern wood buildings for architects, engineers, and developers.The Secretary also announced plans to launch a new prize competition, expected to begin later this year, for developers, institutions, organizations and design teams competing to demonstrate the architectural and commercial viability of using sustainable wood products in high-rise construction. The Department is planning to invest up to $1 million to launch the competition. One non-profit partner, the Binational Softwood Lumber Council, has committed an additional $1 million for the competition. The competition will help spur increased sustainability in construction and will give priority to applicants that source materials from rural domestic manufacturers and domestic, sustainably-managed forests.Emerging engineered wood technologies can be used in industrial building projects such as tall buildings and skyscrapers, as well as other projects. By some industry estimates, a 3-5 story building made from emerging wood technologies has the same emissions control as taking up to 550 cars of the road for one year. Wood-based designs have also been demonstrated to improve energy efficiency, thereby reducing energy consumption for heating and cooling.Today's announcements were made as part of a the Building With Wood: Jobs and the Environment workshop hosted by the White House Rural Council, which included architects, builders, designers, wood manufactures, foresters, state officials, university leaders and representatives from the USDA, General Services Administration, Department of the Interior, Federal Emergency Management Agency and Department of Defense. They also are part of USDA's overall strategy to promote the use of wood as a green building material. USDA's Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin has invested over $2 million in research and technical support for emerging wood technologies. The Forest Products Laboratory has created additional opportunities for emerging wood technologies to be used in housing developments and other green building demonstration projects.When President Obama signed the Farm Bill in February he directed his Administration, working through the White House Rural Council, to lead a new Made in Rural America export and investment initiative. This initiative is charged with bringing together federal resources to help rural businesses and leaders take advantage of new investment opportunities and access new customers and markets both at home and abroad. White House Rural Council leadership on advanced wood products is an example of how the Administration is moving forward on dual goals of domestic production and sustainability. is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

(Administrator Anne Alonzo, 4th from right) USDA Photo Courtesy of Peter Wood.\nMarch is National Nutrition Month, and local food plays an important role in providing Americans with fresh, healthy fuel for their bodies. From farmers to financiers to schools and hospitals, there is a lot of passion for sharing good food by supporting strong local and regional food systems. I experienced this firsthand during my trip to Chicago, Ill., where I spoke at last week’s Good Food Festival & Conference.\nThe trip came on the heels of a recent announcement that USDA is making $97 million available to expand access to healthy food and support rural economies.  Grants from my agency -- the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) – make up over $90 million of that funding.  AMS was a sponsor and exhibitor at the trade show, where we shared information with stakeholders about the many resources we have to support local and regional food systems. Through our Specialty Crop Block Grant Program and Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program (comprised of the Farmers Market Promotion Program and the Local Food Promotion Program), AMS supports producers, local food entrepreneurs, and rural and urban communities across the country.\nAt the conference, I met many local food producers and stakeholders who have directly benefited from AMS support for local food systems. I emphasized USDA’s continued commitment to this valuable sector and thanked the conference host, FamilyFarmed.org, for their inspired leadership in advancing local foods. Last year, FamilyFarmed.org received an AMS grant for their Good Food Business Accelerator Program, which leverages an impressive collection of partnerships to provide local food startups in the Chicago area with strategic, operating, and financial support.\nThe FarmLogix team, Aramark and the Chicago Public Schools have worked together to add locally-grown produce onto school menus. During the visit, students at Cyrus H. McCormick had a lunch featuring local apples and carrots. (Administrator Anne Alonzo, 2nd from right) USDA Photo Courtesy of Peter Wood.\nAnother highlight of the trip was a visit to my old elementary school, Cyrus H. McCormick, in the urban Latino community where I grew up on Chicago’s South Side. Chicago Public Schools and FarmLogix, another AMS grantee, organized the visit to highlight how school districts are incorporating locally-grown produce to provide kids with fresh, healthy food. We visited the students over their lunch that included local carrots and apples. Later, at a school assembly, they asked me all about my career, education, and working in government. I was in their shoes 30 years ago – it was incredibly moving to connect with them and hopefully inspire them to pursue careers in public service and agriculture.\nUSDA continues to support the local food sector and has identified strengthening local food systems as one of the four pillars of our commitment to rural economic development and job creation. All of us here at USDA are doing all we can to support this sector via the Know your Farmer, Know your Food initiative.\nThe Good Food Festival and Conference, hosted by FamilyFarmed.org, brought local food producers and stakeholders to Chicago, Ill.

        "content": "Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in\n Food and Nutrition\n Jan 30, \n Today, USDA proposed the establishment of minimum national professional standards and training requirements for school nutrition professionals who manage and operate the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs.\nThe standards, another key provision of the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of (HHFKA), aim to institute education and certification standards for school nutrition professionals. These new standards will ensure that school nutrition personnel have the training and tools they need to plan, prepare and purchase healthy products to create nutritious, safe and enjoyable school meals.\nAs a former school nutrition director I can tell you that school nutrition professionals across the country are pleased with the new meal patterns established by the HHFKA, which requires schools to prepare healthier meals for 32 million children each day. Schools are at the forefront of national efforts to improve nutrition and reduce obesity in our Nation’s children.\nSince the start of the - School Year, I have visited dozens of schools and witnessed students embracing healthier meal options as schools successfully implement the latest lunch, breakfast and snack standards.  In fact, our most our most recent show that roughly 90 percent of schools are reporting that they are meeting the new standards, a 12 percent increase from June .\nMany school nutrition professionals already complete annual training that is similar to what we are recommending; for others, the standards will be new. These proposed standards will ensure that all school nutrition professionals meet the same national requirements as they prepare healthy meals served in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs.\nThe professional standards proposed by USDA will focus on training opportunities and strengthen the school nutrition profession.\nThis proposal would:\nCreate minimum hiring standards for school food authority directors based on a school district’s size;\nEstablish minimum hiring standards for State directors of school nutrition and State distributing agencies; and\nRequire minimum annual training for all new and current school nutrition professionals.\nSchool nutrition professionals, educators, and members of the nutrition community from around the country have voiced their support for strengthening school meals programs by setting professional standards.\nWe received a tremendous amount of feedback from State agencies, school districts, and several professional associations as we developed the proposed standards; we now look forward to receiving additional comments that may help us fine tune these standards to ensure the greatest benefit.\nUSDA is committed to working closely with school nutrition directors, managers and staff to meet the proposed requirements once they are in place. Our Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) will continue collaborating with partners to identify free and low-cost training at locations that are convenient and easily accessible. FNS will also be working with our partners to develop an easily accessible national database that will list available trainings by State.\nAs our nation continues to fight childhood obesity, we commend our schools for making so much progress in offering healthier options during the school day.  Many of our kids spend the majority of their waking hours each day in school, and consume half their daily calories from school meals.\nBy enhancing school nutrition careers, we are giving our hard-working and caring professionals the tools and training needed to create a healthy school environment where our children are healthy, engaged, and productive learners.\nThe school nutrition community has expressed their support for establishing professional standards.

        "content": "NRCS Mississippi in\n Conservation\n May 05, \n Every year a low-oxygen, or hypoxic, area forms in the northern Gulf of Mexico, just below the mouth of the Mississippi River. Fish and other wildlife often avoid hypoxic zones, which can be deadly to marine organisms. Known contributors to the Gulf’s hypoxic zone include runoff from urban areas, land development and agriculture.\nUSDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) works with farmers and ranchers to help reduce agricultural runoff that may contribute to the hypoxic zone, in part through the Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative (MRBI).\nThis reservoir and drainage ditch are part of a water recycling system in place on Shivers Farm to reduce the amount of sediments that run into the Sunflower River, a tributary of the Mississippi River. \nThe Mississippi River Basin drains a huge portion of the United States, including parts or all of 31 states. As water drains off land and enters the river, it can transport nutrients from soil, fertilizer, animal wastes and sewage. The river carries water down the continent to the Gulf of Mexico, where any excess nutrients the water contains can stimulate the growth of algae, which consume large amounts of oxygen in the water—creating a hypoxic zone. The zone in the Gulf varies in size, but is often 7,000 or more square miles. Scientists have been studying the area since the s and mapping it since the mid-s. \nShivers Farms, located outside of Indianola, Miss., is one of the farms participating in MRBI to reduce nutrients transported to the Mississippi River and, ultimately, the Gulf of Mexico, with the goal of increasing water quality in both bodies of water. The farm sits on 300 acres along Porter Bayou, and runoff from its lands enters the Sunflower River, eventually flowing into the Gulf.\nBut now about half of the water used on the farm stays on site when it drains off the fields, because the farmer has installed a series of underground pipes, ditches and a storage reservoir, funded in part by  NRCS. This system allows time for nutrients and sediments to settle in the reservoir, which provides irrigation water for the crops.\nReusing water improves water quality by reducing the amount of runoff entering the river and helping filter out nutrients and sediments. It provides benefits for farmers, too: the nutrients in the water fertilize the plants, which prefer the warmer reservoir water to cold aquifer water, since the latter takes more energy for them to process. And the reuse of water means that less water is drawn from the aquifer.\nThe farm’s manager is happy with the benefits, and says that he hopes other Delta farmers take advantage of MRBI. In the future, he plans to look into other NRCS conservation programs.\nMRBI was launched in , and Mississippi is one of 13 states participating. The effort stretches across the 2,350-mile basin from Lake Itasca, Minn. to the Gulf.\nFind out more about the Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative.\nCheck out more conservation stories on the USDA blog.\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\nThis reservoir retains and recycles nearly half of the water used on Shivers Farm. Crops benefit from the warmer surface water, and the Gulf benefits because this reservoir allows time for the sediments and nutrients to settle out of the water. \n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Conservation\n Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative\n NRCS",

To roast, meat is placed on a rack in a shallow, uncovered pan and is cooked by the indirect dry heat of an oven.\nThe traditional centerpiece of many holiday meals served this time of year is the roast. Whether you use pork, beef, goose, turkey, or chicken, the most popular means to cook your meat of choice is in the oven.\nThe roasting recipe that was handed down to you from your great grandmother may need a little updating though. Whether it asks you to marinate at room temperature overnight, or cook until ‘the juices run clear,’ some instructions in heirloom recipes might be outdated. To help you make the dish your great grandmother intended, we pulled together a list of holiday roasting tips.\nBeef, Veal, Pork and Lamb: To avoid overcooking beef, veal, pork and lamb roasts use a meat thermometer. These roasts should be removed from the oven when they reach an internal temperature of 145 °F. For safety and quality, allow meat to rest for at least three minutes before carving or consuming. If you’re concerned about serving a dry roast, use a continuous read thermometer or start checking the temperature of your meat earlier then the recipe’s cooking directions.\nTurkey, Duck, and Goose: Domestic ducklings and geese have a great deal of fat. While it helps them float when swimming, fat is undesirable in a cooked duck. Therefore, it’s recommended to prick or score the skin of a whole duck before cooking so that most of the fat will render out. These birds should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 °F as measured by a food thermometer. Temperatures should be taken in three areas of the bird: the thickest part of the breast, the innermost part of the wing, and the innermost part of the thigh. For more information on safe poultry handling and cooking, read our Thanksgiving material.\nFor approximate cooking times to use in meal planning, visit FoodSafety.gov. For reasons of personal preference, consumers may choose to cook meat to higher temperatures but at the recommended temperatures the food is safe to eat.

The ski area is entirely on Forest Service land. (U.S. Forest Service)\nForget the high-priced dinner, artificial moon glow and hurried wait staff this Valentine’s Day.\nTry, instead, something very different from the tried and true red roses that wilt away or those earrings that she really had hoped would be a ring. Plan a visit to a national forest or grassland. Let a photograph or video be the record of your everlasting love. Please do not carve your names into a tree or other object or in another way deface the beauty of our national forests and grasslands.\nAnd if the weather for the recreational activity you would like to pursue makes a Valentine’s Day visit out of the question, consider designing and printing a “Let’s Love the Outdoors Together” coupon with a promise for a hike, bike or other activity during a more heart-warming time of year.\nMake your Valentine’s destination Love Lake picnic site on the Rio Grande National Forest in Colorado. Open year round, a lovely hike around the small impoundment at the head of Middle Creek can do a heart good. Of course, it is winter. But you could bundle up and cuddle together as you take the snowmobile for a refreshing ride over the snow.\nCan’t get away from that diamond? Then try Diamond Lake on the Umpqua National Forest in Oregon is a breathtaking mile-high lake that is perfect for a couple who enjoys swimming in the cold yet refreshing waters, fishing in a lake stocked annually with thousands of Rainbow trout or biking along an 11-mile paved trail around the lake. The campground has more than 200 sites to accommodate tents, RVs and trailers. The season begins in May, so don’t forget to make your reservation through Recreation.gov.\nFor a warmer climate, head to Heart Rock on Seeley Creek Trail on the  San Bernardino National Forest in California. The easy hike follows Seeley Creek to the overlook that marks the trails’ end. It is here you will see a heart-shaped hole in the cliff next to a picturesque 20-foot waterfall. Just don’t get too close.\nYou could make Valentine’s Day a family affair at Heart Bar Campground, also on the San Bernardino. The area has tent and camping trailer spaces, picnic tables, toilets, drinking water and parking. Everything you need except for the s’mores. Bring those for a sweet ending to your day.\nWe all know love is fickle, so how about Heartbreak Ridge on the Superior National Forest? The steep ridge, once used for logging, broke many a logger’s heart because during the winter he could not haul up or down the rise. Maybe for this one, you might want to give your loved one a coupon for a spring or summer hike. The forest is in Minnesota, and it’s pretty frigid this time of year.\nNational forests are home to 122 ski areas, like Loveland Ski Area on the Arapaho National Forest in Colorado. Loveland Basin is on the eastern slope of the Continental Divide about 53 miles west of Denver. The ski area, operated under a special-use permit with the agency, has three quad chair lifts, two triple chair lifts, three double chair lifts and one poma surface lift to service 1,570 acres of skiable terrain. Of course, a visit there on Valentine’s Day might just come with a commitment. The ski area is staging its 23rd annual mountaintop matrimony day.\nThe Valentine Lake Northshore Campground has 14 campsites, six of which are located along the shoreline of the lake on the Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana. The three-mile Valentine Lake Trail starts and ends at the campground and is good for a leisurely stroll and a bit of fishing from the pier.\nDon’t have a valentine? Maybe Cupid shot a few misdirected bows at Double Arrow Lookout on the Lolo National Forest in Montana. The 20-foot tower has amazing views of Seeley Valley and the adjacent Swan Mountains with accommodations for a wonderful stay.\nBut don’t be disheartened. No Valentine’s Day is complete without a special hug.

USDA supports the development of circular bioeconomies, where agricultural resources are harvested, consumed, and regenerated in a sustainable manner. This approach can also create new revenue streams for agricultural producers and ensure that wealth and other economic benefits in the form of jobs and other opportunities are created, and stay, in rural communities.\nUSDA released a fact sheet outlining the Department’s bioeconomy accomplishments (, 128 ), which include $772 million in investments for research, development and infrastructure involving biofuels, fertilizer production, crop innovations, biobased products and more.\nEnabling the American Bioeconomy Through Building a Resilient Biomass Supply\nPresident Biden's Executive Order charged USDA with delivering a plan to support the resilience of the U.S. biomass supply chain for domestic biomanufacturing and biobased product manufacturing, while also advancing food security, environmental sustainability, and the needs of underserved communities. Secretary Vilsack announced the report, “A Plan to Enable the Bioeconomy in America: Building a Resilient Biomass Supply (, 2.8 ),” in March .\nIn developing the Plan, USDA consulted with public stakeholders — as well as federal partners in the Departments of Defense, Energy, Commerce, and Transportation, as well as the National Science Foundation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency.\nThis plan begins with an assessment of the biomass availability and current uses and includes a detailed analysis of biomass supply chain systems, revealing considerations – climate change, food security, environmental justice, and others – that could affect biomass availability. Finally, the Plan presents recommendations for programs, research, development, and demonstration, and policies that could increase biomass availability, build supply chain systems resilience, and expand the use of domestic biomass within the bioeconomy.\nAlongside the Plan, USDA released an Implementation Framework (, 196 ) that identifies actions USDA will take in the next year to increase the resiliency of the biomass supply chain.\nThe National Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative\nThe Biden-Harris Administration launched the National Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative, informed by a September Executive Order, to advance American biotechnology and biomanufacturing in health, climate change, energy, food security, agriculture, supply chain resilience, and national and economic security. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is working with agencies across the federal government on and strategies on strengthening America’s bioeconomy, and supporting the nation’s innovation ecosystem. OSTP has released a new report, co-authored by USDA, called Harnessing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Research and Development (R&D) to Further Societal Goals (, 2.4 ). The report outlines a vision for what is possible with the power of biotechnology and biomanufacturing, and R&D needs to achieve this ambitious vision.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research portfolio. \nAmericans love, love, love their spuds:  In , per capita consumption of potatoes in the U.S. hit almost 114 pounds, according to USDA’s Economic Research Service. One of our favorite ways to dish up this versatile veggie is in the form of French fries.\nOf course, deep-frying those potato slices to golden crispness adds extra calories from the oil.  But what if you could indulge your French fry craving with fewer calories? And what if the technique to achieve that was more environmentally friendly than conventional fry preparation?\nThat’s not just some chef’s pipe dream; the scientists of the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) have cooked up a way to do it.\nAfter the potatoes are peeled and sliced into strips, but before they’re dunked in the deep-fat fryer, the scientists prep them with three minutes of infrared (IR) heat.  The IR preparation forms a nice, microscopic crust on the fries, which helps reduce their oil uptake.\nIn the ARS experiments, fries that were prepped with three minutes of IR heat at 120 kilowatts per square foot, then deep-fried at about 295 degrees Fahrenheit for seven minutes, had 37.1 percent less oil than fresh-cut fries that didn’t get the IR treatment.\nAs for the flavor of the finished product, more than half of 77 volunteer taste-testers said they found the taste and color of the IR-prepped fries to be no different from conventionally prepared fries.  More than half of the panelists said they preferred the IR fries’ extra crispness.\nFries prepped with infrared heat before frying have less fat than conventionally prepared fries, ARS scientists have shown.\nThe IR process is also suitable for fries that are partially processed at a potato processing plant, then frozen and shipped for later “finish-frying.”  Those fries are typically blanched with hot water or steam to inactivate enzymes in the spuds that might otherwise cause undesirable browning.\nThe IR heating blanches the potato strips and gets rid of the unwanted enzymes without using water.  That eliminates the need to air-dry the strips, so processors who opt for the IR method could reduce their water use and maybe their energy bills, too.\nThat means the IR fries could be good news for potato processors, the environment—and our waistlines!\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n ARS\n ERS\n potatoes\n Science Tuesday",

Chambers, Office of Communication, and Michael Fracasso, Minerals and Geology Management, U.S. Forest Service in\n Forestry\n Apr 05, \nA Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth found by Barb Beasley during a Passport in Time excavation in the Late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation on the Custer National Forest in South Dakota on June 22, . Unlike mammals that only possess two sets of teeth during their lifetime, dinosaurs replaced worn teeth by shedding them continuously throughout their lives. A single Tyrannosaurus may have shed hundreds or even thousands of teeth during its lifetime. U.S. Forest Service photo by Rhonda Fore.\nThe big female sniffed at the dry Late Cretaceous air as she trotted – delicately, considering her 7-ton frame – along a game trail through a stand of towering conifers, whose needled lower branches trembled slightly at her passing.\nTiny mammals scurried in the underbrush of magnificent ferns and little blue flowers. A small flock of red birds rose from the scant cover of a magnolia as the dinosaur passed, their calls carried on the wind, sending other distant flocks to flight in this corner of what is today the Custer National Forest in South Dakota.\nThe Tyrannosaurus rex in her prime was the undisputed queen of her forest. Pausing to sniff the breeze, her nostrils flared as she determined that the rotting carcass she’d been tracking all morning was close now. She continued on toward the river – in just a few more miles she would find the delicious remains of an Edmontosaurus.\nAs she ate, her jaws rending tendon and bone with more than 5 tons of pressure on the dead duck-billed dinosaur’s thigh, several of her teeth – built like a cross between a steak knife and a railroad spike – broke loose and came to rest along the debris-strewn shore of the river.\nSoon after that driving rains flooded the riverbed and washed the teeth and other bones downstream where they separated and settled out onto sandy point bars forming at bends in the river. There, they were covered more and more deeply through succeeding years in sediments laid down by floods, volcanism and the dust of ages.\nAs millennia passed, the strata above piled higher and the organic material in the teeth and bones was slowly replaced by minerals. The sand that surrounded them became cemented to form a rocky matrix known today as the Hell Creek Formation. The cycads and conifers of the Late Cretaceous gave way to new trees, birds, flowers and mammals. Species evolved and disappeared, leaving imprints of their own in the strata above the dinosaur remains.\nMillions more years of wind and rain then began to erode the stone away, finally exposing a time-blackened tooth to sunlight for the first time in 66 million years. That’s how one of those new mammals, a Homo sapiens, who happened to work for the U.S. Forest Service, came to find it.\nBarbara Beasley, regional paleontologist, was leading a crew of 20 volunteers when she found the tooth just a few inches away from where she had been swinging an awl moments before.\n“These teeth are so rare, at first you aren’t totally sure it’s what you’ve found,” said Beasley. “Then once you pick it up, you’re just in awe. It’s a real adrenaline-pumping moment.”\nTyrannosaurus Rex skeleton is on display in the Dinosaurs hall at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. Smithsonian photo by John Gibbons.\nA local 4-H group was visiting the dig site, and the kids clambered to touch the serrations, a visceral connection to an ancient world and the some of the wonder that can be found on the national forests and grasslands.\nFossils of various types have been found on nearly two-thirds of Forest Service lands, most notably in the western United States. Beasley and her colleague Bruce Schumacher have been coordinating volunteer-staffed Passport in Time paleontological excavations to conserve fossil resources in various locations in Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Nebraska and Colorado since .\n“For a lot of volunteers, working on a dig is a dream-come-true,” said Beasley. “One of the best parts of working for the Forest Service is getting to provide these sorts of opportunities – our volunteers have been 10-year-old kids with their parents, all the way up to people in their 80s.”\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Custer National Forest\n Forestry\n FS\n South Carolina",

When they decided to participate in the 4-H market steer project they contacted the Winchester Farm Service Agency (FSA) office about a youth loan.  After receiving the loan, each purchased a market steer to show in 4-H shows in the area and the nearby county fair. Their plan is to market and sell the steers this summer and save the profit for college. Rebecca’s father, Wade Hatcher, is sponsoring both steers at his farm.\nRebecca Hatcher and Jake Broadway got their first taste of the cattle business through an FSA Youth Loan. \nRebecca had three years of FSA Youth Loans for the 4-H Market Swine program in Florida before relocating to Tennessee where her family purchased a farm. Although this will be Jake’s first experience entering the market steer project, he has three years of farming experience helping his uncle with chickens and working with his dad, Jeffery Broadway, performing daily farm chores.\nThe market steer project is designed to give the applicant a sense of responsibility and instill a love for cattle as well as an appreciation for the importance of the individual’s role in agriculture and society. Participation in this project was made possible when Rebecca and Jake each applied for and received a FSA Youth Loan through the Farm Service Agency.

According to USDA’s Cost of Raising a Child report, the answer for a child born in is $241,080 for food, shelter and other necessities over the next 17 years, which translates to about $301,970 when adjusted for inflation!\nSpeaking as a father and a grandfather, I know how much we as parents want to give our children the tools they need to excel at anything they set their minds to—from the essentials, like a roof over their heads and a quality education, to the fun stuff, like a brand new soccer ball, piano lessons or a trip to summer camp. We work hard to ensure our children’s future happiness and success each and every day.\nBut this next generation faces a unique challenge that threatens their future health and well being: a growing health crisis, in the form of diet- and obesity-related diseases. And despite encouraging recent on declining rates of early childhood obesity, nearly a third of our nation's young people are at risk for preventable diseases like type-2 diabetes and heart disease. Preventable diseases have serious consequences – which is why health experts tell us that our current generation of children may well have a shorter lifespan than their parents.\nIn light of this, perhaps the most important leg up we can give to our children is a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, whole grains and other nutrients they need to grow up healthy and strong.\nWe at USDA have been doing our part by making it a top priority to improve child nutrition and provide science-based nutrition information and advice so that the healthy choice is the easy choice for American parents and children. Thirty two million American students now have healthier and more nutritious school breakfasts, lunches and snacks due to improved nutrition standards implemented as a result of the historic Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of . And parents and teachers can use the resources at ChooseMyPlate.gov to access quick, easy reference tools to facilitate healthy eating on a budget for parents, teachers, healthcare professionals and communities.\nFor new parents or people thinking of expanding their families, our Cost of Raising a Child calculator allows you to tailor your results based on household size, income, and geographic region to get a more accurate estimate of your expected costs.

This competitive prize, open to teams of architects, engineers, and developers, will showcase the architectural and commercial viability of advanced wood products like Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) in tall buildings.\nAdvanced wood products are becoming the latest innovation in tall building construction. Products like CLT are flexible, strong, and fire resistant. In construction, wood products can be used as a successful and sustainable alternative to concrete, masonry, and steel. Using wood also reduces greenhouse gas emissions by storing carbon and simultaneously offsetting emissions from conventional building materials.

Kids of all ages will dig up lessons in school gardens, visit farms, harvest pumpkins, and don hair nets for tours of processing facilities. Science teachers – and English, math, and social studies instructors, too – will use food and agriculture as a tool in their classrooms, so that lessons about the importance of healthy eating permeate the school learning environment.\nAn investment in the health of America’s students through Farm to School is also an investment in the farmers and ranchers who grow the food and an investment in the health of local economies. In school year -, schools purchased $386 million in local food from farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and food processors and manufacturers. And an impressive 56 percent of school districts report that they will buy even more local foods in future school years. Farm to school programs exist in every state in the country.\nFor example, the Lake County Community Development Corporation in Ronan, Montana a 40 percent increase in revenues to farmers based on school sales alone. The Southwest Georgia Project, a community development non-profit, notes that “We’re actually seeing our farmers have hope. The farm to school program allows them to see an opportunity for a sustainable living for themselves and their families.” Testimonials in a USDA video released this week highlight the degree to which farm to school programs support healthy eating behaviors among children and provide positive economic impacts to local communities.\nStrengthening local food systems is one of the four pillars of USDA's commitment to rural economic development, and Farm to School programs can play an important role. To support the expansion of Farm to School programs into more schools and expand opportunity for farmers and ranchers, USDA offers grants, training, and technical assistance. Since the start of our Farm to School Grant Program in fiscal year , for example, USDA has awarded grants to 139 projects spanning 46 states and the District of Columbia, serving more than 16,200 schools and 4.55 million students, nearly 43% of whom live in rural communities.\nJust this week, I visited the George Washington Carver Elementary School in Richmond, Virginia and the Virginia State Fair to announce more than $52 million in new USDA grants nationwide to support the development of the local, regional and organic food sectors. You can learn more about USDA’s investments at www.usda.gov/results.\nAt USDA we’re transforming school food and creating a healthier next generation. We’re happy to celebrate in October, but we’re going to be cheering for schools with farm to school programs all year long. When students have experiences such as tending a school garden or visiting a farm, they’re more likely to make healthy choices in the cafeteria. I see the change every time I visit a cafeteria; students light up when meeting their farmer. They are piling their trays full of healthy foods, they are learning healthy habits that they will carry with them for life, and they are learning an appreciation for the American farmer that they will carry with them their entire lives.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n Farm Bill\n Farm to School\n Farm to School Census\n Farmers\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n Georgia\n HealthierNextGen\n KYF2\n Montana\n Nutrition\n Ranchers\n Rural Economy\n school meals\n Secretary's Column\n Tom Vilsack\n Virginia\n Washington DC",

The association is dedicated to the health and well-being of infants, children, adolescents and young adults. In honor of National Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program Breastfeeding Week, Dr. Joan Younger Meek discusses the benefits of breastfeeding and the role WIC plays in supporting mothers and newborns.\nBy Joan Younger Meek, MD, MS, RD, IBCLC, FAAP, Chair, American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Breastfeeding\nBreastfeeding is the most beneficial way a mother can nourish her baby. Breastfed infants have reduced risk of infections, asthma, obesity, diabetes, certain childhood cancers, and SIDS, compared with formula fed infants. In addition to its nutritional benefits, breastfeeding supports the baby’s developing immune system and helps to protect against respiratory and intestinal infections.  This is especially important for babies born prematurely. Breastfeeding may be linked to lower obesity rates in adolescence and adulthood. And the benefits extend to mothers as well—breastfeeding moms have a reduced risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, heart disease, and postpartum depression compared to mothers who don't breastfeed. These are just some of the reasons why the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends mothers exclusively breastfeed for about the first six months, and to continue doing so as other foods are introduced, for 1 year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infant.\nOne of the most powerful programs to support breastfeeding is WIC, the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. In existence for 40 years, WIC serves more than 8 million pregnant women, infants and children, including more than half of all infants born in the United States. WIC provides nutritious foods, nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and referrals to health care and social services for millions of low-income women, their infants, and young children who are determined to be nutritionally at-risk.\nAmong the ways WIC helps promote breastfeeding is through its peer counseling program, where women receive support and counseling on how to initiate breastfeeding from trained peer counselors, many of whom were former WIC participants themselves. WIC also provides lactation consultants, classes and support groups, education materials and hotlines for questions. These support systems work; the rates of women who initiate breastfeeding in WIC have risen dramatically from 44.5% in to 67.1% in , higher rates than non-WIC participants. Additionally, WIC provides breastfeeding mothers with a larger and more varied food package, and to encourage mothers to begin breastfeeding, WIC no longer routinely provides formula for the first month after birth.\nAs we celebrate the benefits of breastfeeding and WIC’s role encouraging breastfeeding, we must also make sure that WIC has the support it needs to continue providing children the best possible start in life. That means increasing the federal investment in the breastfeeding peer counseling program. That also means maintaining the parts of WIC that work best—its evidence-based food packages, its adjunctive eligibility with Medicaid, and its vital link with the health care system — and making improvements to strengthen its reach, like allowing states to extend eligibility through age 6 and streamlining enrollment.\nAs a pediatrician, I have the benefit of seeing the importance of WIC firsthand, in the new mother who is able to meet her breastfeeding goals through the support of a peer counselor or in the healthy toddler whose mother can provide more fruits and vegetables to enrich her diet. I am proud to celebrate National WIC Breastfeeding Week by recognizing the many ways WIC helps families to ensure that their babies get the healthiest possible start in life.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Breastfeeding\n children\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n Nutrition\n WIC\n women",

Connecting rural to urban, farmer to consumer, and fresh ingredients to our diets, farmers markets are becoming economic and community centerpieces in cities and towns across the U.S.\nOver the weekend, I had the opportunity to kick off National Farmers Market Week at a wonderfully diverse and thriving market—the Columbia Heights Community Marketplace in Washington, DC.  Columbia Heights represents what I envision many farmers markets are like– a market with a deep sense of community that provides local residents with access to fresh, locally produced fruit, vegetables, meats, baked goods, and much more.  It’s also a place where neighbor meets neighbor, and the many benefits of having a farmers market nearby are felt throughout the community.\nWhen food is produced, processed, distributed and sold all within the same region, more money stays in the local economy.  This leads to economic development and job creation.  Farmers markets provide opportunities for small farmers and businesses to sell their products, and they help meet the growing demand for locally produced food.  Being able to quickly and directly market to the consumer gives farmers important income opportunities without the added costs of shipping, storage and inventory control.\nAnother growing feature for markets across that nation is the acceptance of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Women, Infants and Children (WIC) benefits.  By accepting SNAP benefits, farmers markets are providing access to a wide variety of fresh, healthy products.  In fact, in over $16 million in SNAP redemptions were made at farmers markets across the country!\nBeyond the economic and business benefits, farmers markets give communities across the country access to fresh, healthy foods, especially in urban and rural areas where shopping options may be limited.  What began as a business necessity for many small farmers has evolved into a social event for entire communities, with many families and patrons viewing a trip to the Saturday morning market as the start of their social weekend. As markets grow, new features like live music, cooking demonstrations, gardening tips and educational opportunities are added.  Businesses that surround farmers markets also benefit from the additional foot traffic that the market brings.\nAs of today, there are over 8,000 markets listed in our National Farmers Market Directory, demonstrating the continued demand for these community-oriented markets and the many contributions they make to their local economies. I hope you’ll join us in celebrating them all during National Farmers Market Week.\nVisit and support your local farmers market or find a new one to visit. Try new foods and enjoy the wonderful, fresh produce offered. Watch as your children learn more about the food they eat and where it comes from.  And reconnect with your local farmers, vendors, neighbors and community.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n AMS\n DC.\n National Farmers Market Week\n SNAP\n Washington\n WIC",

        "content": "Introduction:\nThe Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) is an annual organizational climate survey administered by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that assesses how employees jointly experience policies, practices, and procedures characteristic of their agency and its leadership.  It offers insight into whether, and to what extent, workplace conditions characteristic of successful organizations are present at their organization by tracking employee perceptions in many critical areas including workplace experience, agency leadership, and employee engagement, among other things. At an agency-wide level, FEVS is an important tool for USDA to assess the success of improvement initiatives, identify aspects for workplace improvements, and shape human resource policies and programs. \nAdditional information about the FEVS can be found on the OPM website.\nOPM administered the FEVS to all non-political, full-time, part-time, permanent, and intermittent Federal employees onboard as of November . \nPer the Annual Employee Survey (AES) regulations (5 CFR Part 250; Subpart C - Employee Surveys), USDA is posting our FEVS results. This brief provides an assessment of the results and highlights our employee engagement improvement strategy.\nInterpretation of USDA’s Results:\nThe OPM FEVS was conducted at USDA for 8 weeks starting the week of May 8th and closing on July 7th. OPM sent a survey invitation to 84,437 eligible USDA employees, of which, 48,358 employees responded, resulting in a final adjusted response rate of 55.34%. USDA saw a 5% increase in its FEVS final adjusted response rate when compared to (50.06%) – outpacing Very Large Agencies and Government-wide percentages by double digits.\nTable 1: USDA vs. Government-wide FEVS Response Rates\n Fiscal Year\n USDA Response Rate\n 64%\n 55%\n 51%\n 46%\n 46%\n 51%\n 55%\n Government-wide Response Rate\n 46%\n 41%\n 43%\n 44%\n 34%\n 32%\n 39%\n Very Large Agencies\n 41%\n 37%\n 39%\n 41%\n 29%\n 35%\n 35%\nThe OPM FEVS results are reported across five indices: 1) Employee Engagement, 2) Global Satisfaction, 3) Performance Confidence, 4) Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA), and 5) Employee Experience. The Employee Engagement Index consists of three sub-indices: Leaders Lead, Supervisors, and Intrinsic Work Experience. The DEIA index is designed to align with Executive Order 5: Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce and consists of four sub-indices: Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility. The Employee Experience Index is new to the OPM FEVS and measures the extent to which employees are engaged by their work and their organization. This index seeks to understand employees' perceptions relative to their experiences at work in response to their interactions with the organization (i.e., job and organizational attachment). This index gives agencies another tool for assessing whether actions to improve engagement have had the intended effect.\nWhen compared to the prior year's results, USDA’s results indicate an improvement in FEVS scores across all 4 historical indices (Employee Engagement, Global Satisfaction, Performance Confidence, and DEIA). Notably, the results show a substantial increase in the Global Satisfaction Index (60.71%), which increased by 1.86% compared to the score (58.85%). The Leaders Lead sub-index (59.05%) continues to be the lowest-scoring Employee Engagement sub-index. However, the results show a significant improvement in the sub-index score, which increased by 3.65% compared to the score (56.41%). Although the score remains below the 65% positive response rate strength threshold, USDA is trending in the right direction. Conversely, the Supervisors sub-index (82.09%) was the highest-scoring Employee Engagement sub-index.\nThe following tables show USDA’s through FEVS results across all five key indices, including an analysis of how USDA performed compared to Government-wide and Very Large Agencies’ results.\nTable 2: USDA FEVS Index Scores (—)\n FEVS Indices\n Global Satisfaction\n 67%\n 62%\n 60%\n 64%\n 59%\n 59%\n 61%\n Employee Engagement: Overall\n 68%\n 65%\n 65%\n 69%\n 70%\n 70%\n 72%\n Employee Engagement: Leaders Lead\n 54%\n 49%\n 49%\n 55%\n 55%\n 56%\n 59%\n Employee Engagement: Supervisors\n 77%\n 77%\n 76%\n 79%\n 82%\n 82%\n 82%\n Employee Engagement: Intrinsic Work Experience\n 73%\n 71%\n 70%\n 74%\n 73%\n 73%\n 74%\n Performance Confidence\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n 86%\n 84%\n 85%\n Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA):\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n 71%\n 73%\n DEIA: Diversity\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n 75%\n 75%\n DEIA: Equity\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n 67%\n 69%\n DEIA: Inclusion\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n 76%\n 77%\n DEIA: Accessibility\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n 68%\n 71%\n Employee Experience\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n N/A\n 74%\nTable 3:  FEVS Indices Results Compared to Government-wide and Very Large Agencies\n FEVS Indices\n USDA\n Very Large Agencies\n Government-wide\n Global Satisfaction \n 61%\n 63%\n 64%\n Employee Engagement: Overall \n 72%\n 71%\n 72%\n Employee Engagement: Leaders Lead \n 59%\n 61%\n 61%\n Employee Engagement: Supervisors\n 82%\n 80%\n 80%\n Employee Engagement: Intrinsic Work Experience \n 74%\n 74%\n 74%\n Performance Confidence\n 85%\n 83%\n 84%\n Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA):\n 73%\n 70%\n 71%\n DEIA: Diversity\n 75%\n 71%\n 71%\n DEIA: Equity\n 69%\n 66%\n 67%\n DEIA: Inclusion\n 77%\n 76%\n 76%\n DEIA: Accessibility\n 71%\n 69%\n 69%\n Employee Experience\n 74%\n 73%\n 73%\nThe FEVS results, paired with the employee feedback collected throughout various USDA employee engagement events over the past year, provide us with critical employee experience insights that are shaping USDA’s short- and long-term employee engagement strategy and initiatives.\nUSDA FEVS Results (, 15.5 )\nUSDA’s Employee Engagement Improvement Strategy:\nUSDA’s Office of Human Resources Management (OHRM) leads USDA’s FEVS improvement efforts.

Click to view a larger version.\nFood is a great equalizer.  Whether sharing it with loved ones around our holiday table or worrying about how we’re going to fit lunch in to our busy work days--food is something we all have in common.  But we don’t always think about the path it takes to get to our plates or even the store shelves.  And while there are many different ways it gets to us, we’re seeing food hubs play an increasingly important role for everyone along the way--farmer to corner store, chef to school lunch.\nFood hubs are innovative business models emerging more and more across the country. They bring farmers and suppliers together, with 81 percent of food hubs focusing on increasing opportunities for local farms and allowing smaller producers to pool their products and fulfill larger contracts. Ninety-one percent of food hubs are near cities, connecting rural farmers to larger suburban and urban communities.  Oftentimes, farmers who work with food hubs offer a wider variety of products and are able to continue selling their goods later into the growing season.  That translated into an average of over $3.7 million in sales in the last year.  And USDA’s efforts have helped expand the number of regional food hubs operating around the country.  There are over 230, a 65 percent increase since .\nSeventy-six percent of food hubs work almost exclusively with small-to-mid-sized growers. Without that support, many of these farmers would not have enough capital to own their own trucks, refrigeration units or warehouse space. By working together through the food hubs, they support each other while building their business.  It’s a recipe for financial success that helps sustain the local community in a major way. USDA’s Regional Food Hub Resource Guide, released by the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) in , gives lot of good information on food hubs and how they support the growth and development of regional food systems.\nFor many food hub participants, there’s an understanding that the growth of their business can be tied to the improving health of their local community.  And they take the opportunity to put that belief into practice.  For example, 75 percent donate food to hunger relief organizations and food banks.  Forty-seven percent offer cooking and nutrition education within the community.  And 52 percent believe that supporting area farmers is their primary mission.  They also contribute to their state’s economic bottom line, returning 55 to 95 percent of their spending locally through bank services, employee benefits, supplies and utilities.\nThat’s not to say that there aren’t some challenges.  Like any modern business, food hubs face some common challenges.  Managing smart growth while balancing supply and demand is a tough line to walk.  Part of that includes increasing staff when needed and securing enough product.  But the entrepreneurial spirit that sustains the innovation of most food hubs is a great foundation to work from to better address these challenges.\nFood hubs are helping producers of all sizes grow and thrive, which in turn supports the economic health and well-being of our diverse local communities. USDA is a proud supporter of food hubs and other players in the local food effort.  We’re committed to understanding this model, how they serve communities and how we can help them continue to succeed.\nTo help show the rapid growth of the local food market across the nation, USDA created the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass – an online tool illustrating the many places USDA has supported these opportunities nationwide.\nIn addition to creating a food hub portal, that includes a collection of research news and information, AMS released its report: Moving Food Along the Value Chain: Innovations in Regional Food Distribution report.  The report provides information on how producers can tap into the growing commercial demand for local and regional food, create additional economic opportunities and expand access to healthy food. You can also delve deeper into the food hub facts and figures cited in this blog and our infographic by reading the survey results published by Michigan State University.\nThe growth of our local markets also has an impact on folks who are new to the business of agriculture. As the average age of the American farmer increases, we need more new folks on the farm. Local and regional markets help these new farmers – who include returning veterans, immigrants and more women than ever before – get started and sell their product.\nUSDA intends to continue our record support for food hubs and other regional and local food systems and we’re committed to programs that serve all Americans. Whether it’s through offering loans, engaging industry leaders in policy discussions or helping open doors to new business opportunities, our goal is to make sure that we support all of U.S. agriculture. But to do so, we need a Food, Farm and Jobs Bill as soon as possible. A new Farm Bill would enable our continued efforts to expand farmers markets and food hubs, while expanding healthy food access for low-income Americans and kids in our schools. All of these efforts would benefit the rural economy, while helping to achieve new opportunity in agriculture in the years to come.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n AMS\n Beginning Farmers\n beginning ranchers\n business\n community health\n economic opportunity\n Farm Bill\n Farmers\n Farmers Markets\n food access\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n Food Hubs\n KYF2\n KYF2 Compass\n local food\n Producers\n regional food\n Regional Food Hub Resource Guide\n Rural Economy\n small farmers",

In January, in his State of the Union address, President Obama focused on the importance of providing a world-class education to all American youth.  He called on us to out-educate our global competitors so that we keep great jobs here and strengthen the American economy in the long-term.\nFFA is playing an important role in providing that education for hundreds of thousands of America’s young people.\nFFA is providing opportunities for young people to learn about food and agriculture, to help them become community leaders, and to prepare them to compete for the jobs of the 21st century.  It is teaching younger generations how to make informed choices in agriculture and natural resources systems – a skill set that will grow our next generation of farmers. It is preparing students for successful careers in agriculture that stimulate the economy and supply our nation with food, feed and fiber we rely on.\nI am proud to say that in addition to FFA, and other youth organizations like 4H, USDA supports universities that are training the next generation of innovators.  America has an aging farming population, and as the folks running our farm lands grow older, we look toward the future for a group that is ready and able to take over this important sector of the American economy.\nLast month I visited with FFA to talk to the students that comprise this year’s National FFA Officer Team. I challenged them to spend time with their friends and other FFA members to think about what they envision for the future of agriculture.  I told them that USDA was committed to continuing our work in educating the next generation of producers and agricultural professionals.  And I signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to deepen USDA’s involvement with FFA and to supplement its important mission.\nAt the end of the day, we need to cultivate a community of young people who pursue a future in agriculture so together we can revitalize not only rural America, but the country as a whole.

For example, ARS research includes understanding how common production practices might impact antimicrobial resistance and understanding whether certain animal pathogens may be a public health concern. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one bacteria type that is a public health concern because of its resistance to some antibiotics which can make it difficult to treat. MRSA has been found in livestock – mainly in swine. One particular MRSA strain, called ST5, has raised additional public health concerns because it is a major cause of human infections globally.\nTo address these public health concerns, ARS conducted research to determine whether production practices like using in-feed zinc as an antidiarrheal agent contribute to the emergence and spread of MRSA in U.S. swine populations, and if ST5 bacterial isolates from swine and from humans are genetically related.\nARS demonstrated that applying zinc in feed does not play a role in the prevalence of livestock-associated MRSA ST5 in the U.S. swine population. More importantly, ARS found that ST5 isolates from agricultural sources are genetically distinct and separate from clinical MRSA ST5 isolates obtained from human clinical settings. Specifically, isolates from agricultural sources were found to be extremely similar to each other within farms and lacked genes typically carried by human isolates. Collectively, ARS indicate that livestock-associated MRSA and clinical MRSA ST5 isolates are genetically distinct and transmission and/or genetic exchange between them is not currently occurring based on the findings in this study.\nARS researchers are continuing to build on these results to further determine the distribution and impact of livestock-associated-MRSA ST5 outside of the livestock setting. As we celebrate World Antibiotic Awareness Week, we remain committed to a “One-Health” approach to prevent, not just react to, complex public and animal health issues. The information gained from these studies is important to our overall understanding of animal pathogens, and any potential risks to public health.\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Health and Safety\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Agricultural Research Service\n ARS\n Animals\n One Health\n World Antibiotics Awareness Week\n antibiotics\n Livestock",

NRCS photo by Gene Barickman.\nNo matter where you grew up, you are likely familiar with monarch butterflies. You may have childhood memories from science class when you watched those peculiar green caterpillars transform into beautiful butterflies. Depending on where you live, you may have seen masses of their orange-and-black wings fluttering in the sky while the butterflies were on their annual cross-country migratory journey.\nToday, the iconic monarch butterfly is under pressure. Habitat loss has led to a steady decrease in their numbers.\nWe’re working to reverse that trend. This year, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is launching a targeted effort in ten key states to create and enhance habitat for the iconic monarch on private lands. Through this effort, we’re partnering with farmers and ranchers to voluntarily establish habitat for the monarch on working lands while ensuring America’s farms and ranches stay productive.\nBecause monarch butterflies are often on the move, they need to have the right plants at the right time along their migration route, including milkweed, which is the sole food source for monarch caterpillars. We worked with butterfly experts across the United States to choose the best plant species for monarchs based on geographic location and value to monarchs.\nWe’re focusing efforts in the southern Great Plains and Midwest – two regions at the heart of the monarch’s migration. In the southern Great Plains, our work will focus on rangelands and ways to improve the health of pastures so they provide good forage for livestock and food for monarchs. In the Midwest we’re focusing on integrating plantings into croplands and making improvements to wetland areas.\nWe’re looking for private landowners in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas and Wisconsin who are interested in making monarch-friendly improvements to their land. These efforts not only benefit butterflies, they also strengthen agricultural operations, support other beneficial insects and wildlife and improve our natural resources.\nWhen we designed this effort, we pulled together a variety of tools from the Farm Bill toolbox. In fiscal year , we’re making available $2 million through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and $2 million through the former Wetlands Reserve Program for existing wetland easements. Additionally, we created new enhancements through the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) to establish monarch habitat. The CSP enhancement assistance is available nationwide.\nWe’re also working with the broader federal family on this effort. NRCS’ effort contributes to a multi-agency, international strategy to reverse the monarch’s population decline in North America. The Obama administration, through the National Strategy to Protect Pollinators and Their Habitat, has a goal of increasing the eastern population of monarchs to 225 million by .\nLearn more about the Monarch Butterfly Habitat Development Project and other pollinators. Visit your local USDA service center to learn more about how you can help monarch butterflies on private lands that you own or manage.\nFor more on other technical assistance and financial resources available through NRCS conservation programs visit www.nrcs.usda.gov/GetStarted or your local USDA service center.\nMilkweed grows along a roadside in Michigan.

Only plants found in this country before European settlement are considered to be native to the United States.\nThere are many benefits of landscaping and gardening with native plants including conserving water, protecting soil from erosion, and creating habitat and providing food for many different animals including birds, pollinators, and small mammals. Simply by growing native plants gardeners can bring enormous beauty to a community and joy to its residents. In addition, native plants are easy-to-grow and require minimal maintenance.\nFall is widely considered the best time of year to plant native trees, shrubs, grasses, vines and perennials.\nLearn more\n Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center Native Plant Database\n USDA PLANTS Database\n Landscaping with Native Plants (NRCS)\n Gardening with Wildflowers (U.S. Forest Service)",

But despite strong demand for its products, it took a USDA program to make Lou’s sausage available outside Ohio.\nIn , Ohio was the first state to join USDA’s Cooperative Interstate Shipment program (CIS).  The program, authorized under the Farm Bill, allows inspected and approved small state-inspected meat processors, like Lou's Gourmet Sausage, to bear an official USDA Mark of Inspection and ship meat and poultry across state lines. Previously, only products from federally inspected plants could be sold in other states. To participate in the program, state certified plants like Lou's Sausage work with USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) to integrate their systems to meet federal inspection standards.  Once inspected and approved for compliance, these smaller plants can ship across state lines and are poised for bigger market opportunities.\nThis week, Indiana followed Ohio's lead and joined North Dakota and Wisconsin to become the fourth state to participate in the Cooperative Interstate Shipment program. Each time a state works with FSIS to participate in the program, it is expanding market opportunities for the region's small meat and poultry producers – many smaller producers process their animals at small state-inspected plants – while strengthening state and local economies and increasing consumer access to safe, locally-produced meat. In Indiana, it will mean that meat processed by selected smaller operations will be available beyond the Hoosier state.\nInterstate shipment may not sound like a local food issue, but CIS actually has important implications for local food producers and consumers – especially when one state has a major market right across its border, as is the case with southern Wisconsin and Chicago. Implementing CIS is part of USDA's broader strategy to strengthen local and regional food systems and to help small and midsize producers access new market opportunities. USDA coordinates its work on these issues under the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative, which includes a variety of resources to help producers and businesses tap into consumer demand for local foods. One such resource, a guide called Tools for Small and Midsized Livestock and Poultry; USDA Resources for Producers and Processors, was released in March as part of a wider package of support for America's small and mid-sized farmers and ranchers.\nFSIS' Small Plant Help Desk, a customer service phone line at 1-877-FSIShelp, is also a valuable resource for small and midsize meat and poultry plants and can address issues and answer questions specific to smaller meat processors. The Small Plant Help Desk has fielded over 10,000 inquiries since .\nFor businesses like Lou's Gourmet Sausage, USDA’s commitment to local food and to small and midsize producers is epitomized by efforts such as the Cooperative Interstate Shipment program and the Small Plant Help Desk. With these resources and opportunities, small processors are accessing new markets – and consumers are happily digging in.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n Farm Bill\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n Food Safety\n FSIS\n Indiana\n KYF2\n Local and Regional Foods\n Meat and Poultry\n North Dakota\n Ohio\n Producers\n small farmers\n Small Plant Help Desk\n small producer\n Wisconsin",

By remaining connected to both customers in the field and to regional and national government leaders, the on-the-ground knowledge of customer needs can much more quickly drive needed changes in policies and procedures that make USDA’s programs more accessible to the American public.\nThese tools also make it possible for employees to more effectively work outside the normal office environment. Increasingly, employees are “tele-working” on a regular basis, which drives down the cost of government facilities leases and transit subsidies, and also enables managers and employees to continue their service during inclement weather conditions that force government offices to close.\nJust a few of the innovative tools in use today at USDA include:\nYour Two Cents, an online platform developed by USDA to serve as a virtual space for employees to talk about innovative solutions to difficult challenges, leading to the increased efficiency and effectiveness of program processes. Your Two Cents and other USDA sites like it are enabling leaders to better harness the collective experience of employees, and to foster an exchange of knowledge between co-workers who might not otherwise have had the opportunity.\nUSDA Connect is a collaboration tool available to all USDA employees. Equipped with powerful social networking capabilities, it enables teams to work collaboratively on projects, regardless of location. When employees in the field work virtually with colleagues, they are better stewards of taxpayer dollars, saving on travel without sacrificing the ability to share knowledge in the pursuit of innovative solutions.\nAgLearn, a virtual university for USDA’s employees, is a low cost, one-stop shop for employee development and training that can be accessed from anywhere in the world. Employees are encouraged to set individual development goals and to take advantage of the more than courses, 20,000 professional development books, and hundreds of videos that are available at a cost of less than 10 dollars per employee per year.\nThese and many other innovative tools helped develop the modern USDA for a stronger rural America.

The 28-year old organic pioneer is proud of her venture and credits USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) as a key component to her success.\nLawrence approached NRCS several years ago to start the process of making her farm organic. NRCS helped her plan and implement a nutrient management program and address irrigation issues on both a two-acre vegetable-and-flower plot and a 25-acre field where she grows a mix of cover crops like wheat and clover.\nNRCS provided assistance to Lawrence through two Farm Bill programs. The Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) Organic Initiative is a nationwide special effort to provide financial assistance to National Organic Program (NOP) certified organic producers, as well as producers in the process of transitioning to organic production. And the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP) is a cooperative program to improve irrigation efficiency and reduce energy consumption.\nDrip irrigation system made possible by the NRCS Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP).\nLawrence is especially pleased with the newly installed drip irrigation system that supplies water to more than 100 varieties of produce and a colorful assortment of flowers on her two-acre parcel.\n“I could not have afforded or done that by myself,” she explains.\nTo be certified organic, a U.S. agricultural operation has to be approved by a USDA Accredited Certifying Agent. Applicants must comply with USDA Organic regulations and submit documentation on their property and farming practices.\nTransitioning to organic is often a lengthy process, as Lawrence knows. Fields may require preparation to support organic production, including the planting of cover crops, incorporating compost and other soil-enhancing practices.\nWhile it takes a while to transition an operation to a Certified Organic one, Lawrence is pleased with her progress. The market for fresh, locally grown food continues to expand in Central Oregon, and her customers include a local hospital, schools and restaurants.\nOver 100 different types produce are grown on this two-acre organic operation, ranging from beets and beans to cabbage and strawberries.\nShe has also generated a new, dedicated client base through community supported agriculture (CSA). CSA is a way for consumers to directly invest in local farms and receive a regular delivery of fresh fruits, vegetables and other local products.\nLawrence looks forward to a bright, rewarding and sustainable future.\nFind out more about the EQIP Organic Initiative.\nCheck out more conservation stories on the USDA blog.\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n AWEP\n Conservation\n EQIP\n National Organic Program\n NRCS",

Her is used to develop the necessary forest prescriptions to treat stand structures to meet the forest’s land management objectives including activities such as timber sales or herbicide treatments.\nChristina Harper, a new forester on the Bienville National Forest in Mississippi, has travelled a busy road from a special student training program to a full-time U.S. Forest Service employee.\nHarper graduated from the Student Career Experience Program, which provides work experience directly related to students’ academic programs or career goals. The program exposes students to public service while enhancing their educational goals.\nDuring her first summer in the Student Career Experience Program in , she performed interpretation and naturalist duties for the U.S. Forest Service at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitors Center in Juneau, Alaska.\n“I was definitely out of my normal element, both geographically and professionally,” said Harper. “The experience demanded understanding customer-service responsibilities that were different from my forestry training skills and gave me a different outlook from my city-girl perspective on connecting with nature.”\nHarper started her college education at Florida A&M University and then received a scholarship and transferred to Alabama A&M University, the only historically black college and university with an accredited forestry program.\nShe began working at the Land Between The Lakes National Recreation Area in the summer of . After she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in forest management in , she became a fulltime forester trainee. At Land Between the Lakes, she learned the basic skills a professional forester needs for the job: marking timber, designing a timber sale, building maps, working with other agencies, developing timber appraisals and understanding contracting procedures. She also learned shovel-testing techniques to search for cultural artifacts in historical areas where there might be relics.\n“Because Land Between the Lakes is a small forest, it was an all-hands-on deck environment where every pair of hands was needed to push a project. This meant I got to experience every department so my experience was above and beyond my expectations.”\nIn May , she moved to her prescription forester position on the Bienville National Forest where she is learning the ropes involved in understanding a new landscape comprised of different types of tree species and vegetation.\n“I’m collecting on a predominately pine forest so I can write prescriptions for the kinds of treatments needed for optimum forest health. Is a specific type of thinning needed?  Would timber removal aid restoration? Would an herbicide treatment improve a timber stand? I’m working to enhance the forest condition to its desired condition as part of a management plan.”\nAs Harper  completes her transition to professional forester, she plans to share the training opportunities she has enjoyed and hopes to inspire others.\n“I want to know that the work I do today has no glitches in it so that down the road, the landscapes I’ve worked on will continue to offer the public opportunities that are part of the Forest Service multiple-use mission,” she said.\nHarper was recently spotlighted in Faces of the Forest, a periodic Forest Service web feature which showcases the people, places and professions within the agency.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Bienville National Forest\n Faces of the Forest\n Forestry\n Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area\n Mendenhall Glacier Visitors Center\n Student Career Experience program",

(USDA photo by Scott Bauer)\nFebruary is traditionally a month of celebration for our nation’s  land-grant universities (LGUs) in commemoration of Black History Month. These institutions are historically-black universities that were established in under the Second Morrill Act.  Now, as the month draws to an end, the LGUs are setting their sights on August 30, which marks the 125th anniversary of the Congressional action that created a network of historically black colleges and universities dedicated to providing educational opportunity for all through innovative scientific research and community-minded Extension programs.\n“One of the ways we can best honor black history is by providing a proper foundation to support future achievement. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education and Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future,” said Cathie Woteki, USDA’s Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics.\nToday, there are 19 land-grant universities in 18 states. Central State University in Ohio is the latest LGU, as established under the Farm Bill.\nUSDA’s  National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) administers a number of LGU education grant programs that support projects that strengthen teaching, research, Extension, and facility programs in the food and agricultural sciences.\nThese include:\nThe Institution Teaching, Research, and Extension Capacity Building Grants program that strengthen teaching and research programs in the food and agricultural sciences through cooperative linkages with federal and non-federal entities;\nThe Evans-Allen Research Formula program that supports basic and applied research at the institutions in the food and agricultural sciences;\nThe Extension Formula program that supports Extension education programs that respond to the changing needs of limited resource clientele; and\nThe Facilities Grant program that provides funds for the acquisition and improvement of agricultural and food sciences facilities and equipment, including libraries, so that the institutions may participate fully in the production of human capital in the food and agricultural sciences.\nThe Institution Capacity Building Grants program has been the LGU’s “bread and butter,” according to Dr. Antoine Alston, professor at North Carolina A&T University and third-generation LGU graduate.\n“Both as a student and faculty, I have been able to use NIFA funding to train farmers in Farmer Safety and have taught secondary agricultural Extension personnel about hydroponics technology,” he recalled. The LGUs, he said, are able to take a little and do a lot.\n“Dedicated funding gave the land-grant universities an opportunity to specialize their research,” said McKinley Mayes, former coordinator of College Programs at NIFA’s forerunner agency, the Cooperative State Research Service. “For example, Lincoln University (Mo.) focused their research on human nutrition, Alcorn State University (Miss.) worked on aquaculture, and Fort Valley State University (Ga.) became known for goat research. This provided significant economic benefits for the local communities.”\nNIFA's investment in research, education and Extension is helping to train tomorrow’s agricultural leaders and workers today.  “The institutions are places of cutting-edge research and technology, no doubt, but they also empower limited-resource students and turn them into leaders,” Alston explained. “These are universities in the business of transforming lives.”\nThrough federal funding and leadership for research, education, and Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

The webinar focused on the cute little baby birds known as chicks. Now, I am not a poultry person, but I love eggs, so I thought this would be something interesting to learn.  I found out that raising backyard poultry is a growing trend.  People like to raise chicks into adults for their eggs, and for the entertainment value of having birds in their backyard.\nI didn’t know there were so many rules when it comes to starting a flock. You need to think about why you want to raise backyard birds and what you intend to do with them.  You also need to find out if it is legal where you live - check city and local ordinances and find out if you need a permit.  If you have one, you should also check with your Homeowners Association.   Look to see if inspections or other steps are to start a flock, and be sure to buy chicks from a National Poultry Improvement Plan- approved source to ensure they start out healthy.\nI was surprised to find out that young chicks must be separated from older birds, for them to be secure and safe from disease.  Let chicks grow into birds in a separate, clean environment before introducing them into your flock that contains older birds.\nThere are two major diseases that can threaten backyard birds - Avian Influenza and Exotic Newcastle Disease. The webinar discussed six simple steps to help protect your birds from disease.  We also learned what potential signs of illness might include and what to do if you think your birds might be sick.\nAre you considering raising birds or want some tips for adding to your current flock?  The full webinar is available online, including nutrition tips and other information to help you grow a healthy and happy flock in your own backyard!\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Tags:\n APHIS\n avian influenza\n backyard poultry\n Martin Smeltzer\n webinar",

I am pleased to see the topic of food security getting such attention, as I believe it’s one of the biggest challenges we face now and in the next 50 years. As director of USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), I believe NIFA has a crucial role to play in addressing these challenges.\nWe are facing a “9 billion challenge,” in that the global population is projected to hit 9 billion by the year . This challenge presents what I call wicked problems that require us to find ways to feed, clothe, shelter all people, and meet their energy needs, without wreaking havoc on the environment.\nThe 9 billion challenge also has major implications on the way we fund science at NIFA. We must align our science with the challenges of the day. There are five major areas that are affected by the rising population that must be addressed beginning now: food security and hunger, sustainable energy, food safety, childhood obesity, and climate change.\nThese problems also require us to rethink how we deploy the best science and resources to address the challenges. The federal and state governments, while having a primary and significant role, do not have the monetary and intellectual resources needed to tackle these wicked problems. It’s going to require a renewed and different compact of public/private partnerships. No one entity has the market cornered on dealing with these challenges.\nThe public partners will include local, state, and federal agencies within the United States. The private partners must include the non-governmental organizations, commodity groups, small private sector firms, and the corporate sector. The academic partners will not only include our traditional partners and Land-Grant universities, but will also bring in the entire educational system from K-12 to all public and private universities. Since we are addressing global challenges, we need to crowdsource—leveraging the monetary and intellectual resources of global partners, public or private.\nI’ve only been at NIFA for a little more than a month, but my long career within the Land-Grant university system has demonstrated to me that NIFA serves as a one-stop shop for our nation’s food, agriculture, energy, fiber, shelter needs, and the environment. By making the right investments in science at the right time, NIFA enables the scientific community to make great discoveries that can be turned into innovations to help us meet our future food needs, while promoting jobs and the economy.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Trade\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Dr. Sonny Ramaswamy\n Food security\n Future of Food\n Land Grant universities\n NIFA",

The former President also noted the importance of elevating the status of women in developing countries, educating them, and giving them job opportunities.  He said that agriculture will be at the “vortex” of major global issues.\nThe forum continues through tomorrow.

        "content": "WIC Program Integrity Branch Chief, Food and Nutrition Service in\n Food and Nutrition\n Aug 05, \nFNS has taken a range of steps to ensure the highest level of integrity in WIC.\nFor more than 40 years, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has provided supplemental foods and nutrition services vital to the health and nutrition of vulnerable moms, newborns and young children. And throughout those four decades, we’ve had a long-standing history of working with WIC state agencies to ensure program resources and taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently.\nWhile a study found a relatively low rate of improper vendor payments, (representing less than 1.5 percent of WIC food expenses), FNS has and will continue to intervene when problems arise and to require state agencies to improve the integrity of their programs.\nFNS is vigilant about the integrity of all of its food assistance programs, including WIC. That’s why in , FNS established the Program Integrity and Monitoring Branch to oversee WIC integrity initiatives. This new branch plays a key role in WIC monitoring and oversight and it is paying close attention to vendor management practices to ensure the program pays only fair prices to retailers for WIC foods. It provides technical assistance to address areas of concern and to disseminate information about noteworthy initiatives. The branch also supports electronic benefit transfer (EBT) implementation efforts, which vastly improves integrity by simplifying the benefit transaction for participants and cashiers and improving states’ ability to track prices stores are charging and redemption patterns. \nHere’s a list of some of our steps we’re taking to ensure integrity:\nProviding Direct Technical Assistance\nIn September , FNS completed reviews on vendor management practices in each state with a retail food delivery system, including the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.  FNS is working with state agencies to correct all problems identified through these reviews.\nIn December , FNS launched a process to assess the strength of vendor management practices nationwide.  We’re now developing technical assistance materials on paying competitive prices for supplemental foods to help state agencies improve their vendor management practices. The first set of topic-specific tools are expected by the end of June and rolled out later this year. FNS is also developing a comprehensive Vendor Management Handbook to improve the quality and consistency of vendor oversight activities.\nFNS staff have recently provided web-based program integrity trainings in two priority areas—income eligibility and certification, as well as vendor management.  To date, two vendor management webinars have been presented and several more are in the planning stages. \nAddressing WIC Foods Sold Online\nIn , WIC began working with major social media sites (Amazon, Craigslist, eBay and Facebook) to address the potential online sale of WIC foods.  Amazon strengthened its policies on prohibiting certain types of sales not only for WIC, but also for SNAP, as a direct result of our request.  Craigslist also has policies prohibiting the sale of WIC and SNAP cards or foods and eBay has a warning for sellers that it is a violation of federal law to sell food and infant formula obtained through the WIC Program.  We also wrote to every state agency encouraging them to place the following statement on all WIC checks, EBT cards or their accompanying folders or sleeves:  “Buying or selling WIC benefits is a crime.  To report suspected abuse, call 800-424- or visit www.usda.gov/oig/hotline.htm.”  FNS is continuing its efforts to guard against the potential sale of WIC foods.   \nConducting Research\nWe are conducting a range of studies to help inform future integrity efforts. One study examines EBT to identify an approach to develop high-risk vendor indicators in both the current and future (all-EBT) WIC environments. Another looks at effective methods for establishing vendor groups based on common characteristics that affect food prices, competitive price criteria and allowable reimbursement levels.\nFindings from both studies are expected in and will be used to inform future actions. FNS is committed to working with our partners in the 90 WIC state agencies to use evidence to strengthen the integrity of the program.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n EBT\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n food assistance programs\n Nutrition\n program integrity\n SNAP\n vendor management\n WIC",

Back in the late ’s local blacksmith Joseph Hancock came up with an ingenious solution for celebrating the Fourth of July in the tiny town. The tradition then was for towns to fire their cannons to celebrate Independence Day.\nBut the Town of Taylor was without a cannon. So Hancock offered up two historic anvils and the tradition of “firing the anvil” became an annual event for the town. At dawn every Fourth of July, the Jennings Band members climb onto a flatbed truck and ride up and down the neighborhoods in Taylor, stopping on street corners while the anvil is fired and patriotic music is played for the sleepy residents.\nDecades after Joseph Hancock donated his anvils, descendents of those first settlers continue to farm and ranch in the fertile valley on the Silver Creek. One family, the Salines, have a ranching operation located just outside Taylor.\nAs a young boy Alma Saline would be up early milking cows, fixing fences and harvesting crops. It’s what the family had to do to keep their -acre farm/ranch running.\nSilver Creek Farms is in the Little Colorado River Basin in northeastern Arizona. It was homesteaded by Alma’s grandfather around . About 400 acres of the ranch is in alfalfa hay, silage corn and a little bit of sweet corn and sunflowers. They have black Angus cows pastured in the river bottom and the open range land that spreads across the high plateau.It’s an idyllic life…but not an easy one.\nWhen Alma’s father died in he left the ranch to his family as a trust. Alma assumed the responsibility of managing the assets and the day-to-day operation of the farm.\n“Much of the equipment that Dad left was old,” Alma says. “We had just a minimum of cattle and only 70 acres in crop production.”\nFor the past 11 years, Alma and his family have been building the ranch back into a higher production operation. They now irrigate 230 acres with two center pivots and have an 80 acre field where all waste water is recycled back into the irrigation system. Another 100 acres is irrigated with water from the Silver Creek Irrigation district.\nIn the family drilled an irrigation well, which irrigates about 300 acres. The well requires about 155,00kW of electricity per year to operate.The cost of the electricity to run the well is the single largest expense on the farm.\nAlma and his family had considered alternative energy sources, but the 54KW per hour requirement was too large for a solar-powered system that would be within their budget.\nTwo years ago, in the old tradition of Taylor creative problem solving, the Saline’s neighbors at the Elkins Ranch put in wind-turbines to generate electricity. Alma and his family were intrigued.\nToday, thanks in part to a $53,000 Renewable Energy for America Program grant from USDA Rural Development, the Salines have installed a 155,000kW Vestus V-19 wind turbine. The unit is expected to generate all of the electricity needed to run the well…and maybe a little extra to hedge against the rising cost of electricity.\nThe ranch has a contract with the local utility company to “net meter”—feed power into the utility grid during production months and use power as needed in the off-wind summer months. “At the end of each year, we’ll settle the differences,” explained Alma. Today it’s not just flying anvils that punctuate the Taylor skies. Turbines are taking a spin there too.\nTo find out how renewable energy programs administered by USDA can help your business, farm or ranch, click here. \nTo hear Under Secretary Dallas Tonsager and Business Programs Administrator Judy Canales discussing the program click here.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Renewable Energy for America Program\n Rural Development",

Among that 1%, the average age of the American farmer is 57 years old—making it imperative for us to engage and encourage young people to pursue agricultural careers.\nEarlier this summer, while visiting Browning, Montana, I had the opportunity to meet with Dr. Billie Jo Kipp, President of the Blackfeet Community College (BCC) and Mr. Terry Tatsey, Director of Agricultural Programs at the college.  Their efforts and commitment to educate local students and keep young people in agriculture is inspiring.\nAt BCC, programs like the Native Science Field Center use outdoor classrooms to give students hands-on experience in cataloging native plants and their relationships to nearby water sources.  The experience, supported through the Blackfeet Community College Extension, is a marriage of cultural and agricultural studies. It passes knowledge between generations and encourages young people to pursue a future in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers as well as agricultural fields.\nThe trip also gave me a chance to participate in the North American Indian Days Celebration. Here I met with tribal members, attended a 4-H livestock sale, participated in the rodeo and witnessed the pride and commitment of the young people as they showcased both their cultural and agricultural traditions.  At USDA, we are committed to providing American Indians and Alaska Natives equal access to all of our programs.  Our Office of Tribal Relations works with Indian Country, providing support across all USDA programs for tribal consultation, sacred site efforts, cross-agency federal programs and the recently created White House Council on Native American Affairs.\nOn my recent visit to Wisconsin, I had the honor to attend the opening day festivities at the Wisconsin State Fair.  Originating in the early mid-s, state fairs are a celebration of foods and the rural communities that produce them.  They are a showcase of rural America—shining a spotlight on farmers, ranchers, dairy producers, agribusiness and the communities that surround them.\nHaving been in agriculture in one form or another all of my life, going to the state fair is still exciting and fair season is one of my favorite times of the year. Along with attending a dairy show, touring the agriculture pavilion—not to mention stopping to enjoy some potato pancakes, sweet corn and a traditional crème-puff—I was able to attend the Wisconsin fair’s lamb show.  This gave me an opportunity to visit with some of the state’s young producers who were striving to win their class and make the sale.\nThese young people represent the future of agriculture, and are just one example of the up-and-coming farmers and ranchers who will feed our nation in the years ahead. Through programs like USDA’s Start2Farm initiative, funded through the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA),  and opportunities like the Specialty Crop Block Grants (SCBG) and Farmers Market Promotion Program, managed by the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), we are committed to creating opportunities in rural America.\nBy cultivating a passion for agriculture in students and supporting beginning farmers and ranchers, we will help build the future of agriculture and show that we do not take for granted the work they do to feed us all. We are dedicated to keeping families on the farm and creating opportunities for future generations.\nWhen visiting the Wisconsin State Fair, Under Secretary Avalos (third person, back row) attended a lamb show and had the opportunity to meet with some of the farmers and ranchers who will feed our nation in the years ahead.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n 4 H\n American Indian\n AMS\n Beginning Farmers\n beginning ranchers\n Blackfeet Nation\n Farmers\n Farmers Market Promotion Program\n Montana\n NIFA\n OTR\n Producers\n Ranchers\n Rural America\n Specialty Crop Block Grants\n Start2Farm\n State Fairs\n STEM\n students\n Tribal\n White House\n Wisconsin",

Written in first person, the “world veterinary year” blogs share career paths - from dream to reality – and put a face on the sometimes overlooked aspects of 'on-the-ground' USDA employees. It is this creative use of social media to effectively showcase the rich personality of our workforce that makes this series our number 4 favorite new media moment.\nIn the series, which began in early , each blog highlighted one of over 700 APHIS veterinarians and his or her job within the agency. A few notable stories told of APHIS vets ensuring that the U.S. Equestrian Team horses were safe to travel to the Olympics and protecting our nation’s bison populations in Yellowstone National Park. Others are overseas battling infectious diseases and on the front lines in times of great need.

Be a part of the Census of Agriculture. The Census is a complete count of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them.\nThe holidays are often a time for family, fun, and food. New Year’s is no exception. One thing many nations around the world have in common is the belief that eating certain foods on New Year’s will bring good luck and prosperity in the 12 months to follow.\nOne New Year’s tradition the South is especially known for is eating black-eyed peas and collard greens. It is believed that a meal with black-eyed peas and collards symbolizes humility and a new year full of coins and “green” (money). Lentils are another popular legume on New Year’s for the same reason.\nHow do our farmers contribute to this traditional fare? According to the Census of Agriculture, our nation’s 1,407 collard operations harvested 12,542 acres. North Carolina ranked first for number of farms , but Georgia led in collard acreage .\nThe for collards are only available every five years in the Census of Agriculture, and it’s that time again. Census questionnaires have been mailed to farmers and ranchers across the nation. By participating in the Census of Agriculture, producers can influence decisions that will shape the future of American agriculture. \nIn , California ranked first in black-eyed pea production, accounting for 31.9 million of the 57.2 million pounds produced nationally. Texas ranked first in harvested acres, with 23,000 of the nation’s 35,300 total harvested acres of black-eyed peas. In the same year, farmers produced 1.3 billion pounds of lentils on 908,000 harvested acres. Montana ranked first in lentil production, with more than 737 million pounds.\nPork is another popular New Year’s tradition. In various cultures, pigs are perceived as representing progress because they look and root forward. In , U.S. farmers produced more than 35 billion pounds of pork, with Iowa, at more than 12 billion pounds, accounting for almost a third of U.S. production. According to the Census of Agriculture, there were 63,246 hog operations across the country. Iowa led the nation with 6,266 operations. What will the Census of Agriculture tell us?\nA fun New Year’s tradition is trying to eat 12 grapes at midnight. Some believe that each chime of the clock represents a month of the year and that the reveler must eat one grape with each chime for 12 months of good luck. Some even say you should make a wish with each grape. According to the Census of Agriculture, our nation had 23,420 grape bearing operations and more than 1 million bearing acres. In , the United States produced 7.7 million tons of grapes, of which about 1 million were utilized as fresh grapes. California is consistently first in grape production. The census will provide additional information on number of grape operations and acres.\nAcross the United States and around the world, people incorporate a variety of other New Year’s food traditions, including eating noodles to symbolize a long life, ring-shaped cakes to represent the year coming full circle, and many more.

These grants have funded more than 60 environmental markets projects, including a number of the nation’s leading market efforts.\nEPRI’s program, launched when the states of Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana signed a multi-state compact in , works with agricultural producers who voluntarily implement conservation practices that reduce nutrient runoff into local waters. Through the program’s first trades in March , three energy companies purchased these credits and retired them for associated nutrient and ecosystem benefits.\nOn April 13, In front of a crowded auditorium at the National Geographic Society in Washington, DC, Former EPA Deputy Administrator Bob Perciasepe awarded the prize to Fox who accepted on behalf of EPRI. Perciasepe expressed admiration for EPRI’s ability to innovate and engage stakeholders from Duke Energy to the Ohio Farm Bureau, and everyone in between.\nIn her award acceptance remarks, Fox noted that part of the project’s success is that EPRI was never satisfied with developing the nation’s largest water quality trading program, or executing the first trades. “We are always pushing and striving, looking forward to the next chapter.”\nThe next chapter for the Institute begins on May 20 when it holds a public auction for nutrient credits in New York City. These credits were generated through the installation of cover crops, livestock fencing and other conservation practices on 30 farms last summer.\nClick here for a video of Fox describing the project and what it means to win the U.S. Water Prize.\nFind out more about NRCS Conservation Innovation Grants.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Bob Perciasepe\n Conservation\n Conservation Innovation Grants\n EPA\n Indiana\n Kentucky\n NRCS\n Ohio\n Washington DC\n water quality",

By , their food security situation is projected to improve, leaving 9.2 percent food insecure (assuming rising per-capita incomes, stable or declining food prices, and no new major crises).\nUSDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) recently released the annual International Food Security Assessment -, in which they assess the food security status and outlook for 76 low- and middle-income countries that are former or current food aid recipients. This report presents the number of food-insecure people, the share of the population that is food insecure, and the food gap projected for and based on projected food price and income changes. The ERS food security indicators are forward-looking and provide a measure of expected progress in food security.\nThe share of populations experiencing food insecurity is not spread evenly across the regions and countries included in the study. Projections of food insecurity in the 22 Asian and 11 Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries show it is relatively low at 13.9 and 17.4 percent compared to Sub-Saharan Africa’s (SSA) 35.3 percent. This regional disparity is projected to widen by . Sub-Saharan Africa, while expected to improve, is still projected to have 22.5 percent of its population classified as food insecure.\nThe share of populations that are food insecure is projected to improve, but with widening regional disparity across the four regions studied\nProjections for 76 low- and middle-income countries show that food insecure people in is relatively low in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) compared to 35.3 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This disparity is projected to widen into when Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to improve but still have 22.5 percent of its population classified as food insecure. Photo credit: USDA, Economic Research Service based on results from the International Food Security Assessment model\nSeveral countries are projected to not make significant progress in their food security situation. For these countries, income growth prospects are poor, and food prices are expected to remain relatively high due to ongoing armed conflicts or recent devastation from natural disasters, which tend to displace a large portion of the population and disrupt economic and agricultural activities. This results in limited access to food and increased food insecurity. For example, most of Yemen remains food insecure, and repeated port closures hinder food imports. Over half the populations in Central Africa and parts of East Africa are projected to be food insecure in , following years of civil conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.\nFor more information, please see the report, International Food Security Assessment - and more at www.ers.usda.gov.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Economic Research Service\n Food security\n International Food Security Assessment",

Community colleges are hubs for career-training, re-training, adult education and for recent high school graduates seeking a pathway into the careers of their choice.\nFor many residents of rural areas, community colleges also provide the closest access to postsecondary education and a way to obtain the skills needed for existing jobs.  However, like some of their students, many rural community colleges are doing more with less as state budgets are being cut and new resources are becoming harder to find.\nDuring the rural community colleges conference in Oklahoma, many attendees asked about funding and resources available from the Department of Education but few were as familiar with opportunities in other federal agencies. Some rural community college administrators were unaware of the significant infrastructure of support available through their USDA Rural Development state and local offices.\nAs the American Jobs Act languishes in Congress, preventing an infusion of $5 billion for modernization from reaching community colleges, the U.S. Departments of Education and Agriculture are working together to guide campuses serving high-poverty rural communities to existing federal resources.\nDuring a recent conference call with members of the Rural Community College Alliance and the American Association of Community Colleges, nearly 100 participants learned about USDA Rural Development programs and funding opportunities that can be used to improve facilities, support distance learning, and provide home ownership assistance as a recruitment and retention tool for faculty.\nThe USDA Community Facilities Program can be used for construction and renovation of classrooms and dormitories, and even to purchase transportation vehicles to serve campus facilities. The USDA Single Family Housing Programs provide homeownership opportunities to low- and moderate-income rural Americans through several loan, grant, and loan guarantee programs.\nUSDA Distance Learning and Telemedicine grants can cover the cost of equipment for video conferencing and other distance learning equipment. USDA’s Community Connect program provides grants to build broadband Internet infrastructure and establish community centers to offer free public access in rural areas where broadband service is least likely to be available, but where it can make a tremendous difference in the quality of life for citizens.\nThese are a few of the ways that USDA can support rural communities, and the Department of Education is working to increase awareness of how college leaders can access these opportunities.\nClick here () for examples of USDA Programs that can be useful to rural community colleges.\nContact your USDA Rural Development State Office [\n Category/Topic:\n Initiatives\n Rural\n Technology\n Tags:\n Broadband\n Community Connect\n Community Facilities\n Department of Education\n Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program\n Rural Development\n Single Family Housing Programs",

With football season upon us, we want to help you “kick off” your citrus’ health. Whether you are a rookie or seasoned veteran when it comes to growing fruit, following these simple tips can help your citrus have a winning season.\n1. Draft an all-pro citrus team\nDwarf varieties are often preferable for backyard growing because they take up less space, do not grow as tall, and are easier and safer to pick. When purchasing citrus trees, buying a healthy tree from a reputable seller is critical. If you are ordering a citrus tree, make sure the nursery or shipper is in compliance with federal quarantine restrictions.\n2. Prep your home turf \nCitrus trees can grow in the ground or in containers. They are happy in practically any soil, as long as there is adequate drainage.  In more clay-like soils, small amounts of gravel or sand can promote improved drainage.\n3. Water with complete coverage\nIf the leaves on your citrus tree start turning yellow and fall off, this could be a result of under watering, but it is more likely from overwatering. To ensure that you are watering adequately, water trees in the ground deeply once a week and trees in containers as soon as the soil becomes dry.\n4. Have a strong defense against the cold (how to prevent the freeze)\nCitrus trees typically thrive in warmer states, such as California, Florida and Texas, because of their intolerance of freezing temperatures. With some exceptions depending on the variety, citrus freezes around 27-28 degrees Fahrenheit. If you suspect a freeze, cover your plants with blankets, towels, or plant covers from a nursery.\n5. Don't fumble on fertilizing\nCitrus/fruit tree fertilizer should be applied every three months for maximum growth and fruit production.\nIn addition to following these five tips, it is also very important for at-home citrus growers to regularly inspect their plants for diseases. There are four significant diseases threatening U.S. citrus: citrus greening, citrus canker, sweet orange scab and citrus black spot.\nIf you suspect your citrus may be diseased, report it immediately to the USDA.  The USDA’s Save Our Citrus iPhone App offers a convenient way for people to identify and report suspected citrus disease. This free app is available for download from the iTunes store.\nTo learn more, follow us on Facebook.com/SaveOurCitrus and Twitter.com/SaveOurCitrus, or visit the Web site at SaveOurCitrus.org.\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Tags:\n APHIS\n app\n citrus greening\n citrus health\n Huanglongbing\n Plant Protection and Quarantine\n Save Our Citrus",

I've received many opportunities with USDA,” said Dupree.\nDupree is a Biological Science Technician with USDA-ARS in Tifton, Georgia, where she started after earning her Agricultural Sciences degree with a concentration in Plant and Soil Science from Alcorn State University. While in school, she interned with the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center through the National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program and interned with USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service. During that experience Dupree learned about instrumentation that she uses currently.\nDupree credits USDA with supporting her in achieving her career goals. Her alma mater — Alcorn State University—is a USDA, National Institute of Food and Agriculture ’s land-grant university partner. Dupree received a full academic scholarship and vital career development support. “USDA has impacted my life by putting me on the path that I am on now,” Dupree said.\nAndreya is also a licensed drone pilot and was able to do that through a National Resources Conservation Service scholarship. Dupree became a licensed drone pilot at Hinds Community College. She sees the agriculture sector moving toward agricultural technologies, especially drone technology since drones can take surveys and pictures and make maps. Dupree credits USDA with providing her enriching career preparation and experiences that have only continued since joining ARS after earning her Plant and Soil Science degree.\nDupree also participated in a USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Extension program while attending Alcorn State University. USDA-NIFA’s Extension programs that help underserved communities are a Justice40 covered program (, 222 ), which is a type of federal program that falls within the scope of the initiative because it includes investments benefitting underserved communities. Justice40 is a whole-of-government initiative that works to direct 40 percent of the overall benefits to certain federal investments to underserved communities. Some of the investments that fall within the Justice40 Initiative include climate change, clean energy, and training and workforce development.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Agricultural Research Service\n ARS\n USDA Science\n drones\n National Institute of Food and Agriculture\n NIFA\n Food Safety and Inspection Service\n FSIS\n careers\n You May Also Like\n USDA Nutrition Research Fuels Olympians’ Engines\n Meet Mari Gomez—Public Servant at USDA & Leader in Her Community\n Shining a Spotlight on USDA Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area Employees",

Basic and applied research at FPL supports a number of objectives, including forest management and restoration, the wise use of forest resources, job creation, and expanding economic opportunities through public-private partnerships on a national scale.\nThroughout his tour, Secretary Vilsack talked with lab leadership about FPL’s diverse and innovative research efforts. Project leaders used the opportunity to field questions from the Secretary and explain work ranging from wood preservation and durability to advances in “green” building strategies and technology, use of beetle-killed trees, work on historic timber bridges, and advances in nanocellulose-related materials and applications.\nIn FPL’s unique weather testing facility, project leader Carol Clausen described how wall assemblies can be tested for a range of harsh conditions, from heavy rain and extreme heat to high humidity and strong winds.\n“Developing durable building materials for green construction is a win-win situation for the Nation’s forests and the American people,” Clausen told Vilsack. “Utilizing beetle-killed trees to create value-added products, improves forest health, reduces the wildfire threat and creates jobs.”\nIn the Engineering Mechanics and Remote Sensing Laboratory, project leader Bob Ross brought out the big gun—an air-powered debris launcher used to develop protective safe-rooms in hurricane and tornado-prone areas.

Yet today it is hard to find buffalo meat on school meal trays in the very areas where they once sustained Native communities. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is working with tribal partners to figure out why and to remove the barriers we can.\nThe Biden-Harris Administration and Secretary Vilsack have made it a priority to better meet our federal trust and treaty responsibilities. Historically, the U.S. government played a significant role in the decimation of the buffalo population in the North American continent, with a policy of destroying buffalo in order to starve Native Americans into submission. We recognize the weight of these actions and our obligation to better support tribes in restoring buffalo across their lands.\nOn Monday, June 6, my colleagues at FNS, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Rural Development, Agricultural Marketing Service, and the USDA Office of Tribal Relations, and I were honored to be invited by the InterTribal Buffalo Council (ITBC) and members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to participate in a traditional buffalo slaughter and field harvest. ITBC is a coalition of 69 federally recognized tribes that has led the work to restore buffalo to Indian Country since . Our traditional harvest was led by Lisa and Arlo Iron Cloud who work with Makoce Agriculture Development, an Indigenous agriculture organization led by Nick Hernandez on Pine Ridge. Ms. Iron Cloud is also partnering with USDA’s Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative to help create resources on sustainable, Indigenous food foraging practices.\nThis “hands-on” experience was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for which we are so grateful to Lisa, Arlo, the ITBC, and the Oglala Lakota Nation Tribal leadership to get a glimpse into the cultural, spiritual, and practical contributions of buffalo to the Lakota people.\nWe saw first-hand the importance of providing opportunities for American Indian children to engage in hands-on nutrition education about buffalo and to be able to taste and regularly eat buffalo as part of their school meals. FNS has worked to address some of the barriers that make it challenging for schools to serve buffalo, but we recognize that we must do more. We look forward to continuing to partner with ITBC and tribal leaders to advance Indigenous food sovereignty priorities and restore buffalo in Indian Country.\nLearn more about USDA Food and Nutrition Service demonstration projects in tribal communities and USDA’s Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative.\n Category/Topic:\n Equity\n Food and Nutrition\n Nutrition Security\n Tags:\n Food and Nutrition Service\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n Nutrition\n Tribal Nations\n native\n indigenious\n Tribal\n buffalo\n harvest\n You May Also Like\n SNAP-Ed Connects Culture, Land, and Food\n Healthier Foods, Healthier Minds\n National Women’s History Month: Celebrating FNS’ Unsung Heroines",

        "content": "USDA Agricultural Research Service Information Staff in\n Research and Science\n Nov 05, \nARS researchers have compiled a comprehensive set of rankings for flavor traits for tomatoes to give breeders a better chance to improve the taste of supermarket tomatoes.\nThis post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nIf you want to stir consumers’ passions about produce, just mention tomatoes. There’s no shortage of outrage about those supermarket tomatoes that look as pretty as a picture, but sometimes aren’t much tastier than the carton in which they’re shipped.\nIt’s not like consumers aren’t willing to give store-bought tomatoes a try; tomatoes are a $ates.  But there’s a tug of war between large-scale producers and consumers: The producers need firm tomatoes that can withstand long-distance shipping and long-term storage, while consumers want that garden-fresh taste.\nFortunately, the scientists of USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) are working on resolving the conflict.  They’ve been exploring tomato’s genetic diversity to uncover information that could help breeders develop a tastier tomato.\nTo do this, the scientists raised 173 varieties of tomatoes on test plots in North Carolina, trained 10 “taste-testers” and asked them to rate the tomatoes on a scale of one to five in the areas of odor, taste, flavor and texture. The tomatoes were selected from the approximately 6,000 accessions in the ARS Tomato Germplasm Collection in Geneva, New York, because they represent a cross-section of the world’s tomato diversity.\nThe answer was surprisingly simple:  Although thousands of components go into determining a tomato’s flavor and other characteristics, the key players are the amounts of sugar and acid.  There’s also a positive correlation between sweetness and flavor:  the sweeter the tomato, the more flavorful it is.\nThe results of this study represent a treasure trove for tomato breeders, offering a comprehensive set of rankings on various tomatoes’ flavor qualities, sweetness, vitamin C content, sugar and acid content, and other characteristics.\nThe findings also are good news for breeders because they demonstrate the vast variation and the broad range of possibilities for adjusting sugar levels and developing more flavorful tomatoes.  This means “building a better tomato” shouldn’t be that difficult because both sugar and acid content in the fruit can be reliably and inexpensively measured as the breeders work their magic to deliver backyard-tomato flavor on the supermarket shelves.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n ARS\n Consumers\n New York\n North Carolina\n Producers\n Science Tuesday\n tomatoes",

        "content": "Wisconsin USDA Public Information Officer in\n Energy\n Rural\n Mar 28, \nUSDA funding of biodigester technology, coupled with nearby wind turbines, produce enough renewable energy to power an entire Wisconsin county.\nThe escalation in prices for energy from fossil fuel has set the stage for the domestic production of renewable energy as a national priority. Not only can the production of renewable energy reduce fossil fuel dependence, but it has the potential to create quality American jobs, combat global warming, and lay a strong foundation for a robust rural economy. This point was not only emphasized in President Obama’s State of the Union address in January, but again upon the President’s recent visit to two Manitowoc, Wisconsin, businesses; showcasing them as leaders in solar power and energy-efficient technology.\nManitowoc is not the only place in Wisconsin that is leading the way in renewable energy and energy efficient systems. Just to the north, in Kewaunee County, they, too, are on the cutting edge of the renewable energy race.\nKewaunee County is home to 20,300 residents and agriculture is the third leading employer for county residents; has become a forerunner, a model, in the generation and use of renewable energy on a large scale within the last seven years.\nToday, there are two anaerobic digesters, both on cattle dairy farms, and three wind farms in operation throughout Kewaunee County.  Collectively, these systems generate enough power to support and sustain 8,000 households. With a total of 8,900 households located in the entire county, renewable energy is powering Kewaunee County, Wis.\nThe revolution began in when both Wisconsin Public Service (WPS) and Madison Gas and Electric (MG&E) constructed winds farms in Kewaunee County. Then in , John Pagel of Pagel’s Ponderosa Dairy, LLC was awarded a renewable energy grant from USDA Rural Development for the purchase and installation of an anaerobic digester. That anaerobic digester takes mainly livestock manure, and processes that waste into energy. Pagel Ponderosa, the largest dairy farm in the state at 4,200 head of cattle and the largest employer in the area, generates enough energy to power more than 800 homes.\nOne year later, Pagel’s partner and co-owner of Dairy Dreams, LLC, Don Niles, was also approved for a USDA grant. Grant funds were again used for the purchase and installation of an anaerobic digester on the Dairy Dreams Farm. Dairy Dreams is a 2,800 head dairy farm located in Casco, Wis. With the addition of this new digester that started production late in , Dairy Dreams generates enough green energy to power 600 homes in Kewaunee County, producing approximately 780 kilowatts an hour.\nAnaerobic Digesters process and ultimately produce energy from livestock manure. In addition to the production of energy, solid byproducts of the system are dried and used on the farm as livestock bedding material, and liquid byproducts are used as high-quality organic fertilizer in place of chemical fertilizers.\n“The decision for the digesters was an easy one for us,” said Niles.  “As a nation we saw that we’re becoming more dependent on foreign oil, and we were concerned with fuel being available locally. Looking all around us we had a renewable resource available. This was the right thing to do for both the nation and our neighbors.”\nThe green energy produced by the digesters is ultimately sold back to the grid at WPS, helping to lower energy costs for area residents throughout the county.\n“Not only is this good for energy independence, but we do try to be mindful of our neighbors and area residents.  The anaerobic digesters allow us to use a high quality organic fertilizer that is produced right here, generated directly from the digester and the energy producing processes, helping us to eliminate odor problems and the need to spread liquid waste,” added Niles.  “We are a blue collar and agricultural county, we pride ourselves on the many ways that we are self-sufficient, and this is just another means of supporting ourselves and our neighbors.”\nPartners on these projects include GHD, Inc. in Chilton, Wis., Focus on Energy, and Wisconsin Public Service.\nUSDA supports deployment of anaerobic digesters through Rural Development, Farm Service Agency and NRCS programs.  To find out how to fund renewable energy projects for your farm or business click here. \nThese calves are making a contribution to powering an entire Wisconsin county. \nUSDA funding of biodigester technology, coupled with nearby wind turbines, produce enough renewable energy to power an entire Wisconsin county.\n Category/Topic:\n Energy\n Rural\n Tags:\n anaerobic digesters\n biodigesters\n FSA\n Manitowoc\n NRCS\n Renewable Energy\n Rural Development\n solar power\n wind power\n Wisconsin",

Scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have discovered a game-changing element of purple corn – it may help reduce the risk of major health diseases.\nWhile developing new types of purple corn, the researchers found some with elevated levels of a naturally occurring chemical that may fight obesity, inflammation, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain types of cancer. They also found that the outer layer of kernels might be used as natural food coloring.\nUSDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture is supporting this research with funds through the Hatch Act. Hatch funds support agricultural research to solve problems that concern more than one state.\nThe research team, led by food science professor Elvira Gonzalez de Mejia and crop sciences professor John Juvik, created 20 varieties of the Apache Red maize strain, each with a different amount and type of anthocyanins, the element that gives the maize its distinct color. Studies have shown that eating anthocyanin-rich foods may reduce the risk of disease.\nIn one finding, the scientists tested purple corn’s phenolic compounds against insulin resistance. They induced insulin resistance in the mouse fat cells, treated the cells with the anthocyanin compounds, and monitored the glucose uptake. They found that insulin resistance decreased by 29-64 percent. Although more studies are needed, the research suggests that phenolic compounds might improve the insulin profile of people who are obese.\nJuvik also described an extra benefit of purple corn. He noted that the natural color of purple corn could potentially be used as a food color replacement for red dye No. 40 – one of the major dyes used in the United States. People could then easily gain some health benefits through a natural, anthocyanin-rich pigment dye that is added to foods and beverages.\nNIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n National Institute of Food and Agriculture\n Economic Research Service\n Illinois\n health",

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nWhen you think of agriculture do you think of science and engineering? You should! Farmers are some of our original scientists, tinkering with plant varieties and farming techniques to find ways to reliably grow food. At USDA, we still do that kind of research in a never-ending effort to find better ways to produce food, fuel, and fiber. We also do a lot of research you might not think of when you think about agriculture: from forensic genetic analysis to track down unwanted pests to figuring out how to turn spent grain from distilleries into biodegradable kitty litter.\nOn April 26-27, the 3rd Annual USA Science and Engineering Festival took over the Walter E.

Lucky for him, he loves farming and enjoys working with his in-laws to manage the 4,000-acre farm of soybeans, wheat and corn.  Now it’s his full-time job, working with his brother-in-law to raise fields of commodity crops each year. But recently, Chris and Tracy Adams, and the rest of the family, began experimenting with farming at a much smaller scale.\nThey built a seasonal high tunnel, a greenhouse-like structure that produces a plentiful supply of strawberries, raspberries, tomatoes and peppers. High tunnels are made of plastic or metal pipe and covered with sheeting, typically made of plastic. Unlike greenhouses, they require no energy to heat, instead relying on natural sunlight to create favorable conditions for growing vegetables and other specialty crops.\nUSDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service offers technical and financial assistance for landowners, like the Adams family, to build seasonal high tunnels.\nSandra Voils, Adams’ mother-in-law, serves on the Russell County Soil and Water Conservation District board of supervisors, so she first told her family about high tunnels and how they could benefit from one. Chris and Tracy Adams did extensive research on strawberries and raspberries and decided they would focus on these fruits for the high tunnel’s first year.\nChris and Tracy Adams with their daughters Ashley and Abigail in front of their high tunnel.\nThe Adams family, with NRCS’ help, also installed drip irrigation and planted a row of wildflowers next to the high tunnel to attract pollinators to help the plants in the garden to flourish. The drip irrigation allows them to apply water at the base of plants, ensuring water is used wisely.\nLocal buyers who have heard about the delicious berries give their phone number to Tracy, asking her to let them know when they’re ready. “I like my produce fresh, and we pick the day we sell them, that way the berries are at the freshest possible condition,“ she said.\nThanks to the seasonal high tunnel, her new morning staple has become Greek yogurt with fresh raspberries. “It is rewarding to go pick your breakfast fresh,” she said. “It is a great way to start the day.”\nThe stages of the growth on the plants in the high tunnel are evident.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n Conservation\n corn\n high tunnels\n Kentucky\n KYF2\n Landowners\n NRCS\n pollinators\n Specialty Crops\n strawberries\n tomatoes\n vegetables\n wheat",

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nThe goal of USDA’s Hispanic-Serving Institutions National Program (HSINP) Future Scientists Program is to enhance the scientific knowledge of teachers, helping them to become more effective in encouraging student interest and progress in science. Teachers in the program attend two-day summer institutes at Agricultural Research Service (ARS) labs nationwide, where scientists introduce them to various research projects. ARS researchers share scientific knowledge with the teachers, who then share it with their students to encourage them to become future scientists.\nOne of the catalysts for this lofty goal is a tiny, inconspicuous and innocuous caterpillar—the corn earworm that wreaks havoc in corn fields nationwide as an agricultural pest.  This program began in .  I brought 10 teachers into the ARS Southern Plains Agricultural Research Center (SPARC) in College Station, Texas, for a summer institute that included teachers studying in corn research plots searching for corn earworm caterpillars in 100-degree heat! It was the first time I made caterpillars the focus of this program.\nSince then, the program has expanded to include students visiting various ARS research labs. I have also harnessed the caterpillar’s “intrigue factor,” since students are intrigued by insects.  They are intrigued by the magic of metamorphosis—particularly when the caterpillar transforms into a beautiful moth.  They are intrigued that they can learn by observation.  They are intrigued enough to ask questions about the worm and then conduct research projects to find answers. The ARS Southeast Area insectary in Stoneville, Mississippi, generously supplies the program with all the worms we need.\nStudents conduct research on the worms and then make presentations at the end of their school year at their local ARS lab at a Future Scientists Student Research Presentation Day. They also take tours and learn about other research projects at the labs.\nOne student who presented in subsequently became a student summer worker at SPARC while in high school, continued working while studying entomology at junior college, and has just received a scholarship to attend Texas A&M University.\nThis year, his teacher brought four of her current fifth-graders to present their research on the worm.  These are just four of the 86,000 students (grades K through 12) whom we have interacted with in the past 21 years of the Future Scientist Program.

The fish are released after being measured and marked with a coded wire tag. Students from Port Protection, Thorne Bay, and Klawock, Alaska, joined the crew composed of staff from the U.S. Forest Service, Sitka Conservation Society and the University of Alaska Southeast Fish Tech Program. Photo credit: Scott Harris, Sitka Conservation Society\nThis post was co-authored with Andrew Thoms, Executive Director of the Sitka Conservation Society.\n“The thing that our forests grow best is salmon!” is the local phrase that a visitor is most likely to hear when visiting some of the 32 communities that live near the Tongass National Forest of Southeast Alaska. \nTongass National Forest staff, local school districts, a local conservation organization, and the University of Alaska have undertaken a joint project to figure out how a forest can be managed to create jobs and other economic opportunities and guarantee the long-term sustainable yield of the Tongass’ fisheries resources.\nFor thousands of years, the Tongass has been occupied by humans, supported by the bounty of salmon and other marine and forest resources of the Pacific coast.  Today, salmon and fisheries continue to be the core of Southeast Alaska’s economy.  Staff at the Tongass National Forest estimate that the Tongass produces over 25 percent of all salmon harvested in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean and is responsible for over $1 billion of economic activity a year. Given the historic and current cultural and economic importance of salmon, it is only logical that entities within the region are thinking about a salmon future.\n“The Forest Service, the University of Alaska Southeast Fisheries Technologies Program, school districts on Prince of Wales Island and the Sitka Conservation Society came together to host the ‘fisheries technician boot camp,’” said Andrew Thoms, executive director of the Sitka Conservation Society.  “Our goals were two-fold: first, we wanted to give youth on-the-job experience by working as part of a team monitoring salmon returns and spawning in a recently restored river. Second, we wanted to give students an idea of the jobs and careers available to them as land managers, essentially serving as stewards of the amazing salmon resource that the Tongass National Forest produces.” \nIn the program, students received hands-on training in fish capture, fish identification and tagging of juvenile salmon out-migrating to the ocean. Students received both college and high school credits for the experience.\nNot only does the project collect valuable for the Forest Service, but the students are also gaining a great deal.\nTamar Theurer, from Port Protection, Alaska, was one of the students selected for the program.\n“I learned how to clip adipose fins and I learned how to identify different types of salmon and other fish,” Theurer said. “I learned more about the environment and habitats of fish and birds; and oh, I also learned my trees! Some of them at least. I want to go into fisheries, so not only will I have knowledge of how to do these things but I can also use this experience on my resume.”\nThis project is one of many collaborative efforts currently taking place on the Tongass National Forest and one of a wealth of programs to restore and protect wild Pacific salmon runs and fisheries stocks. Awareness is growing of the important role that National Forest System lands and watersheds play in producing wild Pacific salmon stocks. This program, and many others like it, will be integral to ensuring that salmon stocks continue to run thousands of years into the future. \nThe program received support from the National Forest Foundation.\nThis post is part of a series featuring the Forest Service’s work with partners on restoration across the country.\nTamar Theurer, from Port Protection, Alaska, learns how to set up a fyke net for monitoring fish abundance on the Tongass National Forest.

As a sport fisherman he enjoys hooking the big, aggressive silvers, also known as coho salmon. (U.S. Forest Service photo)\nTo be a wildlife biologist and to be in Alaska … it’s not a question, it’s the good life for this Forest Service land manager.\nJust ask Robert Stovall, the deputy district ranger for the Seward Ranger District since for Alaska’s Chugach National Forest. There are no roads into the forest’s interior. Beyond a two to three-mile road journey, you’ll find yourself in back country with no improved roads, a land full of beautiful scenery, lots of native wildlife, adventures and challenges.\nStovall is engaged in managing the various resources on the district and assists with overall forest management activities such as the effects of a large bark beetle outbreak 10 years ago that today involves restoring about a third of the district. As a line officer focused on managing the agency’s multiple use mission, he feels he’s found his niche.\n“The opportunity to focus on programs that involve multiple resources is very rewarding,” said Stovall. “It’s the chance to work in timber, minerals, fire programs, wildlife and fisheries, heritage, and watersheds which involve working with interdisciplinary teams to help guide the projects.”\nStovall has spent his 35-year career as a land management steward for national wildlife refuges and national forests across the nation.  During that time, he’s experienced some of the most soul-refreshing and adventure-inspiring scenery, beheld eye-to-eye encounters with moose and bear, weathered the vagaries of changes in Alaska’s yearly snowfalls, and helped residents and visitors enjoy their national lands.\nPart of his focus is also helping the next generation learn to appreciate the many ways to enjoy getting outside. The forest is known as the Chugach Children’s Forest which provides opportunities for outdoor educational activities and expeditions to help children learn about nature.\n“We’re working with schools and other young adults and youth-oriented employment groups,” he said. “This is very important because these folks are eventually going to be doing my job and I love to see them get interested in doing my job the way I did by going out and being in the woods.”\nOne of those activities involved exploring a snowfield that was used by native Alaskans in prehistoric times. Stovall accompanied a youth expedition for an ice patch survey which involved a 10-mile horseback ride to the edge of ice fields on Devil’s Creek Trail to look for prehistoric signs of hunted caribou. While the kids learned more about their culture, Stovall experienced a different kind of adventure.\nChugach Deputy District Ranger Robert Stovall’s horse ride on the Chugach National Forest’s Devils Pass Trail to accompany youth on an archaeological survey expedition proved a courage-inducing experience leaving him a bit ‘astounded’ by this first-time horseback encounter. (U.S. Forest Service photo)\n“With a steep drop off, you kind of want the horse to hug the inside of the trail. For the old rangers of , or , it was their standard operating procedure to ride a horse,” he said. “Fast forward 100 years and I’m there getting on a horse for the first time in my life, and for me, it was not one of those experiences I was immediately ready to repeat. This particular ranger was kind of astounded by it. I’m glad I can say that I’ve done it.”\nFishing is a major industry and recreational activity on the Chugach.  A world-renowned fishery for sockeye salmon sits on the clear waters of the district’s Russian River where sportsmen can see the fish and a personal use fishery is located on the lower portions of the Kenai River, the major river on the Kenai Peninsula which flows out of the glacially-fed Kenai Lake. Dip net fishing with a four to five-foot diameter net is popular with fishermen who stand in the river and wait for the fish to swim into the net.  One of Stovall’s hobbies is mastering the joy of ‘catching the big one.\n“My favorite pastime is of course fishing, especially salmon fishing. Fishing for silvers, also known as coho, salmon fishing is probably the most fun because they bite at the lures, they’re a big fish, and they’re relatively aggressive,” said Stovall. “They’re not an easy fish to catch unless you have a lot in an area and you can use a snagging hook method to make them easier to catch.”\nWhen he’s not fishing, he’s exploring the trail system for hiking, biking and bird watching, nervously watching for black and brown bears while fishing, and watching the wildlife.\n“As a wildlife biologist, I think moose are probably the most stunning animal to observe. It’s amazing how an animal that large can all of a sudden be right before you. You come around a corner and there’s a moose. Your first instinct is to run, which if you have to do it, run in a zigzag fashion,” he cautioned. “Remember, with a bear just back away or let it go where it wants to go and then you go somewhere else.”\nThe Chugach was also chosen as this year’s national forest to provide the Capitol Christmas Tree and it will most likely come from the Seward Ranger District.\nRead more about Stovall in FACES of the Forest, a feature that introduces the people, places and professions in the agency.\nRobert Stovall is a deputy district ranger on the Chugach National Forest.
