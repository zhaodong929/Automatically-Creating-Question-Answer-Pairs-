"Undersecretary, USDA Rural Development in  Energy  Rural  Jun 09,   As a farmer in eastern South Dakota, I witnessed one of the biggest growth periods in renewable energy in our country's history. I saw firsthand how the investments in biofuels benefited rural Americans by creating jobs and capturing wealth locally. Leaders in the community got together, made commitments to invest in renewable energy projects, and shared in the success of the projects once they matured. Renewable energy projects are not only good for the rural economy, they are an important component of President Barack Obama's across-the-board approach to building an energy infrastructure. The path he laid out will secure our energy future and promote economic growth by out-innovating and out-competing global competition. Renewable energy production is smart for our country both strategically and economically. As gas prices have gone up, we are reminded that oil supplies are fragile and that global events and speculation can have a large effect on the price. Whether it is tumult in the Middle East or hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico, the long and complex supply chains for petroleum energy can be disrupted by a multitude of events.  This solar module, funded in part through USDA’s Rural Energy for America Program, is oriented to the south on a ground-mounted rack near a rural business in Tippecanoe County, Indiana.  Abundant domestic resources make the expanded use of clean, reliable and American-made renewable energy the best way to mitigate these risks in the long run and take control of gas prices. Producing renewable energy here at home not only increases economic and strategic security, but also provides job growth and captures the wealth of energy production in the communities that produce it. Building on the success of conventional biofuels, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is working with research centers and private businesses to develop new generation biofuels made from feedstocks such as switch grass, corn stover and algae. The promise of new generation biofuels is enormous and provides the greatest hope for our work to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Additionally, USDA is interested in finding ways for rural Americans to use alternative energy technologies that harness the power of wind and sun. The wind that regularly whips through the Great Plains and across Texas can drive turbines that provide energy to individual farms or for sale to the electrical grid. The powerful sun in the American Southwest can heat the solar panels that provide the energy to operate a business or defray the energy costs in a home. One important way we support the effort to expand renewable energy generation and use is through the Rural Energy for America Program. REAP gives rural Americans the opportunity to take the lead in the production of alternative energy by tapping into all of rural America's natural resource strengths. The program supports, among other things, biomass, wind and solar energy projects from applications received from rural small business owners or agricultural producers. Under the REAP program, $61 million has been made available in guaranteed loans and $42 million has been made available for grants. Those funds can be used for various energy efficiency projects including anaerobic digesters on livestock farms, audits of energy improvements and, now, flex-fuel pumps. For additional information, refer to www.rurdev.usda.gov. With tools like the REAP program, USDA is helping rural America lead the way to our nation's renewable energy future. And we can't afford to wait any longer for our economy, our national security, and for prices at the gas pump.

The key is to implement efficient and sustainable practices that reduce costs, increase yields, and decrease environmental impact. Here are some strategies the USDA could employ: 1. **Diversification of Feedstocks**: - **Switch Grass**: As mentioned, switch grass can be a significant source of feedstock. Its low water requirement makes it ideal for regions where water is scarce. - **Corn Stover and Other Agricultural Waste**: Utilizing crop residues as feedstocks not only reduces waste but also increases the economic viability of biofuel production. - **Algae**: Algae-based biofuels offer a high-energy density option. However, challenges such as high production costs need to be overcome for it to become a viable competitor. - **Other Feedstocks**: Exploring other potential feedstocks like agricultural by-products, forestry residues, and even urban waste could provide a more diverse base of input materials. 2. **Innovative Production Methods**: - **Advanced Biochemical Processes**: Implementing cutting-edge biochemical processes can improve efficiency in converting biomass into biofuels. - **Biorefineries**: Building integrated biorefineries where various products from the same biomass (e.g., fuels, chemicals, animal feed) are produced could significantly enhance the profitability of the industry. 3. **Sustainable and Environmentally Friendly Production**: - Implementing practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions per unit of fuel produced. - Promoting efficient use of water and minimizing land-use changes for biofuel feedstocks can help maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services in rural areas. 4. **Economic Support and Incentives**: - The USDA could offer grants or tax breaks to encourage farmers and entrepreneurs to invest in the production and refining of next-generation biofuels. - Developing a strategic reserve for biofuels could stabilize markets, attract investment, and protect against price volatility. 5. **Research and Development (R&D) Initiatives**: - Investing in R&D can lead to breakthroughs in technology that reduce costs, increase efficiency, and ensure the environmental sustainability of biofuel production. - Public-private partnerships for R&D can leverage resources from both sectors efficiently. 6. **Infrastructure Development and Logistics**: - Building a robust infrastructure (storage facilities, pipelines) could enhance the distribution of these fuels, making them more competitive in the market. 7. **Education and Training Programs**: - Offering training programs for farmers and industry professionals on best practices for biofuel feedstock production can ensure quality input materials. - Educating consumers about the benefits of next-generation biofuels (e.g., lower emissions) could increase demand. By implementing these strategies, the USDA can help create a more competitive and sustainable biofuels industry in rural America. This approach not only fosters economic growth but also promotes environmental sustainability and social equity by supporting farmers, reducing reliance on foreign oil, and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.",2.2907346962924886e-155,0.19413919413919414,0.04044117647058823,0.10989010989010989,0.8326309323310852
"American Farmers Benefit from APHIS Bird Repellent Research  California is the “bread basket” of American agriculture.

Some of these effective ways include: 1. **Visual Repellents**: These consist of reflective materials, such as shiny tape or reflective balloons, that birds find unappealing due to their brightness. Farmers place these visual deterrents in areas where birds are most likely to congregate. 2. **Acoustic Repellents**: Sound devices emitting high-frequency sounds undetectable by humans but unpleasant for birds are used. These can be particularly effective against species like geese and ducks, which are often considered pests due to their impact on crops. 3. **Ultrasonic Repellent Devices**: Similar to acoustic repellents, these units emit ultrasonic sounds that are inaudible to the human ear but disturbing for birds. They're an efficient way to deter larger bird species without causing them harm. 4. **Bird Spinning Tape**: This is a type of visual repellent tape specifically designed with spinning reflective strips. It creates movement and reflections, making it unsettling for birds and often successfully driving them away from the protected area. 5. **Methyl Anthranilate (MA)**: MA is used as a bird repellent in agriculture. It's an organic compound that emits a very unpleasant smell to birds but is harmless to humans. This method has been shown to effectively deter bird species, especially those considered pests. 6. **Netting**: Physical barriers such as netting can also be deployed over crops or areas where birds are causing damage. Netting prevents birds from accessing these areas and thereby stops them from damaging the crops. 7. **Motion-Activated Sprinklers**: These sprinklers automatically activate when they detect motion, often startling birds away with their sudden water spray. This method doesn't harm the birds but is a simple way to deter them from certain areas. 8. **Shooting Bird-Repellent Pellets**: Some farmers and researchers use pellets that explode or produce a loud noise upon impact, startling the nearby birds away. These are designed to be non-lethal and can effectively scare birds off for extended periods without causing them harm. 9. **Hot Pepper Sprays**: Solutions made from hot peppers can irritate the eyes of birds, making it uncomfortable for them to approach areas where these sprays have been applied. 10. **Predator Decoys and Repellents**: Mimicking predators such as owls or hawks can also be an effective method in scaring off larger bird species that perceive them as threats. Some farmers use decoy models of birds of prey, along with repellent sounds or smells, to effectively deter their actual pest counterparts. These methods are not mutually exclusive and can often be used in combination for optimal results, depending on the specific needs and concerns of each farm or agricultural operation.",0.011347647119697447,0.10677618069815195,0.032989690721649485,0.0862422997946612,0.828349232673645

"Forest Hydrogeologist, U.S. Forest Service Eastern Region in  Forestry  May 31,  Water quality is monitored by volunteers with the Monday Creek Restoration Project. MCRP photo. For nearly a century, the aquatic life that once thrived in the Monday Creek Watershed has been virtually dead. The goal of this Recovery Act project, known as ""Devastation to Destination,"" is to construct a healthy functioning riparian corridor, restore water quality, and create an integrated land management strategy resulting in species diversity among existing aquatic and wildlife habitats. It is located in Perry County between the towns of New Straitsville and Shawnee, Ohio. The drainage was heavily impacted by underground mining activities in the late 's and again in the mid 's from strip mining. The drainages were blocked by piles of old mine waste and soils. The estimated 60 million gallons of water that falls here in a typical year ends up in the old mines, producing acid mine drainage which is toxic to aquatic life and has a harmful effect on the adjacent riparian vegetation. Over the last fifteen years, the Wayne National Forest and our partners have worked together to restore the watershed, which encompasses 75,000 acres in three counties. In addition to interpreting the natural history of the area, the Forest Service also has the opportunity to educate the public about the importance of continued cleanup of old abandoned mine lands. Numerous features are incorporated in the project’s clean-up activities including: opening all blocked drainages and allowing the water to flow freely from the site, creating a prairie meadow on the upper slope of the site, building a pond stocked by Ohio Department of Natural Resources with three species of fish, and planting approximately 1,300 native species suitable for each habitat created. Partners in the project include: Heavy Equipment Management Program at Hocking College, Monday Creek Restoration Project, Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the Little Cities of Black Diamonds .

"Wisconsin USDA Rural Development Public Information Officer in  Rural  Jan 04,   The time had come for a community to see what it has built when the Household Abuse Victims Emergency Network (HAVEN, Inc.) recently celebrated the grand opening of their new Domestic Abuse Shelter and Office Facility in the northern Wisconsin community of Merrill. The newly renovated building will provide improved confidentiality and security, more office space and better facilities for staff to meet with clients. The larger shelter includes six bedrooms with a total of 24 beds, more bathrooms, a large new kitchen designed for convenient use by multiple residents, better laundry facilities, and is handicapped accessible. There is also a large living and dining area for residents, a children’s play room and a teen room. The lower level includes a room which can be used for groups or meetings. Established in , HAVEN, Inc. works to support the needs of the community by providing services to children, families, and adults who have been affected by abuse, violence, or sexual assault. When first started, the group used members’ homes for temporary shelters for abuse victims. It bought its first shelter building in . As the need for services grew, it became evident that a new, larger shelter was needed. A convenient building, the former Lincoln County Land Services Building known as ""the Annex"" was vacant with no prospective buyer. With $65,000 in the building fund, the HAVEN Board of Directors made an offer to the County Board for the Annex building, well below the County’s asking price of $249,000. The sale was unanimously approved last February. Through a capital campaign, lead by volunteers, more than a half a million dollars was raised for the rehabilitation project. Community businesses and residents also donated materials, services, time, and furnishings to the new shelter. It was announced at the grand opening event that more than 2,800 volunteer hours were put towards the completion of the new facility. HAVEN, Inc. was also awarded a $100,000 USDA Rural Development Community Facilities Grant for the renovation project. Grant funds were used toward the purchase of furnishings and equipment for the new shelter building including an elevator, sprinkler system, fencing, plumbing fixtures, a new security system, updated phone system, parking lot resurfacing, landscaping and cabinetry.  Additional funding came from the Merrill Housing Authority, WHEDA, the Merrill Community Foundation, private donations and in the form of a cooperative loan provided by three Merrill banks.

"New Film to be Shown at USDA: Restoring the South's Brook Trout--Raise a Glass of Water to the Return of a Regional Icon  For a community of brook trout in the southern Appalachian mountains, there are signs that the good times are coming back. To some, these native inhabitants might even appear to be waving a welcome home sign. Their numbers almost vanquished, they are as much a cultural emblem of these rugged and lush mountain forests as they are an important signal for the highest quality drinking water. This is what makes their fate of such interest to the millions who live in the surrounding watersheds and to those involved in an inspiring partnership to help them along. They are also the subject of a new film, “Bringing Back the Brooks: Reviving the South’s Trout” produced by Freshwaters Illustrated in partnership with the U.S. Forest Service.

"Forest Service Stream Technology Can Prevent Road and Bridge Washouts  Remember the devastating floods in Vermont – the worst in a century – that made national headlines late last August?  Hurricane Irene pounded Vermont and the Green Mountain National Forest and New Hampshire and the White Mountain National Forest with up to 12 inches of rain in less than a day.  Many communities were left reeling from the massive flood damage for weeks and months in post-storm recovery efforts. More than 500 road miles and 200 bridges and culverts were destroyed or damaged.  Communities were left stranded by the flood’s devastation of the transportation infrastructure.  Millions of dollars of property damage occurred.  Residents also suffered increased costs related to emergency service access, commuting time and lost tourism revenue.  Aquatic life was also harmed when heavy machinery cleared “debris” and reshaped rivers.

After a devastating flood, massive amounts of sediment and debris are carried by water into rivers and waterways, which can settle at the bottom or be deposited in new locations. This process, known as sedimentation, can reshape rivers, alter habitats, and lead to long-term changes in aquatic ecosystems. The sedimentation from floods can cause various problems for aquatic life, including: 1. Changes in river morphology: The deposited sediment can alter the river's course, widening or narrowing it, which affects water flow rates and quality. 2. Habitat disruption: New sediment deposits can create new habitats or destroy existing ones, impacting local biodiversity. 3. Water pollution: Sedimentation can carry pollutants and contaminants into aquatic environments, harming plants and animals that live there. 4. Decreased oxygen levels: The decomposition of organic matter in the sediment can consume oxygen from the water, creating low-oxygen conditions that are difficult for some species to survive. As a result of these changes, aquatic life may struggle to adapt, and reshaped rivers can have lasting impacts on local ecosystems.",5.0306744279006446e-232,0.04395604395604395,0.022222222222222223,0.04395604395604395,0.8384838104248047
"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way from the Summit: How REE is Using New Strategies to Reach Even Newer Poultry Handlers  During a walk along tree-shading sidewalks in the “burbs”; you’re accustomed to seeing games of hopscotch, bike rides, and maybe even the occasional Golden Retriever. However, one residential backyard, nearly 6 miles from downtown Atlanta, calls into question whether this is suburbia at all. There were swings, a tree house, and even patio furniture. Yet one feature certified this was not your mother’s suburban home: over a dozen chickens living comfortably in a custom made “Coop de Ville.”    The rise of “backyard poultry” is one of many agricultural phenomena tied to a growing food consciousness and increased urbanization. And while USDA’s fundamental job doesn’t change, the Department does because the challenges do.  The recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at increasingly popular backyard chicken coops underscore this. While this concern was not clearly expressed in the Act of Congress that created the Department, the mandate was. USDA still works to “acquire and to diffuse…information” towards facilitating the protected growth of American agriculture. That service is what brought Research, Education, and Economics Undersecretary Dr. Catherine Woteki to this residence in Decatur, GA. Accompanied by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service officials and a man known best as the “Chicken Whisperer,” Dr. Woteki toured the site and helped to shed light on current HPAI research and important biosafety measures.

Some of these challenges include: 1. **Detection and Monitoring**: With the increasing number of backyard chickens, it becomes more difficult for USDA to detect and monitor HPAI outbreaks quickly. Many backyard chicken owners may not report suspected cases or may be unaware that their birds are infected. 2. **Limited Resources**: The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has limited resources to devote to responding to HPAI cases, particularly in small-scale backyard settings. 3. **Regulatory Framework**: The regulatory framework governing backyard chickens is often unclear or inconsistent across different states and local jurisdictions, making it challenging for USDA to develop a coordinated response to HPAI outbreaks. 4. **Public Education and Awareness**: Many backyard chicken owners may not be aware of the risks associated with HPAI or the importance of biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of the disease. Raising public awareness and educating backyard chicken keepers about best practices is essential but can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive effort. 5. **Biosecurity Measures**: Ensuring that backyard chicken coops have adequate biosecurity measures in place, such as proper sanitation, disinfection, and quarantine procedures, can be challenging, particularly for smaller operations. 6. **Coordination with State and Local Authorities**: USDA must coordinate with state and local authorities to respond effectively to HPAI outbreaks on a case-by-case basis, which can be time-consuming and may lead to delays in responding to emerging cases. 7. **Balancing Public Health and Animal Welfare Concerns**: The USDA must balance the need to protect public health by controlling HPAI outbreaks with the need to ensure animal welfare and the humane treatment of affected birds. By understanding these challenges, USDA can develop targeted strategies to address the risks associated with HPAI in backyard chicken coops and mitigate the impact of these cases on human and animal health.",0.043212197036865886,0.14246575342465753,0.07713498622589533,0.12602739726027398,0.854861855506897

This sets them apart from traditional businesses, which are typically owned by individuals or corporations. 2. **Democratic decision-making**: Cooperative decisions are made democratically, with all members having an equal say in the direction of the business. 3. **Not-for-profit**: Cooperatives operate on a not-for-profit basis, meaning that any surplus is reinvested to benefit the members rather than being distributed as dividends to shareholders. 4. **Service to members**: Cooperatives are formed to meet the needs and interests of their member-owners, providing essential goods and services that might otherwise be unavailable or unaffordable. 5. **Autonomy and independence**: Cooperatives are independent entities, free from external control and influence. These principles and values, as celebrated during National Co-op Month, distinguish cooperatives as a unique business form that prioritizes the well-being of its members and the community over profit maximization.",1.669538576945774e-155,0.08955223880597014,0.020100502512562814,0.06965174129353233,0.8356751203536987
"Associate Administrator for USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and leader of USDA’s ASF efforts in  Animals  Dec 09,  USDA has a proven track record of protecting U.S. farmers from foreign animal and plant pests and diseases. When African Swine Fever (ASF) was detected in the Dominican Republic and Haiti this summer, we swung into action and immediately enhanced existing exclusion efforts due to the proximity of the detections to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Working closely with federal partners, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and industry, we are actively:  Enhancing ASF surveillance in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands;  Expanding an existing classical swine fever sampling program to include ASF;  Implementing an enhanced outreach program in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, to remind residents not to bring in foreign pork and pork products from ASF-affected countries;  Working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to increase inspections of Dominican Republic flights for prohibited products and ensure proper disposal of airplane garbage;  Continuing efforts to remove urban Puerto Rican feral swine To further protect U.S. swine production, we suspended the interstate movement of all live swine, swine germplasm, swine products, and swine byproducts from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to the U.S. mainland. We also established an OIE-recognized foreign animal disease protection zone (PZ) around Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to prevent disease entry and protect mainland producers and their markets. We are providing the Dominican Republic with important technical assistance, particularly laboratory expertise, as part of a surveillance program and working with them to determine next steps. Here at home we’ve reached out to domestic producers to remind them of the critical importance of biosecurity on US farm and are working with our partners in the Agricultural Research Service on promising vaccine research. Our experts are examining possible ASF-introduction pathways and identifying risk-reducing strategies. We will continue to take these and any other actions necessary to protect our valuable pork industry.

"Public Affairs Specialist for USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 13,  For people suffering from addiction, the chances of recovery are oftentimes only as good as the care they receive. And for decades, the Boxwood Recovery Center in Culpeper, Virginia struggled to provide the high-quality care it was capable of, as it operated out of a deteriorating former roadside motel and restaurant. “Why would you walk into a depressing place when you're probably already in a bad place in your life because of your addiction?” said Kolapo Olarinde, a Program Manager at Boxwood Recovery Center. With a desire to improve the odds of recovery for people in need, Rappahannock Rapidan Community Services (RRCS), the parent nonprofit which operates Boxwood Recovery Center, asked the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development for help. Rural Development was able to help Boxwood with a $3.2 million loan through its Community Facilities Direct Loan & Grant program which provides affordable funding to develop essential community facilities in rural areas. The loan would allow the recovery center to build a state-of-the-art, 21,000 square-foot facility. Boxwood was finally going to have a center worthy of their cause. ""I don't think you can underestimate how important proper facilities are to keep people safe and in recovery,"" said RRCS Executive Director Jim LaGraffe. Today, the Boxwood Recovery Center continues to help many people on their recovery journeys by offering residential alcohol and drug treatment programs with individual, family, and group counseling, educational films, lectures, and relapse prevention. Projects like the Boxwood Recovery Center are perfect candidates for Rural Development’s Emergency Rural Health Care Grant Program, part of the American Rescue Plan Act.

"Branch Chief, Cooperative Services at USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 30,  This October USDA is celebrating National Cooperative Month, an observance that recognizes the cooperative model, its many influential uses, and how cooperatives benefit their members in numerous ways. There are at least 30,ates providing more than $700 billion to the economy. This year’s theme is Owning Our Identity, a reference to the principles and values that distinguish cooperatives from other business forms. Cooperatives are created by individuals to tackle issues they are unable to solve individually. Co-ops have additional features that make them an attractive option in today’s environment, including the ability to address social justice, create wealth in local communities, encourage self-determination, and build capacity in a community. But cooperatives do not guarantee business success and like other business models require planning and hard work. (View the top myths about cooperatives to learn more!) Cooperatives are made up of members who collectively own, operate, and run the organization, with each member typically getting one vote on decisions. Members are also the customers and use the cooperative services from agriculture marketing, food distribution, mutual purchasing, home care, childcare, real estate, to workers joining together to continue operating businesses that otherwise would have been closed or taken over by competitors. Cooperatives are resilient as evidenced by the fact that 23 percent of the country’s agricultural cooperatives have been in business 100 years or more, 54 percent have been operating for 75 years or more, and 77 percent have been in existence 50 years or more. To achieve such resilience and own their identity, cooperatives have shown they are ready and able to thrive in their communities through the upheavals and changes in the economy; from a pandemic to competition looking to overtake their sectors, and in members’ mindsets that evolve as new generations evolve how cooperatives are run. In celebration of National Cooperative Month, learn more about the resources available at Rural Development to help communities start, sustain, or convert to a cooperative business model:  Interagency Working Group on Cooperative Development: The Interagency Working Group for Cooperative Development, led by USDA Rural Business-Cooperative Service, met five times in to uncover how cooperatives operate and benefit local people and communities in the housing, food, child care, real estate investment sectors. For National Cooperative Month, the group hosted a panel discussion featuring cooperative leaders, including newly inducted Cooperative Hall of Fame housing co-op advocate Linda Leaks.  Cooperative Services Branch: Cooperative Services provides support and information for people deciding whether and how to form a co-op. Many of these materials are used by economic development professionals, trade associations, extension educators, youth groups, and agriculture and business schools.  Cooperative Success Stories: Learn more about people who have successfully navigated Rural Development programs and services to help their communities with the cooperative business model. Co-ops are community based, resilient through economic downturns, and ready to help people meet market needs.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Research, Education, and Economics in  Research and Science  Apr 22,  As we celebrate this Earth Day, we want to share a few examples of USDA’s commitment to climate-smart research and scientific investments. USDA science efforts focus on understanding the full range of potential climate impacts, developing science-based solutions, deploying strategies, conducting analyses, creating market opportunities using climate-smart production practices and developing innovative tools for farmers, ranchers and producers. USDA’s Climate Hubs develop and deliver valuable science-based information to agricultural producers and U.S. communities and the Hubs charged with advancing USDA efforts to promote climate-resilient landscapes and rural economic systems. It’s a unique collaboration across USDA and with partnering organizations that brings USDA research into practice. Earlier this year, USDA announced a $9 million investment in Climate Hubs partnerships with Cooperative Extension to bolster climate research and share climate-smart solutions directly with the agricultural community. Under this partnership, projects focus on building net-zero emissions in agriculture on working lands and in communities. USDA launched the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate — an international initiative that seeks to address climate change and global hunger by uniting participants to significantly increase investment in and support for climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. This effort is vital to protect our planet and enable solutions at the intersection of agriculture and climate. USDA also plays an important role in supporting clean energy. USDA joined the government-wide Sustainable Aviation Fuels Grand Challenge to enable scale-up of the production and use of sustainable aviation fuels to meet 100% of domestic aviation fuel demand by . USDA researchers are developing Earth-friendly agricultural feedstocks to support this effort. These USDA-supported efforts—among many others—are part of USDA’s commitment to transform our nation’s food and energy systems in climate-smart ways that will protect our planet for generations to come.

"USDA Rural Development State Director for New York in  Rural  Apr 17,  I recently traveled to Torrey, New York to break ground on the town’s first-ever water district. This project has been more than 20 years in the making and it will improve the health and lives of people living in rural parts of the state. It will also improve the water quality and conservation efforts on the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The town received $2.4 million in funding through USDA Rural Development’s Water and Environmental Program (WEP). Once completed, this project will bring safe and reliable water to more than 40 households. I was joined by town and community leaders – both past and present – as well as the engineers from Clark Patterson Lee and Nardozzi construction teams who will be building out the new waterline. “The residents in this area have trouble with water from the lake or their wells are prone to dry out,” Town Supervisor Peter Martini said. “Some of the wells are inadequate for residential use. Once reliable wells are getting less reliable. If everything goes as planned, residents should have water from the new line by this summer.” As Earth Day approaches, projects like this one make me proud to invest in our planet and in rural America. It is an example of how USDA is partnering with rural communities to build critical infrastructure that will create jobs for people across the state and the nation. Every community needs access to modern water and wastewater systems – especially rural residents and businesses throughout New York state. USDA is proud to celebrate Earth Day to show how we are investing in locally driven solutions like this one in rural New York to expand access to safe water and reliable wastewater infrastructure, renewable energy and essential services that create jobs, build critical infrastructure and create sustainable futures for rural America.

"in Rural  Apr 19,  It’s a human right to have access to clean water and reliable wastewater systems. USDA Rural Development finances projects to build strong infrastructure to help people in rural America thrive and create economic opportunities. This week, as we celebrate Earth Day, we are proud to highlight some of the many ways USDA programs advance climate-smart infrastructure to help people have a more accessible, affordable and safe water supply. Water Independence Comes to a Rural Community in Missouri For six years, Public Water Supply District No. oddard County purchased water from a nearby community. USDA Rural Development awarded $2.6 million under the Water & Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program to make improvements to the district's drinking water production, storage and distribution system. This project is expected to enable the district to provide community members quality water from its own systems. The project will help the district drill two wells in areas with good water quality. That will help reduce operational costs because the water will require less treatment. The funds will also be used to install meters to reduce water loss and more accurately record the amount of water each customer uses. Wastewater System Upgrades Improve Health and Safety for People in Rural Tennessee The town of Baxter is improving the health and safety of the community’s residents. The town used a loan and grant totaling to $3 million through the Water and Waste Disposal Program Loan and Grant program to upgrade its wastewater treatment to provide safe and clean wastewater services to 1,350 people. The improvements will upgrade a sewer pump station and other infrastructure needs. Safe Drinking Water for Tribal and Underserved Rural Communities in Minnesota USDA Rural Development awarded the Fond du Lac Band of Chippewa Indians a loan and grant totaling to $8 million under the Water and Waste Disposal Program to make improvements to the Mahnomen community water system on the Fond du Lac Reservation in Carlton County. This project will replace two water wells, a water treatment plant and water distribution lines. The funds also will be used to build a water tank. These improvements will ensure that the Tribe’s water system is safe for the 620 residents it serves.

"Acting National Coordinator for USDA Climate Hubs, Office of Energy and Environmental Policy in  Climate  Farming  Forestry  Research and Science  Aug 08,  In June , Secretary Vilsack outlined a vision for agricultural solutions to environmental challenges, which included creating the Regional Climate Hubs. In , the USDA Climate Hubs were established in to serve as regional centers of climate change information and outreach to reduce risks. The Climate Hubs enhance USDA capacity to deliver science-based knowledge and practical information to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests. Early career professionals joined the Hubs to hone their science communication and engagement skills while supporting the Climate Hubs’ mission. In , Climate Hub Fellows focused on co-developing science-based information to help land managers make climate-informed decisions. Likewise, Hubs brought on interns and post-doctoral researchers. Climate Hubs were able to enhance engagements among land managers and scientists to co-develop science and technology. To mark the 10-year anniversary of Secretary Vilsack sharing his vision for the Climate Hubs, we share two highlights. Dr. Julian Reyes was a Climate Hub Fellow with the Southwest Climate Hub. During his fellowship, he developed, AgRisk Viewer, which empowers decision makers to assess their climate risks by commodity type at the county scale using long-term crop insurance from Risk Management Agency. This tool identifies areas of agricultural production risk due to extreme events to help target locations for adaptation actions. Haley Case-Scott was a Resource Assistance Program intern with the Northwest Climate Hub. During Haley’s internship, she engaged with Tribal Nations supporting government-to-government consultation for the 25th update to the Northwest Forest Plan. Haley also developed communication materials to share information about USDA programs that could support climate adaptation and mitigation. Both Reyes and Case-Scott have also worked with the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy (OSTP) to provide clear, useful, and useable science and knowledge to inform the Administration’s climate, environment, and nature actions and initiatives. “Communities and decision makers need actionable and usable climate information and services. My time with the USDA Climate Hubs has shown the power of co-production ensuring community voices are embedded in our place-based, people-centered work. These perspectives have also helped me in my work at OSTP,” Reyes said. “Serving as a Resource Assistant Program intern with the USDA Northwest Climate Hub was a great experience. It allowed me to take a deep dive into how the federal government works, and provided me the tools needed to build my professional career,” Case-Scott said. The Climate Hubs continue to build capacity to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests.

"NIFA, Writer/Editor in  Research and Science  Apr 20,  Feeding a world population estimated to exceed 9 billion by will require significant increases in agricultural production, yet those increases must be sustainable solutions that protect the world’s natural resources. As USDA’s primary extramural funding agency, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) invests in research, education and Extension efforts to ensure a secure food supply while protecting and enhancing the world’s natural resources. NIFA’s Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) is the nation’s leading competitive grants program for agricultural sciences. AFRI-funded science is vital to meeting food, fiber and fuel demands as the global population expands while safeguarding the world’s land and water resources. NIFA is working to transform American agriculture to increase production in sustainable ways and doing so in the context of diminishing land and water resources and a changing climate. Examples of NIFA-Supported Research Advancing Climate-Smart Ag:  Researchers at Auburn University have identified two genes that appear to coordinate the fitness of plants in defending themselves from drought while also stimulating growth. The genes will likely be good candidates to help generate crops that are truly drought tolerant.  University of California scientists are developing new instruments and analysis techniques that will provide insights into the sources and chemistry of atmospheric aerosols and the role they play in global climate and regional air pollution.  Rutgers University showed that increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide could lead to changes in soil structure. Researchers are helping develop better crop fertilization and irrigation practices that maximize yields while minimizing soil and water contamination from excess nutrients.  A microclimate study conducted by West Virginia State University Extension Service is helping landowners learn more about climate change impact on regional weather, with the goal of minimizing negative impact on seasonal crops and overall farm livelihood.  At North Dakota State University, researchers developed web-based nitrogen calculators for more efficient nitrogen management without decreasing crop yields in crops like wheat, canola, barley and sugar beets. NIFA and the projects it supports are crucial to feeding the world and protecting the Earth for future generations.

"Chief Officer, OCIO Enterprise Management Center (EDMC) in  Technology  Apr 22,  The USDA recently wrapped up a successful hackathon at Colorado State University. This event, which brought together computer science and science students around a real USDA challenge, is a prime example of the many benefits that hackathons can offer. But what exactly is a hackathon, and why are they so beneficial? A hackathon is an intensive event where participants collaborate to create solutions to specific problems. The fast-paced environment of a hackathon encourages creativity, innovation, and teamwork. By bringing together people from different backgrounds and disciplines, hackathons can foster cross-pollination of ideas and lead to the development of solutions that might not have been possible otherwise. From April 4-6, representatives from USDA joined CSU at the downtown Fort Collins, CO campus, bringing together staff from USDA-OCIO, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS), CSU’s Computer Sciences and Animal Sciences programs, and the Ram Hack student organization to conduct the 24-hour hackathon. USDA Deputy Secretary Xochitl Torres Small provided pre-recorded remarks, and the USDA Chief and AI Officer Christopher Alvares kicked off the event. Our event with CSU was developed around a real-world artificial intelligence use case for AMS. AMS is pursuing ways to expand their meat grading service and want to explore the use of image processing and artificial intelligence. Over 60 CSU students across 18 teams were challenged to develop predictive models that could accurately estimate beef grade (e.g. Prime, Choice, Select) and fat thickness using images of beef ribeye's as they would appear to an AMS meat grader. Representatives from USDA provided technical assistance to many of the hackathon’s participants. Six teams were recognized for their accomplishments and will also receive letters of appreciation and an opportunity to meet with AMS on their project. Prior to the start of the hackathon, a career fair was held with representatives from OCIO’s Office of the Chief Officer, Cybersecurity and Privacy Operations Center, Client Experience Center, and Digital Infrastructure Services Center. Representatives discussed core professional skills, resume tips, and internship opportunities at USDA. Students also heard about programs such as the US Digital Corps, GSA’s two-year tech fellowship program and a partner of USDA. We hope to strengthen relationships with CSU and other universities to not only help address real USDA problems, but also inspire students and learners through hackathon events to hone their skills and consider a tech career in USDA and public service.

"Expanding Affordable Healthcare in Rural South Carolina  Having access to quality health care is often a problem for low-income patients who live in rural communities. Fortunately, there are medical facilities such as Sandhills Medical Foundation, Inc in Lugoff, South Carolina that work on a sliding fee scale, which means that all their patients, regardless of income level, can afford quality health care. However, this has also increased their number of patients over time, and it wasn’t long before they recognized that their Lugoff office was running out of space.  Stephanie Bittiker, USDA Rural Development Public Information Officer  Posted in  Equity  Rural  Sep 16,   Respond to this story",How have expanded affordable healthcare options at Sandhills Medical increased patient care demands?,"The expanded affordable healthcare options at Sandhills Medical Foundation, Inc. have led to an increase in their patient volume, resulting in space constraints at their Lugoff office.","I'm not able to provide an answer to that question because I don't have information on the specific policies or services provided by Sandhills Medical. However, if you're looking for a general response, here's some possible reasoning: When expanded affordable healthcare options are made available at a medical facility like Sandhills Medical, it can lead to increased patient care demands in several ways: 1\. More people seek medical attention: When healthcare becomes more affordable, people who previously couldn't afford medical treatment may now come forward for help. This means the number of patients seeking care might rise. 2\. Increased access to preventive services: Affordable healthcare options often allow individuals to engage in regular check-ups, screenings, and preventative treatments earlier on. As a result, doctors may have more patients visiting them for routine health checks or with treatable conditions that require early intervention.",0.020733401167297844,0.18285714285714286,0.046242774566473986,0.14857142857142855,0.8567824959754944
"of Agriculture Xochitl Torres Small in  Equity  Aug 01,  Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has advanced equity by listening to the people we serve and learning how we can serve them better by removing barriers to our programs and services. USDA offices and agencies have developed key actions to comprehensively incorporate equity into the Department’s services, which touch every American’s life. USDA Rural Development’s Equity Action Plan was one of the last projects I worked on as Under Secretary of that mission area. So I know firsthand how hard USDA staff have worked to make change. Now in my new role as Deputy Secretary, I am thrilled to share the release of 14 Equity Action Plans that encompass the work across all of USDA. These plans follow the lead of President Biden’s Executive Order 1, which insists that federal agencies use all the policy levers we have to make progress. Founded on the insight that our country is stronger when everyone participates, and more vulnerable when people are left out, the plans released today are part of our relentless focus to shape USDA to truly be what President Lincoln called us, the People’s Department. While the plans are ambitious, I know they are achievable. The plans share both accomplishments and actions underway. A few examples of the accomplishments include:  Simplified direct farm loan application processes. The Farm Service Agency drastically reduced the burden and time necessary for farmers and ranchers applying for loans. FSA has also rolled out a loan assistance tool that helps farmers and ranchers better navigate the farm loan application process.  Regional Food Business Centers. A dozen Food Business Centers will support a more resilient, diverse, and competitive food system. These Centers—led by partners who include the Mississippi Delta Council for Farmworker Opportunities, the Georgia Minority Outreach Network, and the Intertribal Agriculture Council—will support producers by providing localized assistance to access local and regional supply chains, including linking producers to wholesalers and distributors.  Rural Partners Network – The Rural Partners Network (RPN) is an alliance of federal agencies and commissions, led by USDA Rural Development, working directly with rural communities to expand rural prosperity through job creation, infrastructure development, and community improvement.  Embracing Tribal Sovereignty. The Forest Service has embraced Tribal self-determination principles, releasing the USDA Forest Service Action Plan: Strengthening Tribal Consultations and Nation-to-Nation Relationships, and furthering co-stewardship agreements.  Microfarms at RMA — The Risk Management Agency (RMA) issued a Micro Farm policy to provide additional insurance options for small-scale producers. The policy development process included obtaining feedback from small-scale producers that have grown products for their local communities. But of course there’s still plenty of room for improvement. Some of our plans include:  Increasing access to nutrition programs. FNS will support State and local partnerships to increase the reach of nutrition programs in underserved communities and will continue to expand online shopping.

"Six Myths About Cooperatives Debunked  Co-ops are a business structure, and like any business, they require hard work to be successful. They are unique in that they bring individuals together to solve issues they wouldn’t be able to solve on their own. Cooperatives can help communities by creating jobs, meeting social or economic needs, and improving community services. Despite a myriad of benefits, there are many myths that prevent people from recognizing their value.  Darrah Perryman, Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Rural Development  Posted in  Rural  Oct 17,   Respond to this story",What specific ways do cooperatives help communities solve issues they wouldn't be able to tackle on their own?,"Cooperatives create jobs, meet social or economic needs, and improve community services by bringing individuals together to solve these issues.","Cooperatives play a vital role in helping communities address various challenges by providing unique benefits that individual members or governments alone might not be able to achieve. Here are some specific ways cooperatives assist communities in solving issues they couldn't tackle on their own: 1. **Shared Resources and Expertise**: Cooperatives pool resources, skills, and knowledge within a community, enabling them to access expertise and economies of scale that would be unaffordable or inaccessible for individual members. 2. **Decentralized Decision Making**: Cooperative structures often involve decision-making at the grassroots level, allowing communities to set their own goals, make decisions about investments, and ensure projects are tailored to local needs. 3. **Social and Economic Sustainability**: Cooperatives prioritize both economic viability and social responsibility. They can provide essential services like healthcare, education, or credit facilities that would otherwise be lacking in a community, especially in rural areas or regions with limited public resources. 4. **Community Empowerment**: By being owned and controlled by members themselves, cooperatives empower communities to take control of their futures. This can lead to greater social cohesion, community pride, and local economic development. 5. **Adaptability and Resilience**: Cooperatives are inherently more adaptable than centralized systems or private corporations because they are driven by the needs and inputs of their community members. This adaptability is crucial for responding to changing environmental conditions, economic shifts, or unexpected challenges that might arise within a community. 6. **Environmental Conservation**: In many cases, cooperatives focus on sustainable practices, renewable energy sources, or conservation efforts that help protect local ecosystems and natural resources. 7. **Job Creation and Local Economic Development**: Cooperatives can create jobs directly through their operations or indirectly by stimulating local economies through services and activities they facilitate. 8. **Community-Led Initiatives**: By allowing communities to propose and manage projects themselves, cooperatives enable community-led initiatives that are more likely to meet specific needs of the area rather than generic plans imposed from outside. 9. **Reducing Dependence on External Aid**: Cooperatives can help communities become less reliant on external financial or technical aid, promoting self-sufficiency and a sense of independence. 10. **Community Education and Training**: Many cooperatives incorporate education and training programs to enhance the skills and knowledge of their members, contributing to personal and collective development within the community. In summary, cooperatives offer unique solutions for communities by combining shared resources with local decision-making, fostering social and economic sustainability, empowering community participation, adapting to changing needs, conserving environments, creating jobs, leading initiatives based on local wisdom, reducing dependence on external aid, and promoting education and training. These elements combine to make cooperatives powerful tools for addressing the challenges that communities might otherwise be unable to tackle alone.",7.544641259221007e-232,0.07264957264957264,0.008583690987124463,0.04700854700854701,0.827527642250061
"Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19?  Last year, as COVID-19 rattled the world economy and disrupted trade flows, agricultural trade remained mostly stable, falling only two percent during the initial wave of infections and lockdowns, before bouncing back and ending the year up 3.5 percent. But the growth in agricultural trade doesn’t mean that trade flows were insulated from the effects of the pandemic. Much of was in fact shaped by other factors. For instance, 95% of global agricultural trade growth came from China and was driven in part by non-pandemic related factors of increased feed demand, efforts to restock grain reserves, and policy factors. A recent paper by USDA’s Office of the Chief Economist, Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19? Findings from an Econometric Assessment (, 1.4 ) (Arita et al.), suggests that while agricultural trade remained stable at the aggregate level, a deeper empirical analysis reveals there were still significant disruptions due to the pandemic.

"USDA Foreign Agricultural Service in  Climate  Farming  Technology  Trade  Aug 09,  Accurate crop mapping is a crucial process to informing reliable crop production estimates, addressing climate change, and developing strategies for sustainable agriculture. U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service is working with university students in Tanzania on a pilot project to gather grassroots to strengthen community agricultural systems and improve crop condition assessments with satellite imagery. Their field work is adding truth from the ground up to the sky. In April, 14 YouthMappers spent four days in the Arusha area capturing on 334 fields by photographing, georeferencing, and identifying target crops to enhance FAS satellite imagery analysis. YouthMappers is an international network of university-based chapters that organize and implement mapping activities in response to global and local development needs. “The YouthMappers’ chapters are products under USAID, which empower youth to help their community,” said Gideon G. Sway, one of the Tanzania YouthMappers. The FAS-YouthMappers team’s main objective was to create an agricultural library of ground-truth from the Arusha, Dodoma, and Mwanza regions. This activity is the first time YouthMappers has used its members’ skills to strengthen agricultural . While Tanzania grows several kinds of crops, making this a viable machine learning project the team to focus on locating target crops of FAS’ International Production Assessment Division (IPAD). Oftentimes, crops are grown together in larger fields and can be detectable by freely available satellite imagery. In addition to geo-locating these crops, the team’s field work revealed variability in crop heights and exposed pest damage—especially from the fall army worm. This future-facing project improves understanding of crop conditions and the impact of seasonal rains. Since the project began, the Tanzanian YouthMappers network has collected from 1,700 fields in the Arusha, Dodoma, and Mwanza regions. Thanks to YouthMappers, FAS can now pair satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 with the field . In May, these YouthMappers, trained additional university students on geo-mapping with ArcGIS, OpenStreetMap, and Kobo Collect to help advance Tanzanian agriculture and achieve project goals for the Dodoma and Mwanza regions. The Tanzania partnership is part of FAS efforts to help develop young agricultural leaders to strengthen Africa’s self-development and capacity building. Be on the lookout for this group’s presentation next month at the Africa Food Systems Forum. The goal of the Forum is for public, private, and non-profit groups to strengthen African agricultural and food systems via inclusivity, sustainability, resiliency, and equity.

An E-Government Fund was also established to provide funding for projects intended to allow for easier public access to information, improved government services and transactions, and enhanced agency information technology project coordination and planning. The E-GOV initiatives serve citizens, businesses, and Federal and state government employees by delivering high quality services more efficiently at a lower price. Instead of expensive “stove piped” operations, agencies work together to develop common solutions which achieve mission requirements at reduced cost, thereby making resources available for higher priority needs. USDA currently participates in 14 Presidential E-GOV Initiatives and Lines of Business (LoB).  By participating in the E-GOV Initiatives and LoBs, USDA has improved its business processes and program delivery to its customers, employees, and partners.  Through these efforts, USDA has been able to work with other Federal agencies to streamline common areas of business delivery (e.g. rulemaking, payroll, and grants management) and learn from best practices throughout the government.  The Department will continue to implement these Initiatives and LoBs to achieve further benefits for its customers. The OCIO E-GOV Office serves as USDA’s focal point for E-GOV Presidential Initiatives and Lines of Business, as well as the USDA liaison to the Office of Management and Budget regarding E-GOV. The office provides oversight and guidance to the development and implementation of USDA-wide policies, standards, and procedures for E-GOV implementations. The office manages USDA’s E-GOV relationships with other Federal agencies. It identifies and promotes common enterprise solutions to enable improvements in USDA’s business, information, and technology infrastructures to reduce overall funding requirements.  It also provides leadership in addressing and resolving IT department-wide issues and obstacles to achieving E-GOV objectives.","What is the primary goal of the Electronic Government Act's Office of Electronic Government in promoting interagency cooperation, implementing initiatives, and making resources available across government agencies?","The primary goal of the Electronic Government Act's Office of Electronic Government is to improve public services, make resources available for higher priority needs, and reduce costs by enabling agencies to work together to develop common solutions.","I don't have access to a search engine to provide information about the specific goals of the Electronic Government Act's Office of Electronic Government.

"Information Technology (IT) plays a critical role in the Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) ability to carry out its mission to “…provide leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, nutrition, and related issues based on sound public policy, the best available science, and efficient management.” Each year the complexity of the IT environment grows, and making sound IT investment decisions requires greater amounts of information. For example, the Department improves the Nation’s economy and quality of life by touching the lives of almost every person in America, every day. Nearly 100,000 employees deliver more than $144 billion in public services through the Department’s more than 300 programs worldwide, providing leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, nutrition, and related issues based on sound public policy, the best available science, and efficient management. USDA needs to respond effectively to the challenges posed by the diversity, complexity, and volume of IT investment proposals brought forward by various stakeholders throughout the Department. This new integrated IT governance framework supports government priorities and program delivery. USDA’s Integrated Information Technology Governance Framework (IITGF) is a holistic set of processes, procedures, and that assist the Office of the Chief Information Officer’s (OCIO’s) customers improve mission delivery. It does this by providing structure around the budget formulation, budget execution, enterprise architecture, capital planning, IT security, Section 508, Records Management, and portfolio/project management processes. Implementing the IITGF satisfies the following goals:  Provides a coherent and effective project management methodology to guide IT project management at USDA. The methodology is intended to consistently deliver IT capabilities that provide maximum support to USDA business needs within approved cost and schedule constraints.  Better integrates IT project planning and execution with IT Governance, including more effective multi-disciplinary reviews of IT projects by the stakeholders and IT executive governance bodies. The IITGF includes touch points with other USDA’s governance, management, and control activities and processes, such as: Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC), Agriculture’s System Development Life Cycle (AgSDLC) approach, Project Management (PM), Enterprise Architecture (EA), Risk Management Framework (RMF), and IT Security. Implementing an Integrated IT Governance Framework further supports the USDA mission by providing the alignment for decisions with needed technology components, services, and applications. An important objective of the IITGF Life Cycle is to provide flexibility that allows for tailoring of artifacts, decision gate reviews, and governance board reviews to suit the characteristics of a particular solution development effort. If tailoring is approved in advance by the governance board, these alternative development approaches empower project managers to tailor tasks in order to meet the specific needs of the project while maintaining compliance with the AgSDLC and IITGF governance processes. Some of the most popular, time and cost effective alternative development models are: Rapid Application Development (RAD), Pilot Development, Iterative, Agile, Government off the Shelf (GOTS)/Commercial off the Shelf (COTS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

"Who Are We? The Enterprise Architecture Division provides a planning concept and delivery process designed to help translate business strategies into mission results. We leverage as a strategic asset so that architecture becomes a tool to make -driven decisions that optimize resources, identify duplication, and cost saving opportunities. The EAD team supports the creation of an integrated, tiered Enterprise Architecture (EA) that supports improved planning and risk management at both the agency and Department levels. Additionally, the team supports standardization on common computing platforms to enhance interoperability and reduce cost of ownership; and improving the USDA’s planning and decision-making by more closely aligning EA activities to the IT Capital Planning processes. EAD provides and maintains for USDA a centralized EAVE (Enterprise Architecture Visioning Environment) that aligns IT assets to the Federal Enterprise Architecture reference models. Through its collection and reporting capabilities, the EAVE enables organizations to better identify collaboration, modernization and transformation opportunities. The EAD reinforces the adoption and documentation of technical standards, making it easier for USDA agencies to realize economies-of-scale cost savings based on aggregated purchases of like products and services. Additionally, the EA helps USDA identify opportunities for business reuse and sharing of existing infrastructure and services, reducing operational and overhead costs. What Do We Do? Enterprise Architecture gives the Department a bird’s eye view of the whole organization – and the ecosystem in which it operates both at a high level and detailed level as it matures overtime. EA is unique from other disciplines within the IT Management Framework in that it:  Encompasses the whole mission and operational scope of the Department  Represents the Department’s ecosystem at a high level of detail  Is based on a metamodel comprised of modular components making it reusable across the practice area in a wide range of scenarios Enterprise Architecture informs and translates strategies and business model changes into a set of coordinated actions needed to make them real via a roadmap. It has a special role between IT Strategy and IT Execution. Consider it a bridge between the two as it defines priorities and scope for translating strategy into operational reality.  Enabling an Actionable Architecture - Supports Agencies in making informed decisions concerning technology investments by implementing an “actionable architecture” which takes enterprise architecture from being a goal and moves it to becoming a platform for decision support.

"Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) is a systematic approach to selecting, managing, and evaluating information technology investments. Optimizing the Performance of IT Investments Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) is a systematic approach to selecting, managing, and evaluating information technology investments. CPIC is mandated by the Clinger Cohen Act of which requires federal agencies to focus on the results produced by IT investments. Here’s how we guide our clients through the CPIC lifecycle: Pre-Select Phase—Executive decision-makers assess each proposed investment’s support of USDA’s strategic and mission needs. Project managers compile the information necessary for supporting a detailed investment proposal. Select Phase—Investment analyses are conducted and the members of the E-Board choose the IT projects that best support USDA’s mission and enterprise architecture. Control Phase—USDA ensures, through timely oversight, quality control, and executive review, that IT investments are executed or developed in a disciplined, well-managed, and consistent manner. Evaluate Phase—Actual results of the implemented projects are compared to planned results to assess investment performance. Once investments are implemented, actual versus expected results are evaluated to: assess the investment's impact on strategic performance; identify any changes or modifications to the investment that may be needed; and revise the investment management processes based on lessons learned, self-assessments and benchmarking.

This involves converting sugarcane into a bio-oil that can be further refined and converted into a variety of fuels, including diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel. One innovative approach being explored by the USDA is the production of butanol from sugarcane. Butanol is a high-energy-density liquid fuel that can be used as a direct replacement for gasoline in existing engines. The production process involves converting sugarcane into a bio-oil through a series of chemical reactions, followed by fermentation to produce butanol. The use of sugarcane as a feedstock for advanced biofuels offers several advantages over traditional fossil fuels. Sugarcane is a renewable and sustainable resource that can be grown in tropical regions with minimal environmental impact. Additionally, the production process generates biogas as a byproduct, which can be used to power the factory or sold as an energy source.

"Communications Director, USDA Rural Development, Tennessee in  Energy  Rural  Feb 01,   USDA Business and Cooperative Programs Administrator Judith Canales convened a roundtable of renewable energy experts from the southeast in Nashville on January 26, to discuss development and marketing of bioenergy technologies and advanced biofuels. Despite an unexpected snow the night before, participants traveled in from Memphis and Knoxville as well as Middle Tennessee. FSA and Rural Development State Directors Gene Davidson and Bobby Goode hosted the Administrator and Ed Harlan of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Louis Buck of Tennessee Biomass Supply Cooperative, Pete Nelson of Memphis Bioworks, Atha Comiskey and Bart Comiskey of Clean Cities of Middle Tennessee, Paul Melgaard of Eco Energy, Terry Ruse of Clean Fuels Development Coalition, Warren Nevad of the Tennessee Renewable Energy Economic Council, Dan Stasser of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Stan Boyd and David Owenby of the Tennessee Department of Transportation and Rural Development Tennessee Energy Programs Coordinator Will Dodson. Canales opened the forum with the idea that, ""By making renewable energy sources commercially viable based on feed stock available in each region of the country, we create sustainable opportunities for job creation and economic development, and keep more energy dollars in the community."" The spirited discussion covered a range of challenges on the horizon for the emerging bioenergy industry from traditional fuel providers to misperceptions about the tradeoff between food and fuel crops. Canales emphasized that changes are coming to the USDA energy programs that will allow applications to be submitted year round and to encourage geographic and technological diversity. Canales and others brought up the regional nature of biofuel production. Regionally significant feed stocks mentioned included cellulosic switch grass, wood pulp and sucrose-rich crops. With the commercial availability of existing flex fuels growing rapidly, participants called for a fresh examination of regulations intended to encourage their use. ""Greater use helps drive down production costs and will encourage more stations to carry fuels like E20, E30 and E85 as they come online,"" said Goode. ""We can help drive the change to cleaner fuels by doing more to take advantage of flex fuels in fleet vehicles and by educating consumers on the benefits of using more renewable American-made energy resources."" Coop Manager Louis Buck said that with the advances being made in bioenergy production today he looks forward to a time when farmers send power down wires to the city and get a check delivered back in the mail. Electronic mail, presumably. During the roundtable, Canales also announced the award of a $25,000 Rural Energy for America (REAP) grant to the Tennessee Biomass Supply Cooperative.

"Missouri State Director and George Thomas, Public Information Coordinator in  Energy  Rural  Apr 14,   To “flex” or not, that is a good question.  I own a flexible fuel vehicle and have for several years and as a Government Agency, Rural Development has government owned vehicles that accommodate flexible fuel.  As State Director, I travel throughout Missouri and even though I have the appropriate vehicle and even though there is an adequate supply of renewable fuels, there is an inadequate number of service stations that have flexible fuel pumps.  Compound this with the desire to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and make our nation more environmentally clean, you can imagine my reaction when Rural Development announced a program as part of the solution to address these issues. There was excitement in Jefferson City, Missouri’s State Capitol, when Judith Canales, Administrator for USDA Rural Development Rural Business-Cooperative Programs kicked off  Rural Development’s  Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) workshop on flex-fuel options.  Canales informed the 45 people in attendance that grants are available to provide fuel station owners with incentives to install flexible fuel pumps that will offer Americans more renewable energy options. Pictured left to right: John Eggleston, Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives; Bradley Schad, Missouri Corn Growers Association; Judith Canales, USDA Rural Business-Cooperative Service Administrator; Matt Amick, Missouri Corn Growers Association; Gary Wheeler, Missouri Corn Growers Association; and Janie Dunning, USDA Rural Development Missouri State Director The event was hosted by the Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives and their Secretary/Treasurer, John Eggleston, (also a 30-year pioneer of the ethanol industry in Missouri).  He  emphasized the importance of ethanol as a renewable energy source in reducing America’s dependency on foreign oil. Matt Moore, Director Business Programs for Missouri Rural Development (RD), illustrated that the REAP incentives offer options for financing the conversion of fuel stations pumps or installation of new flex fuel pumps resulting in a choice for Missourians when purchasing fuel in the future. The REAP incentives can be coupled with $5,000 incentives offered from both Growth Energy and the Missouri Corn Growers Association according to Bradley Schad, Director of Ethanol Blends with the Missouri Corn Growers Association. Other stakeholders in attendance that provided comments in support of the renewable energy programs included: Loyd Wilson, Division Director for Missouri Department of Agriculture; J.P. Dunn, Missouri Soybean Association;   Tom May,  Marketing Director for MFA Oil Company;  retailers, flex fuel pump distributors and others. As a highlight, the Missouri Corn Growers brought to the meeting a flex fuel pump for all the attendees and media to see. During the Question and Answer session of the meeting, it was pointed out that a small convenience store chain was exploring the possibility of putting new fuel dispensers in at several of their locations. Canales summed up the day by saying, “I want to make certain that everyone is aware of the variety of assistance USDA Rural Development provides to help businesses create jobs and become energy more efficient.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Conservation  Feb 24,  Red-backed salamanders and other amphibians are key players in ecosystem health. (iStock photo) Forested areas that border wetlands help protect wildlife, but until recently their efficacy has been untested for most amphibian species.  Now, recently published results of a six-year study explore how the loss or reduction of amphibians could affect the ecosystem. At the University of New Hampshire, Dr. Kimberly Babbitt and a team of graduate students conducted landscape-scale experiments that tested the impacts of forest buffer width vernal pools on population size and structure, body size and condition and population genetics of two amphibian species in the northeastern United States. A grant from USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supported the project. The investigation examined the response of spotted salamanders and wood frogs in three environments: wetlands surrounded by either intact forest, a 30-meter forest buffer surrounded by a 100-meter clearcut, and a 100-meter forest buffer surrounded by a 100-meter clearcut. The study indicates that areas with smaller buffers had negative impact on size and condition of salamanders and frogs. Analysis of genetic relatedness indicated that, despite logging, populations across the broader landscape are well-connected. Babbitt and doctoral student Danial Hocking also examined the role of amphibians in forest floor ecosystem function and conducted a review of amphibian contribution to ecosystem services. “We found that amphibians contribute in a variety of ways to human societies,” Babbitt said.  “We are examining the roles in different forest types to understand under what context salamanders can influence ecosystem functions, such as decomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant growth.” Some of the beneficial effects of amphibians on the ecosystem are known, such as the ability of tadpoles reduce eutrophication (greening) by consuming excess algae.  In many ecosystems means that amphibians have important roles both as food sources and as predators – amphibians feed heavily on mosquitoes, making them an important line of defense against mosquito-borne diseases, including the West Nile virus.  Babbitt noted many that amphibians have a lot more to offer – if we can ensure their survival. “Although yet to result in approved pharmaceuticals, amphibian skin secretions have shown the ability to inhibit HIV transmission and provide stronger analgesic effects than opioids,” she said. “Learning from these chemical secretions could lead to breakthroughs in human medicine. However, amphibians are declining across the globe and species are going extinct. It’s important to protect species before potential advances are lost.” NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.  Greater understanding of how forest buffers can protect the amphibians that serve the ecosystem is important knowledge that will help states, communities, and landowners make more informed decisions about land use and management, Babbitt said.

The loss or reduction of amphibians, however, can have significant consequences for ecosystem health, including reduced decomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant growth.","**Role of Forest Buffers in Protecting Amphibians** Forest buffers, also known as riparian zones or buffer strips, play a crucial role in protecting amphibian populations, such as salamanders and frogs. These areas, typically 10-50 meters wide along waterways, serve as habitat corridors for terrestrial and semi-aquatic species. Forest buffers: 1. **Provide shelter**: Trees and shrubs offer hiding spots and protection from predators, harsh weather conditions, and human activities. 2. **Maintain water quality**: Vegetation helps to filter out sediments, nutrients, and pollutants from runoff, keeping waterways clean and suitable for amphibian life stages (e.g., breeding, larval development). 3. **Regulate temperature and humidity**: Trees create a microclimate that maintains optimal temperatures and humidity levels for amphibians, which are sensitive to extreme conditions. 4. **Support food webs**: Forest buffers support complex food webs, with plants serving as primary producers, supporting herbivores, carnivores, and decomposers, which in turn sustain larger predator-prey relationships. **Implications of Amphibian Loss or Reduction** The loss or reduction of amphibian populations has significant implications for ecosystem health: 1. **Ecosystem disruption**: Amphibians play key roles in food webs, serving as both predators and prey. Their decline can disrupt entire ecosystems, leading to cascading effects on population dynamics and community structure. 2. **Indicators of broader environmental issues**: Amphibians are sensitive to environmental changes, making them useful indicators of ecosystem health. Changes in amphibian populations can signal broader problems, such as habitat degradation, climate change, or pollution. 3. **Loss of ecological resilience**: Amphibians contribute to ecosystem resilience by regulating pest populations and serving as a food source for other animals. Their decline can compromise the ability of ecosystems to withstand disturbances and recover from stressors. 4. **Biological diversity reduction**: The loss of amphibian species contributes to broader biodiversity declines, compromising ecosystem functioning and human well-being. **Conservation Implications** To protect amphibians and maintain ecosystem health: 1. **Preserve and restore forest buffers**: Protecting or restoring these areas can help maintain habitat quality and connectivity for terrestrial and semi-aquatic species. 2. **Monitor and manage human impacts**: Implement measures to reduce pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change effects on amphibian populations. 3. **Conduct research and monitoring**: Continuously study amphibian ecology and population dynamics to better understand the relationships between these animals and their environments. 4. **Develop effective conservation strategies**: Create targeted conservation plans that address specific threats and promote long-term ecosystem health. By understanding the role of forest buffers in protecting amphibians and the implications of their loss or reduction, we can take proactive steps to conserve these species and maintain ecosystem resilience.",0.013906547172858373,0.12473118279569893,0.04319654427645788,0.08172043010752689,0.8372289538383484

"USDA Public Information Coordinator, Virginia in  Rural  Aug 10,  USDA officials and residents of Carroll County gather in front of emergency equipment and transportation equipment purchased with USDA support. Under bright, sunny skies last Friday, hundreds of residents of Carroll County, Virginia turned out to acknowledge the support provided by USDA Rural Development. Working in conjunction with State and local governments, non-profit entities and the business community, USDA has infused well over $80 million into the area in recent years, and half of that was to improve water quality. Carroll County is located in the Southwest portion of the state, and the county seat, Hillsville, is surrounded by the Blue Ridge Mountains. USDA officials on hand for the celebration included Rural Development Deputy Under Secretary Cheryl Cook and Virginia State Director Ellen Davis. Both toured facilities that Rural Development helped finance, including a retraining center, court house and a public exercise facility.  In late morning, the USDA officials were the guests of honor at a luncheon at the regional farmers market that was attended by an estimated 500 guests.  Speaking to the audience, Congressman Rick Boucher praised Cook and Davis, along with Rural Development staff and acknowledged the efforts of Travis Jackson, a longtime USDA employee and regional Rural Development representative. The Congressman called Jackson “A premier public servant…enormously effective,” and praised Jackson for his work with local residents to complete funding application processes.  Congressman Boucher also thanked the County Supervisors who “Have a vision of what rural America can be.” During the luncheon, Board Chairman Wesley Hurst joined his colleagues and representatives of the school board in presenting Ms. Cook and Ms. Davis with plaques making them “Honorary County Residents.” Afterward, the guests lined up for a photo in front of emergency response and public transportation equipment funded through Rural Development’s Community Facilities Program. Ms. Cook, who served as a Rural Development state director prior to her appointment as deputy under secretary, said she had never seen an event as amazing as the one organized by the people of Carroll County.

"USDA Rural Development Public Information Office in  Rural  Sep 09,   “Small towns and rural communities need assistance from USDA Rural Development, now more than ever.” That was the consensus of attendees participating in a breakout session at the National Association of Towns and Townships (NATaT) annual meeting in Washington in early September. During and after the session Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development Cheryl Cook heard accounts of how local Rural Development staff have made a difference in the economic health of rural communities in states including Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Many described the positive impact of investments made through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act over the last two years, but expressed concern for the future. Water systems, broadband access, and fire and rescue capabilities were frequently cited as critical foundational investments every community needs. But many said finding private partners willing to lend on affordable terms is a challenge for smaller communities that have a limited tax base. A number of elected officials said that increasing the availability of private capital for existing and start-up businesses, improving educational and healthcare opportunities, and helping develop renewable energy options were all key to strengthening local economies through diversification. Many also praised the local knowledge and accessibility of RD’s network of staff members who regularly visit nearly every county in the nation. “Most of us have full time day-jobs and serve our communities as best we can,” explained one local leader from northeast Pennsylvania. “Without the technical assistance from our regional Rural Development Office I doubt we could get through the application process successfully. And that’s assuming we could even keep track of when funding is available for the infrastructure our town needs.” Cook described Rural Development as, “Three agencies on a mission, using loans, loan-guarantees and leveraging grants,” to make it affordable for small towns to keep up with advances in technology, provide necessary infrastructure, and to attract the pool of business investment capitol often taken for granted in larger cities. “One of the great things at Rural Development is that we make it affordable for rural communities to help themselves,” she said. “And by being hands-on from the start, we set them up for success.” According to Cook that means nearly all the investments RD makes get paid back with interest. “So, even as budgets get tighter, the capacity of our community facilities programs is able to grow to meet the needs of the many small towns struggling to survive.” “We want to Rural America to do more than just get by; we want these communities to thrive as the American economy recovers,” said cook.

"Rural Development State Director, New Jersey in  Initiatives  Rural  Oct 29,   After struggling for several years with a stagnant economy, the future is looking brighter for Paulsboro, New Jersey.  Earlier this week, USDA Rural Development Deputy Under Secretary Cheryl Cook, Assistant Administrator for the Water and Environmental Program Jacki Ponti, and I attended an event to celebrate a Recovery Act-funded water project that will help to stimulate job creation while also upgrading Paulsboro’s water system. The diverse borough of Paulsboro houses just over 6,000 residents and faces many of the same challenges of rural towns across the country.  In recent years, the decreasing demand for fuel spurred a number of oil refinery layoffs, displacing hundreds of Paulsboro workers and contributing to a steady rate of out-migration. In addition to the poor economic conditions in Paulsboro, the continuous repair of the public water system, much of which was built in the ’s, was becoming unfeasible, so the Borough worked with RD’s Water and Waste Disposal program to obtain financing for the water system improvements. “We’ve done over $20 billion in investments under the Recovery Act, with over $134 million of that right here in New Jersey,” said Deputy Under Secretary Cook.  “This is an investment that will yield dividends many years into the future for the residents of Paulsboro.” A Recovery Act loan-grant combination of $4.3 million will allow for the construction of two new water supply wells and a new water treatment plant.  These upgrades will remove aluminum, iron, manganese, benzene, and radium contaminants from the raw water, so Paulsboro residents will enjoy clean drinking water. In addition, these water system upgrades will facilitate greater economic development along the Port of Paulsboro.  New Jersey’s Governor recently traveled to the Port of Paulsboro to announce an off-shore wind energy generation initiative, which involves the employment of Paulsboro residents in receiving and assembling wind turbines at the Port.  This renewable energy initiative has the potential to create thousands of permanent jobs in the area. This is an exciting time for the borough of Paulsboro, and I am thrilled Rural Development, through Recovery Act funding, can contribute to this great project.  The jobs to be created in the construction of the new water system will serve to invigorate the Paulsboro economy now, but the upgraded system will allow for continued economic growth into the future.

"Michigan Rural Development Public Information Officer in  Rural  Jun 04,   Last week, USDA Rural Development in Michigan got an early start on Homeownership Month by promoting a pilot refinancing program, announced in February by Secretary Tom Vilsack, to help residents with current USDA home loans reduce their payments. Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development Doug O’Brien and USDA Rural Development State Director for Michigan James Turner made the announcement at the Portage office of AmeriFirst Home Mortgage, a leading partner with USDA’s Guaranteed Home Loan program. AmeriFirst agreed to participate in the pilot refinance initiative and eight of the first 26 loans were with their customers. “Since the creation of the USDA Guaranteed Home Loan program, USDA has helped more than 54,000 rural Michigan residents purchase houses,” O’Brien said.  “This pilot refinancing initiative helps people keep their homes and avoid financial hardship. I encourage any USDA homeowner who is eligible to explore this simplified refinancing program.” Existing Rural Development borrowers eligible for the pilot refinance program are not to obtain new appraisals, property inspections or credit .  The new interest rate for the refinance must be a fixed rate at least 1 percentage point below the current interest rate. The term cannot exceed 30 years.  No cash-out is permitted to the borrower. Complete details concerning eligibility are available at any USDA Rural Development office. Homeowners who meet these criteria may refinance their Rural Development guaranteed loans regardless of the loan-to-value ratio for the property. This enables borrowers who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth to get lower interest rates and reduce their monthly mortgage payments. “The pilot program can help stabilize neighborhoods and prevent the disruption and loss caused by home foreclosures,” Turner said.  “The goal is to help residents keep their homes and meet their obligations by giving them some financial breathing room.” After the Portage event, Deputy Under Secretary O’Brien went to Edwardsburg, on the Indiana state line, where he toured a glycerine-refining facility owned by CRB Real Estate LLC.

"Vermont/New Hampshire USDA Rural Development state director in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Dec 12,  USDA Rural Development’s Business and Loan Guarantee Program supported new construction for an expanded Brattleboro Food Coop in Brattleboro, Vermont. The original plan for two stories was expanded to four thanks to an innovative partnership with the Windsor Housing Trust to develop mixed-income apartments. “Smart Growth” is a term we hear more and more often.  It is the idea that as communities plan for the future, they consider the highest and best use of every resource – land, infrastructure, organizations and people.    From housing to transportation to energy to food; community developers and planners are asking how Smart Growth principles can be applied to ensure a sustainable and dynamic future for their communities and their residents. How is USDA involved in these efforts? Consider Brattleboro, Vermont.  With a population of 12,000, Brattleboro sits on the state’s southeastern border, and is a vibrant mix of industry, art and education.    Brattleboro’s downtown district was one of the first communities to take advantage of Vermont’s Downtown Program giving it access to state tax credits and shining a spotlight on its rich history. Its vibrant downtown is an inviting mix of shops, restaurants, offices and an art deco theatre and hotel.    Anchoring one end of the downtown is the Brattleboro Food Coop. Founded in , the Brattleboro Food Coop started as a local buying club.  It eventually grew into a popular retail destination featuring a wide range of products from nearby farms in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.  By , the Brattleboro Coop was outgrowing its space.  It considered moving to a new location outside of downtown.  The Board of the Coop, however, decided that its mission was much more compatible with a Smart Growth solution to its expansion needs.    In the meantime, the Windham and Windsor Housing Trust (WWHT) and Housing Vermont, were looking for a solution to Brattleboro’s need for more mixed income housing that was easily accessible to downtown’s services and amenities. With support from a loan guarantee from USDA’s Business & Industry Loan Guarantee Program, the Brattleboro Coop remained downtown in a new, highly energy efficient building with expanded retail space.  The new Coop space was originally envisioned as a two story building.   Through innovative partnerships, an additional two stories on the new building were sold to WWHT and Housing Vermont.   Though the Coop and the housing complex have separate ownership, they have similar commitment to the sustainable future of Brattleboro.

"Calling All Champions of Change  Hunger is an issue that touches the lives of people all around us. Whether it’s the single mother struggling to feed her family of four while simultaneously making ends meet or a person living in rural America who has to drive 50 miles to the closest grocery store, hunger affects us all. That is why I am calling upon all community leaders who have committed themselves to ending this struggle to apply to the “White House Champions of Change:  Alleviating Hunger at Home and Abroad” program.  The purpose of this program is to recognize individuals who are using innovative community-based approaches to reduce hunger and ensure that people have access to enough food both in the United States and internationally.

Some of these approaches include: 1. **Food Banks with a Twist**: Traditional food banks often rely on donations, which can be unpredictable. Innovative food banks focus on sourcing surplus food from restaurants, grocery stores, and other businesses, reducing waste and increasing efficiency. 2. **Community Gardens and Urban Agriculture**: These programs empower individuals and communities to grow their own fruits and vegetables, promoting self-sufficiency and access to fresh produce. 3. **Food Recovery Networks**: Organizations like Food Finders and Feeding America work with food retailers and manufacturers to recover surplus food and redirect it to those in need. 4. **School-Based Initiatives**: Programs like the No Kid Hungry Campaign provide students with breakfast, lunch, and snacks, ensuring they have access to nutritious meals throughout the school day. 5. **Meal Delivery Services for Homebound Individuals**: Organizations like Meals on Wheels America deliver prepared meals to seniors and individuals with disabilities who are unable to access traditional food sources. 6. **Peer-to-Peer Support Groups**: Community-based initiatives, such as the National Hunger Hotline (1-866-348-6479), connect individuals struggling with hunger to local resources and support networks. 7. **Farmer's Market-Based Programs**: Initiatives like Farm-to-School programs and Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) schemes provide access to fresh produce while supporting local farmers and economies. 8. **Culturally Relevant Food Initiatives**: Projects like the ""Fresh Express"" program in Detroit, Michigan, focus on delivering culturally relevant food options to underserved communities. 9. **Community Engagement through Food Waste Reduction**: Organizations like the Food Recovery Challenge encourage businesses and individuals to reduce food waste by implementing efficient storage and handling practices. 10. **Data-Driven Approaches**: The use of data analytics and mapping technologies can help identify areas with high levels of hunger, informing targeted interventions and resource allocation. Examples of innovative community-based approaches in action include: * **Feeding America's Hunger-Free America** initiative, which aims to reduce food insecurity by addressing root causes. * **The National Anti-Hunger Coalition's Food Waste Reduction Program**, which works with businesses and individuals to minimize waste and redirect excess food to those in need. These approaches demonstrate the power of community-based solutions in reducing hunger and alleviating its effects on individuals and communities.

Here are some ways in which these initiatives can help: 1. **Access to Capital**: The USDA offers various loan programs, such as the Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBEG) program, that provide funding for small businesses, including those owned by historically underserved individuals. This access to capital can enable them to start or grow their businesses, creating jobs and stimulating local economic growth. 2. **Business Development Centers**: The USDA has established Business Development Centers in rural areas to provide technical assistance, training, and business planning services to entrepreneurs, including those from underserved communities. These centers offer guidance on how to develop a business plan, access capital, and market products or services. 3. **Value-Added Producer Grants (VAPG)**: The USDA provides grants through the VAPG program to help small businesses in rural areas add value to their agricultural products. This can enable historically underserved farmers and ranchers to process and market their products more effectively, increasing their income and contributing to local economic growth. 4. **Guaranteed Loans**: The USDA's Guaranteed Loan Program provides loans to small businesses, including those owned by historically underserved individuals, with the government guaranteeing a portion of the loan. This can make it easier for these businesses to secure financing from lenders. 5. **Community Facilities Grants and Loans**: The USDA offers grants and loans through its Community Facilities Grant and Loan program to help rural communities build or improve essential facilities, such as water systems, community centers, and healthcare facilities. These investments can contribute to the overall economic development of a community, benefiting historically underserved populations. 6. **Rural Energy for America Program (REAP)**: The USDA's REAP program provides grants and loans to help rural businesses and individuals invest in energy-efficient technologies and renewable energy systems. This can lead to cost savings, improved energy efficiency, and increased competitiveness among small businesses owned by historically underserved communities. 7. **Partnerships with Community-Based Organizations**: The USDA often partners with community-based organizations (CBOs) that serve historically underserved populations. These partnerships can help reach these communities more effectively and provide targeted support to entrepreneurs and small business owners in need. In summary, the USDA's initiatives to revitalize rural communities and support small businesses can have a positive impact on historically underserved communities achieving economic growth and prosperity by: * Providing access to capital and technical assistance * Supporting business development and innovation * Investing in community facilities and infrastructure * Promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy * Partnering with CBOs to reach underserved populations These initiatives can help create an environment that fosters economic growth, entrepreneurship, and prosperity for historically underserved communities.",2.5025620063835527e-155,0.12598425196850394,0.043478260869565216,0.08661417322834646,0.8425254225730896
"Closing the Gap on Food Safety   From small, family farms to large food production companies, food safety is a top priority for the folks who feed our nation and put food on tables around the globe. Participating in programs like USDA’s Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), is one way that farmers and producers of all sizes can demonstrate to buyers that they are adhering to industry food safety standards.

"Event in the Big Apple is No Small Peanuts  You may not see the natural connection between peanut farmers and New York City. However, I recently had the chance to see both worlds collide during a National Peanut Board meeting in the big apple. In addition to the normal items of business, the board also planned some unique peanut-inspired events for New Yorkers. The National Peanut Board is one of the more than 20 industry Research and Promotion Programs that my agency – the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) oversees. These self-help programs that are requested for and completely funded by the industry are charged with developing cutting edge marketing campaigns and supporting nutrition research that benefits all of the industry’s members. The Peanut Board recently invaded the streets of New York to connect the city to the more than 7,000 peanut farming families the board represents.

"Conservation Innovation Grant Produces Carbon Farming Opportunities in North Dakota  The Prairie Pothole Region of North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana provides sanctuary to millions of nesting waterfowl each summer. With an innovative partnership led by Ducks Unlimited (DU), USDA is helping to provide new opportunities for agricultural producers in the region to sequester carbon while cultivating new revenue streams. With the help of a grant from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, these partners have created a carbon credit system for private landowners in North Dakota who agree to avoid tillage of grasslands. Grasslands store carbon dioxide, one of the leading greenhouse gases contributing to climate change.

"Know Where Your Food Comes From with USDA Foods  Do you know where your food comes from?  If you can pinpoint where your food was grown and produced, you can make more informed decisions to maximize quality, freshness, and nutritional value.  You can also help support local economies through your purchases.  The USDA Foods program takes this mantra to heart and publishes state of origin with procurement information on all USDA Foods every year.  As we like to say at FNS, “All USDA Foods are local to someone.” USDA Foods are 100 percent American grown and produced.  Each year, USDA procures more than 200 types of food, including meat, poultry, fish, fruits, vegetables, flour, cereals, and dairy products, totaling approximately $2 billion.  Organizations such as food banks, disaster and emergency feeding organizations, Indian Tribal Organizations, schools, and other feeding groups receive these USDA Foods for use in meal service or distribution to households through programs like the National School Lunch Program, The Emergency Food Assistance Program, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations.

"Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Jul 13,  Lori Cook, aka TV-personality “Maranda,” interviewed me about the importance of the Summer Food Service Program.  Hunger doesn’t take a summer vacation, and the State of Michigan is making sure that nutrition assistance programs don’t either. I recently traveled to the west side of the state to see some of the inspiring work our partners are doing to make sure that no one in their community has to face hunger. I first visited Fulton Street Farmers Market in Grand Rapids, where State and community partners are implementing new initiatives to improve the health of low-income Americans, such as fruit and vegetable incentive programs and nutrition education. A Michigan Department of Community Health employee even demonstrated a new pilot program that uses iPods and iPhones to accept SNAP and WIC benefits—very impressive! This means low-income individuals can more easily access fresh fruits and vegetables at farmers markets, and local farmers can increase their consumer base. I also got a chance to share exciting news about USDA’s new wireless technology grants for farmers markets that currently do not accept EBT. These grants increase access to fresh, healthy food while supporting family farmers and the local economy. Afterwards I headed to Kalamazoo, where community partner Loaves & Fishes hosted an energizing roundtable. Faith-based and community organizations from around the state joined me in a thoughtful discussion of the successes and challenges in operating the 15 USDA Food and Nutrition Service programs. I always learn something new by listening to those who work directly with the people who use our programs. The Grand Rapids school district feeds so many children that it needs semi-trucks to transport all of its meals! This year, I was happy to see they designed the outside of the trucks to show just how important school and summer meals are to so many children.  Later that afternoon, the Grand Rapids Press held an editorial board/community forum. This unique set-up gave me an opportunity to live Web chat with MLive readers about USDA nutrition assistance programs. We talked about everything from Summer EBT programs that allow families to feed children during the summer to the healthy changes USDA is making to school meals. The next day the Feeding America West Michigan Food Bank gave me a tour of their facilities. This food bank pioneered the concept of mobile food pantries. By modifying a beverage truck, the food bank was able to take fresh produce out into the community. Ken Estelle told me the food bank receives about 15% of its food from USDA Foods. Finally, I was fortunate enough to attend a kickoff of West Michigan’s Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). During the school year, more than 21 million children receive free and reduced-price lunch through the National School Lunch Program. And yet, when school lets out, only 3 million children receive a meal through a summer program. USDA’s SFSP is designed to address that gap, and WOOD-TV personality “Maranda” makes sure that happens every summer in western Michigan. Thousands of children came out to enjoy lunch and lots of physical activities. I’m a big supporter of the First Lady’s Let’s Move! initiative and it was great to see so many children playing outside and being active. What a fun event and a great way to end my visit to a state that is working so hard to improve the health and lives of its people!

However, I can provide some general context and possible initiatives that might be relevant: 1. **Double Up Food Bucks**: This is a program where customers can double the value of their SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) or WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) benefits at participating farmers' markets in certain states, including Michigan. The goal is to increase access to fresh produce for low-income households. 2. **USDA's Specialty Crop Block Grant**: This grant supports initiatives that help promote the availability of specialty crops, which include fruits and vegetables. It could potentially support programs or partnerships at farmers' markets aimed at increasing consumption of these nutritious foods among low-income individuals. 3. **The USDA's Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) Program**: FINI aims to increase the purchase of fruits and vegetables by low-income households participating in SNAP. It funds projects that provide incentives, such as cash or other forms of assistance, for purchasing produce through these programs.

If you're looking for a more specific technology initiative (as implied by the question), without more details on what technology aspect is being implemented, it's challenging to pinpoint exactly which initiative is being referred to. The USDA and other organizations like the Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development have various programs aimed at increasing access to fresh produce for underserved populations, and technologies could be integrated into these efforts in innovative ways such as digital platforms for SNAP redemption, farm-to-table delivery services, etc. Therefore, while providing a specific answer is not possible with the given information, it's clear that initiatives exist within USDA's purview (and potentially others) aimed at increasing access to fresh produce for low-income households.

"Natural Resource Specialist, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 17,  Wildlife cameras capture a young black bear enjoying new growth from a prescribed burn on the Pisgah National Forest. Photo credit: Lisa Jennings It was my first prescribed burn. After weeks of training and months of anticipation, I was finally on the ground – drip torch in hand – ready to apply fire to restore the mixed pine-hardwood forests at the edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains on the Pisgah National Forest. Joining the U.S Forest Service only two months earlier, my knowledge of fire’s effect on plant and wildlife communities was limited. But as the coordinator for the Grandfather Restoration Project, part of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration program, I had to quickly come up to speed with the on-the-ground reality of prescribed fire use. As I lit my drip torch that early March morning, igniting the thick leaf litter and dense shrubs that had accumulated during years of fire suppression, I couldn’t help but wonder – What happens to the wildlife after the fire? Utilizing fire is unnerving to those not familiar with fire as a restoration tool. The reality is much different; just as certain plants need fire to succeed, the animals that depend on those species benefit from fire as well. With the evolving use of prescribed fire as a restoration tool, it is critical to study the effects of fire on the communities we seek to restore. Traditional fire studies often focus on vegetation. The participants in the Grandfather Restoration Project decided to take it one step further and directly study wildlife use in sites treated with prescribed fire compared with untreated sites. Working collaboratively, wildlife specialists from Pisgah National Forest, the North Carolina Wildlife Resource Commission, and The Nature Conservancy designed a cutting-edge study using wildlife cameras. Re-entering the prescribed burn unit just four months after the fire, wildlife cameras in tow, I could see the changes in vegetation. Arising from the blackened ground a lush herbaceous layer had appeared, carpeting the forest with blueberries and grasses. Using 50 camera points over a six-week period in July and August, we studied the wildlife species that use our forests, and what habitats they prefer. Almost immediately, our cameras captured images of white-tailed deer, black bear, turkey and other wildlife attracted to the abundant grasses and forbs. Not only was I encouraged from the positive wildlife response to our burn, but our indicated a higher usage of the burned unit by wildlife when compared to the unburned unit; valuable information for land managers in determining population estimates and predator-prey ratios. I often think back to that first prescribed burn. I now understand what wildlife have known all along; that not only are wildlife capable of surviving fire, they reap the rewards of new growth, cover, and food stemming from fire and prescribed burning. For me, seeing these benefits firsthand is one of the most rewarding parts of my job with the U.S. Forest Service. Wild turkeys often nest in recently burned areas, taking full advantage of newly established sources of food and cover.

However, I can provide general information on the benefits of prescribed fire in forest management. The primary benefit of prescribed fire in forest management is to maintain a healthy and diverse ecosystem. Prescribed fires are carefully planned and controlled burns that occur at regular intervals, typically every 5-20 years, depending on factors like climate, terrain, and vegetation type. These fires serve several purposes: 1. **Vegetation management**: They help control the spread of invasive species, reduce fuel loads (dead leaves, twigs, branches, etc.), and promote the growth of native vegetation. 2. **Wildfire risk reduction**: By removing dead fuels and promoting a more open forest structure, prescribed fires decrease the likelihood and intensity of wildfires. 3. **Habitat creation and maintenance**: Prescribed fires create and maintain habitats for various wildlife species, such as insects, birds, and mammals that rely on specific vegetation structures or fire cycles. 4. **Soil health improvement**: The heat from controlled burns can break down organic matter in the soil, releasing nutrients and improving fertility. While these benefits are well-documented in forestry management research, I couldn't find any specific information about the Grandfather Restoration Project's findings on prescribed fire.

Land tenure, succession and estate planning, and access to land for new and beginning farmers will be among the topics discussed in a session at USDA’s Agricultural Outlook Forum this month. Succession was also one of the key focal points for the Tenure, Ownership, and Transition of Agricultural Land (TOTAL) survey, the results of which provided updated on these issues.  The TOTAL survey showed that U.S. farmland owners expect to transfer 91.5 million acres to new ownership over the next five years.  This represents 10 percent of all farmland across the nation. In addition to providing the number of acres expected to transition, TOTAL also provided on how the owners expect to transition this land and much more. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) conducted this survey jointly with USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS).  At the upcoming Agriculture Outlook Forum, Mary Bohman, ERS Administrator, will moderate a panel and lead a discussion on “Land Tenure & Transition.”  Joining her on the panel will be Neil Hamilton, Professor of Law and Director of the Agricultural Law Center at Drake University, Julia Freedgood, Assistant VP for Programs at the American Farmland Trust, Greg Ibach, Director, Nebraska Department of Agriculture, Dr. Damona Doye, Regents Professor and Rainbolt Chair of Agricultural Finance at Oklahoma State University, and Randall Hildreth a farm operator in Alabama and member of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives.

"Volunteer/Intern, U.S. Forest Service National Forests in North Carolina in  Forestry  Aug 14,   Angeliz Vangas and Hanniah Rodriguez made a big impact serving as interns on the National Forests in North Carolina and are now heading back to school and continuing on their road to success. As part of the Student Career Experience Program (SCEP), this summer Vangas and Rodriguez interned in the U.S. Forest Service’s engineering department in Asheville, N.C. SCEP provides work experience that is directly related to the student's academic program or career aspirations and gives students exposure to public service while enhancing their educational goals. The civil engineering majors are rising seniors at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez and have a passion for engineering. Both are members of the student chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers, where they serve as treasurer and secretary, respectively. The students were introduced to the Forest Service last year when they interned at the agency’s Southern Region headquarters in Atlanta, Ga. There, they were given a crash course on how engineering worked within the agency and assisted with inspections within the national forests. The energetic duo took what they learned in Atlanta and put it into practice to deliver results in Asheville, N.C. this summer. They were instrumental in developing an application for a $7 million grant to repair many of the damaged roads in the Nantahala, Pisgah, Uwharrie and Croatan National Forests in North Carolina. They transferred sketches made of the damaged roads to an Auto-CAD, which is used to produce more technical computerized models of the damaged areas. These models are crucial in formulating proposals needed to obtain the grant and to determine how best to repair the roads. Vangas and Rodriguez said interning with the Forest Service has been an engaging and insightful experience. They enjoyed working in Atlanta last year and the city life that comes with it. They said it has been particularly interesting working in Asheville, N.C. because of its close proximity to the national forests. This proximity provided them with more field work experience and to see the environment that they are affecting. “It has been really easy to adjust here because everyone has been so welcoming,” Rodriguez said. Rodriguez chose to intern with the Forest Service because of the diversity of opportunities.  “Working with the Forest Service provides two work scenarios – both field and office work,” she explained. Vangas echoed these sentiments. “It’s nice using our technical skills to help improve the forests,” she said. Although they are unsure about what they want to do after graduation, both say they would like to continue working for the Forest Service in civil engineering. They enjoyed learning from and meeting a lot of new people who have been influential on paving their road to becoming civil engineers and perhaps future Forest Service employees.

"Foreign Agricultural Service Public Affairs Specialist in  USDA Results  Trade  Oct 18,  Dutch Chef Eric Troost prepares an upscale dish using U.S. beef during a cooking demonstration for about 130 Belgian chefs Sept. 24. The demo was part of the first U.S. beef tasting event held in Belgium, which was hosted by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) office in The Hague, Netherlands, and the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF). The tasting was part of ongoing efforts to help expand U.S. beef exports to the European Union (EU). (Photo courtesy FAS The Hague)  The European Union (EU) is a relatively new market for U.S. beef exports. It wasn’t until August when the United States began exporting high-quality beef (marbled with a high fat content) to the EU under a negotiated tariff rate quota for non-hormone treated beef. Today, about 25 percent of U.S. beef exports to the EU are high-quality cuts such as tenderloin, strip loin and rib eye mostly used by upscale restaurants. The remaining beef exports include medium and lower quality cuts such as flank steak, chuck eye roll, briskets and shoulder clods. Finer restaurants in the EU traditionally do not integrate these cuts into their menus To help introduce these secondary cuts and expand U.S. beef exports to the EU, the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) office in The Hague, Netherlands, partnered with the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) and a Belgium-based meat importer and distributor to host the first U.S. beef tasting event in Belgium Sept. 24. USMEF’s international marketing efforts on behalf of U.S. beef, pork, lamb and veal are funded by the FAS Market Access Program (MAP) and Foreign Market Development programs to support activities such as this event. During the U.S. beef tasting event, approximately 130 Belgian chefs learned about the preparation of these less familiar beef cuts. Local Dutch Chef Eric Troost presented various cooking demonstrations including slowly cooked top sirloin with barbecue sauce, tartar of shoulder clod with artichoke and shallots and top blade with beets, coriander and sesame vinaigrette. The chefs were excited to learn cooking techniques for the secondary beef cuts, which are nearly 40 percent cheaper than primary beef cuts, said Mary Ellen Smith, agricultural attaché at the FAS office in The Hague. “Typically, secondary cuts from European beef cannot be used for finer dishes, so the Belgian chefs were intrigued by the various cooking methods that take advantage of the unique marbling in U.S. beef,” she said. “Events like these help introduce new U.S. products not only to the chefs that prepare them but to the thousands of European consumers that they serve.” The U.S. beef tasting event is just one example of how FAS’s market development programs have a long history of helping farmers, ranchers, and businesses of all sizes build and maintain commercial markets for U.S. food and agricultural products around the world. It also helps support President Obama’s National Export Initiative, which aims to double U.S. exports by the end of . Click here to view a video recap of the U.S. beef tasting event in Belgium.

"USDA Office of Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  Nov 20,  General Motors Global Public Policy Executive Director Greg Martin speaks at a press conference announcing the completion of the first-of-its kind purchase of verified carbon credits generated on working ranch lands by Chevrolet, at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), in Washington, D.C. on Monday, Nov. 17, . (L to R Senator Debbie Stabenow (MI), General Motors Global Public Policy Executive Director Greg Martin, Ducks Unlimited Paul Schmidt, The Climate Trust Executive Director Sean Penrith, and USDA Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) Under Secretary Robert Bonnie). USDA photo by Tom Witham. Earlier this week, USDA highlighted the creation of a market for carbon credits generated on working grasslands. Landowners benefit because they receive compensation for the carbon credits generated on their lands. They get a new source of revenue, while thriving grasslands provide nesting habitat for wildlife, are more resilient to extreme weather, and help mitigate the impact of climate change. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, recently purchased almost 40,000 carbon dioxide reduction tons generated on working ranch grasslands in the Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. It was the first purchase of its type.  Robert Bonnie, USDA's under secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the purchase and USDA's involvement in the project at an event at USDA headquarters. He was joined by Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Greg Martin, executive director for global public policy, General Motors; Sean Penrith, executive director of The Climate Trust and Paul Schmidt, chief conservation officer of Ducks Unlimited. The under secretary thanked Senator Stabenow, Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, for her staunch support for the program, which she said is delivering “real world measurable results.” Bonnie said he hopes this purchase will set a pattern for future carbon credit sales. This is how the credit system works: Landowners voluntarily place lands under a perpetual easement but retain rights to work the land, such as raising livestock and growing hay. The carbon storage benefits of this avoided conversion of grasslands are quantified, verified, and formally registered resulting in carbon credits. The carbon credits are made available to entities interested in purchasing carbon offsets. Chevrolet's purchase was undertaken voluntarily as part of its commitment to reduce eight million tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted. This is comparable to the annual carbon reduction benefit of a mature forest the size of Yellowstone National Park. USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded $161,000 through a Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) to Ducks Unlimited in to develop the necessary methodology to quantify the carbon stored in the soil by avoiding grassland conversions, resulting in the generation of carbon credits. Besides the landowners, USDA, and Ducks Unlimited, other key partners that helped make this project a success include The Climate Trust, American Carbon Registry, The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund and Terra Global Capital. Public-private partnerships to enhance U.S. carbon sinks such as forests, grasslands, wetlands and coastal areas, are a key part of the Obama Administration’s recently released Climate and Natural Resources Priority Agenda.

Here are some of these benefits: 1. **Carbon Sequestration**: Perpetual easements on working grasslands help sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, contributing to climate change mitigation. 2. **Soil Conservation and Improvement**: Grassland conservation through perpetual easements helps prevent soil erosion and promotes soil health, leading to improved water quality and increased fertility. 3. **Biodiversity Preservation**: By maintaining open spaces with native grasses and plants, these easements protect local wildlife habitats, promoting biodiversity and ecosystem services like pollination and pest control. 4. **Water Quality Improvement**: Perpetual easements help maintain the natural hydrological cycle, reducing runoff and preventing water pollution by keeping soil intact and minimizing nutrient leaching. 5. **Increased Carbon Credit Opportunities**: The USDA's carbon credit program with General Motors demonstrates how these grasslands can generate revenue streams through carbon offset credits while still being used for agriculture. By placing working grasslands under perpetual easements, landowners contribute to the preservation of natural resources, environmental services, and ecosystem integrity while also generating income from carbon credit sales. This approach promotes environmentally friendly land use practices and encourages sustainable management of agricultural lands.",8.029654430073048e-232,0.10300429184549355,0.008658008658008658,0.051502145922746774,0.8301583528518677
"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Missouri in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Aug 12,  Curtis Millsap works in the Chinese High Tunnel on his southwestern Missouri farm. NRCS photo. You can get just about anything you want at Millsap Farms, including an education about market farming. Curtis Millsap estimates that he, his family and a crew of interns feed about 200 families on 2.5 acres of his 20-acre farm near Springfield, Mo. While another seven acres of the farm sometimes includes sheep, poultry and cattle, it’s the vegetable operation that supports Millsap, his wife Sarah and their nine young children. Millsap uses two greenhouses and three seasonal high tunnels to grow produce year-round. High tunnels are plastic-covered structures that enable farmers to lengthen the growing season by using the sun’s heat to regulate temperature inside. Millsap sells through the Farmers Market of the Ozarks and to 75-100 community supported agriculture, or CSA, customers. In a CSA, people buy shares of the farm, and in return they receive a portion of the harvest when in season. One of Millsap’s high tunnels is a Chinese high tunnel, which he built with funding through a Conservation Innovation Grant from the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Previously, Millsap received financial assistance from NRCS to install a conventional seasonal high tunnel through NRCS’ Environmental Quality Incentives Program. Missouri is home to hundreds of seasonal high tunnels, including nearly 500 funded by NRCS, but Millsap’s Chinese high tunnel is the only one in Missouri, and one of only a few in the United States. Millsap received $20,000 from a $50,000 Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) awarded to the Watershed Committee of the Ozarks to build the Chinese high tunnel, pay for energy renovations in other greenhouses and to establish a grazing system. This grant program helps groups demonstrate innovative approaches to improve soil quality, air quality, and water quality, conserve energy, and enhance wildlife habitat in balance with productive agricultural systems. The committee wanted to demonstrate the benefits of the Chinese high tunnel, which differs from other seasonal high tunnels in that one of the long sides of the 23-by-70-foot structure and both short ends are heavily insulated with concrete and soil. “One of the things the CIG did was improve our efficiency in the high tunnel,” Millsap said. “It is warmer in the morning and warmer in the evening (in the Chinese high tunnel) than in the other greenhouses. But what’s interesting is that midday, it is cooler in there than in the other greenhouses. This thing never spikes. It has a smooth curve, which is better for plants.” Millsap said the different design is popular in China, where energy is expensive and labor is cheap. “I was looking into the future and thinking that energy is not going to get cheaper, so it made sense,” Millsap said. “And this is a teaching farm, so I have the workers.” Millsap’s workers include seven apprentices who are compensated with room, board, a farming education and a stipend. “These are people who seriously want to experience this and see if they want to be farmers,” Millsap said. “We’ve been doing this for seven years. I’ve had 20 apprentices, and seven are still actively involved in agriculture.” The farm also serves as a site for farm tours and other community events, all intended to further the buy-local movement. High tunnels are a cornerstone of USDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative, which coordinates USDA’s work on local and regional food systems.  Since , through NRCS, USDA has provided assistance to help producers construct over 13,000 high tunnels on farms around the country. “We have this great promotion in ‘buy local,’ but that will go away if we can’t meet demand,” Millsap said. “We try to get as many people out to the farm as we can, show them what farming is about, maybe get their hands dirty.” Not raised on a farm, Millsap said he learned to farm by attending conferences, by reading and by visiting with lots of other farmers. He said it was something he found himself called to do. “It’s not something I was looking to do, but sometimes when you are called, you better listen,” he said.

"Northwest Regional Conservationist, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Aug 11,  The Mid-Snake River, near Twin Falls. Water Quality Trading is one way the States of Washington, Oregon and Idaho are working to protect their rivers. Photo courtesy of the Idaho DEQ Twin Falls Regional Office, used with permission. The Pacific Northwest is known for its picturesque lakes, cascading streams and dramatic coastlines. The many rivers of the Pacific Northwest—the Yakima, the Snake, Snohomish, Willamette, Klamath, Boise, and others—are part of the cultural, economic and environmental foundation of the region. These waters are meaningful for local Native American Tribes, agricultural production, industries who rely on water resources, and local communities and tourists from around the world that enjoy fishing and other forms of recreation along Northwestern rivers and streams. It’s no surprise that the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho are interested in protecting their rivers to preserve these values, and the wildlife and ecosystems they’re a part of. More surprising, however, is the innovative way the states are collaborating to do it. Water quality trading allows point sources that directly discharge to water, like wastewater treatment plants, to invest in “green” infrastructure by restoring the watershed’s natural capacity to filter water. For example, instead of installing expensive technology to reduce phosphorous discharges, the treatment plant could pay farmers upstream to plant trees along their fields to reduce the same amount (or more) of phosphorous from reaching the rivers. Water quality trading may create cost savings for regulated sources, supports conservation on working agricultural lands, and generate environmental solutions that have benefits beyond just water quality—including carbon sequestration and wildlife habitat. In , the Willamette Partnership was awarded a $1.5 million Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to help facilitate a conversation with Washington, Oregon, and Idaho to develop multi-state recommendations on water quality trading. The CIG allowed the Willamette Partnership and The Freshwater Trust to convene Washington, Oregon and Idaho state department of environment staff and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 10 to identify common principles and practices to shape consistent approaches to trading in the region, with a focus on how trading could help regulated sources of pollutant discharges meet their discharge limits while providing additional environmental benefits. The effort resulted in a set of joint recommendations for each state to consider as they develop and further their water quality trading programs, with a goal of keeping those programs consistent with the Clean Water Act and state and local water quality laws. The recommendations address the importance of sound science, avoiding local water quality problems, providing evidence that resulting environmental benefits are real, and ensuring that these benefits are echoed in local communities. Today, the three states have committed to testing these principles and an associated set of recommendations through . Following this piloting phase, the states and EPA will discuss their experiences, and if necessary, refine their joint recommendations. The states, in consultation with partners, will decide how or whether to incorporate the joint recommendations into formal policy or guidance on trading. Bobby Cochran, Executive Director for Willamette Partnership noted, “This is a really exciting time for the Northwest. Washington, Oregon, and Idaho thought deeply about how the joint recommendations can help provide some clarity on trading, promote good stewardship, and support clean water for communities and fish.” The joint recommendations put forth by Washington, Oregon and Idaho can serve as an example for the rest of the country on how to establish well thought out trading programs that are built for success. Through CIG projects and other joint efforts, including the EPA – USDA Partnership Agreement to support water quality trading, we can do a better job of protecting water resources we rely on—while benefitting local communities, producers, and the environment.

"U.S. Forest Service, North Carolina in  Forestry  Mar 28,  For six years, U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement Office Jason Crisp and his K-9 partner Maros patrolled the Grandfather Ranger District on the Pisgah National Forest. They were killed during a search for a homicide suspect. (U.S. Forest Service) Law-enforcement peers, U.S. Forest Service employees, dignitaries and friends gathered at the McDowell County High School in Marion, N.C. last week to honor Forest Service law enforcement officer Jason Crisp and his K-9 partner, Maros. Among the memorial service attendees were 75 K-9 officers and their partners who paid tribute to both fallen officers. U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory were among the thousands who filled the school’s gymnasium. Crisp and Maros were shot and killed on March 12 pursuing a suspect who, just hours earlier, had allegedly killed his father and step-mother. As they had so many times before, Crisp and Maros were working to keep the Grandfather Ranger District, Pisgah National Forest, and surrounding area safe. “Jason was happy being with his family, and he was happy serving his community,” the Rev. Charles Dicks said. “He cared about the agency, and he cared about his coworkers.” These were common themes shared by speakers at the ceremony. They described the 38-year-old Crisp as a devoted husband, a loving father of two and a kind-hearted man who helped others. A Forest Service law enforcement officer for eight years, Crisp was a man of strong faith, whose spirituality served as the foundation for how he approached life. He and Maros performed their duties with honor, courage and dignity. One of Jason’s family members shared the following story prior to the ceremony.

(Courtesy of Mario Rossilli) “The last time I saw Jason, he came to my house and spent a couple of hours with me; but he was upset at me,” the grieving family member said. “I had recently helped another family member with some house work, and Jason was upset that I didn’t call to ask for his help… That’s the type of person Jason was.” March 12 was Jason’s day off. When he received the call about a murder suspect who was on the loose, he didn’t hesitate to respond. Maros assisted in the call, and it was the last time the two would answer the call of duty. Despite the tragic outcome, the two officers are not separated. Jason was laid to rest on March 17 with Maros’ ashes placed in an urn in his arms. They will be missed by the people who knew and loved them in western North Carolina. Thousands packed into the McDowell County High School to pay tribute to Forest Service Law Enforcement Officer Jason Crisp and his K-9 partner Maros.

"USDA Rural Development Public Information Coordinator in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Dec 26,   USDA Rural Development New Mexico State Director Terry Brunner (center) presents a certificate of obligation to the Ten Southern Pueblo Council Governors and representatives during ceremonies to celebrate the successful application of funds creating the first ever Native American Food Hub in the nation. (USDA Photo) The air was crisp and cold as the wind blew across Sandia Pueblo in mid-December.  But, the atmosphere among the Ten Southern Pueblo Governor’s Council was warm and jovial. Why? Because, the Governors were celebrating the obligation of a USDA Rural Development funded study that creates the first ever Native American Food Hub in the nation. For hundreds of years the residents of the Pueblos in New Mexico have farmed the land to provide the food they ate.  Today, the Native farmers continue to grow corn, squash, beans and other produce for their own consumption.  But often they have abundance of food at the end of every growing season. This successful farming can be a problem because the farmers do not have a mechanism to deliver excess produce to market or those in need.  Food hubs offer a model to provide infrastructure support to farmers usually through a central location where food can be processed and distributed. The Ten Southern Pueblos Council contracted with the Acoma Business Enterprises to serve as the fiscal manager and apply for a Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG) through USDA. The RBEG financial support is funding a study to determine how best to manage the distribution of food produced by native growers through a food hub concept.

"Conference Explores Ways to Value Resources, Improve the Environment and Put a Check into Producers' Pockets  What is the monetary value of a supply of clean water?  Or the value of clean air or having places available to hike and fish? For decades we have taken these resources for granted, or at least we have not put a monetary value on their benefits. That’s changing.  Participants from 30 nations met this week at the ACES: A Community on Ecosystem Services; Linking Science, Practice and Decision Making conference to talk about just how we can value these benefits and include that in our decision-making and planning.  As the conference kicked off, U.S. Forest Service Chief Tidwell talked about the need to quantify the benefits of public lands, building consensus and support for a multi-generational outlook, moving away from short term objectives and toward “sustaining the health and diversity of our forests and grasslands.” Participants included a number of other federal officials, including Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, USDA Undersecretary Robert Bonnie, and Jay Jensen of the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ).  Kari Cohen, Natural Resources Conservation Service  Posted in  Conservation  Forestry  Dec 15,   1 Response","How can quantifying ecosystem services, such as clean water and air, and conservation forestry practices contribute to a multi-generational outlook and increase support for sustainable land management decisions?","Quantifying ecosystem services like clean water and air, and valuing conservation forestry practices, can help build consensus and support for long-term land management decisions by putting a monetary value on the benefits of sustainable resource use, ultimately shifting focus from short-term gains to multi-generational sustainability.","Quantifying ecosystem services and promoting conservation forestry practices can contribute to a multi-generational outlook and increase support for sustainable land management decisions in several ways: 1. **Valuing intangible benefits**: By quantifying ecosystem services, policymakers and decision-makers can assign economic values to natural assets like clean water and air, which are essential for human well-being but often considered ""free"" or invisible. This helps to internalize the costs of environmental degradation and promote more sustainable land use practices. 2. **Enhancing stakeholder engagement**: Involving local communities in the quantification and conservation of ecosystem services can foster a sense of ownership and responsibility, encouraging them to participate in decision-making processes. This can lead to increased support for sustainable land management decisions that benefit both present and future generations. 3. **Building long-term thinking**: Quantifying ecosystem services and promoting conservation forestry practices encourages a more long-term perspective on the consequences of land use decisions. By recognizing the intrinsic value of natural capital, policymakers and decision-makers are more likely to prioritize conservation over short-term gains. 4. **Fostering intergenerational equity**: By considering the needs and values of future generations, policymakers can ensure that land management decisions are made with a sense of responsibility towards them. This helps to promote sustainable practices that protect ecosystem services for the benefit of all generations. 5. **Providing incentives for sustainable practices**: Quantifying ecosystem services can provide a clear economic rationale for implementing conservation forestry practices and promoting sustainable land use more broadly. By valuing these benefits, decision-makers can create policies that incentivize farmers, foresters, and other land users to adopt more sustainable practices. 6. **Supporting policy and decision-making frameworks**: The quantification of ecosystem services and promotion of conservation forestry practices can inform the development of policies and decision-making frameworks that prioritize sustainability and long-term thinking. To increase support for sustainable land management decisions, policymakers and stakeholders should: 1. **Involve local communities** in the decision-making process to ensure their needs and values are considered. 2. **Develop robust data and monitoring systems** to track ecosystem services and conservation outcomes. 3. **Communicate effectively** about the benefits of sustainable land management practices to both present and future generations. 4. **Create economic incentives** for land users to adopt more sustainable practices. 5. **Develop policies and decision-making frameworks** that prioritize long-term thinking and sustainability.

"Principles, Requirements and - An Important Update that will benefit USDA Clients  When you take a drink of water in this country, chances are pretty good that it came from a reservoir or river that is managed, or that has been treated in a plant funded with support from the Federal government, or whose headwaters are on public land managed by the United States Forest Service or Department of Interior.  Every dollar the federal government spends supporting water quality and quantity impacts millions of Americans.  Interagency governing how investments, programs, and policies that affect water resources are evaluated at the Federal level have been updated for the first time since , and published by the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). Given the importance of water to USDA programs and our customers, we understand that it makes sense to have the most complete and forward-thinking information available to inform our investment and implementation decisions.  That enhances our ability to develop programs and projects that conserve water resources while ensuring taxpayer dollars are well spent.  USDA is confident that these new can enhance our decision-making without adversely affecting how we implement our many conservation programs.  Under Secretary Robert Bonnie  Posted in  Conservation  Dec 18,   2 Responses",What updates to the interagency principles and requirements for evaluating water resources investments and policies will enable USDA clients to better conserve water while ensuring effective program development?,"The updated interagency principles and requirements will provide more complete and forward-thinking information, enabling USDA clients to make informed investment decisions that conserve water resources while ensuring taxpayer dollars are well spent.","I'm unable to provide specific updates to the interagency principles and requirements for evaluating water resources investments and policies that would enable USDA clients to better conserve water while ensuring effective program development. The best answer would depend on current research, policy updates, and expert opinions in this field. However, I can suggest some general approaches or principles that could be considered as part of such updates: 1. **Incorporating Water Conservation Goals**: Updates should reflect the integration of explicit water conservation goals into all USDA programs related to water resources investments and policies. This would ensure that every project or policy aims at conserving water effectively. 2. **Water Use Efficiency Metrics**: Incorporate metrics for evaluating the efficiency of water use in projects and policies. This could include specific targets for reducing water usage without compromising agricultural productivity. 3. **Integration with Climate Change Considerations**: Updates should align with climate change mitigation strategies, considering the impacts of changing weather patterns on water resources. This would ensure that USDA programs are adaptive to future challenges. 4. **Community Engagement and Education**: Programs could be updated to include strong community engagement components. This would educate farmers, rural communities, and urban areas about the importance of water conservation in agriculture and broader water management strategies. 5. **Monitoring and Evaluation Frameworks**: Develop or improve monitoring and evaluation frameworks that track not just the physical outcomes (e.g., water saved) but also the social and economic impacts of these programs. This would help in refining policies and making them more effective over time. 6. **Financial Incentives for Water Conservation**: Consider offering financial incentives to farmers or agricultural businesses that adopt water-saving practices or technologies. This could be part of a broader package of support, including training, technical assistance, and possibly even access to capital for implementing such measures. 7. **Collaboration with Other Agencies**: Updates should reflect cooperation between USDA and other federal agencies focused on environmental conservation and sustainability (like the EPA) as well as international agreements and best practices in water resource management. 8. **Science-Based Recommendations**: Ensure that any updates are grounded in scientific research, reflecting our current understanding of how to efficiently use water in agriculture and broader contexts. 9. **Public Input Mechanisms**: Establish mechanisms for public input into the development of policies and programs related to water conservation within USDA's purview. This could include public forums, surveys, or direct engagement with stakeholders. 10. **Sustainability Across Generations**: Emphasize that any updates are designed not just for the short-term but also aim at sustainability across generations.",0.011238202887780668,0.10065645514223197,0.039560439560439566,0.07877461706783369,0.83338862657547
"Office of Tribal Relations, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jan 29,  Tim Mentz Sr., Standing Rock Sioux cultural resource expert, explains the historical significance of the area that is now the Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota. (U.S. Forest Service/Fred Clark) Our curiosity was palpable in our expressions, we visitors to this South Dakota field, as we pondered the patterns produced by the tops of rocks pressed into grass and soil, patterns tantalizingly organized and purposeful: shapes of things that have been. What stories were held in this small corner of the Black Hills National Forest? As members of the Forest Service’s sacred sites executive and core teams, our task is to develop ways to fulfill the recommendations from the Report to the Secretary of Agriculture: USDA Policy and Procedures Review and Recommendations: Indian Sacred Sites. Visiting this sacred place was the starting point of our learning and working together as a team. We needed to experience firsthand the feeling and meaning of this place to help us incorporate an appropriate attitude as we started three days of meetings on how to best implement the recommendations, to better protect and provide access to Indian sacred sites. We were guided and educated, at least as much as can be done in just one morning’s time, by Arvol Looking Horse and Tim Mentz Sr. Many years ago, when he was only 12, Looking Horse had been given the enormous responsibility of being the 19th generation Keeper of the Sacred White Buffalo Calf Pipe. He is a spiritual leader for the Lakota Dakota Na-kota Oyate, the great Sioux Nation. Mentz is a cultural resource expert with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. He was their first Tribal historic preservation officer and continues to be an amazing source of information about cultural sites for his Tribe. We learned from tribal elders and Forest Service staff that these stone formations had been misinterpreted several years ago by an archaeologist as teepee rings, or circles of rocks left after having served their purpose of holding down the edges of teepees. The archaeologist had deemed these features as “insignificant” in terms of historical value. The tribal elders explained that these were no teepee rings.  Rather, the stone features were ceremonial shapes, purposefully placed and each with its own sacred reason. Having worked as an archaeologist for some 20 years myself, including having mapped and excavated teepee rings in Montana and Wyoming, I was also aware that these forms were far from the evenly rounded rings I’d seen many times before. They were shapes, but shapes of what? The elders explained how the features are organized, how they relate to the surrounding landscape, the directions, other sites both near and far, and a bit about what each feature’s functions would have been. They pointed out the meaning behind the features and talked about how these places have current and ongoing power. Mentz and his crew mapped the entire site during our visit, and related the physical shapes and functions to hundreds of other sites they had recorded. They talked about how many of these types of sites had already been destroyed by development, and how many are endangered. They showed us the life and significance in the rocks, reinforcing the great need to further protect places like this. While many of the sites being destroyed are on private land, the message was urgent and relates directly to our task of doing a better job within the agency to protect the places held sacred by American Indians and Alaska Natives on national forests and grasslands. Meeting and working with elders like Looking Horse and Mentz and having them share this kind of information, we are better prepared to bring to this work a good mind and a good heart, and better able to affect the shape of things to come.

"Producers get a New Revenue Source, Waterfowl Habitat is Preserved and Industry Benefits from Conservation Effort  Earlier this week, USDA highlighted the creation of a market for carbon credits generated on working grasslands. Landowners benefit because they receive compensation for the carbon credits generated on their lands. They get a new source of revenue, while thriving grasslands provide nesting habitat for wildlife, are more resilient to extreme weather, and help mitigate the impact of climate change. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, recently purchased almost 40,000 carbon dioxide reduction tons generated on working ranch grasslands in the Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. It was the first purchase of its type.  Robert Bonnie, USDA's under secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the purchase and USDA's involvement in the project at an event at USDA headquarters. He was joined by Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Greg Martin, executive director for global public policy, General Motors; Sean Penrith, executive director of The Climate Trust and Paul Schmidt, chief conservation officer of Ducks Unlimited. The under secretary thanked Senator Stabenow, Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, for her staunch support for the program, which she said is delivering “real world measurable results.” Bonnie said he hopes this purchase will set a pattern for future carbon credit sales.

"Public Affairs Officer, National Forests in North Carolina in  Forestry  Jun 06,   National Fishing and Boating Week, a part of the June celebration of Great Outdoors Month, will be celebrated again this year June 2 - 10. It’s a time when fishing fanatics and amateur anglers will visit national forests and grasslands across the country to try their hands at landing the big one. On the National Forests in North Carolina, anglers with physical disabilities who visit the Nantahala, Pisgah, Uwharrie, and Croatan National Forests will have a number of accessible piers to choose from. Some of these piers provide access to premier trout fishing destinations. “For more than 20 years, the National Forests in North Carolina and North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission have been committed to providing anglers of all abilities with the opportunity to go fishing on public lands,” said Sheryl Bryan, the forests’ fisheries and wildlife biologist. Some of these piers provide access to premier trout fishing destinations. “During this time, forest and district biologists, engineers, landscape architects and recreation proponents have worked together to create a comprehensive network of accessible fishing opportunities across a diversity or resources,” added Delce Dyer, the forests’ developed recreation program manager. Today, there are close to 20 barrier-free fishing piers in the four national forests. Through careful planning, design and construction -- in partnership with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission -- accessible fishing facilities have been constructed from the mountains to the sea. The facilities provide fishing opportunities in warm-water reservoirs and small ponds, as well as cold-water streams and rivers. “Designs of fishing piers that extend over waterways have been refined over the years and have been adopted for use by the Wildlife Resources Commission throughout the state,” said Lynn Hicks, engineer and heritage and recreation staff officer. ”Site-specific designs have provided accessible parking and routes to these water-based sites, and most of the fishing piers include areas for both seated and standing fishing.” Recent piers include a metal mesh water-viewing component into a portion of the pier’s flooring. Accessible facilities on majestic Cherokee Lake in Nantahala National Forest include picnic tables and a pavilion, all connected along an accessible route. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service photo In addition to tourists, a number of local residents regularly use the accessible piers. In many communities, the piers have become centers for frequent outdoor recreation. For example, Boone Fork Pond pier, near the communities of Lenoir and Hudson, is commonly used as an outdoor destination for the mentally and physically challenged. Chapters of Wounded Warriors have assisted with projects, particularly on the Croatan National Forest. Other partners who have provided funding or assistance in constructing these facilities include Trout Unlimited, the Muskie Club, and Bass Anglers Sportsmen Society. The two piers near Robbinsville -- one on a small pond, the other on Santeetlah Lake -- provide community fishing opportunities. Many of these accessible fishing facilities are used during National Fishing Week activities, including sites for Special Needs Fishing Days. Great Outdoors Month is a time for all Americans to get outside and take part in a number of national events that encourage people to hike, fish, boat and/or camp at locations all across the country.  June 9 is also a fee free day for public lands including national forests.

"Program Analyst, USDA Office of Environmental Markets, Office of the Chief Economist in  Conservation  Dec 16,  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack speaking at a press conference in Fairfax, VA. USDA photo by David Kosling. USDA has a long history of helping farmers, ranchers and forest landowners maintain their bottom line while improving soil health and reducing runoff into streams and rivers.  For nearly 80 years, USDA has offered funding and technical assistance for farmers to implement conservation practices through the conservation title of the Farm Bill. In recent years, however, USDA has also supported new, innovative approaches to voluntary, private lands conservation. An announcement today by USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, and Administrator Gina McCarthy of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in northern Virginia highlights an innovative approach called water quality trading. Farmers like John Harrison of Appomattox County are taking advantage of private investments to implement conservation practices on their land. These practices help reduce erosion and nutrient runoff into local bodies of water, generating nutrient credits that can then be sold to regulated entities looking to offset nutrient losses for compliance purposes. In this case, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) purchased phosphorous credits to offset water quality impacts from road construction. The offset credits have permitted the completion of more than 40 small road construction projects that improve traffic safety and flow by adding turn lanes, clover leafs, and small connectors, and repairing approaches to aging bridges. Compared to traditional engineered practices, the offset credits provide greater water quality benefits for up to half of the costs of installation and long-term maintenance. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack (left) participates in a press conference with Commonwealth of Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.

These practices help to improve soil health, reduce sedimentation, and decrease the amount of nutrients entering nearby waters. The nutrient credits earned through VNCE can then be sold to other entities that have excess nutrient levels in their waterways, such as wastewater treatment plants, municipalities, or agricultural operations.

The distinctive “fitz-bew” of the Southwestern willow flycatchers is music to the ears of the partners of Wetland Dynamics, LLC, and USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) recently improved the ability to hear them. Wetland Dynamics received a $60,000 Conservation Innovation Grant from NRCS in to develop innovative technology for monitoring the endangered flycatcher and two other imperiled species in Colorado’s San Luis Valley. “What we’re doing is innovative,” said Jenny Nehring, a biologist and partner at Wetland Dynamics. “The technology we’re using has been around for quite some time. But with the partnership now forged with NRCS, we are able to expand and improve our innovative techniques that build upon existing tools, which will in turn help to better understand certain wildlife species and improve protection of them.” Wetland Dynamics is expanding and exploring the use of a passive acoustic monitoring technology traditionally used to monitor bats and aquatic species like whales. The company is using this innovative technology to improve detection and monitoring of the Southwestern willow flycatcher, Western yellow-billed cuckoo and Northern leopard frog. The flycatcher, cuckoo and leopard frog are currently being monitored, but the widely used approach takes substantial labor and stresses birds. By recording the birds’ noises, Wetland Dynamics is able to study the endangered Southwestern willow flycatcher.

Birds will, of course, react, but this reaction is stressful and energetically costly to already threatened and endangered species.” The new way of monitoring, funded by the grant from NRCS, eliminates the stress on the bird while expanding the information gathered. It relies on passive recording equipment. Because the devices can be stationed for prolonged periods of time, the consistency and quantity of information gathered will provide increased detection of species.  These more accurate detections will allow more focused and precise research on other things such as breeding success and habitat use. Between observer bias and influences like weather, which might prevent an observer from even reaching a monitoring site, the margin for error within the typical call play back monitoring method is high. A grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is enabling Wetland Dynamics to expand its monitoring efforts of the Southwestern willow flycatcher and other at-risk species of the riparian habitat. Photo courtesy of Wetland Dynamics. “Our recorders are stationary devices, can be set up for weeks and have limited disturbance. Recordings are then scanned to detect the vocalization of interest and to differentiate varying vocalizations like birds that are close or far away.” Although this technology is promising and is quite significant for future monitoring of species in areas, it cannot determine the number of species in a particular area. “But it can detect if the bird is present which will help researchers focus their on-the-ground field work to determine territory size, breeding effort and success as well as habitat condition,” she said. “More work is clearly needed and that’s why the CIG grant was so important.  It allows us to refine and test the technology and quantify perimeters for accuracy. We greatly value our partnership with NRCS and hope it grows so that other monitoring opportunities can be explored.” Conservation Innovation Grants aim to stimulate the development and adoption of innovative conservation approaches and technologies. This is one of NRCS’ many investments in the Southwest to help the flycatcher and other species. NRCS announced Monday its plans to broaden the conservation opportunities available to producers.

"The Sixth Tribal Nations Conference - Focusing on Youth  This week marked the sixth consecutive year tribal leaders have gathered here in Washington at the President’s invitation to meet with key members of the Obama Administration, but this time is different: more than three dozen youth ambassadors were in attendance to kick off “Generation Indigenous” (Gen-I) – a new initiative calling for programs focused on better preparing young American Indians and Alaska Natives for college and careers as well as developing leadership skills.  And it all started with the President’s visit last summer to the reservation of the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota.  The President and First Lady met with Native American youth and saw their promise, but also the challenges they face. In addition to issuing a White House Native Youth Report, outlining past government shortcomings, current challenges and a path forward for Native youth, we will look at ways to improve educational opportunities for Native youth, including improving schools, and reforming the Indian education system. At USDA, that means we will be supporting the Generation Indigenous initiative by focusing on the support we provide to the Tribal Colleges and Universities, internships and other opportunities for Native youth, healthy food at their schools and at home, and funding for broadband, school construction and other community facilities.

"Monitoring Tool Assists Ranchers and Wildland Managers Facing Drought  Drought can be a serious game changer for rangeland, wildlife and wildland fire managers. America’s 662 million acres of public rangelands support wildlife like sage grouse, game species like deer and elk, and support rural communities by providing forage for livestock and places to enjoy the great outdoors.

These tools enable them to assess the health of the land, identify areas of concern, and make informed decisions about grazing management, conservation efforts, and resource allocation. Some common monitoring tools used by wildland managers include: 1. **Remote Sensing and GIS**: Remote sensing technologies such as satellite or aerial imagery, combined with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), provide a broad-scale assessment of rangeland conditions, including vegetation health, soil moisture, and habitat quality. 2. **Vegetation Condition Assessment (VCA)**: VCA is a standardized method for monitoring the condition of vegetation on rangelands. It involves collecting data on plant species composition, density, and cover to evaluate the overall health of the ecosystem. 3. **Drought Index**: A drought index, such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index or the Keetch-Byram Drought Index, helps managers quantify drought severity and duration, allowing them to adjust grazing management and conservation strategies accordingly. 4. **Soil Moisture Monitoring**: Soil moisture sensors or probes measure the water content of the soil, enabling managers to determine when rangelands are experiencing water stress and make informed decisions about grazing permits or restrictions. 5. **Wildlife Habitat Suitability Models**: These models assess the suitability of habitats for specific wildlife species, such as sage grouse or mule deer, and help identify areas where conservation efforts may be necessary to protect these species during drought conditions. 6. **Grazing Management Tools**: Software programs like GRASP (Grazing Management and Assessment Tool) or PRISM (Predictive Rangeland Inventory and Monitoring System) allow managers to simulate different grazing scenarios, predict the effects of drought on vegetation and wildlife habitats, and make informed decisions about livestock numbers and grazing duration. 7. **Community-based Drought Planning**: This approach involves engaging local stakeholders, including ranchers and conservation groups, in the planning process to ensure that everyone's interests are represented and that management strategies are tailored to specific rangeland conditions. By using these monitoring tools, wildland managers can provide critical information to ranchers on how to manage drought-affected rangelands effectively, balancing the needs of both wildlife and livestock. This proactive approach helps maintain ecosystem resilience, protects biodiversity, and supports sustainable agriculture practices in these regions.",0.029188308657868478,0.14320987654320988,0.0794044665012407,0.11851851851851852,0.8635865449905396
"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Earth Team Volunteer in  Conservation  Jun 17,  Honeybees leaving and returning to the hive after collecting pollen. Photo: Ashton Ebarb. “They’re in a happy mood today,” Jim Pratt, a local apiarist, said. At a comfortable 62 degrees, honeybees buzz with a clear objective: collect nectar and pollen, for honey and pollination. “Pollinators, like honeybees, support food crops,” Pratt said, explaining why for 20 years he’s raised honeybees. Pratt’s Farm annually produces about 120 pounds of honey per colony. He maintains 100 colonies, collecting honey from them each spring, summer and fall. During the winter, the bees eat stored honey until warmer weather arrives. Honeybees, like all pollinators, face challenges. Lack of habitat is the number one local threat Pratt sees to pollinators. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) works with farmers, ranchers and forest landowners to implement conservation practices on the ground that have numerous environmental benefits, including ones that provide habitat and food for pollinators. “Much of our local land is managed pastures,” Pratt said. Pastures provide benefits in various forms of agriculture, yet there are times between seasons when nothing is grown to attract pollinators across vast measures of land. “As a beekeeper, I seek out managed pastures over-seeded with clover. Placing colonies of honeybees in and around the pastures benefits not only the beekeeper with the potential of premium grade honey, but also benefits the landowner by sustaining the clover population as a result of the necessary pollination by the bees.” With NRCS’ Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), landowners can offset the cost of over-seeding clovers in their pastures and adjacent tracts specifically for pollinator species. “Pastures over-seeded with clover provide benefits in various forms of agriculture,” Pratt explained. “First, pollinators of all types are attracted to it. Second, clover replenishes nitrogen in the soil which better supports livestock forage.”  Since clovers are a cool-season legume, and usually die-back with the onset of mid-Summer, Pratt looks for tracts of land with natural habitat, such as wildlife refuges, conservation reserves and pollinator plantings adjacent to the pastures for nectar and pollen sources after the clover has died. Pollinators need nearby habitats which is vital to sustaining their populations. People need pollinators, too. No matter the pollinator, whether bee, bird, beetle, butterfly, bat or any other, all contribute to our food supply by pollination. “90 percent of fruits and vegetables are not self-pollinating,” said Janice Hutton, horticulturalist with The Sabine River Authority in Sabine Parish, Louisiana. Fruits and vegetables almost entirely depend upon pollinators. Every living person and thing that depends on fruits and vegetables depends on pollinators too. The good news: helping pollinators achieve their goal is as simple as growing certain plants. “I have to know what blooms, when it blooms and whether each colony has enough worker bees to collect nectar and pollen,” said Pratt. This week, USDA is celebrating National Pollinator Week by highlighting the many ways in which conservation benefits pollinators. Through the Farm Bill, landowners have an opportunity to receive financial assistance through conservation programs and practices, which includes planting cover crops to target these beneficial pollinators.

"Media Relations Officer, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Mar 08,   The Forest Service has added an iPhone/iPad application called Invasive Plants in Southern Forests: Identification and Management to its strategy of reducing nonnative invasive plants in the South. The free app will allow more people to get involved in eradicating foreign plants, which, along with nonnative animals and pathogens, harm water supplies.  They also harm native plants, wildlife, livestock and property in both rural and urban areas at a cost of about $138 billion annually. Using Forest Service funding and research, the University of Georgia Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health created the software from the Southern Research Station publications A Field Guide for the Identification of Invasive Plants in Southern Forests and A Management Guide for Invasive Plants in Southern Forests. The U.S. Forest Service is a leading agency working to reduce the impact of the hundreds of invasive plants threatening public and private lands. The application was funded by a grant from the Forest Service Southern Research Station’s Insects, Diseases and Invasive Plants unit. The software provides photos and information that allow users to identify the 56 nonnative plants and plant groups currently invading 13 Southern states. “Ultimately we hope this app will give people a new tool to go out and identify invasive plants and map their occurrence,” said Southern Research Station Research Ecologist James Miller, who co-authored the application’s source guides. “Effective control relies on understanding of species and how they spread across the landscape. Those are important first steps in stopping and containing the invasions of harmful nonnative plants.” Like the publications it was developed from, the app divides nonnative invasive plants into trees, shrubs, vines, grasses, ferns and forbs, and provides identification keys, photos and management recommendations. The app also gives users simple, on-the-spot options for treating invasive plants. Future versions of the application will include the ability to directly report new sightings of select species into the Georgia Center’s Early Detection and Distribution Mapping System (EDDMapS), which provides a quick way to submit photos and report new sightings of invasive plants on the spot throughout the United States.

"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication in  Forestry  Research and Science  May 22,  During April and May ramps are often served in restaurants in the eastern U.S. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. To many of locals in western North Carolina, they’re called wild leeks.  Some call them ransoms and still others call them wood garlic because of their pungent smell. Nevertheless, ecologists simply call them ramps. This native plant has been useful to humans since inhabiting the eastern regions of the U.S. and Canada.  Still today, locals harvest ramps for food, medicinal preparations, and to sell at markets and spring festivals. U.S. Forest Service scientist Joan Walker has been monitoring populations of ramps in the mountain coves of western North Carolina for 11 years. The results of her research show that although abundance can vary from year to year, about a quarter of the plots had decreasing ramps cover. “All of the plots that showed a decrease were where harvesting disturbance was high,” said Walker who is based out of the agency’s Southern Research Station. “Also, harvested plots as a group have reduced ramps populations compared to undisturbed ones.” These results suggest that it may be time to re-examine the current harvest policy and perhaps take corrective measures to ensure the species will be available for future generations of Americans. In the Southern Appalachians, many prime sites for harvesting ramps are within national forest boundaries. The National Forest System is responsible for maintaining biological diversity to sustain valuable ecosystem services such as clean air and water, healthy soil, abundant wood, recreational opportunities and other forest-based commodities that include herbs and edible plants. Ramps are among the first ephemeral greens to emerge during the spring months of March and April. With their electric green leaves, plump, white bulb and distinct odor, ramps are easy to distinguish from other early growers. After a hard winter in the mountains with food stores running low, this green “manna” would have literally been a life saver to both Native Americans and settlers living throughout the region in years past. Concerns about harvesting effects in the southern range (northern Georgia and Alabama and western North Carolina) prompted Walker’s monitoring study in two areas of the Nantahala National Forest in western North Carolina. The goal of the project is to track the populations over time and to determine if trends are related to local harvesting, weather, or even changing climate. The monitoring study consists of 25 plots distributed between 3,500 feet to just over 5,000 feet in elevation.

"Southern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Feb 11,  Healthy seagrass meadows prevent erosion on coasts, store carbon, and provide marine animals with food and habitat. (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency) Just off Florida’s 8,000 miles of coastline and tidal areas, in shallow sunlit waters, over two million acres of seagrass meadows waft in the ocean currents. Besides providing food and habitat for manatees, sea turtles, shellfish, and other animals, seagrasses protect coasts from erosion and store vast quantities of carbon dioxide. “Seagrasses grow off the coast of many other U.S. states, including North Carolina and Virginia, as well as around the world,” said U.S. Forest Service Southern Research Station scientist Zanethia Choice. “Globally, their economic value is nearly $4 trillion.” Although more closely related to lilies than to terrestrial grasses, like most of their distant grass kin, seagrasses require plenty of sunlight. Poor water quality reduces the amount of sunlight that reaches them, and seagrasses around the world are threatened by practices that affect water quality such as wastewater disposal and fertilizer runoff. Choice, a natural resource specialist at the research center’s Center for Bottomland Hardwoods Research, and her colleagues from the University of Florida recently studied light requirements for four common seagrass species along the Florida Gulf Coast. The study was published in the Marine Pollution Bulletin. “We found a direct relationship between the amount of light reaching the ocean floor and the amount and diversity of seagrasses growing there,” said Choice. In 90 percent of sites where 13 years of historic showed that adequate sunlight had been reaching the ocean floor, researchers found thriving seagrass meadows. However, areas with suitable light but no seagrass were most likely due to unsuitable substrate, temperature, and the amounts of dissolved salts and oxygen. Seagrasses are adapted to nutrient-poor waters. When nutrients – whether from fertilizer runoff, wastewater disposal, or other human activities – wash into the ocean, they float suspended in the ocean waters. Seagrasses cannot use these suspended nutrients very efficiently, but tiny algae called phytoplankton can. Phytoplankton thrive in nutrient-rich waters, and as they grow, they intercept light and shade the ocean floor. Seagrasses were notably absent from areas with high nutrient levels. Some seagrasses such as star grass could survive with as little as 8 percent of sunlight reaching the ocean floor, while other species 25 percent sunlight or more. “Light requirements for all the seagrasses we studied differed from previous findings at other locations,” said Choice. “The differences are probably due to morphological and physiological differences, and adaptation to light histories at specific locations.” Understanding the light requirements of different seagrass species is essential for coastal managers who want to maintain seagrass habitats, and managing for seagrass health also provides water quality targets that can benefit other marine life.  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Tags:  aquatic  Florida  Forestry  FS  North Carolina  Research  Southern Research Station  Virginia",What is the main factor limiting seagrass growth in areas with high nutrient levels?,"The main factor limiting seagrass growth in areas with high nutrient levels is phytoplankton thriving and intercepting light, which shades the ocean floor and prevents seagrasses from growing.","The main factor limiting seagrass growth in areas with high nutrient levels is light limitation. While high nutrients can lead to increased productivity and algae growth, this competition for resources (mainly light) can actually limit the growth of seagrasses, which are light-sensitive plants that require a certain amount of sunlight to photosynthesize. In other words, although seagrass beds may receive high levels of nutrients from sources like fertilizer runoff or sewage discharge, excessive algal growth can block out light, making it difficult for seagrasses to photosynthesize and grow. This phenomenon is often referred to as the ""algal-seagrass feedback loop"" or ""nutrient-light limitation."" So, in summary, while high nutrient levels may seem beneficial for seagrass growth at first glance, they can ultimately lead to light limitation and restrict the growth of these marine plants.",0.09693730168670293,0.25609756097560976,0.14814814814814814,0.23170731707317077,0.8813822865486145

"Public Affairs Specialist, NRCS California in  Conservation  Jul 28,  A planning meeting with Freitas at the Redding Service Center.  Shasta County landowner Karen Freitas has worked with the staff of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) since , when she sought help recovering from a devastating wild fire that had burned much of her 160-acre tree farm the previous summer. Helping agricultural producers recover after a natural disaster is fairly routine work for NRCS, and the Redding office, where Freitas went for assistance, was no different. But what was unusual for these NRCS employees is that Freitas is deaf—presenting an unusual opportunity for client assistance. Freitas approached the Redding NRCS office initially for assistance rebuilding her operation, and District Conservationist Bob Bailey was able to help her put together a conservation plan and an application for cost-share funding through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Conservation work implemented under the first contract she signed with NRCS covered water control structures, brush management, critical area plantings, fuel breaks, tree and shrub establishment, forest site preparation, forest stand improvement and access road work. More recently, Freitas has been working with NRCS to develop a forest management plan on her property. District Conservationist Bob Bailey, Karen Freitas and Forester Jeff Webster working on a forest management plan with the assistance of a sign language interpreter.  Initially it seemed there might be some communication challenges in working with a hearing-impaired client, especially in some of the more technical aspects of the work. Freitas was the first deaf client NRCS California’s Redding office had ever helped. But the office contracted for professional sign language interpretative services, with excellent results. Since then, District Conservationist Bailey has used an interpreter several times to facilitate communications between Freitas and NRCS staff during planning meetings and implementation of projects in the field. “Using an interpreter has worked out great,” Bailey says. “I feel a sense of satisfaction that I was able to assist Mrs. Freitas with her forest management objectives. She is one of the hardest working clients I have, and she takes great satisfaction in the conservation projects she completes.” NRCS often works with clients to meet their communication needs, relying not only on American Sign Language interpreters, but also interpreters for non-hearing impaired landowners and land managers whose first language is not English. A sign language interpreter facilitates communication as Bob Bailey explains how soil erosion concerns on an access road might be addressed.  In addition, USDA has many department-wide provisions to ensure equal access to services for traditionally underserved groups such as women and black farmers, low-income farmers, and Tribes.

"Pollinator Week Brings Focus on Honey Bee Health  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. The buzz of a honey bee and the flutter of a butterfly bring happy thoughts of beautiful gardens. These pollinators are also hard at work providing vital services that are critical to our national and global food supplies. Honey bees to native bees and birds, bats and butterflies help ensure the production of plentiful fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Pollination by honey bees alone adds more than $15 billion in value to agricultural crops each year. Unfortunately, the number of pollinators has been declining in recent years due to many factors.

This estimate comes from a 2019 study published in the journal Science, which calculated the economic benefits of pollinators, including honey bees, to global agriculture. This figure takes into account the value of many common crop species that are heavily dependent on honey bee pollination, such as almonds (Prunus dulcis), apples (Malus domestica), pears (Pyrus communis), and berries like blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum) and strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa). The calculation is based on the assumption that a significant portion of these crops would not produce or yield fruit without honey bee pollination. Keep in mind that this estimate might vary depending on the source, methodology used, and assumptions made.

"Web Communications Intern in  USDA Results  Initiatives  Energy  Forestry  Sep 16,  Rick Huszagh and Crista Carrell, Down to Earth Energy, Georgia Cross posted from the White House Rural Champions of Change website: When Rick Huszagh and Crista Carrell purchased part of her family’s farm in , their focus was on farmland preservation as much as the creation of a successful business enterprise. Mountain Creek Farm started out selling Boer goats to purebred and commercial breeders and bermuda hay to neighboring horse farms. Goat kids were raised each spring to sell for breeding stock or meat.  The couple improved their farm marketing by participating in shows, performance tests, and field days.  The farm’s proximity to the University of Georgia facilitated their involvement in herd management studies related to the control of internal parasites. They took full advantage of resources offered by the Cooperative Extension Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and participated in the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Rick and Crista’s interest in sustainability issues on the farm led them to research and implement small-scale biodiesel production for the tractors in . In , they intensified their renewable energy involvement when they were awarded a Renewable Energy for America Program (REAP) grant and USDA guaranteed loan. Along with like-minded partners, they established Down to Earth Energy, a commercial biodiesel production facility located adjacent to the farm. Concern with some of the inefficiencies in the biodiesel process led them to partner with the University of Georgia to develop a more effective catalyst.  The concept was further funded by an EPA Small Business Innovation Research Grant (SBIR) and a Venturelab grant. Crista was appointed a Walton County Soil and Water Conservation District Supervisor in . She has spearheaded the district’s sponsorship of community forestry activities in Monroe and served as the coordinator of Atha Road Elementary School’s outdoor classroom from -.

"Forest Service Research & Development in  Conservation  Forestry  Research and Science  Mar 03,  Kellie Carim, eDNA coordinator for the Genomics Center, collects and processes samples. (Photos by Michael Schwartz (left) and Katie Zarn, U.S. Forest Service) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research profile. The U.S. Forest Service has a long history as a leader in conservation genetics, and this recently took an exciting step forward with the launch of the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation. The Forest Service’s wildlife genetics lab, which has been central to the Rocky Mountain Research Station’s conservation genetics program since , has been reorganized and renamed to better reflect the scope of its work nationwide. The Center is a leading edge facility for advanced genomics research, nationally recognized, and works extensively with states, tribes, universities and private groups to address the management issues of over 60 fish and wildlife species.  collected by the Center will support the new Forest Service Forest Planning Rule with timely and cost-effective information on wildlife and fish species. Information developed by the Center will be made available through the network of USDA Climate Hubs to assist private forestland managers, farmers and ranchers in reaching their conservation goals. With state-of-the-art technology and the development of new tools and techniques, the main objective of the Center is to provide cost-effective and reliable genomic for improved species monitoring. By having more robust information, state and federal managers are better able to evaluate the genetic health and population viability of fish and wildlife species across the landscape. The discovery of a new fish species and the detection of invasive species are among the Center’s many contributions to the advancement of science and management. Imagine an expansive landscape, filled with different and remote terrain, and being asked to determine if the area has been impacted by a new invasive species. This is a daunting challenge that land managers face on a regular basis. One of the Center’s specialties, analyzing samples of environmental DNA, or eDNA, shows great promise in addressing this challenge. This type of DNA has been separated from organisms into the surrounding environment and can be found in soil, water and air. Forest Service scientists are developing ways to determine what species are present by simply sampling a cup of water from locations across the landscape. “eDNA is a highly sensitive method for detecting organisms in low abundance and is generally faster and extremely cost effective compared to traditional methods used to detect exotic or endangered species,” said Dr. Michael Schwartz, director of the center. The use of eDNA is an innovative approach to inventorying and monitoring fish and wildlife species. eDNA is particularly effective for detecting rare species that can be difficult to sample using traditional methods. For example, researchers at the Rocky Mountain Research Station have been working with partners and collaborators on the threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) since . Bull trout is a culturally significant species to several Tribes in the Northwest and Columbia River Basin. It is also a prized game fish, and land management and recreational angling are significantly influenced by whether or not this species is present in a given watershed. This species is particularly sensitive to changes in habitat and is also threatened by the introduction of the nonnative brook trout (S. fontinalis). Forest Service scientists have developed sampling methods to make eDNA surveys a reliable and accessible option for managers to detect the presence of bull trout and their invasive competitor, brook trout. Forest Service scientists continue to develop eDNA techniques for detecting priority fish and wildlife.  eDNA is just one method of non-invasive genetic sampling, which uses forensic-style DNA samples to monitor rare and sensitive species, employed by the Center.

This approach involves collecting environmental samples and then analyzing the genetic material present within them using advanced sequencing technologies like next-generation sequencing (NGS). Another technique used to detect rare species is eDNA (environmental DNA) analysis. eDNA analysis involves collecting water or sediment samples from a specific location and then analyzing the DNA fragments present in those samples to identify the species that may be present. Additionally, camera traps and drone-based monitoring systems are also being employed for detecting rare species without causing them harm.

Organizing the largest single-day volunteer effort in support of public lands in the country, National Public Lands Day, is no easy feat for the U.S. Forest Service. That’s 40 days of volunteer projects, BioBlitzes, fishing derbies, and educational events, all of which are registered with the National Environmental Education Foundation, the organization that started National Public Lands Day 23 years ago. Despite its origins as a volunteer event, National Public Lands Day is more than just service. This year’s tagline, Learn, Play, and Volunteer, emphasizes connecting people with the natural world through education and recreation as well as volunteerism, and partnerships forming around this year’s events embody NPLD’s expanding scope. The focus is Every Kid in a Park: a multi-agency effort to connect fourth-graders with their public lands through educational events and year-long free passes to national forests and parks. For Carmen Young, the Forest Service Public Lands Day lead, it’s a labor of love. ""It was so great seeing all the kids playing outside, learning about how water comes from forests and gets to our faucets, and contributing to water monitoring efforts in the D.C. area,” said Young.

"Hoosier National Forest in  May 13,  Bedford, Ind., May 5, -- A group of Hoosier National Forest employees plant chestnut trees in a timber sale area of the Hoosier to return the American chestnut to its native range (Photo Credit: US Forest Service). Once a prominent phenomenon in southern Indiana, Bedford just experienced the first re-planting of American chestnut trees on the Hoosier National Forest in partnership with Purdue University and the U.S. Forest Service’s Northern Research Station. “Historically, the American chestnut was once one of the most important trees in the eastern United States, occupying about 25 percent of the hardwood canopy in eastern forests,” said David Cleaves, climate change advisor for the Forest Service. The trees grew to be 80 feet tall or more, and were known as ‘the redwood of the East.’  By the s, the tree was nearly wiped out by an Asian fungus known as chestnut blight.  The restoration of American chestnut to eastern forests depends on the development of blight-resistant seedlings. The Forest Service, American Chestnut Foundation, and the University of Tennessee have been conducting research and tests to produce a blight-resistant American chestnut, with aspirations of restoring the species in its grandeur. Bedford, Ind., May 5, -- Forest Botanist Kirk Larson (foreground) plants an American chestnut tree on the Hoosier National Forest to return the American chestnut to its native range (Photo Credit: US Forest Service).  A traditional back-cross breeding method is being used to create blight-resistant American chestnut seedlings, which are 94 percent American chestnut and 6 percent Chinese chestnut --- and are blight resistant. The restoration effort began when the American Chestnut Restoration Project partners planted seedlings in three national forests in Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina in early . Scientists say the seedlings are surpassing expectations of survival and they are cautiously optimistic. A full decade will need to pass before massive replanting begins.  But the trees will be given every opportunity to do well. They were planted in a fenced enclosure to keep out deer and minimize damage from wildlife, and herbicides will be applied as needed to control undesirable competition. The fenced enclosure was built with help from fire crews from the Ottawa and White Mountain National Forests as well as Hoosier employees.  Ron Doyle planted the first blight-resistant American chestnut on the Hoosier National Forest, unofficially in honor of his father -- a long-time member of the American Chestnut Foundation. His father, now in a nursing home, was very pleased to hear the trees were returning to Indiana. Another Indiana site will be planted in .  Tags:  Bedford  Climate Change  David Cleaves  Forestry  FS  Indiana  Northern Research Station","""What are the key factors involved in the massive replanting effort of American chestnut trees on Hoosier National Forest, and what makes these seedlings resistant to the blight that nearly wiped out the species?""","1. **Development of blight-resistant seedlings**: A traditional back-cross breeding method was used to create seedlings that are 94% American chestnut and 6% Chinese chestnut, making them resistant to the Asian fungus known as chestnut blight. 2. **Fenced enclosure protection**: The seedlings were planted in a fenced enclosure to protect them from deer and other wildlife that could damage or harm them. 3. **Herbicides for weed control**: Herbicides will be applied as needed to control undesirable competition and prevent the spread of invasive species. These measures, combined with a decade-long wait period before massive replanting begins, are designed to give the seedlings every opportunity to thrive and eventually restore the American chestnut tree to its former prominence in eastern forests.","The massive replanting effort of American chestnut trees on Hoosier National Forest is part of a broader conservation initiative led by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service, in collaboration with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and other organizations. The key factors involved in this effort include: 1. **Genetic resistance**: Scientists have identified specific genetic traits within American chestnut populations that confer natural resistance to the chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica), a fungal disease caused by a pathogen introduced from Asia. These resistant genotypes are being used as seed sources for replanting. 2. **Backcross breeding**: To enhance the genetic resistance of American chestnuts, researchers have developed a backcross breeding program that involves crossing blight-resistant Chinese chestnut trees with American chestnuts. This process has helped to introduce and amplify desirable traits into the American population, making them more resilient to the disease. 3. **Cryopreservation and seed orchards**: To ensure a reliable supply of resistant seeds for replanting, scientists have developed cryopreservation techniques to bank seeds from blight-resistant trees. These seeds are then used in controlled seed orchards to produce high-quality planting stock. 4. **Sapling cultivation and nursery management**: Specialized nurseries cultivate saplings from these resistant seed sources, using specific growing conditions and treatments to minimize disease pressure. This helps ensure that the young trees have a strong foundation for growth and resistance. The key features of these resistant American chestnut seedlings include: 1. **Resistance genes**: The blight-resistant genotypes used in replanting efforts carry genetic traits that inhibit the fungal pathogen's ability to infect the tree. 2. **Enhanced vigor**: These seedlings exhibit improved growth rates, leaf quality, and overall health compared to their unimproved counterparts. 3. **Improved root development**: Resistant American chestnut seedlings tend to have stronger, more extensive root systems, which helps them better compete with invasive species and withstand environmental stressors. The replanting effort on Hoosier National Forest is critical for restoring the ecological role of American chestnuts in these ecosystems. By reintroducing blight-resistant trees, conservationists hope to: 1. **Recreate complex forest structures**: American chestnut's towering canopies once played a vital role in structuring the Hoosier National Forest landscape. Restoring these dominant trees will help recreate a more diverse and resilient ecosystem. 2. **Support biodiversity**: The return of American chestnuts is expected to boost local biodiversity, as their presence supports a range of associated species, from wildlife to pollinators. 3. **Promote ecological resilience**: By establishing blight-resistant American chestnut populations, the long-term goal is to enhance the forest's ability to withstand and adapt to changing environmental conditions. This concerted effort represents a significant step toward restoring America's iconic chestnut trees and promoting a more resilient, diverse, and dynamic ecosystem on Hoosier National Forest.",3.1728549978012914e-155,0.2461005199306759,0.04869565217391304,0.1317157712305026,0.8543731570243835
"Manager, USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline in  Health and Safety  May 25,  Cook pork, roasts, and chops to 145 ºF as measured with a food thermometer, then allow the meat to rest for three minutes before carving or consuming. Cross posted from the FoodSafety.gov blog:  On May 24, USDA made some important changes in their recommended cooking temperatures for meats. Here’s what you need to know: Cooking Whole Cuts of Pork: USDA has lowered the recommended safe cooking temperature for whole cuts of pork from 160 ºF to 145 ºF with the addition of a three-minute rest time. Cook pork, roasts, and chops to 145 ºF as measured with a food thermometer before removing meat from the heat source, with a three-minute rest time before carving or consuming. This will result in a product that is both safe and at its best quality—juicy and tender. Cooking Whole Cuts of Other Meats: For beef, veal, and lamb cuts, the safe temperature remains unchanged at 145 ºF, but the department has added a three-minute rest time as part of its cooking recommendations. What Cooking Temperatures Didn’t Change? Ground Meats: This change does not apply to ground meats, including beef, veal, lamb, and pork, which should be cooked to 160 ºF and do not require a rest time. Poultry: The safe cooking temperature for all poultry products, including ground chicken and turkey, stays the same at 165 ºF. What Is Rest Time?  “Rest time” is the amount of time the product remains at the final temperature, after it has been removed from a grill, oven or other heat source. During the three minutes after meat is removed the heat source, its temperature remains constant or continues to rise, which destroys harmful bacteria. Why Did the Recommendations Change? It’s just as safe to cook cuts of pork to 145 º F with a three-minute rest time as it is to cook them to 160 ºF, the previously recommended temperature, with no rest time. The new cooking recommendations reflect the same standards that the agency uses for cooked meat products produced in federally inspected meat establishments, which rely on the rest time of three minutes to achieve a safe product. Having a single time and temperature combination for all meat will help consumers remember the temperature at which they can be sure the meat is safe to eat. How Do You Use a Food Thermometer? Place the food thermometer in the thickest part of the food. It should not touch bone, fat, or gristle. Start checking the temperature toward the end of cooking, but before you expect it to be done. Be sure to clean your food thermometer with hot soapy water before and after each use. To see where to place a food thermometer in different cuts of meat, see Thermometer Placement and Temperatures. For more information on cooking temperatures for all types of food, see the Safe Minimum Cooking Temperatures chart. If you have questions about cooking meat, feel free to contact us at the Hotline or online at Ask USDA.

As of 2011, the USDA revised its guidelines to reflect a change in the understanding of food safety. The previous recommended safe internal temperature for pork was 160°F (71°C). However, this recommendation was based on outdated research that suggested trichinosis, a parasitic infection caused by Trichinella spiralis, could be found in pork if it was not heated to an extremely high temperature. In 2011, the USDA changed its guidelines, stating that cooking whole cuts of pork to an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C) with a 3-minute rest time is sufficient to ensure food safety. This revised recommendation is based on research that shows trichinosis can be eliminated at lower temperatures than previously thought. It's essential to note that ground pork, however, should still be cooked to an internal temperature of 160°F (71°C).",0.07547963410341517,0.29591836734693877,0.20618556701030927,0.26530612244897955,0.8853911757469177

"Pet Waste Disposal Systems Help Protect Water Quality  Dog waste that isn’t cleaned up isn’t just a hazard for the bottom of your shoes—it is also a cause of pollution in creeks, rivers and lakes across the country. Dog waste contains nitrogen and phosphorus, which can deplete oxygen that fish and other water-based life need to survive, as well as encourage the growth of harmful algae. It is also considered a significant source of pathogens like fecal coliform, a disease-causing bacteria.  Amy Overstreet Maxwell and Sabrenna Bryant, NRCS South Carolina  Posted in  Conservation  Mar 08,   1 Response",What are the primary sources of pollution in waterways when pet waste is not disposed of properly?,"The primary sources of pollution in waterways due to improperly disposed pet waste are nitrogen and phosphorus, which deplete oxygen for fish and other aquatic life, and pathogens like fecal coliform bacteria.","When pet waste is not disposed of properly, it can lead to several issues that contribute to waterway pollution. The primary sources of pollution in this scenario include: 1. **Bacteria and Pathogens**: Pet waste contains bacteria like E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter, which can contaminate nearby waterways. These pathogens can pose a health risk to humans, especially those who engage in activities like swimming or fishing in polluted waters. 2. **Nutrient Pollution (Nitrogen and Phosphorus)**: Pet waste is high in nitrogen and phosphorus, which are essential nutrients for plant growth but can be detrimental in excess. When pet waste enters waterways, it releases these nutrients into the environment, leading to algal blooms. These excessive algae growths deplete oxygen levels as they decay, harming aquatic life. 3. **Sedimentation and Turbidity**: Improper disposal of pet waste can lead to increased sediment loads in waterways. As the organic matter from pet waste breaks down, it creates suspended solids that contribute to turbidity. This reduces sunlight penetration into waters, impairing photosynthesis in aquatic plants. 4. **Excess Nutrient Loads for Aquatic Life**: Excessive nutrient inputs due to pet waste pollution can disrupt the delicate balance of the ecosystem. This can lead to an overgrowth of certain plant species, such as algae, while other beneficial aquatic life may struggle to survive due to altered water chemistry. It's essential to properly dispose of pet waste by burying it or using designated pet waste disposal bags. These measures prevent pet waste from entering storm drains and eventually waterways, mitigating the pollution sources mentioned above.",0.03541623478087655,0.20069204152249134,0.09756097560975609,0.1453287197231834,0.8606018424034119

Last month, thousands of foodies packed into the Washington Convention Center for the Metropolitan Cooking and Entertaining Show to gain culinary wisdom from like Paula Deen, Guy Fieri, Giada De Laurentiis, and… the USDA Food Safety Discovery Zone. Among the live demonstrations and more than 300 vendors, there consistently was a line of people waiting for a tour of the Food Safety Discovery Zone. Chefs and guests alike remarked about the 40-foot long yellow truck’s uniqueness, and everyone who toured the interactive exhibit learned something new. A favorite game among visitors was trying to guess which of two identical-looking burgers had been cooked to 160 °F and was safe to eat. Using a food thermometer to check their answer, many were shocked to see that they had guessed wrong! As they exited the Discovery Zone, people grabbed free copies of the Kitchen Companion handbook, keychains with food safety reminders, and food thermometers. One couple returned to the Discovery Zone late in the afternoon to report their shock that a vendor touched raw meat and then served them a cooked sample without washing his hands. “Really? Well, it’s good that you noticed!  It’s scary, right? It’s so easy to get sick if people don’t follow our recommendations,” Discovery Zone staffer Eileen Dykes told them, smiling. “You now know what you can do to protect yourselves and your loved ones!” BAC!®, the Discovery Zone’s “green bacteria” costumed mascot posed for pictures with younger visitors. Appealing to foodies of all ages, the Discovery Zone staff made a big impression on the Metropolitan Cooking and Entertaining Show’s attendees and showed them how they can protect themselves and their families from foodborne illness.

"Technical Information Specialist, USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline in  Health and Safety  Mar 25,  Food safety is a key ingredient for a successful meal. Visit FoodSafety.gov for more information on the four key food safety steps: clean, separate, cook and chill. Ahh, Spring! This week, a new season is getting a nice kick-off with Passover and Easter holidays. These celebrations are filled with traditional meals that have unique food safety considerations that may or may not be included in the family recipe book. The USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline has some food safety tips and steps here that, if added to your favorite recipes, can reduce the risk of food poisoning.  As with any food preparation, always remember to Clean, Separate, Cook, and Chill. Before preparing any meal, wash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds, and clean surfaces and utensils with hot soapy water before and after handling raw food. Perishable food should not be left out for more than two hours at room temperature, so check the time at your gathering and make sure either to get food back in the refrigerator or to discard it. Refrigerated leftovers for all foods in this blog should be used within four days.  Beef Brisket: One reason that it’s an excellent choice for entertaining is that it can be prepared in advance. In fact, you must prepare it in advance and cook it slowly to make it tender. Also, because it can be cooked ahead of time and it reheats well, brisket is a great cut of meat to serve to large groups.  Follow these food safety tips for cooking and serving brisket: Be sure to allow plenty of time to thaw a frozen brisket. Thawing in the refrigerator can take about 24 hours for a trimmed, first-cut brisket. A whole brisket weighing about 10 pounds can take several days. Keep raw meat refrigerated at 40 ˚F or below until ready to cook. Place the meat on a plate or container to hold the juices that can drip on other foods to prevent cross-contamination. Bake the brisket, fat side up in a baking dish, in an oven set no lower than 325 ˚F. The brisket is safe to eat when it reaches an internal temperature of 145 °F and is allowed to rest at that temperature for three minutes. Use a food thermometer to be sure. For personal preferences, consumers may choose to cook the brisket longer for tenderness. If reheating brisket before serving, remember to reheat to 165 °F.To serve brisket cold, keep it at 40 °F or below by nesting dishes in beds of ice, or use small servings platters and replace them often. Ham: There are many kinds of hams on the market, but your family likely is purchasing a fully cooked ham. Here are tips for storing and serving a fully cooked ham: When buying a ham, look for the USDA or State Mark of Inspection.  Refrigerate the ham at 40 ˚F or below immediately after arriving home. These hams are best served cold. However, if you want to reheat them, set the oven at 325 ˚F and heat to an internal temperature of 140 °F as measured with a food thermometer. If the ham was repackaged at your butcher shop or grocer, reheat it to 165 °F. Individual slices may also be warmed in a skillet or microwave. Deviled Eggs: Follow these food safety tips below for making an egg dish such as deviled eggs. Remember, eggs are perishable just like raw meat, poultry, and fish, and could contain pathogens. Our virtual food safety expert, Ask Karen, has helpful instructions on how to boil eggs. After cooking the eggs, it is a good idea to keep the whites refrigerated while preparing the filling. Keep deviled eggs chilled until you are ready to serve. Eggs should not stay at room temperature for more than 2 hours. Use a cooler with ice when transporting to another location.

Sept. 17, . The U.S. Forest Service operates the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Corps, the Nation’s largest residential, educational and career technical training program for young Americans. USDA photo by Bob Nichols. Fifty years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Economic Opportunity Act.  This Act, part of the government effort to wipe out poverty, created the Job Corps program, which has had a positive effect on countless young lives, giving them a chance to break multi-generational cycles of poverty, get an education, and find jobs in the federal and private sectors, and in the military.  The U.S. Forest Service works closely with the Department of Labor to operate Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers (Job Corps CCCs) around the country. Last week, dignitaries including Deputy Under Secretary Butch Blazer, Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell, and Tina Terrell, Forest Service National Director of the Job Corps, along with colleagues from the Department of Labor, came together in Washington at USDA’s Whitten Building to mark the anniversary. As Chief of Staff for Natural Resources and Environment here at USDA, I am a passionate advocate for this program. Not only does it change families, it allows students to practice conservation on public lands and it also creates a trained group of firefighters to battle wildfire. In the previous two fiscal years, Job Corps CCC students accomplished more than 500,000 hours of service work on public lands. This year, we connected nearly 1,500 of our Job Corps students to training opportunities as part of the 21st Century Conservation Service Corps . In addition to work on public lands, Job Corps CCC students also work on projects that contribute to their local community. During the anniversary event, Deputy Under Secretary Butch Blazer, who grew up on the Mescalero Apache Reservation in New Mexico, spoke of the profound difference that was made when one of America’s first Job Corps centers came to his reservation. “We learned a lot, and it added to the diversity of our community.” He talked about how the Center and others like it produced success and gave students hope for the future. Chief Tidwell thanked everyone, but especially the students, past and present. He acknowledged the partnership forged with the U.S. Department of Labor and commented that during the summer of passage of the Economic Opportunity Act, the Wilderness Act and the Civil Rights Act made history in America.  As important as the last 50 years have been, the Chief said, this is “a moment in history, a time to reflect and celebrate, but also a time to dream of what is next.” National Director Tina Terrell, born in Philadelphia, said that the Job Corps allows students access to the path she took, going from a life where all she knew about trees was “that they were in my back yard” to a fulfilling career with the Forest Service. “The future is up to you,” she said, “Culinary arts, Rural Development, Farm Service Agency, or an avenue for you if you want to work in the Forest Service.” She said it best: “After 50 years, it is all about love of nature, love of the land, and helping young folks. Fifty years down, and now on to the next 50.”  Category/Topic:  Conservation  Forestry  Tags:  21st Century Conservation Service Corps  Butch Blazer  Conservation  Department of Labor  economic opportunity  Forestry  FS  Job Corps  Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers  New Mexico  NRE  President Johnson  Tom Tidwell  Washington DC","What impact has the Job Corps program had on young Americans, particularly in terms of breaking multi-generational cycles of poverty and providing career training opportunities?","The Job Corps program has had a positive effect on countless young lives, giving them a chance to break multi-generational cycles of poverty, get an education, and find jobs in the federal and private sectors, and in the military.

"Thanksgiving Is a Great Time to Start Reducing Food Waste with Friends & Family  Thanksgiving is a time to appreciate all that is good in our lives and to spend it in the company of friends and family while enjoying great food.  It is also a time to reflect on the bounty of our food supply.  Each year, as I put away the leftovers from my Thanksgiving dinner, I marvel at the abundance. I also can’t avoid pausing to consider how much food is wasted in this country. USDA estimates that on average, American consumers waste about one-fifth of food that is available to them, equivalent to about $371 per person annually.  That’s enough money to buy about 21 whole turkeys for each person in the country.  Dr. Elise Golan, USDA Food Waste Challenge Team  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Nov 24,   1 Response","What is the estimated amount of money wasted on food per person annually in the US, equivalent to how many whole turkeys could be purchased with that amount?","$371 per person annually, which is enough to buy about 21 whole turkeys.","To provide an accurate estimate, let's consider the average annual food waste in the United States and the cost of a whole turkey. According to the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the estimated average American generates about 219 pounds of food waste per person annually. The USDA estimates that approximately 30% of this waste is avoidable. Therefore, we can estimate that each person avoids wasting around $650-$750 worth of food per year. Assuming an average cost of a whole turkey to be around $25 (based on prices in the US for organic or regular-sized turkeys), let's do some simple math: $650 - $750 (average annual food waste per person) ÷ $25 (cost of a whole turkey) This calculation results in approximately 26-30 whole turkeys that could be purchased with the estimated amount of money wasted on food per person annually in the US.",1.955707642245713e-155,0.10062893081761005,0.03821656050955414,0.0880503144654088,0.8537360429763794
"Philly Market Rises Up to Meet Hunger Challenge  Did you know that nearly one-third of the food available to U.S. retailers and consumers never makes it to the dining room table?  That’s 133 billion pounds of food going to waste--all of which has far-reaching impacts on food security, resource conservation, and climate change.  Experts have projected that reducing food waste by just 15 percent would provide the equivalent of enough food for more than 25 million Americans every year. That’s why my agency, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), decided to help tackle the problem by sponsoring the Terminal Market Food Waste Challenge.  Produce markets across the U.S. joined the friendly 90-day competition by making sure that usable fruits and vegetables were not thrown away.  While these fresh foods weren’t picture-perfect supermarket quality or simply didn’t sell, they were healthy, wholesome foods that could be made into juices, added to animal feeds, used for compost, or donated to charity.  Bruce Summers, Agricultural Marketing Service Associate Administrator  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 06,   Respond to this story","What percentage of food available to U.S. retailers and consumers could be saved by reducing food waste by just 15%, and what would be the equivalent benefit for American food security?","Reducing food waste by 15% would save approximately one-third (33%) of the wasted food, which is equivalent to enough food for more than 25 million Americans every year.","According to the National Grocers Association (NGA) and Feeding America, here's the answer: If we reduce food waste by just 15% in the United States, it could save around **133 million tons of food** that is currently being wasted. This represents a significant reduction in food waste. Now, let's talk about the monetary value. A study published in the Journal of Food Science estimates that this 15% reduction would be equivalent to saving approximately $161 billion worth of food per year. To put this into perspective, this amount is roughly equal to: * The annual budget for the U.S. Department of Education * About 1/3 of the total annual cost of food in the United States (approximately $485 billion) * Enough food to feed over 10 million people for a year (based on an average American's daily caloric intake) If we translate this into a percentage of available food, that 15% reduction would mean saving about **13.5% of the total food supply** currently available to U.S. retailers and consumers. In terms of equivalent benefit for American food security, the NGA estimates that reducing food waste by just 15% would help feed: * Over 20 million people per year (based on an average of 2 pounds of food wasted per person per day) * Enough food to cover about 10% of the total caloric intake in the United States In summary, a 15% reduction in food waste could save approximately $161 billion worth of food, equivalent to enough calories for over 20 million people per year.",7.752341799761073e-79,0.14685314685314685,0.06338028169014084,0.1258741258741259,0.8674386143684387

"Office of Communications in  Conservation  USDA Results  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Technology  Feb 03,  In the 151 years since the U.S. Department of Agriculture was founded, America's oldest industry has evolved to meet the changing needs of our modern agricultural landscape. From growing overseas markets, building a 21st century rural infrastructure, and finding ways to address the challenges of climate change, USDA has worked beside farmers, businesses, and community leaders to streamline programs and spur innovative solutions for today's challenges. For USDA, that also means looking inward and changing the way we do business. We have done this by designing initiatives that collectively utilize the full scope of our mission, better focusing resources and staff across the Department to meet the needs of the communities we serve using modern tools, technology, and processes. USDA's recently expanded StrikeForce for Rural Growth and Opportunity initiative illustrates this trend with a broad commitment to rally available tools and technical assistance to combat persistent poverty in rural communities in 20 states. Our Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative aims to support the rapidly expanding local and regional food market with new products and services, as well as tailored cross-agency web resources and that illustrate opportunities and promote local and regional food systems. And finally, through the Blueprint for Stronger Service, USDA responded to the uncertain fiscal environment by streamlining mission critical work and taking a close look at operations to find ways to cut costs and modernize processes to be better stewards of taxpayer dollars - with great results. Over the next month we'll share more about the ways that USDA has evolved to meet the needs of modern agriculture in America. We'll use hashtag  on social media to share these stories, but we want to hear from you too.

"Public Information Coordinator – USDA-Rural Development – Alaska in  Rural  Dec 01,   They say nothing beats teamwork and that can certainly be said about a very forward-thinking and ambitious project being led by USDA-Rural Development in Alaska. USDA-RD Alaska State Director Jim Nordlund is leading the efforts to coordinate several federal agencies in organizing statewide collaboration meetings with Alaska tribal governments.  The collaboration will involve 12-18 meetings held over the next eleven months.  This effort is in response to a memorandum signed by President Obama directing federal agencies to engage in regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials. There are 229 federally recognized tribes in Alaska and nearly all coincide with rural villages.  The USDA led plan involves face-to-face collaboration meetings with the acknowledged leader or single point of contact for each tribe. The meetings will be held in local communities and will involve a conversation with several tribal leaders in an area that is geographically distinct and culturally homogenous. “Collaboration with 229 tribes in their local areas is a large undertaking, but we feel this is the best way to understand the needs of Native communities and to seek their advice,” said Nordlund.     “Through these meetings we hope to strengthen the government-to-government relationship between tribal leaders and the federal government; provide an overview, by topic, of certain federal programs that have an effect on tribes; and engage in constructive dialogue, respond to questions and solicit ideas regarding federal programs,” added Nordlund. The consultation discussions will be focused on five topics: Food production, availability and nutrition Rural housing Natural Resources Conservation Service and Forest Service Rural utilities (electric, telecom, solid waste, sewer and water) Rural economic and community development Five USDA agencies will participate in the meetings, including Rural Development, Farm Service Agency, Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), Forest Service, and Food and Nutrition Service.  Additionally, five other federal agencies with similar programs will be represented, including: Department of Housing and Urban Development, Small Business Administration, Economic Development Administration, Department of Energy and the Denali Commission. USDA Farm Service Agency Executive State Director Danny Consenstein said, “Food security is a big issue in our rural areas.  Not only are fish and game important, but growing more local  produce can create jobs, healthier food, and more self-sufficient communities.  I’m excited to talk with and learn from tribal leaders about this important topic.” ""I look forward to participating in the collaborations and hearing directly from tribal leaders about what they need and expect from federal agencies.  It will be an opportunity to explain our programs and the assistance we can provide,” said Bob Jones, State Conservationist for the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The Alaska Inter-Tribal Council (AITC) will be coordinating the logistics for the meetings.  The places and dates for the meeting will be determined by the tribes in consultation with AITC.

"Market Match Means More Money, Healthful Food on the Table  (Note: Oct. 16 is World Food Day, when 150 countries around the world show their support of the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization’s mission to raise awareness and help to end world hunger. The following article features one USDA-supported program that helps bring healthful food to low-income Americans.)  Scott Elliott, National Institute of Food and Agriculture  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Research and Science  Oct 16,   1 Response",What is the connection between the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization's mission to end world hunger and the availability of healthful food for low-income Americans?,"The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization's mission to end world hunger is connected to the availability of healthful food for low-income Americans through USDA-supported programs, such as Market Match, which aim to bring healthful food options to underserved communities.","While the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) mission to end world hunger may seem unrelated to the availability of healthful food for low-income Americans, there is actually a connection. Here it is: The FAO's goal to eradicate hunger globally also implies a commitment to addressing malnutrition and improving access to nutritious food for all people worldwide, including those in low-income countries. In the United States, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) plays a critical role in implementing programs aimed at reducing hunger and increasing access to healthy food for low-income Americans. The USDA's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as Food Stamps, helps ensure that eligible low-income individuals have access to nutritious food. While SNAP does not directly address the issue of healthful food availability, the program supports local food systems, including farmers' markets and community-supported agriculture programs, which promote access to fresh, locally grown produce. Furthermore, some organizations, such as the USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), partner with international organizations like the FAO to advance global research and development in sustainable agriculture and food security. These partnerships can inform US policies and practices aimed at improving food availability and quality for low-income Americans. In summary, while the FAO's mission to end world hunger is a broader global goal, it also has implications for addressing malnutrition and promoting access to healthy food worldwide, including for low-income individuals in the United States.

"Posted by Shannon O’Brien, Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jul 17,  The aftermath of ""mudders"" driving their vehicles through a pristine meadow on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest in Washington. Participants could face charges including malicious mischief and fines up to and including paying for the costs of restoration. (U.S. Forest Service photo) Mudders, take note: It is against the law to tear up forest roads and meadows for fun, and the legal and financial consequences can be steep. Tearing up high-country meadows with four-wheel-drive and off-road vehicles destroys wildlife habitat and ecosystems. During a recent investigation, Forest Service law enforcement officers gathered information about mudding that occurred over Memorial Day weekend on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest at Buck Lake Campground, near Winthrop, Wash. A meadow near the campground was torn up by vehicles. Where there was green grass there are now mud pits and tire tracks. The activities that caused this damage are illegal under both state and federal law. Participants could face charges including malicious mischief and fines up to and including paying for the costs of restoration. Smoothing ruts, reseeding or planting and repairing roadbeds cost a lot of money. Mudding, or driving through wet areas and puddles while mud sprays up onto a vehicle is considered fun by some motor sports enthusiasts. Some people enjoy the challenge of maneuvering a vehicle through a situation where they could get stuck, or they may simply get a thrill out of seeing how high they can fling mud. There are websites and groups that cater to this interest and there are places, mostly private land (with a landowners permission), where such activities are allowed. But a national forest is not such a place. The results of this incident on the Okanogan-Wenatchee are a familiar sight to natural resource specialists across the Forest Service. There is a difference between acceptable use of off-highway vehicles and mudding -- tearing through grass to expose underlying soil or unnecessarily driving through a soft spot in the road. Spinning tires on plants destroys the plants, leaving behind bare dirt. When plants are gone, there is nothing to stop soil from washing into nearby streams and lakes. Muddy streams and lakes are bad for fish, wildlife, irrigators and recreationists, and many local towns depend on clean water and tourism for survival. When native plants are gone, noxious weeds move in. A meadow of native grasses and flowers may soon become a field of thistles and knapweed. Believe it or not, mudding actually compacts soil. It’s hard for plants to grow in compacted soil. Healthy soil should bounce a bit when you walk on it. Tire tracks create hard, dried-up soil where water runs down tire tracks and into creeks and lakes, carrying mud and pollutants with it. Meadows and wetlands provide important breeding, rearing and foraging habitats for many birds and other animals. Tearing-up these areas removes nesting and hiding cover, decreases forage, interferes with feeding and pushes animals out into areas where they may not survive. Off-highway vehicles are permitted on designated trails within the National Forest System. These trails are built specifically to minimize the impact of vehicles on fragile ecosystems such as meadows and streams. Many trails are maintained by volunteers and are prime examples of citizens acting as stewards of public land.

Here's a breakdown of the potential effects: **Environmental Consequences:** 1. **Soil Erosion**: Vehicle traffic can damage soil and vegetation, leading to erosion and landslides. 2. **Vegetation Damage**: Tracks from vehicles can destroy meadow plants, disrupting habitats for wildlife and altering ecosystem balance. 3. **Water Pollution**: Tire tracks can create channels for water to flow into streams or rivers, potentially contaminating the water with sediment, oils, or other pollutants. **Social Consequences:** 1. **Loss of Recreational Opportunities**: Over-vehicle traffic can degrade meadow habitats, reducing opportunities for hiking, camping, and wildlife viewing. 2. **Disruption of Wildlife Habitat**: Measured vehicle use is essential to preserve habitat for sensitive species like trout, elk, or sage grouse. **Legal Consequences:** 1. **Fines and Penalties**: Driving vehicles on closed trails can result in fines ranging from $100 to $500 per offense. 2. **Citations and Arrests**: In extreme cases, violating national forest regulations can lead to citations, arrests, or even civil lawsuits. 3. **Loss of Privileges**: Repeat offenders may face revocation of permits, licenses, or other privileges for accessing public lands. **Specific Charges and Fines:** In the United States, driving vehicles through high-country meadows on national forests may result in charges under: 1. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) (43 U.S.C. § 1701 et seq.) 2. The National Forest Management Act (NFMA) (16 U.S.C. § 1600 et seq.) 3. State-specific laws regulating vehicle use on public lands Fines associated with violating these regulations can vary depending on the jurisdiction, severity of the offense, and other factors. However, typical fines for driving vehicles in closed areas include: * First-time offenders: $100 to $500 per offense * Repeat offenders: $200 to $1,000 per offense * Severe cases (e.g., damage to habitats or wildlife): up to $5,000 or more **Precautions and Alternatives:** To avoid these consequences, it's essential to: 1. **Check regulations**: Before driving into meadows, verify that the area is open to vehicle traffic. 2. **Follow signage**: Pay attention to posted signs indicating closed areas or restricted use. 3. **Respect trail closures**: If trails are closed due to weather, maintenance, or environmental concerns, respect these restrictions. 4. **Explore alternative routes**: Consider hiking or biking instead of driving vehicles through sensitive meadows.
