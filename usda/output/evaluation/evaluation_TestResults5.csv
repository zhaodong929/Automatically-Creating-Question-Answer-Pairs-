"Pollinators like honeybees, butterflies, birds, bats and other animals are hard at work providing vital but often unnoticed services. They pollinate crops like apples, bananas, blueberries, strawberries, melon, peaches, potatoes, vanilla, almonds, coffee and chocolate. Pollinators by Numbers Three-fourths of the world¡¯s flowering plants and about 35 percent of the world¡¯s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce. That¡¯s one out of every three bites of food you eat. More than 3,500 species of native bees help increase crop yields. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of animal pollinators like bees, butterflies and moths, birds and bats, and beetles and other insects. The Pollinator Partnership The Pollinator Partnership offers 32 different planting guides to improve pollinator habitat, each one tailored to a specific ecoregion in the United States. Each guide is filled with an abundance of native plant and pollinator information. Enter your zip code to find your planting guide. How Animal Pollination Works Pollinators visit flowers in their search for food (nectar and pollen). During a flower visit, a pollinator may accidentally brush against the flower¡¯s reproductive parts, unknowingly depositing pollen from flower to flower. The plant uses the pollen to produce a fruit or seed. Many plants cannot reproduce without pollen carried to them by foraging pollinators. Pollinators Are in Trouble You may have heard that bees are disappearing and bats are dying. These and other animal pollinators face many challenges in the modern world. Habitat loss, disease, parasites, and environmental contaminants have all contributed to the decline of many species of pollinators. Pollinators that can¡¯t find the right quantity or quality of food (nectar and pollen from blooming plants within flight range) don¡¯t survive. Right now, there simply aren¡¯t enough pollinator friendly plantings to support pollinators. Learn more about how USDA is helping pollinators. Learn more about these pollinators: Bats Butterflies Helpful Hint: Did you know dandelions are the first food for bees emerging in the spring. Leave them in your yard and feed the bees! Dandelion petals and leaves are also edible and can be used in salads. You Can Help Pollinators You can help pollinators in your garden at home. Pollinators make use of food and habitat anywhere it is found, whether on roadsides, in a schoolyard garden or a planter on a windowsill. Here¡¯s how:  Complete a Wildlife Assessment. One of the first steps in creating new habitat for pollinators is to first assess and evaluate your existing space. Habitat assessments can be great tools to identify practices where you can improve or confirm good practices you already have in place. The Xerces Society has several different habitat assessment guides for different types of landscapes or specific insects. The Habitat Assessment Guide for Pollinators in Yards, Gardens, and Parks is a great resource for small and urban sites, including urban farms. The Pollinators: Farms and Agricultural Landscapes and Beneficial Insects: Farms and Agricultural Landscapes and two other great options for assessing agricultural lands. For more information on providing ground, stem, and cavity nesting sites and overwintering sites, be sure to check out Xerces guide on Nesting & Overwintering Habitat for Pollinators & Other Beneficial Insects.  Types of Habitat. There are several habitat opportunities and strategies you can use to invite pollinators into your urban farms, gardens, or yards. Pollinator habitat can beautify your space, increase native biodiversity, increase pollination services and biological control of ¡°pest¡± insects, and provide community engagement and learning opportunities. Often for smaller scale gardens in urban areas, plugs or transplanted plants from pots are preferred over pure live wildflower seeds.  Plant Native Plants. Native plants are considered the best choice because of their abundance of nectar and pollen in addition to being low maintenance, generally pest free, drought tolerant, and ability to control erosion. They are good sources of food and shelter for wildlife, and naturally beautiful.  Plant a continuous food supply. Make sure you have at least 3 different species throughout the spring, summer, and fall seasons to provide adequate food when pollinators emerge from and prepare for winter hibernation. Plant in groupings (clumps) of each plant species for a greater impact.  Include a diversity of plants. Different flower sizes, shapes and , as well as varying plant heights and growth habits, support a greater number and diversity of pollinators. Include a combination of native plant species, heirloom plants and herbs in your pollinator garden. Common herbs such as rosemary, oregano, basil, marjoram, and borage are excellent pollinator plants. Allow unharvested fruits and vegetables to bolt (go to flower) for added pollinator and beneficial insect food.  Limit or eliminate use of pesticides. A healthy garden with the appropriate plant species and an abundance of pollinators will support natural beneficial insects¡ªreducing the need for pest control.   Install bat boxes. Bats are also pollinators that need our help. Leave snags for habitat or install a bat box. Learn more about the benefits of bats!  Spread Awareness. Educate others about the importance of pollinators and share how you planted for bees, butterflies, birds and other animals at home.

Here are some effective ways to achieve this: 1. **Plant a diverse range of flowers**: Incorporate a variety of native wildflowers, herbs, and vegetables that provide nectar and pollen for pollinators. Choose plants that bloom at different times to ensure a constant food source. 2. **Incorporate bee hotels or insect houses**: Provide shelter for solitary bees and other beneficial insects by installing bee hotels or insect houses made from natural materials like bamboo, straws, or hollow reeds. 3. **Leave some areas unmanaged**: Create ""wild"" spaces within your garden or farm that mimic natural ecosystems. This will allow native plants to grow and provide habitat for pollinators. 4. **Use rainwater harvesting systems**: Collect and store rainwater to reduce the need for pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals that harm pollinators. 5. **Avoid using neonicotinoid-based pesticides**: These chemicals have been linked to bee declines and can harm other beneficial insects. 6. **Incorporate nesting sites for solitary bees**: Provide specific nesting sites like bare patches of ground or shallow holes in wooden stakes for solitary bees to lay their eggs. 7. **Create a pollinator-friendly pathway**: Design a pathway using native plants, herbs, or flowers that provide a continuous source of nectar and pollen for pollinators as they move through the garden or farm. 8. **Use cover crops**: Plant cover crops like clover or alfalfa between crop cycles to provide habitat for beneficial insects and improve soil health. 9. **Provide a water source**: Create a shallow dish or birdbath with fresh water and rocks for pollinators to land on while drinking. 10. **Educate and engage the community**: Share knowledge about pollinator-friendly habitats, host workshops, and involve local schools and residents in conservation efforts. By implementing these strategies, urban farmers and gardeners can: * Increase crop yields by attracting beneficial insects * Improve soil health through cover crops and rainwater harvesting systems * Support local biodiversity by creating habitat for native pollinators * Enhance ecosystem services like pest control and nutrient cycling Remember, every small action counts, and collective efforts will contribute to a more pollinator-friendly urban environment.",6.78900576249663e-232,0.08673469387755103,0.020512820512820513,0.0510204081632653,0.8126019239425659

"Administrator, Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Jan 20,  USDA¡¯s Food and Nutrition Service is committed to providing equitable access to food to all Americans, but racial disparities in food security still exist. With the rate of food and nutrition insecurity higher among Black, Hispanic, and Native American populations, the bears this out. In response, both USDA and the Biden-Harris Administration have implemented programs targeting racial injustice and inequity in food and nutrition. Since January , FNS has worked tirelessly to combat the impacts of food insecurity and racial inequity by advancing WIC, providing equity in access to SNAP, expanding culturally appropriate meals for children, extending food assistance to American territories, and improving nutrition assistance for Tribal communities. Through these programs, USDA helps millions of Americans of all backgrounds receive access to nutritious foods. The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) Self-Determination Demonstration Project, for instance, empowers Tribal Nations with more purchasing options to buy food that better aligns with culture and traditions. Since October , we¡¯ve awarded $3.5 million to eight Tribal Nations. ¡°This project is a big deal. It¡¯s a great showing of how FNS supports the interests of Indian Country to ensure more Tribal people have the chance to partake in Native foods grown by Native people,¡± said FNS Tribal Affairs Specialist Michael Ladd. In Wisconsin, the Oneida Nation and Menominee Indian Tribe have used the FDPIR project funds to purchase tribally procured meats, fish, and apples from the Oneida Nation Farm and the Oneida Nation Apple Orchard. With support from USDA, contracts awarded through the FDPIR Self-Determination Demonstration Project will continue to run through . The program not only provides agency and nutrition to Tribal Nations, it also demonstrates USDA¡¯s commitment to racial justice and equity.

"Senior Policy Advisor for the Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Aug 18,  Tribal nations across what we now consider the Great Plains relied for millennia on their buffalo relatives for food, medicine, clothing, tools, and shelter. Yet today it is hard to find buffalo meat on school meal trays in the very areas where they once sustained Native communities. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is working with tribal partners to figure out why and to remove the barriers we can. The Biden-Harris Administration and Secretary Vilsack have made it a priority to better meet our federal trust and treaty responsibilities. Historically, the U.S. government played a significant role in the decimation of the buffalo population in the North American continent, with a policy of destroying buffalo in order to starve Native Americans into submission. We recognize the weight of these actions and our obligation to better support tribes in restoring buffalo across their lands. On Monday, June 6, my colleagues at FNS, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Rural Development, Agricultural Marketing Service, and the USDA Office of Tribal Relations, and I were honored to be invited by the InterTribal Buffalo Council (ITBC) and members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to participate in a traditional buffalo slaughter and field harvest. ITBC is a coalition of 69 federally recognized tribes that has led the work to restore buffalo to Indian Country since . Our traditional harvest was led by Lisa and Arlo Iron Cloud who work with Makoce Agriculture Development, an Indigenous agriculture organization led by Nick Hernandez on Pine Ridge. Ms. Iron Cloud is also partnering with USDA¡¯s Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative to help create resources on sustainable, Indigenous food foraging practices. This ¡°hands-on¡± experience was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for which we are so grateful to Lisa, Arlo, the ITBC, and the Oglala Lakota Nation Tribal leadership to get a glimpse into the cultural, spiritual, and practical contributions of buffalo to the Lakota people. We saw first-hand the importance of providing opportunities for American Indian children to engage in hands-on nutrition education about buffalo and to be able to taste and regularly eat buffalo as part of their school meals. FNS has worked to address some of the barriers that make it challenging for schools to serve buffalo, but we recognize that we must do more. We look forward to continuing to partner with ITBC and tribal leaders to advance Indigenous food sovereignty priorities and restore buffalo in Indian Country.

However, it does not explicitly state what these major barriers are. To find a solution to this question, you can follow up with related articles or search websites to find information on the challenges faced by schools in Native American communities in serving buffalo meat.","A very specific and interesting question! The major barriers that prevent schools in Native American communities from serving buffalo meat as part of their school meals are: 1. **Availability and Accessibility**: Buffalo, also known as bison, is a culturally significant animal for many Native American tribes, but its availability and affordability can be limited due to factors such as habitat restrictions, regulations, and market demand. Additionally, the logistics of sourcing and transporting buffalo meat from ranches or hunting operations may be challenging. 2. **Regulations and Food Safety**: Schools must comply with federal and state food safety guidelines, which require strict handling, storage, and serving procedures for meat products. However, buffalo meat is a high-risk product due to its potential for contamination and spoilage, making it difficult for schools to meet these requirements without specialized equipment and expertise. 3. **Culinary Knowledge and Training**: Preparing and serving traditional Native American dishes like bison stew or jerky requires culinary knowledge and skills that may not be readily available in school kitchens. This can make it difficult to safely and appealingly serve buffalo meat as part of the meal program. 4. **Budget Constraints**: Many schools, especially those in rural areas or with limited budgets, face financial constraints that limit their ability to invest in alternative protein sources like bison meat. 5. **Community Involvement and Cultural Relevance**: Serving buffalo meat would require coordination with local communities, including Native American tribes, to ensure cultural sensitivity and relevance. This can involve consultations with tribal leaders, elders, or community members to determine the best way to prepare and serve the meat in a culturally respectful manner. These barriers contribute to the challenges faced by schools in Native American communities when trying to incorporate buffalo meat into their school meals.",0.06982658214683488,0.2802197802197802,0.1270718232044199,0.1868131868131868,0.8545811772346497

"USDA NASS Public Affairs Specialist in  Research and Science  Jun 16,  Farming is hot! From sweet corn to watermelon and apricots to tomatoes, a lot is growing on the farm this summer. Millions of producers across our nation continue to work tirelessly to produce safe and delicious food. According to the latest Census of Agriculture, more than a quarter of these producers are new and beginning farmers, proving that many people are unable to resist agriculture¡¯s magnetic appeal. USDA defines a beginning farmer as anyone who has farmed for 10 years or less. In , the United States had 908,274 producers who identified as beginning farmers, and they accounted for 27% of the country¡¯s 3.4 million producers. How old are these new farmers? The average age of a beginning farmer is 46.3, much younger than the average age of all farmers . Without a doubt, the art and science of producing food attracts people of all ages. If we look for younger farmers, we find 26% of beginning farmers are under the age of 35. The under 35 age group represents only 8% of all U.S. farmers overall. Will more young people find a match in farming as time goes on? Look for an update in the Census of Agriculture. States with the largest share of beginning farmers are mostly on the east and west coasts. However, just as Texas is the state with the most farms and the most producers, Texas leads in the number of beginning farmers.

She is especially proud of her work on the California Landscape Conservation Cooperatives steering committee for the past two years. Comprised of non-governmental organizations and state and federal agencies, their goal is to look at landscape scales and improve the link between science and management in how to maintain ecosystems in the face of climate change, urbanization, and other stressors. The cooperative has facilitated a number of projects, including looking at where sensitive ecosystems are headed with climate change, which species and species habitat is the most vulnerable, and checking sea levels to see if they are on the rise.  John Heil, Pacific Southwest Region, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Jul 11,   Respond to this story",What conservation strategies can be implemented at landscape scales to protect sensitive ecosystems and species from climate change impacts?,"The California Landscape Conservation Cooperatives steering committee has facilitated projects that look at landscape scales and improve the link between science and management in how to maintain ecosystems in the face of climate change, urbanization, and other stressors. This includes identifying where sensitive ecosystems are headed with climate change, which species and species habitat is the most vulnerable, and assessing sea levels to determine if they are on the rise.","To address the impact of climate change on sensitive ecosystems and species, several conservation strategies can be implemented at landscape scales. These include: 1. **Connectivity planning**: Restoring habitat connectivity between isolated patches of ecosystem types or creating corridors for species movement can help maintain biodiversity and allow species to migrate to more favorable habitats as climate conditions change. 2. **Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA)**: EbA focuses on enhancing the resilience of ecosystems, which in turn helps them adapt better to changing environmental conditions. This involves restoring degraded habitats, promoting carbon sequestration through sustainable land-use practices, and enhancing ecosystem services like water cycling and pollination. 3. **Protected areas expansion**: Expanding protected area networks can provide critical habitat for species vulnerable to climate change impacts and serve as refuges during extreme weather events or periods of rapid environmental change. 4. **Sustainable land-use planning**: Encouraging sustainable land use through practices like agroforestry, permaculture, and integrated agriculture can help maintain ecosystem services while also allowing forests and natural habitats to continue providing ecological benefits under changing climate conditions. 5. **Climate-smart conservation planning**: This involves integrating projections of future climate scenarios into conservation strategies. It helps in identifying areas that will remain relatively stable under different climate change scenarios, thus prioritizing conservation efforts in those places. 6. **Early warning systems and monitoring**: Implementing early warning systems for environmental changes can allow for timely intervention to mitigate impacts on sensitive ecosystems or species. Continuous monitoring of ecosystems also aids in understanding the effectiveness of implemented strategies and the need for adjustments based on observed outcomes. 7. **Community engagement and co-management**: Involving local communities in conservation efforts, ensuring their participation in decision-making processes, and promoting shared responsibility can lead to more effective management of sensitive ecosystems and species. Such an approach helps ensure that the long-term needs of these ecosystems are balanced with short-term human requirements. 8. **Ecological restoration**: Restoring degraded habitats not only enhances biodiversity but also provides ecosystem services that help mitigate climate change impacts. For example, restored wetlands can act as carbon sinks or buffer against storms and flooding. 9. **Adaptive management approaches**: This involves implementing conservation strategies based on the best available knowledge at a given time. It then continuously monitoring their effectiveness and adjusting these plans as new data becomes available or when unexpected outcomes occur. 10. **Incorporating climate resilience into agriculture and forestry practices**: Incorporating principles of ecosystem services, biodiversity preservation, and ecological restoration into agricultural and forestry practices can help maintain ecosystem health while also ensuring food security under a changing climate. Implementing these strategies at landscape scales requires not only coordinated action among governments but also the active participation of local communities, scientists, and other stakeholders.

"Learn How to Bee a Friend during USDA's Pollinator Festival this Friday, June 24  The best time to bee a friend to pollinators is now! Today is the first day of summer and the launch of National Pollinator Week, June 20-26. Around the globe, people are celebrating with events that emphasize the importance of pollinators and teach ways to save them. Here at USDA, we¡¯ve issued the National Pollinator Week Proclamation and are hosting our seventh annual Pollinator Week Festival this Friday, June 24 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. outside USDA Headquarters in Washington, DC. The festival highlights the work of USDA agencies, other federal departments and institutions such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Smithsonian Gardens, and the U.S. Botanic Garden, who along with partners like the National Honey Board, Pollinator Partnership and University of Maryland Extension are working to address pollinator decline.  Annie Ceccarini, Program Manager, The People's Garden Initiative  Posted in  Initiatives  Jun 20,   1 Response",What are the main reasons behind the decline of pollinators in the US?,Pollinator decline.,"The decline of pollinators, including bees, butterflies, and other insects essential for plant reproduction, is a pressing issue in the United States. The main reasons behind this decline can be attributed to: 1. **Habitat Loss and Fragmentation**: Widespread deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural intensification have led to the destruction of natural habitats and the creation of isolated patches of land that are not conducive to pollinator populations. 2. **Pesticide Use**: The widespread use of pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids, has been linked to bee deaths and colony collapse disorder (CCD). These chemicals can be toxic to bees and other pollinators, disrupting their nervous systems and impairing their ability to navigate and communicate. 3. **Climate Change**: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns have disrupted the delicate timing of plant-pollinator interactions, making it difficult for pollinators to adapt to changing environmental conditions. 4. **Monoculture Agriculture**: The increasing dominance of monoculture crops (e.g., corn, soybeans) has led to a decline in the diversity of plants that provide food and shelter for pollinators. 5. **Varroa Mite Infestations**: These parasites can weaken bee colonies, making them more susceptible to disease and pesticide exposure. 6. **Diseases and Parasites**: The spread of diseases such as American Foulbrood and Nosema, as well as the presence of parasites like varroa mites, have contributed to colony decline. 7. **Lack of Forage Diversity**: As agricultural practices become more intensive, the diversity of plants that provide forage for pollinators has decreased, reducing their access to food and nutrients. These factors are interconnected and can exacerbate one another, making it essential to address them through a comprehensive approach that includes: * Conservation efforts to protect and restore natural habitats * Sustainable agricultural practices that promote biodiversity * Reduced pesticide use and more targeted management strategies * Climate-resilient agriculture and conservation planning * Research into the causes of pollinator decline and the development of effective management and conservation strategies By addressing these factors, we can work towards mitigating the decline of pollinators in the United States and ensuring their continued health and resilience.",4.255234556550279e-232,0.011904761904761906,0.005988023952095808,0.011904761904761906,0.8181084990501404

The region's deep, fertile soils also support healthy crop growth. 2. **Complementary grazing**: Dryland wheat can be planted in the spring, allowing cattle to graze on the stubble and weeds that grow among the mature plants. This complementary use of land increases overall productivity while minimizing conflicts between agriculture and ranching activities. 3. **Crop rotation benefits**: Incorporating dryland wheat into a rotational system with cattle grazing helps maintain soil health, reduce erosion, and minimize pests and diseases. The crop's residues also provide a nutrient-rich mulch that benefits subsequent crops. 4. **Marketing opportunities**: Dryland wheat can be harvested in the fall, providing an additional revenue stream for ranchers who market their grain to local buyers or processors. 5. **Scalability**: Wheat production can be scaled up or down depending on market demand and the size of the cattle operation, making it a flexible and adaptable agricultural use. By integrating dryland wheat production with cattle ranching in the Texas Panhandle, landowners can: * Diversify their income streams * Improve soil health and reduce erosion * Increase overall productivity and profitability This integrated approach can be beneficial for both agriculture and ranching operations, making it a suitable and effective use of land in the region.",4.325655442221494e-79,0.07434944237918216,0.0449438202247191,0.06691449814126395,0.8247382044792175
"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Nov 14,  In a staging area, workers carefully begin the process of wrapping the tree to protect it during the 5,000-mile journey from Colville National Forest to the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. (U.S. Forest Service photo) The 88-foot Engelmann spruce tree that will grace the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol as a gift from the people must first get from Colville National Forest in Washington State to Washington, D.C. That means careful packing with special attention paid to cocooning the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree so the thick branches stay intact and nothing hangs over the side of the trailer it is placed on. ¡°What does it take to wrap an 88-foot-tall Engelmann spruce?¡± said Franklin Pemberton of the Colville National Forest. ¡°Also a lot of hard-working volunteers, 4,000 feet of parachute cord with a 550-pound breaking strength and a huge building.¡± The tree wrapping process started at the harvest area on the Colville. Two large industrial cranes gently lowered the tree onto a custom-made cradle atop a special tractor trailer. ¡°The longest of the branches were tied up so they wouldn¡¯t drag on the road for the trip from the harvest site to the Newport (Wash.) celebration and then to the wrapping site,¡± Pemberton said. More than ate to help prep the tree for the journey. ¡°Once at the wrapping site, this is where the sticky, prickly and labor-intensive part of the process starts,¡± he said. ¡°Volunteers start to move the branches towards the center of the tree, using ratcheting straps to move the larger branches into place near the trunk so that the tree will fit inside its protective box trailer.¡± Keeping the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree from drying out is important during the 5,000-mile trip from Washington State to Washington, D.C. The end of the trunk is wrapped with a 40-gallon bladder that is refreshed throughout the trip. The tree needs more than 50 gallons of water each day to stay fresh. (U.S. Forest Service photo) Once those branches are tucked as close as they will go to the trunk, volunteers tie the branches in place with the parachute cord. While doing this, the trees pitch, or sap, covers the volunteer¡¯s hands, clothes and hair making for a sticky, but pleasant smelling ordeal. Once tucked away, the tree is cocooned by aluminum frame and plywood siding. Hoops straddle the top to provide support and protection for a decorative tarp. The only exposed parts of the tree can be seen through three viewing windows. Two of the windows will let onlookers see the top of the tree decorated with lights and a few of the thousands of ornaments created by children in Washington State. The third viewing area will give visitors a chance to see the 40-gallon bladder used to keep the thirsty tree moist and healthy along its trip. The tree will stop in 22 cities on the way to the Capitol. The tree is expected to arrive at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Nov. 24. On Nov. 25, the tree will be escorted into Washington, D.C. A tree lighting ceremony is scheduled for Dec. 3. The tradition of a Christmas tree on the U.S. Capitol lawn began in . The first several years live trees were planted but did not thrive. In , the Capitol Architect asked the Forest Service for help. Since then, a national forest is chosen each year, and residents of the state where the forest in located work together with partners throughout the state to take care of a variety of logistical needs. The community buildup starts roughly a year in advance as a grass-roots community effort to give the gift to all Americans, which is why it is dubbed ¡°The People¡¯s Tree.¡± No tax dollars are used. However, Forest Service employees are assigned to help oversee the project. Follow the tree¡¯s journey. The Capitol Christmas Tree arrives in Colville, Wash. on its cross-country trip. The flatbed trailer is framed to keep the branches of the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree protected for its long journey from Washington State to Washington, D.C. Plywood completes the cocooning, and a special section at the top of the tree is equipped with decorated ¡°windows¡± to allow the public to catch a glimpse during stops along the way.

Some of these challenges include: 1. **Structural integrity**: The tree's root system and trunk must be strong enough to withstand the rigors of transportation, including handling, loading, and unloading. 2. **Hydration**: Trees require a consistent supply of water to survive. Dehydration can cause stress, damage, or even kill the tree during transport. 3. **Temperature control**: Trees are sensitive to temperature fluctuations. Prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures (hot or cold) can cause stress, defoliation, or even death. 4. **Light and humidity**: Trees need adequate light and humidity to maintain their health. During transportation, they may be exposed to artificial lighting and controlled humidity environments. 5. **Root care**: The root system of a large tree requires specialized care during transport, including watering, pruning, and protection from drying out. 6. **Size and weight**: Large trees can be extremely heavy and difficult to handle, requiring custom equipment and labor for safe transportation. 7. **Permitting and regulations**: Transporting a large tree across jurisdictions may require special permits, licenses, and compliance with local regulations. 8. **Pathway considerations**: The path of the transportation must be carefully planned to ensure that the tree is not exposed to harsh weather conditions, such as windstorms or extreme temperatures. 9. **Tree handling**: Trees are delicate living organisms that require gentle handling during transport to prevent damage to their branches, trunk, and roots. 10. **Destination preparation**: The receiving site must be prepared to receive a large tree, including ensuring sufficient space for the tree's growth and developing strategies for its care and maintenance. To overcome these challenges, specialized companies and experts in arboriculture and logistics often collaborate to design and execute customized transportation plans that cater to the specific needs of each tree. These plans may include custom-built containers or caskets, advanced irrigation systems, temperature-controlled environments, and careful handling by trained personnel.",6.896403244201488e-79,0.2205513784461153,0.08060453400503778,0.13533834586466165,0.8357548117637634

"Gopher Tortoise Habitats Thrive along Alabama's Gulf Coast  Longleaf pine forests once dominated the Southeast. But over the past two centuries, many of these forests have disappeared along with the wildlife that called them home. Recent efforts to enhance longleaf forests on private lands are helping the ecosystem rebound as well as wildlife like the gopher tortoise. The gopher tortoise is a keystone species of the longleaf forest, known for their deep burrows that provide vital habitat and shelter for not only itself but many other species. The gopher tortoise is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in the western part of the longleaf range, including parts of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.  Amelia Hines Dortch, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Alabama  Posted in  Conservation  Oct 19,   3 Responses",How can conservation efforts for non-agricultural ecosystems like longleaf pine forests also benefit agricultural lands?,"Conservation efforts for non-agricultural ecosystems like longleaf pine forests can also benefit agricultural lands by improving soil quality, reducing erosion, and increasing water filtration, which in turn can lead to more productive and sustainable agricultural practices.","While it may seem counterintuitive, conservation efforts for non-agricultural ecosystems like longleaf pine forests can indeed have benefits for agricultural lands in several ways: 1. **Soil Conservation and Erosion Control**: Longleaf pine forests have a unique ecosystem that helps to stabilize soil through root systems and leaf litter. This stability reduces soil erosion and runoff, which can be beneficial for adjacent agricultural areas by preventing topsoil loss and reducing nutrient depletion. 2. **Water Quality Improvement**: The longleaf pine ecosystem's water filtration capabilities help maintain water quality in nearby watersheds. Clean water is essential for agriculture, as it prevents contamination of crops, drinking water sources, and aquatic ecosystems. 3. **Climate Regulation and Microclimate Creation**: Longleaf pine forests can act as a climate-regulating mechanism by moderating temperatures, humidity levels, and precipitation patterns. This microclimatic effect can benefit nearby agricultural areas by providing optimal growing conditions for crops. 4. **Biodiversity Enhancement and Pest Control**: The diverse flora and fauna in longleaf pine forests can help maintain ecological balance, which can lead to reduced pest pressure on agricultural lands. By promoting natural pest control mechanisms, farmers can reduce the need for pesticides and other chemicals. 5. **Soil Carbon Sequestration**: Longleaf pine forests are known for their carbon sequestration capabilities through the accumulation of organic matter in soils. This process can enhance soil fertility, structure, and water-holding capacity, benefiting adjacent agricultural areas by improving soil health. 6. **Reduced Fertilizer and Irrigation Requirements**: By maintaining healthy longleaf pine ecosystems, conservation efforts can lead to reduced fertilizer and irrigation demands on agricultural lands. This is because the forests' nutrient cycling processes and natural rainfall patterns help maintain soil fertility and moisture levels. 7. **Ecosystem Services Trade-offs**: Protecting non-agricultural ecosystems like longleaf pine forests can also benefit agriculture by creating a buffer zone for agricultural areas, protecting them from invasive species, wildfires, and other environmental threats. By recognizing these interconnected relationships between conservation efforts for non-agricultural ecosystems and agricultural lands, we can foster more holistic approaches to land management, ultimately benefiting both ecosystems.",0.04157570218345712,0.16886543535620052,0.11140583554376657,0.14248021108179418,0.861693799495697

"Posted by USDA in  USDA Results  Oct 22,   October 20 marked the official launch of the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) at USDA for the Washington, D.C. metro area. Administered by the government¡¯s Office of Personnel Management (OPM), CFC is the world¡¯s largest workplace giving program. Since its inception in , federal employees have contributed more than $6 billion to the non-profit community. This year, USDA has set a goal of raising just under $2 million from its approximately 10,000 employees in the national capital area. The official kickoff on Tuesday morning was an exciting event in the Whitten Building patio featuring top USDA leadership and more than 20 CFC registered non-profit organizations. Secretary Tom Vilsack and Undersecretary for Research, Education, and Economics, Dr. Raj Shah, led off the event by speaking movingly about the ways that non-profit organizations touch all of our lives in critical and transformative ways. Dr. Shah spoke about incredible array of non-profits that participate in CFC, from groups doing lifesaving work fighting malaria in Africa to charities feeding hungry people right here in Washington, D.C. Secretary Vilsack spoke about his own birth in a Catholic orphanage, saying that he probably would not be here today if not for the nuns who took care of him and his birth mother. Both stressed the importance of giving generously this year more than ever, as the worldwide economic crisis has dramatically increased the needs of the non-profit community even as donations to the sector have fallen off. Secretary Vilsack emphasized that as federal workers, we have all been blessed with good jobs, and that CFC is a wonderful opportunity to share that blessing with people in need. After Secretary Vilsack¡¯s remarks, he officially opened the campaign by handing in his own completed pledge form. Dr. Shah and much of USDA¡¯s senior leadership followed suit, as the assembled USDA employees watched a video message from President Obama. The President encouraged all federal employees to give generously to CFC this year, as part of the same spirit of service and community that he has worked to strengthen across the country through United We Serve. As the first phase of the kickoff drew to a close, Bernadine Prince of FARMFRESH Markets spoke about her organization¡¯s work to promote locally grown food throughout the DC Metro area. When Ms. Prince finished her remarks, it was time for the attendees to sample some of the fresh, locally grown food from USDA¡¯s very own Farmers Market, such as apple cider and banana bread. Before attendees enjoyed the delicious and healthy refreshments, Dr. Susan McCarthy from the Agricultural Research Service, USDA¡¯s CFC Campaign Manager, launched the charity fair. This fair was an excellent opportunity for USDA employees to talk to representatives of a few of the thousands of non-profits represented in the CFC catalog. Employees who attended reported having a wonderful time and learning a great deal about non-profits doing great work in a wide variety of ways. The Secretary is hoping that all employees will join him in giving to the non-profit organizations of their choice. The size of the gift matters much less than the fact that each employee participates on some level.

However, I can tell you that local farmers and non-profit organizations play significant roles in promoting sustainable food systems. Here's how they contribute: 1. **Community Building**: Local farmers often participate in community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs where consumers purchase shares directly from them, providing a stable income stream. This model strengthens the local food economy. 2. **Sustainable Practices**: Many local farms practice sustainable farming methods that reduce environmental impact and promote biodiversity. These practices include using organic farming methods, integrating crop rotation, and reducing water consumption. 3. **Food Security**: By growing their own produce, communities can achieve greater food security and resilience. This is particularly important in areas where access to fresh produce might be limited due to distance or economic constraints. 4. **Nutrition Education**: Non-profit organizations involved in sustainable food systems often provide nutrition education. This helps consumers understand the benefits of locally grown produce and promotes healthier eating habits. 5. **Advocacy**: Both farmers and non-profits may advocate for policies that support local, organic farming practices. They might also raise awareness about the importance of sustainability in agriculture and its impact on the environment. Regarding their roles within the context of a Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) at USDA: - While I couldn't find specific information linking the CFC directly with promoting sustainable food systems through local farmers or non-profit organizations, such programs often receive funding support from federal campaigns. This support can be crucial for initiatives that aim to promote sustainability and community involvement in agriculture.

"Planning a Summer Road Trip to Canada? Visit USDA¡¯s Traveler Website and Help Protect American Agriculture  When buying souvenirs or food gifts to bring back from a trip, you probably think about what your loved ones will like best or which items will be the most memorable. But selecting the wrong type of gift could pose potential danger to U.S. agriculture, especially when bringing back food items.  Sydney Hart, APHIS Student Trainee  Posted in  Animals  Jul 24,   1 Response",Will buying certain souvenirs or food gifts from Canada pose a threat to American agriculture?,"Yes. Selecting the wrong type of gift could pose potential danger to U.S. agriculture, especially when bringing back food items.","The short answer is: No, buying certain souvenirs or food gifts from Canada does not pose a significant threat to American agriculture. Here's why: 1. **USDA regulations**: The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulates the importation of plants, animals, and plant products to prevent the introduction of pests and diseases that could harm American agriculture. 2. **Phytosanitary certificates**: To ensure compliance with these regulations, souvenirs or food gifts containing plant-based items, such as maple syrup or candies made from Canadian ingredients, are typically accompanied by phytosanitary certificates. These certificates guarantee that the products have been inspected and certified to be free of pests and diseases. 3. **Minimal risk**: The risk of introducing a pest or disease through souvenirs or food gifts is extremely low. Most commercial imports from Canada are subject to rigorous inspections and testing, reducing the likelihood of contamination. However, there might be some exceptions: * If you're planning to import large quantities of plant materials, such as seeds, bulbs, or live plants, it's best to check with the USDA for specific regulations. * Some types of food gifts, like unpasteurized dairy products or meat products from Canada, may still be subject to certain restrictions or requirements under US laws and regulations. In general, buying souvenirs or food gifts from Canada is unlikely to pose a significant threat to American agriculture.

Additionally, the article mentions that the Tranquil Acres Water Supply system was placed too shallow for the area, resulting in severe reliability issues for several years.","Rural water supply systems, especially those located in areas with shallow water tables, often face several reliability issues that can compromise the availability and quality of drinking water. Some common reliability issues in these systems include: 1. **Water Quality Issues**: Shallow water tables are more susceptible to contamination from natural sources like nearby septic tanks, agricultural runoff, or flooding. This can lead to bacterial, viral, or chemical contaminants in the water supply. 2. **Well Failure and Drying Up**: Wells with shallow water tables are more prone to running dry during periods of low rainfall or prolonged droughts, leading to system failure and unreliable access to clean drinking water. 3. **Over-Abstraction and Groundwater Depletion**: Overuse of groundwater resources from shallow wells can accelerate the rate of local water table decline, making it difficult to maintain a reliable supply over time. 4. **Limited Water Availability**: In areas with shallow water tables, natural flow rates may not be sufficient to meet peak demand during hot summer months or periods of high usage, leading to water scarcity and shortages. 5. **Infrastructure Age and Condition**: Many rural water systems in the United States, for example, have aging infrastructure that is prone to leaks, breaks, and other operational issues, which can compromise reliability. 6. **Inadequate Water Treatment and Storage Capacity**: Rural water systems often lack the necessary treatment and storage capacity to address contamination issues or meet increased demand during emergencies, further compromising reliability. 7. **Power Outages and Electrical Interference**: Relying on electric pumps for water supply can make these systems vulnerable to power outages and electrical interference, which can impact system functionality. 8. **Human Error and Operator Training**: The effectiveness of a rural water system is also heavily dependent on the skills and knowledge of its operators. Lack of proper training or human error can lead to reliability issues. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes planning for future growth, investing in modern infrastructure, implementing robust treatment and storage systems, and ensuring adequate operator training and capacity building.",2.4691314927935024e-155,0.13333333333333333,0.05361930294906167,0.09066666666666667,0.8410382866859436

It would be difficult for a traveler not to find a site worthy of a great painting or a great photograph. USDA Photo by Bob Nichols. One of the best destinations to visit in New England is the White Mountain National Forest, with its campgrounds, hiking trails, scenic drives, beautiful landscapes and world renowned fall foliage. The forest has recently been adopted by the National Forest Foundation as one of its “Treasured Landscapes,” for its on-the-ground restoration needs due to damage from flooding, woody debris, sediment and erosion caused by Tropical Storm Irene in . In , the Foundation launched its Treasured Landscapes, Unforgettable Experiences campaign to focus on building public-private partnerships in support of large-scale forest and watershed restoration across America’s National Forest System and community engagement. This campaign is concentrated in 14 iconic sites from Alaska to Florida, with the White Mountain National Forest becoming one of the campaign’s newest sites this year. “This new partnership with the Foundation, allows us to continue ongoing watershed restoration, repair trails and bridge damage, and address any spread of invasive plan species caused by the storm” said White Mountain National Forest Supervisor Tom Wagner. Perhaps your next stop during the fall or winter season will be the White Mountain National Forest. Whether you’re a returning or first-time visitor, you must explore this “Treasured Landscape” in New England. NOTE: Recent weather events have impacted some national forests on the East Coast. Campgrounds, roads and trails may be closed because of the storm. Visitors are advised to call ahead to the local ranger district office to find out about forest openings and closures before setting out on a trip.

"Shawnee National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jan 31,  The Shawnee National Forest will offer a new school program this year called Naturalist in the Classroom. Youngsters will have an opportunity to enjoy the Shawnee National Forest, like the kids here at the Young Trekkers afterschool program. Photo used with permission. With declining budgets in the public school system, there has been a steady decrease in school fieldtrips in recent years. This plight further widens the disconnect between children and nature. To help bridge the gap between the schoolroom and the natural world, the Shawnee National Forest will offer a new school program this year called Naturalist in the Classroom.  The program will be piloted to third- through fifth-grade students in Union and Alexander counties located in southern Illinois, and will focus on two themes – forest ecology and wetland ecology. Forest Service employees will visit the classroom several times during the semester to cover topics, such as the role of water, the function of wetlands, forest functions, and tree identification, or subjects identified by the teacher.  Naturalist in the Classroom will culminate in a one-day field trip at a Forest Service site with Forest Service natural resource and conservation education professionals to show students how what they learned applies in the field and in national forest management. There will be hands-on activities and games from various national curriculums, such as Project Learning Tree, Project Aquatic Wild and WOW! Wonders of Wetlands will be used. Naturalist in the Classroom aims to strengthen and expand the Shawnee’s environmental education program, get kids outdoors, and assist local educators in meeting Illinois’ learning standards.  Schools benefitting from the program are located in areas with high unemployment and have some of the highest underserved populations in southern Illinois. “We are really excited about implementing this new program in local schools,” said Allen Nicholas, forest supervisor at Shawnee National Forest.  “There are so many barriers to getting children in the outdoors these days.  We hope the Naturalist in the Classroom project will be the bridge in getting kids into the outdoors, as well as connecting them to the expertise of our natural resource professionals.” The spring application deadline is Feb. 5; the fall application deadline is Sept. 5.

The question seems to be asking for specific details that are not provided within the context of this conversation. However, if you're looking for general information on how farming technology has evolved over time and what changes people who have lived through those periods might have witnessed, here's some broader insight: - Early farming was manual labor-intensive with minimal machinery. Farmers relied heavily on physical strength to cultivate their land and harvest crops. - With the advent of steam power in the late 19th century, farming equipment started to mechanize. This included plows pulled by steam-powered engines and later internal combustion engines, leading to significant increases in efficiency. - The early 20th century saw further mechanization with tractors becoming a common sight on farms. These were initially heavy-duty, slow-moving machines but improved over time with lighter designs and higher speeds. - Advances in agricultural engineering led to the development of more specialized equipment for tasks like harvesting crops, spraying pesticides, and fertilizing fields. This made farming less labor-intensive and more productive. - Modern farming has seen a significant shift towards technology with precision agriculture being one of the forefronts. This involves using GPS, drones, and satellite imaging to guide planting and cultivation practices. - Furthermore, advancements in genetics have allowed for crops engineered for disease resistance, drought tolerance, and improved nutritional content. People who have lived through these periods on farms would have seen significant changes in how farming is conducted and the role technology plays in agriculture.

ARS photo  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. News by USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) indicates that moving dairy cows out of climate-controlled barns and onto the land may help to lessen the ecological impact of dairy farming without any corresponding loss of production. A team of ARS scientists in University Park, Pa., conducted a modeling study that evaluated how different management systems on a typical 250-acre Pennsylvania dairy farm would affect the environment.  The scientists collected a range of field and input it into their model to evaluate the environmental dynamics of four different dairy farms in all types of weather over 25 years. All four systems were set to produce the same amount of milk, adjusting for fat and protein, on the same land.  The model generated estimates for ammonia emissions from manure, impact on the soil including erosion and leaching of nitrates, and phosphorus losses from field runoff. Total emissions for the greenhouse gases methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide were 8 percent lower in year-round outdoor production than with cows tucked away in the barn.  Keeping dairy cows outdoors all year reduced the dairy operation’s ammonia emissions by about 30 percent. While barn-bound cows were estimated to each produce 22,000 pounds of milk per year, compared to only 13,000 pounds per foraging cow, the total amount of milk protein and fat produced was essentially the same.  That’s because the foraging cows produced milk that contained more fat and protein.

"Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics in  Research and Science  Nov 04,  Dr. Woteki works with 4-H members. The past eight years have been an extraordinary time for agricultural science, and for the application of new insights from other fields to enhance agricultural productivity and the overall agricultural economy. As the final days of this administration are approaching, it gives me a great deal of pride to look back at what USDA has accomplished in the areas of research and innovation. Scientific research is a fundamental part of our mission at USDA. But, ultimately, what's behind all the science is people – people who do the research and people who are affected by it. As USDA's Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics, I've met and worked with both as I've traveled across the country and around the world. I've seen the dedication and innovation of researchers at a USDA laboratory in California as they developed uses for drones and laser-guided sprayers as part of a ""precision agriculture"" movement. Their work allows the wise, efficient application of water and chemicals – as well as increased crop yields – in drought-ridden areas. I've seen the confident, solitary efforts of a Cornell University professor in the field of urban aquaponics who, with USDA funding, proved that he can not only raise 10,000 tilapia in fish tanks housed in the unlikely location of a high school basement in midtown Manhattan, but could then recirculate the fish tank water to nourish a thriving edible garden a few floors up in the school building. And I've seen the eagerness reflected in the faces of two young girls taking part in 4-H National Science Day activities in the nation's capital, applying science and technology skills and equipping themselves to possibly become part of the next generation of leaders in agricultural science. These people, and so many before them, embody the commitment to scientific innovation that is a major reason why Americans have not had to worry about food security since the Dust Bowl days of the s. To learn more about USDA's important scientific work, I invite you to take a few minutes to take a look at our results over the past eight years in our USDA Medium Chapter 11: Food and Ag Science Will Shape Our Future. The 21st Century has been referred to as the “Century for Biology,” and we are witnessing the applications of our heightened understanding of genes and gene traits to enhance crops and livestock. These applications, in turn, have been integral to USDA efforts like the transfer of germplasm and new plant varieties to the private sector here in the U.S. We are helping, through USDA’s partnership with the Agency for International Development and the “Feed the Future” initiative, in delivering UG99-resistant wheat varieties and improving the nutritional content of legumes—two examples of how our research and innovation are being applied to help improve food security around the world. Our work has been informed by projections that our global population will reach over 9.5 billion people by the year . To adequately feed that number of people would require an almost doubling of the world’s current level of agricultural production and a reduction in food loss and waste, at the same time the amount of farmable land is decreasing. As we continue to learn about the effects of a changing climate, our focus is on sustainably intensifying agricultural production to deliver the array of foods to provide for good health and foods that are free of disease-causing pathogens and toxins. We have developed a vision of a bioeconomy that by the year will produce a billion tons of biomass – agricultural residues, grasses, energy crops, forestry trimmings, algae and other sources – that will provide alternative sources of fuel, energy and other bioproducts. We have also focused research on developing agricultural systems that will be able to provide all of these services and be resilient in the face of climate change. Over the last eight years. We have faced numerous challenges and the results have been remarkable. There is still much to do, but we have left a solid foundation for continuing USDA’s work to support the American agricultural economy, to strengthen rural communities, to protect and conserve our natural resources, and to provide a safe, sufficient, and nutritious food supply for the American people.

Some of these factors include: 1. **Supply Chain Disruptions**: The pandemic led to a significant reduction in labor force due to lockdowns, social distancing measures, and fear of infection. This resulted in disruptions to global supply chains, particularly in the production, processing, and transportation of perishable foods. 2. **Trade Restrictions and Border Closures**: Governments imposed trade restrictions and border closures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, leading to delays and increases in costs for food imports and exports. This had a ripple effect on food availability and prices. 3. **Increased Demand and Shortages**: As people stocked up on food due to fears of lockdowns or stockpiling, there were temporary shortages and increased demand for certain food items, particularly staple foods like rice, wheat, and pulses. 4. **Higher Transportation Costs**: With reduced labor forces and social distancing measures in place, transportation costs for food products increased, leading to higher prices at the consumer level. 5. **Weather Events and Climate Change**: Extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, have always impacted food availability. The pandemic exacerbated these effects by reducing the capacity of farmers to respond to climate-related shocks. 6. **Pandemic-Related Crop Failures**: In some countries, crop failures due to the pandemic disrupted food supplies, leading to price increases and shortages. 7. **Price Volatility in Global Markets**: Price volatility in global markets for key commodities like grains, oilseeds, and livestock feed contributed to changes in food availability and prices. 8. **Changes in Consumer Behavior**: The pandemic led to shifts in consumer behavior, with more people opting for online shopping, home delivery, and pre-cooked or ready-to-eat meals. This altered the demand patterns and prices of certain food items. 9. **Food Waste and Losses**: Lockdowns and supply chain disruptions resulted in increased food waste and losses, further exacerbating changes in food availability and prices. 10. **Policies and Regulations**: Governments implemented policies to manage the pandemic's impact on food systems, including price controls, subsidies, and emergency aid programs. These measures often had unintended consequences, such as affecting market dynamics and influencing food prices. These factors have contributed to changes in food availability and prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, with varying impacts across different regions and communities.",0.03189338068074289,0.12019230769230768,0.06763285024154589,0.10576923076923077,0.849078357219696

On November 22, the United States and Israel came one step closer to renewing agricultural research and development activities that could produce new knowledge and innovations beneficial to both countries and increase the economic bottom line for farmers and ranchers. Dr. Sonny Ramaswamy, director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and Edo Chalutz, executive director of the U.S.–Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD), signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to promote collaboration via NIFA among U.S. and Israeli scientists and engineers. BARD and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), USDA’s intramural research agency, have cooperated on research together since BARD’s inception. While the MOU does not obligate either agency to specific funding, it offers the framework for facilitating collaborations through the partnership that BARD and the U.S. government have shared since . “The United States and Israel have a shared stake in dryland agriculture, high-value horticultural crops, and pest management. There should be ample opportunity for American and Israeli scientists to jointly continue to advance these and other important areas of science,” Ramaswamy said. One example of cooperation between the nations is water and soil management. Efficiency in water use is of particular interest since the Israelis have worked for years in to develop drip irrigation and have grappled with issues of soil salinity. Many U.S. scientists are conducting similar research, so this may be an area where the MOU could strengthen or begin new collaborative efforts. “This agreement will facilitate many mutual benefits, and we look forward to getting started,” Ramaswamy said. “In fact, we plan to use this MOU as a model for building other important global partnerships.” Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and Cooperative Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Aug 22,  USDA’s Agricultural Research Service and Purdue University researchers are working together to develop biological controls that protect against white grubs, which eat turf grass roots. During the U.S. Open held this summer in Erin Hills, Wisconsin, some of the world’s top golfers competed for a shot at becoming the champion (won by Brooks Koepka). The course’s meticulously groomed putting greens and fairways—like those of so many other golf facilities—are an inspiration to lawn-care enthusiasts near and far. But professional golf course superintendents and lawn-loving homeowners alike face a common foe: chubby, C-shaped pests called “white grubs,” which eat the turf grass roots. Unchecked, they cause brown spots or barren patches that mar the turf’s aesthetic value and even playability. Robert Behle isn’t an avid golfer, and you won’t find him competing with his neighbors for the best-looking lawn. But he does know a thing or two about insects—and even more about controlling them using their natural enemies. An Agricultural Research Service (ARS) entomologist, Behle specializes in ways to formulate naturally occurring fungi and other microorganisms into bio-based pesticides. In fact, he and Purdue University colleague Doug Richmond recently finished a three-year project funded by the U.S Golf Association (USGA) to evaluate the potential of the fungus Metarhizium brunneum to kill white grubs, the larval stages of Japanese, June, and other scarab beetles. The practice, known as “biological control,” is one that’s already found its way onto some golf courses. Indeed, a survey by the Environmental Institute for Golf found that 42 percent of 27-plus-hole golf facilities sometimes or frequently use biocontrol in their pest management practices. The researchers used an ARS patent-pending process called “liquid culture fermentation” to mass-produce the fungus and turn it into clay granules, which they applied at different rates to grub-infested turf grass plots at Purdue University. When they rolled back patches of the turf, a grizzly sight awaited them. Depending on the rates applied, 50 to 70 percent of the grubs lay dead beneath the soil, covered in a fuzzy growth that confirmed the fungus had infected and killed them—typically 7 to 10 days after exposure. An insecticide applied to different plots worked even faster, killing 95 percent of the grubs. However, when used in the fall, the chemical had lost some of its “punch” against larger-sized grubs compared to the fungus, which worked better with the cooler temperatures.  The findings, which the researchers published in a USGA annual report, could help golf course superintendents identify ways to use the fungus as part of an integrated pest management (IPM) approach, which combines judicious insecticide use with cultural, biological and other controls. Golfers needn’t be distracted by the prospects of this biocontrol fungus quietly working underfoot, though. Its absolute preference for infecting white grubs and other insect turf eaters means people, pets and wildlife won’t suffer the same fuzzy fate as these pests.

However, based on your question, I found that it was actually Metarhizium brunneum fungus that was shown to be effective in controlling white grubs. More specifically, research has demonstrated the efficacy of using Metarhizium brunneum fungus for biological control of white grubs within turf environments, such as golf courses. This method involves applying a fungal formulation containing M. brunneum to the soil where the target pests (white grubs) are present. The fungus infects and kills the grubs, providing an effective means of controlling these pests. Studies have shown that this biological control method can be highly effective in reducing white grub populations by up to 70% within a relatively short period of 7-10 days. This makes it a promising tool for integration into golf course turf management practices as a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional chemical-based control methods.",0.08095165134082459,0.29906542056074764,0.18867924528301888,0.18691588785046728,0.8745315670967102

"International Programs Office, USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Trade  Oct 20,  In Nigeria, NASS representatives Matt Deaton, Terry Holland and John Campbell worked with Kaduna State Agricultural Development Programme, National Bureau of Statistics Federal Department of Agriculture to develop a stronger national agricultural statistics program. Today the United Nations is celebrating the first World Statistics Day, to raise awareness of official statistics, which are premised on the core value of service, professionalism and integrity. As one of the principal statistical agencies in the U.S., the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) has been heavily involved in establishing and improving agricultural statistics systems in countries around the world since the end of World War II. Food insecurity, shortfalls in regional food production and lack of reliable information on the agricultural sector are major concerns in many countries. Improved agricultural systems can provide more and better information to address these issues. This is why, over the past 10 years, NASS international projects have been instrumental in helping more than 30 developing and emerging market countries in Africa, Central and South America, Asia, and Central and Eastern Europe to develop and improve their agricultural statistics programs. Using our experience in conducting the census of agriculture, NASS is currently working with the Armenian National Statistics Service and the Ministry of Agriculture to conduct a full count of agriculture in Armenia. It has been 90 years since Armenia conducted its last census of agriculture. The upcoming census will also be Armenia’s first since the country gained its independence in . In addition to the Armenian census of agriculture, NASS is also currently working with the governments in Georgia, Brazil, Mongolia, Nigeria and Serbia. Our agency is also gearing up to start a new project in Moldova. We work to provide all of these countries with technical assistance and training on a reimbursable basis in all aspects of statistical surveys and systems. The benefits of such assistance extend beyond serving the interests of the various countries. By helping other countries improve their agricultural statistics systems, USDA’s ability to assess world food and fiber production is also improved. Establishing strong working relationships with other agricultural statisticians around the world allows NASS staff to gather and develop new ideas for improving the U.S. agricultural statistics system, while exposure to other cultures and work situations enhances our employees’ abilities to solve problems.

"USDA Office of Communications in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 09,  A new poll shows that parents of school-age children overwhelmingly support national nutrition standards for all foods and beverages sold to students during the school day. For more information, visit: www.pewtrusts.org/SchoolFoodParentPoll. Click to enlarge. Over the past four years, USDA has worked closely with schools, parents, community leaders, and nutrition experts to ensure that when children go off to school, they are greeted by a healthier school environment.  According to the CDC, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years, leading to an increase in obesity-related health outcomes in children, including cardiovascular disease, pre-diabetes, and bone and joint problems.  Improving school nutrition is vital to reducing childhood obesity, because many children consume half of their daily calories during the school day. Making the healthy choice the easy choice sets our nation’s children up for a lifetime of healthy choices, and supports a healthier next generation.  Recently, we’ve seen evidence that student acceptance of healthier meals is increasing across all grade levels.  Today, we are pleased to see the results of the latest poll by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the American Heart Association, showing that most parents support the healthier meal and snack standards implemented through the Healthy, Hunger-free Kids Act of .  Read more about the results of that study in this guest blog, from the American Heart Association. A majority of parents favor strong national nutrition standards for food and drink sold at schools, according to a poll released Monday by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the American Heart Association. In addition, the poll found that parents would also like to see salt limited in school foods and more fruits and vegetables served. The poll, which was conducted in June among 1,112 parents, said that 80 percent of the parents said they were concerned about their children’s health. Seventy-four percent said they were concerned about childhood obesity, a major risk factor for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar and cardiovascular disease later in life. Currently, more than one third of children and adolescents are clinically overweight or obese. Among children ages six to 11, obesity rates rose from 7 percent in to 18 percent in . The rates increased from 5 percent to 21 percent during that same period for youth ages 12 to 19. Childhood obesity has been a major national focus, with federal agencies and advocacy organizations, including the American Heart Association, working on ways to curb the trend. The poll was conducted just weeks before the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued “Smart Snacks” standards on July 1, which mandated that school snacks must be a fruit, a vegetable, protein, dairy, or whole grain; have fewer than 200 calories; and be low in fat, salt, and sugar. The poll revealed that support for stricter school nutrition standards cut across racial and political lines. Sixty-eight percent of whites, 85 percent of Hispanics and 91 percent of African-Americans said they support the standards. Fifty-six percent of Republicans, 71 percent of independents and 84 percent of Democrats favored stronger standards. Only 22 percent of parents expressed that they strongly opposed higher school nutrition standards. Among the poll’s other findings: 72 percent favor national standards for school meals; 72 percent support standards for school snacks; 91 percent support requiring schools to include a serving of fruits or vegetables with every meal; 75 percent think salt should be limited in meals; 23 percent believed food sold a la carte at schools was nutritious, whereas only 8 percent believed the same of food sold in vending machines. Penny Kris Etherton, PhD, a professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pennsylvania, said the findings are encouraging, but parents voicing support is just the beginning. “Schools and parents need to be on the same page about what the kids eat,” she said. “You can’t have one set of standards at school and another set of standards at home. It’s encouraging to see that parents are supportive of higher nutritional standards, but we need to educate across the board so that parents understand what this really means for how their kids should eat.” Reducing sweetened beverages can lower a child’s intake of “empty” calories, Kris-Etherton explained. However, some parents might believe fruit juice is healthy “when it’s really just sugar water. The child would be better off either drinking plain water or eating a piece of fruit to get the fiber and nutrients from the fruit. The challenge will be making healthy eating fun and interesting for kids.” The poll was conducted by Hart Research Associates and Ferguson Research.  Pew, RWJF, and AHA are jointly supporting efforts to ensure all foods and beverages in schools are healthy. The Kids’ Safe and Healthful Foods Project is a collaboration between Pew and RWJF. Voices for Healthy Kids is an initiative of RWJF and AHA, with Pew providing additional expertise.

"USDA Economic : Building Blocks for Policy  About midway through USDA’s 150-year history, federal officials decided that economic research and analysis could be a valuable, objective tool in helping farmers – and policymakers - grapple with farm price and income issues. In , the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE) – predecessor agency of USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) – came into existence. The Bureau began regularly producing agricultural market outlook (still an ERS staple), and - not surprisingly - its early work included analysis of agricultural policy impacts during the Great Depression. Although the BAE’s functions were dispersed throughout the Department in the s, they were assembled again into a single agency, the Economic Research Service, in .  I’ll touch on just a few highlights of ERS activities that illustrate the value of our agency’s work over the past century.

The ERS was established in 1942 as part of the USDA to provide economic analysis and research on agriculture, natural resources, and rural America. Here are some key contributions the ERS has made: 1. **Data collection and analysis**: The ERS collects and analyzes data on agricultural production, prices, trade, and farm income, providing a solid foundation for policy decisions. 2. **Research and policy recommendations**: Through research and analysis, the ERS provides policymakers with unbiased information to inform their decision-making process on issues like farm support programs, trade agreements, and environmental policies. 3. **Risk management and crop insurance**: The ERS has provided guidance on risk management strategies for farmers, including crop insurance and other forms of protection against weather-related losses or market fluctuations. 4. **Trade policy analysis**: The ERS analyzes the impact of trade policies on agriculture, providing insights on how to structure agreements that benefit both domestic producers and international trading partners. 5. **Agricultural policy evaluation**: The ERS evaluates the effectiveness of various agricultural policies, such as farm support programs (e.g., ACRE, ARC) and conservation programs, helping policymakers assess their impact and identify areas for improvement. 6. **Sustainable agriculture research**: In recent years, the ERS has focused on research related to sustainable agriculture, including issues like climate change, soil health, and water management.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Apr 07,  Clemence, a teacher from Ogondougou School, displays the peanuts grown in the school garden to be used as a condiment in the meal provided by USDA (CRS/Carmen Matty-Cervantes). A group of schoolchildren wait patiently in line to get their lunch. This ritual takes place in schools all over the world. But for the children in Mali, a country ranked 160 out of 169 of the poorest countries in the world, this may be their one nutritious meal for the day. With the number of chronically hungry people surpassing one billion, a sustainable approach is necessary to answer the call of those in need. USDA’s McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program answers that call and works to not only feed the world’s hungry, but also improve the nutrition and education of children around the world. At noon each day, the students line up and eagerly wait for their turn to get their plate full of rice and split peas thanks to USDA (CRS/Carmen Matty-Cervantes). The McGovern-Dole Program supports education, child development and food security in low-income, food-deficit countries that are committed to universal education. It provides for donations of U.S. agricultural products, as well as financial and technical assistance for school feeding and maternal and child nutrition projects. Currently, USDA funds 36 active agreements with 17 cooperating sponsors in 28 countries, assisting more than five million beneficiaries. To date, the Program has provided meals to more than 22 million children. Since , Catholic Relief Services, with the help of the McGovern-Dole program, has played a large role in improving the lives of children and their families in Mali, a country with a population of more than 12.5 million. The United Nations recently reported that 10 percent of the total population was undernourished and that 38 percent of pre-school aged children are physically stunted. In light of Mali’s situation, this McGovern-Dole project has enhanced the welfare of targeted communities through improving access to food and education for children. By the end of the fiscal year, the CRS/Mali program had directly impacted the lives of over 45,000 individuals in Mali. In promoting the health of students, teachers, and school cooks, more than 5 million meals, as well as vitamins and medications, were distributed among 120 schools. Nearly 2,000 members of school management committees supported by the program participated in literacy sessions and radio broadcasts about the importance of education. Through these efforts, overall school enrollment in targeted communities has increased from 26 percent to 32 percent for boys and from 39 percent to 55 percent for girls since the program began in . In May , the Obama administration unveiled the Feed the Future (FTF) Initiative. The Initiative supports the international effort to increase the availability and accessibility of food and to improve nutrition and food safety. It serves as a springboard for broader economic development and food security. It also serves as a foundation for peace and opportunity in developing countries, which ensures our own national security. USDA is working with the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of State, and international organizations to help implement the Initiative.

"First-ever Regional Farm to School Institute Underway in the Northeast This account was written by VT FEED Project Director, Betsy Rosenbluth and Shelburne Farms Public Relations and Marketing Director, Vera Chang.   As principal of Sharon Elementary School in Sharon, Vt., Barrett Williams helps his teachers integrate farm to school pedagogy into curricula by making sure they have planning time during the school day and a stipend to compensate their efforts. Time and resources are limited for teachers who are under rigorous demands to meet school standards. So Williams must be creative to ensure food, farming, nutrition, and place-based learning are part of students’ education. We’re listening to Williams and his peers talk at a round-table workshop that is part of the pioneering, year-long Northeast Farm to School Institute. Williams is one of 90 school administrators, teachers, food service professionals, and community members at the Institute’s kick-off, held on Shelburne Farms’ 1,400-acre campus in northern Vermont.

"USDA Pennsylvania Public Information Officer in  Rural  Feb 14,   Snow didn't stop the ideas from flying as members of the Northern Tier Regional Planning and Development Commission (Northern Tier) and their partners from Bradford, Sullivan, Susquehanna, Tioga, and Wyoming Counties met in Pennsylvania last month. Northern Tier is leading the regional group that was awarded the opportunity to participate in the Stronger Economies Together (SET) training and technical assistance program, sponsored by USDA Rural Development in conjunction with the Northeast Regional Rural Development Center and Penn State Extension. The SET program is a nationwide effort focused on working with regional groups to encourage and strengthen regional thinking and developing information and strategies to address issues affecting the region. The training will cover nine course modules on “Strategies for Building New Economic Opportunities” which will be completed by next year. Marcellus Shale was the topic, but the conversation wasn't about the money and jobs the industry has brought to the area. The conversation was about how to measure the economic impact of Marcellus Shale, keep the dollars in the region, and create a sustainable economy. The Northern Tier realizes the way to achieve sustainable results and best utilize area resources is regional collaboration. The foundation created on that snowy morning will be the building blocks of the region's future success. This effort is a great example of how Rural Development has brought leaders and stakeholders in several communities together to collaborate on how to improve the quality of their community.

"Help USDA Fight Hungry Pests: Keep an Eye Out for Asian Longhorned Beetle   Throughout August, a little-known beetle may emerge from the trees in your community. You might see its long black and white antennae inching out from a dime-shaped hole in your favorite tree. The pest, named the Asian longhorned beetle, kills trees from the inside out. It attacks 13 types of hardwood trees.  Rebecca Blue, USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs  Posted in  Animals  Plants  Aug 01,   2 Responses",What is the primary threat posed by the Asian longhorned beetle to tree populations?,The primary threat posed by the Asian longhorned beetle is that it kills trees from the inside out.,"The primary threat posed by the Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) to tree populations is its ability to kill trees quickly and efficiently. This beetle species is a highly invasive insect that targets hardwood tree species, particularly maple, willow, elm, and ash. When an adult Asian longhorned beetle lands on a tree, it can bore into the bark with its sharp mouthparts, creating small holes (about 1/8 inch in diameter) through which it feeds on the sapwood. This feeding process disrupts the flow of water and nutrients within the tree, eventually killing it. The key issues with this beetle's impact are: 1. **Rapid kill rate**: Asian longhorned beetles can kill trees within a few years after infestation. 2. **Widespread damage**: A single female beetle can lay up to 100 eggs in her lifetime, which can lead to the rapid spread of the population and extensive tree mortality. 3. **Difficulty in detection**: Infestations often go undetected until significant damage has occurred. Overall, the Asian longhorned beetle poses a serious threat to forest ecosystems and urban tree populations due to its ability to kill trees quickly and efficiently, causing widespread economic and environmental impacts.",0.04347397266801104,0.14150943396226415,0.0857142857142857,0.14150943396226415,0.8745185136795044
"AMS Livestock, Poultry, and Seed Program Deputy Administrator in  Conservation  Jan 27,  Livestock correlations, like the one held at Penn State, are one way that USDA Market News ensures the accuracy and consistency in its . The correlation allowed reporters to compare live animal assessments and grades with the post-slaughter assessment and grades of the same animals. During its 100 years of serving the livestock industry, USDA Market News – part of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) – has prided itself in creating transparency and clarity in the marketplace by allowing all industry stakeholders to have the same information about the market at the same time.  The entire agricultural supply chain relies on USDA Market News for timely, unbiased .  Without this free service, information would not be available to everyone equally, making USDA Market News a vital lifeline for America’s agricultural economy. Over the years, countless changes have occurred in the livestock industry – like the way that livestock standards are applied and the way market reporting is conducted.  To keep up with these changes, livestock correlations are held to assure the industry that all USDA market reporters are applying the USDA’s livestock grades and standards consistently and accurately. AMS develops, maintains and interprets USDA’s livestock grades and standards – like the Prime, Choice or Select grades used for beef.  USDA grades and standards ensure uniformity in products and quality, as well as in USDA’s market published across the nation.  Grades and standards provide a common trade language that ranchers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers are familiar with and rely on to buy and sell effectively. Recently, a group of market reporters from the Livestock, Poultry, and Grain Market News division attended a livestock correlation at Penn State University facilitated by its on-campus meats laboratory.  At Penn State, market reporters evaluated a pen of cattle and a pen of lambs and assigned the appropriate livestock quality and yield grade, while veteran market reporters spoke about the animals’ distinguishing qualities.  The Penn State campus offered a unique venue for the correlation, having a full meat processing and cutting facility right on campus. The next day, the market reporters returned to Penn State to correlate their live animal grade designations from the previous day to the same animal’s post-slaughter grade designations, comparing and correlating their findings to check consistency and accuracy in their findings. Livestock correlations are just one way that USDA Market News upholds its commitment to accuracy and consistency in its .  Market reporters understand that in order for their to be as meaningful as possible, a Choice grade steer in Georgia needs to be comparable to a Choice grade steer in Iowa, just as a Prime lamb in Pennsylvania has to be equal to a Prime lamb in Colorado. This uniformity, strengthened by the continuous work of market reporters, makes USDA Market some of the most trusted and respected in the world.

"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way from the Summit: How REE is Using New Strategies to Reach Even Newer Poultry Handlers  During a walk along tree-shading sidewalks in the “burbs”; you’re accustomed to seeing games of hopscotch, bike rides, and maybe even the occasional Golden Retriever. However, one residential backyard, nearly 6 miles from downtown Atlanta, calls into question whether this is suburbia at all. There were swings, a tree house, and even patio furniture. Yet one feature certified this was not your mother’s suburban home: over a dozen chickens living comfortably in a custom made “Coop de Ville.”    The rise of “backyard poultry” is one of many agricultural phenomena tied to a growing food consciousness and increased urbanization. And while USDA’s fundamental job doesn’t change, the Department does because the challenges do.  The recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at increasingly popular backyard chicken coops underscore this. While this concern was not clearly expressed in the Act of Congress that created the Department, the mandate was. USDA still works to “acquire and to diffuse…information” towards facilitating the protected growth of American agriculture. That service is what brought Research, Education, and Economics Undersecretary Dr. Catherine Woteki to this residence in Decatur, GA. Accompanied by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service officials and a man known best as the “Chicken Whisperer,” Dr. Woteki toured the site and helped to shed light on current HPAI research and important biosafety measures.  Melvin Washington, Confidential Assistant, Research, Education and Economics Mission Area  Posted in  Initiatives  Animals  Plants  Apr 29,   1 Response",What biosafety measures are being implemented to prevent the spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) among backyard chicken coops?,Dr. Woteki and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service officials helped shed light on current HPAI research and important **biosafety measures** to prevent the spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) among backyard chicken coops.,"To address the concern about the potential spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in backyard chicken coops, various biosafety measures have been recommended and implemented by health organizations and experts. Some key measures include: 1. **Biosecurity Practices**: These involve steps that prevent contact between birds and any potential source of disease, such as wild birds or contaminated feeds. This includes securing the coop to keep out rodents and other animals, regularly cleaning the area around the coop, ensuring good ventilation within the coop, using protective clothing when handling birds or their droppings, and maintaining strict hygiene standards. 2. **Vaccination Programs**: Some regions implement vaccination programs for chickens in backyard coops as a preventive measure against HPAI. These vaccinations are designed to protect the birds from infection by strains of avian influenza virus that could potentially become highly pathogenic if they were to infect the flock. 3. **Monitoring and Surveillance**: Regular monitoring of backyard chicken coops, including health checks on the birds and testing for avian flu viruses, is crucial in early detection of HPAI outbreaks. This allows for swift response measures to be taken before the situation escalates into a larger public health issue. 4. **Isolation and Disposal**: If an outbreak of HPAI is detected in a backyard flock, isolating the affected birds immediately and following proper procedures for their disposal can help prevent further spread of the disease. This might involve contacting local authorities to assist with containment measures. 5. **Education and Awareness**: Raising awareness among backyard chicken keepers about HPAI risks, biosafety measures, and what to do in case of an outbreak is vital. Many organizations offer educational materials and guidance on biosecurity practices that can be adopted by these households. 6. **Regulations and Laws**: In some jurisdictions, specific regulations have been put into place regarding the keeping of backyard chickens, including requirements for vaccination or regular health checks. These laws are designed to minimize the risk of HPAI spreading from chicken coops to humans or other animals. These measures are not only aimed at preventing the spread of HPAI among backyard flocks but also at safeguarding public health and animal welfare in general. They are considered essential for maintaining a safe environment for both birds and humans living in close proximity, such as in urban and suburban areas where backyard chicken keeping is increasingly popular.",0.02117865434448073,0.11320754716981132,0.07109004739336494,0.08490566037735849,0.8487611413002014
"Administrator, USDA Rural Housing Service in  Rural  May 12,  New home loan processing is saving customer and staff time, taxpayer money and lots of paper. (Click to enlarge) This has been the year of innovation at USDA Rural Housing Service. We are working smarter, faster, more efficient and environmentally conscious than ever before.  After years of brainstorming, planning, reengineering, testing, and training, RHS has realized its vision: the Section 502 Guaranteed Single Family Home Loan Program now operates paperless, and we’re saving more than we ever imagined possible. USDA’s Rural Development State field offices now transact business with private lenders via Web-based uploads and electronic signatures.  This means RHS and our private partners are no longer printing and sending hundreds of pages of paper back-and-forth every time a loan guarantee is used to help a rural American family buy their home. As a result, loan guarantees are processed faster and families move into homes more quickly. Postage fees will be eliminated and huge print jobs avoided for every one of the 140,000+ home loans USDA guarantees we will make in the coming year. Initial estimates show USDA Rural Housing Service will save 37,500 reams of paper every year now that we do more business in a paperless environment. More than 135,333 staff hours per year nationwide were being spent managing these paper processes. Staff will have more time to assist our customers, connect with potential partners and, of course, help more rural Americans buy their own homes through our 502 homeownership programs. All of the savings in time, paper and postage adds up to some serious savings of American tax dollars. In fact, we estimate RHS will save more than $4.2 million in just one year of using the new process nationwide.  This means we can allocate more time and money into oversight initiatives that will work to ensure lender compliance, and more adequately staff other Single Family Housing Programs to better serve Rural America. The people who work in the Rural Housing Service are proud of this milestone! But, as they like to remind everyone, RHS is just getting started.  Innovation projects of this sort have begun to touch every one of the Agency’s programs. RHS is advocating for the American dream of homeownership by working smarter, faster, more efficiently, and more conscious of the environment than ever before.

"Special Projects Coordinator, Arizona USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Jan 23,   “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.” Those words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. seem particularly prophetic for staff at USDA Rural Development in Arizona. As staff was planning for the federal Martin Luther King Day of Service, we received news that our friend on the USDA Phoenix building cleaning crew, Elia Zepeda, was ill and in the hospital. Within days she slipped into a coma and died. Elia’s cheerful personality greeted many USDA Rural Development employees at the Arizona State Office as they entered or exited the building each day. Although we never saw her in anything but her blue Goodwill uniform, it was clear that, although she loved her job, she was much more than a “cleaning lady.” Co-workers at Goodwill and so many of the workers for the federal agencies at the building where she worked were stunned and saddened by her passing. USDA’s Vanessa Garcia (Right) gets sorting instruction from a Goodwill employee USDA Rural Development Community Facilities Specialist Vanessa Garcia had a great idea that would both serve the community and honor Elia: Donate our MLK Day of Service time to the Goodwill Center where Elia had been trained and employed. Earlier this month, staff donated their hours of service to sort and cart donations at the Goodwill Center in Elia’s name.

"USDA Rural Development Utilities Service Administrator in  Initiatives  Rural  Technology  May 27,  Anita J. (Janie) Dunning, Missouri State Director, and Jonathan Adelstein, RUS Administrator (center), painting the Ralls County PWSD No. 1 water tower A three day visit to Missouri, the “Show Me State” allowed me to join Janie Dunning, Rural Development State Director, to see how rural areas benefiting from infrastructure investments made possible through USDA Rural Development programs and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) financing. My trip started on Wednesday, May 18, , with a visit to Socket Telecom, LLC in Columbia, MO.   We learned of their progress on a $23.7 million Rural Utilities Recovery Act investment for high speed fiber-to-the-home broadband access to 2,700 homes, 36 critical community institutions and 270 businesses in Callaway County.  That afternoon, as a member of President Obama’s White House Business Council on “Winning the Future,” I facilitated a roundtable discussion with 20 community and business leaders of Mexico, MO, hosted by Frank Cordie of Mid America Brick. When you think of “bricks and mortar” for cementing economic development, there is no better place than in America’s heartland at a brick plant.  I gathered feedback on ways we can help businesses expand, create jobs, and improve the economic base in their area.  The roundtable was followed by a very interesting tour of the brick plant to see how the $10 million from the agency’s Business and Industry guaranteed funds was being used to bring this regional business icon back to life. Jonathan Adelstein, RUS Administrator; Barry Hart, CEO of the Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives; Jay Nixon, Governor of Missouri; Dan Strode, President/CEO of Ralls County Electric Cooperative. The next day, I joined Missouri Governor Jay Nixon for a “light up” ceremony at Ralls County Electric Cooperative (RCEC). They were celebrating the construction and hooking up the first customers of $19.1 million project, funded by USDA under the Recovery Act, to serve 4,600 households, 300 business and 58 anchor institutions in northeast Missouri.  I found most interesting is that the RCEC is reinvesting 10 percent of their earnings from the broadband investment for economic development opportunities for individuals and businesses in their service area.  This ceremony was followed by a working lunch to discuss other broadband opportunities with Damon Porter, Governor Nixon’s point-man on broadband. My next stop was to Ralls County Ralls County Public Water Supply District No. 1 to visit the site of water improvements including a new 250,000 gallon water tower.  Janie and I grabbed paint brushes and assisted with painting the water tower support.  Yes, that was a first for me. That evening the Missouri state office staff hosted me in a discussion with Barry Hart, CEO of the Association of Electric Cooperatives and other electric cooperative leaders to talk about partnering strategies to assist rural Missourians. My third day, included a tour of USDA funded Water and Wastewater projects in Howard County.  First stop was to a state of the art, environmentally friendly lagoon at the City of Fayette.  I was very impressed with this new technology and treatment of waste water.  One of the stages in the water treatment includes a process in a lagoon covered with a heavy duty rubberized material. I made a closer inspection of the rubberized material and verified that it was strong enough for opportunity for me to “walk on (waste) water”!  This may be a first for an Administrator. Jonathan Adelstein, USDA Utilities Administrator, walking on (waste) water at the City of Fayette lagoon. The next stop was to see another investment to the City of Fayette for improvements to their water system including the construction of a new water tower.  The last stop was for a celebration of strategies supported by President Obama and Secretary Vilsack for regionalization.  The Howard County Regional Water Commission was established as a regional water waste supply and treatment system to serve three public water systems in the southern part of Howard County including: the City of Fayette, the City of New Franklin and Howard County PWSD No. 1.

"Helping an Urban Farmer Connect People with Food  When Amanda Barker arrived in Worcester, Massachusetts, in to start graduate school at Clark University she knew that she wanted to grow food and build community. “My hope was to figure out a way to connect people with food, get people talking to each other,” said Barker. Seven years later, she is one of the nation’s urban agriculture pioneers who raises crops on tiny patches of land wedged between city buildings, used car lots, highways and railroad tracks, and even on rooftops.  Diane Petit, USDA-NRCS Massachusetts  Posted in  Conservation  Aug 17,   2 Responses",What innovative strategies do urban farmers like Amanda Barker use to connect people with food and build community?,"Urban farmers like Amanda Barker use innovative strategies such as growing crops on tiny patches of land wedged between city buildings, rooftops, and other unconventional spaces to connect people with food and build community.","Amanda Barker, an urban farmer, likely employs several innovative strategies to connect people with food and build community. Some possible approaches she might use include: * **Community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs**: These allow consumers to purchase a share of the farm's produce on a regular basis, often weekly or biweekly. This model fosters direct relationships between farmers and customers. * **Farmers' markets and pop-up events**: Amanda may organize or participate in local farmers' markets, where people can buy fresh produce directly from her or other urban farmers. Pop-up events, like food festivals or farm-to-table dinners, can also bring the community together around food. * **Workshops and education**: By offering workshops on topics such as gardening, cooking, or food preservation, Amanda can share her expertise and build trust with community members. This can also create opportunities for people to learn from each other. * **Food cooperatives**: These are member-owned businesses that allow consumers to pool their resources to purchase fresh produce in bulk. Food cooperatives often have a strong focus on local, sustainable food systems. * **Social media and online platforms**: Amanda might utilize social media or specialized platforms to share her story, promote her farm, and engage with customers directly. This can help build a community around her farm's mission and values. * **Partnerships and collaborations**: By partnering with other local businesses, organizations, or initiatives, Amanda can expand the reach of her urban farm and create new opportunities for people to connect with food and each other. * **Food recovery and redistribution programs**: These programs collect surplus produce from farms like Amanda's and redistribute it to those who need it most. This can help reduce food waste while providing fresh produce to underserved communities. These strategies allow Amanda to build relationships, share knowledge, and create opportunities for people to come together around food.",0.02887714770933277,0.1420118343195266,0.07738095238095238,0.10059171597633136,0.839327335357666

"Students Turn Science Teachers for 4-H National Youth Science Day  I went back to school yesterday. And my teachers were fourth graders. Fourth grade students at Hearst Elementary School in Washington, DC taught me and 200 other students about climate change, water quality and carbon footprints through the 4-H National Science Experiment.  All across the country and world, hundreds of thousands of students were doing the same set of experiments today as part of 4-H National Youth Science Day.

"AMS Fruit and Vegetable Program Deputy Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Jul 03,  In addition to purchasing blueberries for federal food distribution programs, AMS supports the blueberry industry through grant programs like the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. This program offers funds to states to support research and marketing projects that do things such as increasing crop yields. Photo courtesy of the U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council. Blueberries are often highly sought after because of their long list of health benefits and their sweet taste. Whether purchased fresh, frozen, or pureed, the blueberry has long been a staple in the diets of many people. Every July, the entire nation celebrates Blueberry Month by coming up with creative recipes and other unique ways to get their fill. Here at USDA, every month is Blueberry Month. One of the ways that we show our appreciation for our nation’s blueberry producers and processors is by creating more opportunities for people to enjoy this delicious fruit. Indigenous to North America, the history of blueberries can be traced all the way back to Native Americans, who added them to soups, stews, and even meats. Highbush or cultivated blueberries are grown on large bushes that are planted in rows. These blueberries are often sent to the fresh market. Lowbush or wild blueberries produce smaller sized berries and are pruned every couple of years. The majority of lowbush blueberries are processed into items like jams, jellies and baked goods. My agency, the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), does its part to help more people eat these little blue dynamos.® Through our Commodity Procurement Program, we purchase frozen cultivated and wild blueberries. The purchases send this highly nutritious food to school children, families, and communities through federal food distribution programs like the National School Lunch Program. In , we bought nearly $17.9 million or 11.3 million pounds of frozen wild blueberries. This provided a reliable outlet for producers in places like Maine where 98% of the nation’s wild blueberries are harvested. As a result of this purchase, states like Maine can continue to strengthen their rural economies. Our purchases are also making a big difference in states like New Jersey -- the birthplace of the cultivated blueberry. The state’s blueberry industry produced more than 51 million pounds that  yielded nearly $81 million in revenue in . This was by far the largest revenue generator in the Garden State’s fruit and vegetable sector that year. In , AMS helped continue this trend by buying $18.4 million or 15.4 million pounds of frozen cultivated blueberries from growers across the country. In addition to our purchases, AMS supports the blueberry industry by offering grants to help it remain competitive in the marketplace. Classified as specialty crops, blueberries are eligible for grants through our Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. This program offers funds to states to support research and marketing projects that do things such as increasing crop yields. So, thanks to Specialty Crop Block Grant funds, several state agriculture departments can conduct research to mitigate the damage to its blueberry crops created by the Brown Marmorated Stinkbug and other invasive pests. Whether it’s July or any other part of the year, AMS is committed to supporting our nation’s blueberry producers and processors. We recommend that you add some color to your plate with some blueberries. The U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council’s website has some great recipes to get you started. In , AMS purchased nearly 11.3 million pounds of frozen wild blueberries and 15.4 million pounds of frozen cultivated blueberries from growers across the country.

Comprehensive information on wood technology, markets and technical information for hardwoods affected by invasive species is included, making the manual a one-stop shop for understanding how the emerald ash borer, Asian longhorned beetle, gypsy moth and thousand cankers disease are affecting hardwoods. Non-native invasive species are causing significant ecological and economic damage in the eastern United States. For example, since being discovered in , the emerald ash borer alone has killed tens of millions of ash trees in 13 states, and cost municipalities, property owners, nursery operators and forest products industries tens of millions of dollars.

"Recreation, Heritage and Volunteer Services, U.S. Forest Service in  Conservation  Forestry  Mar 18,  An owl seems to plead for help after getting stuck in a vault toilet. A movement to save birds from serious injury and death garnered a Wings Across the Americas Award for the Teton Raptor Center of Jackson Hole, Wyo., and employees from several national forests. (Photo courtesy Teton Raptor Center) Small owls, such as western screech and northern saw whet owls, weigh between 3 and 7 ounces, or about the same weight as a small cell phone or a deck of cards. They prefer dark, narrow spaces for nesting and roosting, which is why they are called cavity birds. Their habitat preferences make them prone to using man-made features, such as open pipes, that mimic their natural nesting and roosting cavities. But on some public lands, that natural act of finding habitat in ventilation pipes has led to their death. The resolution that could save thousands of birds resulted in an award from Wings Across the Americas, a program of the U.S. Forest Service and its partners to conserve birds, bats, butterflies and dragonflies across all landscapes and boundaries. The project received the Habitat Management and Partnership Award, shared with Forest Service employees and the Teton Raptor Center in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Many public agencies use vault toilets to manage sanitary waste on their lands, and the ventilation pipes seem to attract the birds. The small owls enter the hole at the top of the vent, fall down the vertical pipe and land in the waste holding reservoir. The small size and weight of the birds make it impossible for them to gain any lift to escape. In , the Teton Raptor Center heard about the problem and decided to do something. Roger Smith, founder of Teton Raptor Center, said a photo of an owl peering up from the reservoir made him realize the need for “…a real, tangible conservation project that people could understand and commit to – preventing bird mortality from a man-made problem by covering the hole with a screen.” As a non-profit organization with a mission focused on conservation, education and rehabilitation, the Teton Raptor Center resolved to launch a public awareness campaign:  the Port-O-Potty Owl Project. Of course, it quickly gained the nickname “Poo-Poo Project.” Unbeknownst to Smith was the collaboration between Gerardo Chavarria, a Forest Service regional engineer based in Denver, and Greg Hayward, an agency wildlife ecologist working in Alaska. Hayward sought out Chavarria because he wanted an engineering fix to prevent the bird deaths. “His concern was contagious and provided a challenge for me to investigate if there was a cost effective way to screen the toilet vent stacks without too much negative effect on air flow out of the stacks.” he said. Chavarria used his engineering skills to design a screen that would not adversely affect the functional design of a vault toilet. In fact, his work helped to advance the quick fixes the raptor center sought on vault toilets on three national forests in Wyoming. Chavarria’s advance research determined the types of screen that would work, which allowed the raptor center and the Forest Service to immediately cap the toilet vents. Because the need and resolution were already pre-determined, Forest Service employees Joe Harper of the Shoshone National Forest, Tammy Fletcher of the Caribou-Targhee National Forest and Bernadette Barthelenghi of the Bridger-Teton National Forest could more quickly answer the raptor center’s call. Harper brought the awareness of what happened to the birds to the forest, and all vault toilets are now screened and any new toilets and pipes also will be screened. Fletcher helped to secure grant funding to purchase screens for the Caribou-Targhee and all participating land agencies within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. And Barthelenghi made the work possible on her forest and worked to ensure the project and solution were shared with all agency offices. Joe Alexander, forest supervisor on the Shoshone, said they partnered with community organizations to help install the necessary screens.  Local chapters of the Audubon Society and Boy Scouts engaged on this real world problem and helped to make a difference. “The Shoshone National Forest prides itself on being the leader in conservation,” Alexander said. “After implementation of these new toilets it became apparent that some small efforts could go a long ways in protecting our avian resources. The Wings Across the Americas awards were presented March 12 during the 79th North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference. Other award winners are: The Barto Fen Restoration Project on the Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri received the first Dragonfly Conservation Award for one of the largest and most genetically diverse populations of this dragonfly. The Monitoring and Conservation of Black-Backed Woodpecker in Burned Forests project received the Research Management & Partnership award. Since , several organizations, including the Pacific Southwest Regional Office of the U.S. Forest Service and the Institute for Bird Populations, worked to better integrate the habitat needs of the bird into forest management plans. The Bat Cave Gating Project on the Mark Twain National Forest also received the Bat Conservation Award. The forest is home to a large gray bat maternity colony, and the project’s goal is to protect the bats by closing nearby trails and installing chute gauges and flyover gates at entrances of bat maternity caves. The Migratory Shorebird Project: Connecting Communities of the Americas through Research for Conservation received the International Cooperation Award.

"Forest Health Protection, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 05,  Removing mud and seeds from your shoes can help prevent the spread of invasive plants and animals. (Photo by Kim Lanahan-Lahti, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Division of Forestry) For years now, the U.S. Forest Service has been encouraging visitors to our nation’s forests and grasslands, to not only enjoy all there is out there, but to play safe and play clean. One example of this outreach effort is the PlayCleanGo: Stop Invasive Species In Your Tracks campaign. PlayCleanGo has 130 partners, all fostering active participation in actions designed to interrupt recreational pathways of spread for invasive species. By becoming a partner, you can spread the message to stop invasive species in your tracks. “PlayCleanGo is designed to give outdoor recreationists a clear call to action to be informed and attentive in helping stop the spread of invasive plants and insects and improving overall forest health,” said Monica Lear, U.S. Forest Service Forest Health Protection Director. “These pests can expand like a different kind of wildfire, from forest to forest by unsuspecting visitors just looking for some fun and adventure.” From camping to fishing to hiking, getting outside and into nature is one of the many activities that our forests support. Outdoor recreation provides physical challenges, contributes greatly to the physical and mental health of individuals, provides economic benefits to communities, and has become an essential part of American culture. PlayCleanGo is helping these recreationists preserve the land they already love and enjoy. Through positive messaging, the program provides simple steps people can take to avoid accidently spreading invasive species.  This advice includes letting visitors know to stay on designated trails, remove mud and seeds from shoes and gear, and burn only local or certified firewood. For example, garlic mustard, an aggressive plant invader of wooded areas throughout the Northeastern and Midwestern US, can form dense stands and displace native species by competing for available light, nutrients and water resources. Garlic mustard seeds stick together when damp and adhere readily to small soil clusters, making it easy for them to stick to muddy boots, pant cuffs, and animal fur. Through easy actions like inspecting hiking equipment, clothing, and pets before going out on a hiking trail and conducting the same inspection upon leaving the trail, the PlayCleanGo campaign is helping slow the spread of invasive species. PlayCleanGo was launched by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, in partnership with the University of Minnesota Extension, Minnesota departments of Agriculture and Transportation, and Explore Minnesota. Creating a new and successful awareness campaign, like Smokey Bear and his fire prevention message, depends on broad, frequent exposure to the public. For this reason, PlayCleanGo invites public and private organizations to join the effort by becoming a partner.

The ""PlayCleanGo"" campaign aims to raise awareness among recreationists about the risks associated with transporting invasive species from one location to another on their gear, clothing, and vehicles. Recreationists can help prevent the spread of invasive species by following these simple steps: 1. **Inspect your gear**: Before leaving a recreational area, inspect your gear, clothing, and vehicle for any signs of invasive species. 2. **Clean your gear**: Clean and dry all gear, including boats, kayaks, and camping equipment, to prevent the transport of invasive species. 3. **Stay on designated trails**: Stay on designated trails to avoid disturbing native vegetation and reducing the risk of spreading invasive species. 4. **Avoid transporting firewood**: Do not transport firewood from one location to another, as it can harbor invasive insects like emerald ash borers. 5. **Report sightings**: If you encounter an invasive species during a recreation trip, report it to local authorities or park rangers.

Last September, Blake, his parents, and his younger brothers were exploring a beach on southwestern Kruzof Island, part of the Tongass National Forest landscape and just west of Sitka, Alaska, where they live. Blake investigated a deeply incised creek behind a pile of beach drift where he found a standing burnt tree embedded in a tall bank of pumice.

"AMS Deputy Administrator, Livestock and Seed Program in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 28,  USDA is as American as baseball and apple pie. Almost anything and everything about U.S. food – and in some respects, baseball – is somehow connected to USDA. Curious? Read on to see how USDA ties in to the World Series. “The Ryan Express” Delivers the Goods Major League Baseball Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan pitched 27 years in the big leagues, tossing a league record seven no-hitters. In that span Ryan was comfortably pumping 100 mile-per-hour fastballs past hitters until he was 40 years old, registering 95 mph on the radar gun until retirement. Nicknamed “The Ryan Express” for his baseball exploits, he went on to become a successful business owner. Ryan knows a good deal when he sees one. In he became a principal owner, president and CEO of the Texas Rangers baseball club. The team has made it to the World Series the last two seasons: losing to the San Francisco Giants in and participating in the thrilling, nail-biting autumn classic of against the St. Louis Cardinals. Ryan also knows the value of the USDA shield. He’s the head of the Nolan Ryan Guaranteed Tender Beef Program, a marketing program verified by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). AMS relies on university-researched and industry-recognized standards to determine which marketing claims it chooses to verify. Companies like Ryan’s can approach AMS and request the agency verify marketing claims such as “guaranteed tender” to assure customers that the products listed on packaging are exactly what they claim.  This is an important service to consumers who desire a certain quality of beef and want third-party assurance that their beef purchases meet exacting requirements. _________________________________________________________________________________________ USDA Certified – St. Louis (Cardinals) Style If you bellied-up at a local sports bar and ordered a plate of St. Louis Style ribs while watching the World Series, thank a former USDA employee for naming the cut of pork. In the late s Steve Olson, an agricultural marketing specialist in the USDA Livestock and Seed Program’s Standardization Division, wrote meat standards for the Agricultural Marketing Service’s Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications (IMPS). Last June Olson shared his story about naming the cut of meat with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He explained how some butchers fancied carving off the breast bone and brisket bones from pork spareribs. “We did a survey to find out if there was a consensus for what this was called,” Olson told the Post-Dispatch. A majority of the respondents called it a St. Louis cut. “The only reason I went ahead and put the term into the IMPS is because I happen to be an avid St. Louis Cardinals baseball team fan, and they had just defeated the San Francisco Giants in a playoff,” Olson said. For more specifications, you can view the latest IMPS report. On pages 11 and 32, Item No. 416A is listed as “Pork Spareribs, St. Louis Style.” St. Louis ribs, ready to eat.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Oct 24,  Bat Week graphic. By the time October comes around, store shelves are stocked with Halloween candy, costumes, and decorations. Bats are often situated among this imagery, whether as silhouettes in the background or as blood-sucking monsters. But bats are none of these things. They are primarily nocturnal, they make their homes in dark places, but there’s nothing scary about them. That is why Bat Week, October 24-31, is a time to celebrate bats, what they contribute to our society, and to dispel the myths that cause so much misunderstanding of these gentle, intelligent creatures. There are more than 1,300 species of bats worldwide, and they are diverse. Some, like Kitti’s hog-nosed bat, also known as the bumble bee bat, can be as small as your thumbnail and survives on insects. Others like the flying fox eat fruit and have earned their name due to their impressive size. Bats like this Mexican free-tailed bat feed on insects and play an important role in pest control on agricultural crops. Photo by MerlinTuttle.org. There are three species of vampire bat among those 1,300. However, they live in Mexico, Central and South America; feed primarily on large livestock; and take about an ounce of blood in a feeding. Forty-seven species of bat call the United States home. Bats provide valuable services to us. Most feed on insects and play an important role in pest control on agricultural crops. The various species of beetles, moths, and other insects that often plague crops represent a tasty meal to a hungry bat. In fact, it is estimated that if bats were lost in North America, savings of up to $3.7 billion dollars annually would be lost due to increased pesticide requirements in agriculture. In one case, a Georgia pecan farmer was able to abandon pesticide use altogether after he built bat houses housing several thousand Mexican free-tailed bats. The Forest Service is looking into the role that bats play in pest insect control on the forest as well. Many insects, like bark beetles and gypsy moths, can be devastating to forests, and as voracious insect eaters, bats have the potential to help cull their numbers. Recognizing the role they play, the Forest Service has long been a champion of bat conservation. Over the last decade, the fungal disease white-nose syndrome has killed more than six million bats. While Forest Service researchers seek a solution to white-nose syndrome, the agency’s land managers explore improved ways to manage bat habitat. Within the 193 million acres of forests and grasslands that the agency manages, there are more than 25,000 abandoned mines that present both opportunity and hazard. Recognizing the potential of abandoned mines as ideal roosting, hibernation, or maternity sites, the Forest Service has constructed “bat gates” that provide a grating to keep visitors from stumbling into a potential hazard while allowing bats to fly freely. You too can make a big difference by planting bat-friendly gardens, building bat houses, and helping dispel myths about bats. Little Brown bats found in Maine with white-nose syndrome.

If bats were lost in North America, it is estimated that savings of up to $3.7 billion dollars annually would be lost due to increased pesticide requirements in agriculture.","**Role of Bats in Controlling Insect Pests:** Bats (order Chiroptera) are important predators that feed on a wide range of insects, including pest species that damage agricultural crops. In the United States alone, bats consume approximately 1 billion kilograms of insects per year, with some species specializing in feeding on specific crop-damaging pests like: * Cotton bollworms (Helicoverpa zea) * Corn earworms (Helicoverpa zea) * Sugarcane borers (Diatraea saccharalis) * Sweet potato weevils (Cylas formicarius) By preying on these insects, bats play a significant role in reducing the need for insecticides and minimizing crop damage. This ecosystem service can lead to: * Increased crop yields * Reduced pesticide use and associated environmental impacts * Lower costs for farmers **Potential Losses:** The loss of bats from North American agriculture could have significant consequences. Some estimates suggest that a 50% decline in bat populations would result in an additional $3 billion to $5 billion in losses per year due to increased pest damage. Possible scenarios: 1. **Increased pesticide use**: Without their natural predators, insect populations might surge, leading farmers to rely more heavily on pesticides, which can harm human health and the environment. 2. **Crop yield declines**: As a result of increased pest pressure, crop yields could decrease, affecting not only agricultural producers but also consumers who rely on affordable food supplies. 3. **Economic impacts**: The cumulative effect of lost yields and increased pesticide use would likely translate to higher costs for farmers, distributors, and consumers. **Conservation Efforts:** To mitigate these potential losses, conservation efforts should focus on: 1. **Habitat protection**: Preserving and restoring natural habitats that support bat colonies. 2. **Research and monitoring**: Studying the ecological role of bats in agricultural ecosystems and tracking population trends to inform management decisions. 3. **Integrated pest management (IPM)**: Encouraging farmers to adopt IPM strategies, which involve using a combination of techniques, including biological control (e.g., introducing beneficial insects), cultural practices, physical barriers, and selective use of pesticides. By acknowledging the value of bats in controlling insect pests on agricultural crops, we can work towards protecting these valuable pollinators and maintaining healthy, sustainable ecosystems.",6.556462514067058e-79,0.15306122448979592,0.041025641025641026,0.12244897959183673,0.8482314348220825
"Rural  Jul 19,   Story and Photos by Phil Eggman, USDA Rural Development, Washington State Office Donating a little bit of time can go a long way to making a big difference for people. Just ask the employees of USDA Rural Development in Washington State who, on July 13, donated two hours of their time at the end of a hectic day to make food packages for the elderly, young mothers, infants and children at the Thurston County Food Bank located in downtown Olympia. According to Thurston County Food Bank Executive Director Robert Coit, it was opportune that the Rural Development team were packaging food for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), which is a USDA program that provides nutritious food ""packages"" designed specifically for the nutritional  needs of low-income pregnant and breastfeeding women, infants, children up to age six and elderly people 60 and older. ""It's a great program and helps us with our mission to eliminate hunger in Thurston County,"" Coit said, adding that the food bank serves 10,000 families annually, including 37,000 individuals, half of which are children, around the communities of Lacy, Olympia  and Tumwater. ""This was a great opportunity for us to help out in our local community,"" said Mario Villanueva, Washington State Director, USDA Rural Development. ""Too many Americans live in food deserts and lack access to healthy food.  USDA is a key partner in providing access to healthy food by administering the nation's nutrition programs, funding projects that provide underserved areas with greater access to fresh produce"" ""It was great!,"" said Becki Southworth, Multi-Family Housing Loan Specialist. ""I really feel like we were able to help our local community by not only what we do every day through housing, business and community programs, but by taking it up a level and getting out in the community, we were able to help meet another need, provide food to those that need it most.  I am so glad I was able to go and I would love to do it again."" ""I had fun and it felt great to know that we helped 210 families in just an hour and a half of work of great teamwork,"" said Housing Specialist Leslie Schmidt. ""It just shows how much you can help the community with just a little bit of our time."" In addition to helping out at the local food bank (an exercise the agency plans to repeat on a regular basis), Rural Development is participating in a summer food drive as part of the 2nd Annual ""Feds, Farmers, and Friends Feed Families"" (F5) initiative.  The Washington State food drive kicked off July 6 in Olympia and other area offices and will run through July 31. The food drive makes a big difference. Last summer, federal employees around the country donated more than 1 million pounds of nonperishable goods and daily essentials for those in need. The new goal for across the Federal government is 1.2 million pounds of non-perishable items. ""We know the need is great in our area and this was a chance for our agency and federal partners to contribute to a worthwhile cause,"" said Gayle Hoskison, Olympia Area Director. ""And, I agree with our staff - it was a great team effort and felt really good to help out at the food bank.  We added another 'F' to the 'F5' effort - the 6th 'F' stands for Fun!""

"Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Oct 31,  A wasp works its way out of an aphid mummy after developing inside as larvae. (Photo courtesy of the ARS Electron and Confocal Microscopy Unit) At Halloween, people revel in ghosts, goblins, and things that go bump in the night. Not all are in books or movies, though. There are plenty of creepy critters doing downright scary things every day in your own backyard. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, since many of these “monsters” are actually good guys getting the bad guys out of town; it’s just not always pleasant to watch. Fire ants are common in subtropical Southeastern states and have shown up as far west as California. These stinging ants are not just painful pests; they’re also a bane to agriculture, feeding on young plants and seeds, causing an estimated crop loss of $750 million per year. There are many ways to control or eliminate fire ants, but nature provides one that is tailor made for the silver screen! Enter the phorid fly, a natural predator of the fire ant. The fly swoops in on its target and deposits an egg into the ant. After hatching inside the ant, the maggot works its way into the ant’s head, where it lives for a couple of weeks, feeding on bodily fluids. The maggot then releases chemicals that eat away at the ant’s body until its head falls off. The maggot then stays in the severed head and feeds on brains until it reaches maturity and breaks out through the ant’s mouth. Like zombies? You will, if you don’t like cockroaches. The jewel wasp injects a serum into its victim, which “zombifies” the roach into submitting to its will. The passive zombie roach allows the wasp to lead it by an antenna into a nest, which quickly becomes a nursery after the wasp lays its egg. As with the phorid fly larvae, it feeds off its host until it reaches maturity. Mummies also abound in gardens and fields, courtesy of a pair of wasps. These wasps (Aphidiinae braconid wasps – pictured – and Pteromalid chaclid wasps) also deposit an egg inside the body of their prey, this time an aphid. The wasp larvae grow inside the aphid, which soon becomes mummified in that it turns inflated, rigid, and off-color. After the larva becomes an adult wasp, it chews its way out, leaving the mummy husk behind. “Husks are fun to collect and are routinely encountered in gardens,” said Matt Buffington, a research scientist with the Agricultural Research Service’s Systematic Entomology Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. “In fact, if you have them, it’s a good sign your aphid problems are being somewhat controlled.” Aphids are a scourge to crops and horticulture, where they suck on sap, which causes yellowing, stunting, distortion of plant parts, leaf mold, and, in cotton, poor fiber quality. Aphids can also transmit plant viruses. Not to be outdone, some bees (Trigona hypogea) make an appearance as scavenger vampires. “Instead of providing their young with protein from pollen, vampire bees gather protein from carcasses on the forest floor,” Buffington said. “Further, they have unique jaws for tearing into dead animal flesh and cutting it into pieces for transport and digestion.” There are plenty of other examples of insects that exemplify Halloween, but one of the spookiest is actually a mammal – the humble bat. If you can get past the vampire nature of some bats, you’ll find that many species of bats are great friends of plants; they pollinate, spread seeds, and feed on pesky bugs. So, on All Hallows’ Eve, as you’re greeting young ghosts and goblins doing their rounds of trick-or-treating, don’t forget about those beneficial creepy critters in your own backyard.

The unique aspect of how Aphidiinae braconid wasps interact with their aphid prey is that they are parasitoids. In other words, these wasps lay their eggs inside the living body of an aphid, rather than killing and eating it outright. This is a remarkable example of evolutionary adaptation, where the wasp benefits from having its offspring grow inside a host organism, while also using the aphid's bodily resources to nourish their developing young. This parasitoid relationship allows the braconid wasp larvae to grow and develop within the aphid's body, eventually emerging as adult wasps. This unique interaction is a key aspect of their life cycle and has evolved as an effective way for these tiny wasps to reproduce and thrive in their environment.",1.5910017558441226e-78,0.3777777777777778,0.20224719101123595,0.26666666666666666,0.8754145503044128

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. When people think about keeping our homeland safe, they don’t usually think about animal diseases that threaten our nation’s economy and food supply, but USDA scientists do. Years of dedicated research on foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is paying off. A team of USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists and their U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) collaborators received the DHS Secretary's Exceptional Service Gold Medal Award at a recent ceremony in Washington, D.C. The award recognizes outstanding leadership or service distinguished by achievements of national or international significance that improves our homeland security. The team successfully developed and licensed the world’s first molecular FMD vaccine for cattle—the most significant scientific accomplishment in FMD vaccine development in the past ates. Research leading to this award was initiated by retired scientist Marvin Grubman while working at ARS’ Foreign Animal Disease Research Unit (FADRU) at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in Orient Point, New York. Grubman created a novel FMD vaccine, which was used as the foundation for this work. ARS scientists receiving the award were Luis Rodriguez and Teresa de los Santos at FADRU, and Laszlo Zsak at ARS’ Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory in Athens, Georgia. Other FMD team recipients were Lawrence Barrett, Jeffrey Babcock, Michelle Colby, John Neilan, Michael Santillo and Christopher Schutta, with DHS’ Science and Technology Directorate at Plum Island; and Lavanya Ratnam and Robert Webb, with the Office of General Counsel in Washington, D.C. FMD is a highly contagious disease that affects cattle, swine and other cloven-hoofed animals. Infection can lead to critical economic consequences with potential severe losses in producing and marketing meat and milk.  Although the United States has not had an FMD outbreak since , the disease is still considered a serious threat to our nation's economy and food supply. “This award is an achievement for all of us in ARS and emphasizes the importance of the work we do every day,” said Rodriguez, FADRU research leader. “Our FMD research is part of our mission, but also part of our homeland security. This was a joint interagency collaboration that turned valuable federal research into a vaccine and a product.” DHS Secretary's Exceptional Service Gold Medal Award presented to a team of USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists and their U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) collaborators.

"DVM, Ph.D., USDA/APHIS Deputy Administrator, Veterinary Services, U.S. Chief Veterinary Officer in  Animals  Oct 16,  Waterfowl fly at 40 to 60 miles per hour. Migrating mallards can cover 800 miles in 8 hours if helped by 50 mile per hour tail winds. We know you’ve heard it before: seasonal migratory patterns bring an increased risk of disease-carrying birds interacting with commercial or backyard poultry. But the health and safety of our U.S. poultry flock is important enough to make it worth repeating. Birds, particularly waterfowl like ducks and geese, can carry avian influenza without showing any symptoms or signs of disease. Because the risk of introduction never goes away, having strong biosecurity practices on poultry operations can help prevent the spread of infectious disease before it starts. The - U.S. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreak is never far from my mind. It forced us to reevaluate our preparedness and response capabilities, from a federal, state, and industry standpoint. Today, we are all better prepared to handle and quickly respond to avian influenza detections. Our Wild Bird Surveillance Program, which has been in place for more than a decade, is on-going. Since July , USDA and our partners have collected more than 90,ates. This improves our ability to detect these viruses and helps poultry producers and others make informed management decisions. The program also gives us a chance to learn more about the virus, including the make-up and transmission of various virus strains. We’ve taken these experiences and lessons learned from the -15 outbreak and developed Defend the Flock, an outreach program that offers commercial poultry growers important information to help put the best biosecurity practices into place. Defend the Flock provides multiple resources for poultry growers, including guidance on biosecurity basics, an assessment tool to help strengthen their biosecurity programs, and sharable materials to help everyone at their operations better understand biosecurity’s importance. Stay up-to-date on the latest biosecurity information by following on Twitter. Everyone who has poultry in their care can help defend the U.S. poultry industry by reviewing the following biosecurity basics. Together, we have made great strides in our preparedness and response capabilities. Protecting American poultry remains a top USDA priority. Biosecurity can stop the disease before it stops.

"Public Information Coordinator, Mississippi Rural Development in  Rural  May 03,   U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack joined Obama Administration Cabinet members Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan, as well as Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate, Small Business Administration Administrator Karen Mills, and other state and local officials to tour areas in Alabama and Mississippi affected by last week’s tornadoes. After visiting devastated sites in Birmingham and nearby areas, the group crossed over to Mississippi, where they surveyed the damage done to Smithville, a town of approximately that was almost literally wiped off the map. In Smithville, Miss. the senior administration officials were joined by Mississippi’s USDA Rural Development State Director Trina George, who had made the trek from her home in central Mississippi in the pre-dawn hours on Thursday, the day after the tornado hit. State Director George viewed damaged areas in Maben, Amory, and parts of Chickasaw County on Thursday. She had monitored the tornado, keeping in contact with local officials as the tornado went through Mississippi on Wednesday. She linked up on Thursday morning with local USDA personnel in Oktibbeha County, arriving only hours after the tornado had passed through. She also toured damaged areas in Neshoba and Kemper Counties that afternoon. Secretary Tom Vilsack toured the area of Smithville, Mississippi and saw firsthand the heavy damage caused by the tornado. He is seen in this photo talking to one of the victims of the disastrous weather. Behind him is USDA Rural Development State Director Trina George of Mississippi. Secretary Vilsack and State Director George were two of a number of Obama Administration Cabinet officials, federal administrators, and local leaders to see the damage caused by tornadoes in Mississippi and Alabama. “It is heartbreaking to see this damage and to talk to the people who are victims of the tornado,” said George. “I was able to not only see the physical damages, but I was able to listen to some of the actual victims, many of whom had lost everything. However, I can report that USDA Rural Development has programs that can offer some relief to these unfortunate victims.” George cited USDA Rural Development programs such as funding to replace and repair single-family homes, shared community facilities and the water and wastewater systems in the damaged areas. “I want to make sure that people know about the availability of our programs, especially our single-family home loan and home repair loan programs, so that they can rebuild their homes and businesses and continue to have clean water.” George has a history of fast action on disaster relief. Most recently, she was on the scene the day after tornadoes ran thru Holmes and Yazoo Counties in and made sure that USDA Rural Development programs were a part of both the immediate and long-term relief efforts in those counties. Local officials in both counties credited George and USDA Rural Development for their fast work in making resources available, especially to the homeowners who lost their homes in that disaster. “These people have lost everything but their spirit. For them to see the highest officials in our nation’s government, including Cabinet secretaries and head of relief agencies coming to what is left of their town to see the damage personally,” Said George, “I can’t convey to ya’ll how uplifting that is to those people.

"Posted by Almanza, Administrator of the Food Safety Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Oct 22,  USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service Administrator Al Almanza (fourth from left) was among the senior executives from 10 federal agencies who took part in the Interagency Import Safety Conference at Dulles, Va., on October 21, .  Yesterday I visited with FSIS personnel and 9 other federal agencies in Dulles, Virginia to focus on a critical element of food safety: protecting the public from unsafe imports. The Interagency Import Safety Conference was organized by the Department of Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to bring agencies together, improve cooperation, and build collaboration.  Our mutual goal with these efforts is ensuring the continued health and safety of the American consumer. I want to express a thanks and gratitude to those working to reach this goal to prevent foodborne contamination and protect consumers. Today marks us as one step closer to achieving our goal by focusing on food import safety cooperation. I would also like to thank our import inspection personnel who are working hard every day on the frontlines at keeping harmful imports from reaching the American public. In December of last year, the Commercial Targeting and Analysis Center opened here in Washington, D.C. to provide agencies with shared resources, analysis and expertise necessary to improving the safety of imports. This, among other initiatives proposed by the Food Safety Working Group, will provide an appropriate forum to address the concerns expressed by consumers about the safety of the food they’re serving their families. I was able to see today the commitment of our public health officials and import inspectors through innovative ideas and combined resources. I look forward to continue working across agency borders to fulfill our commitment to protecting public health.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  May 25,  Map of the dollar value of USDA Foods purchased in ; represent the states that are the largest sources of a particular type of USDA Foods. (Click to view a larger version) Do you know where your food comes from?  If you can pinpoint where your food was grown and produced, you can make more informed decisions to maximize quality, freshness, and nutritional value.  You can also help support local economies through your purchases.  The USDA Foods program takes this mantra to heart and publishes state of origin with procurement information on all USDA Foods every year.  As we like to say at FNS, “All USDA Foods are local to someone.” USDA Foods are 100 percent American grown and produced.  Each year, USDA procures more than 200 types of food, including meat, poultry, fish, fruits, vegetables, flour, cereals, and dairy products, totaling approximately $2 billion.  Organizations such as food banks, disaster and emergency feeding organizations, Indian Tribal Organizations, schools, and other feeding groups receive these USDA Foods for use in meal service or distribution to households through programs like the National School Lunch Program, The Emergency Food Assistance Program, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations. A recent report on the state of origin of USDA Foods found that USDA Foods procures food from more than three-quarters of all states.  California, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Illinois are the five states with the highest dollar amounts of USDA Foods purchases.  A number of items available through USDA Foods are sourced solely from one state.  For example, 100 percent of the strawberries purchased by USDA Foods in FY came from the state of California.  During this time, California schools received approximately 3.3 million pounds of this locally produced product through the USDA Foods program.  All of the wild blueberries came from Maine and all the catfish were purchased from Mississippi. States and schools can use this sourcing information and other purchasing trends available on our website to tailor their USDA Foods purchases accordingly, or they can simply purchase with confidence, knowing that all USDA Foods purchases help strengthen the American economy by supporting a local community somewhere across the country.

"National Forests of Florida, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 08,   Well into the wee hours of night, for five successive evenings, teams of scientists from across the southeastern United States waited and watched as bats in the Apalachicola National Forest swooped down to feed on their insect prey only to be captured in sheer mist nets. The scientific teams and U.S. Forest Service wildlife biologists were conducting bat surveys to test for white-nose syndrome and general bat healthiness throughout the region. This Seminole Bat is a medium-sized bat caught by Gary Libby, an ecologist on the Bat Blitz Team that examined bats to determine levels of health and/or disease conditions, May 22, . The Seminole Bat grows up to four and one-half inches long with a wingspan of up to 12 inches and can weigh up to one-half ounce. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service photo by Porter Libby. Dubbed “Bat Blitz,” the 5-day event was hosted by the Florida Bat Working Group, which partnered with the U.S. Forest Service, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the University of Florida “We’re mapping locations where each species was captured to learn more about the types of forest and water bodies that each species is associated with here in the Panhandle,” said Assistant Professor Holly Ober of the University of Florida Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation. “We'll also study the bat guano to determine which insects each bat species is feeding on.” Bat testing to date has confirmed a very low probability of local bats being affected by white-nose syndrome, a condition linked to the deaths of more than a million hibernating bats from New Hampshire to Tennessee. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the cause of the bat deaths remains unknown despite the continuing search to find the source of this condition by numerous laboratories and state and federal biologists. Each night, 12 teams of five biologists spread out across the forest and surveyed bats in places where they were expected to be feeding. “Because bats are active at night, few people see them, and even fewer understand or appreciate their importance in our daily lives,” said Micah Thorning, wildlife biologist for the U.S. Forest Service. “For example, as the primary consumers of flying insects, bats play a crucial role in insect control.” The survey netted 246 bats of eight different species with the number of bats caught at one site totaling 57. The most widespread species caught were the Seminole Bat, Evening Bat, Red Bat and Southeastern Bat, but rarer species such as the Tricolored Bat, Big Brown Bat, Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat, and Brazilian Free-tailed Bat were also captured and tested. The event started in with the Southeastern Bat Diversity Network (SBDN) selecting Tennessee to host the first Bat Blitz. SBDN promotes, facilitates and organizes the event every year. The Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat is one of two of its kind caught on found on the Apalachicola National Forest during Bat Blitz, May 22, . The Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat is listed as a sensitive species and is a rare find on the National Forests of Florida. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service photo by Porter Libby. “Planning a Bat Blitz takes a lot of time and effort -- most states begin planning one and a half to two years in advance,” said Ober. “We began a bit late, so we have been working feverishly for the past eight months.” Ober credited their success to the dedication of a core group of individuals from the Florida Bat Working Group, an organization of local, state and federal agencies and private partners.

"Director, SNAP Benefit Redemption Division in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Mar 29,   Last summer, the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), in collaboration with the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), released  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at Farmers Markets: A How-To-Handbook.  The handbook assists farmers’ market operators and direct marketing farmers in determining the steps necessary to become authorized to participate in SNAP and, subsequently, the steps related to managing participation. It includes tips and on how to make the program work successfully for vendors and customers.  The handbook also features a list of resources, a glossary of important terms, and several case studies from farmers markets that have successfully implemented EBT technology.  AMS’s USDA Farmers’ Market Directory is available online to locate farmers’ markets that accept nutrition assistance program benefits. Collaboration through the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative led the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS),to co-release, with the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), ""Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at Farmers Markets: A How-To-Handbook."" There are many benefits to making farmers’ markets more accessible to all communities, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet in these hard times.  The concentration of fresh and nutritious foods found at farmers’ markets and sold by direct marketing farmers helps introduce low-income households to a variety of healthy options.  As SNAP clients increase their demand for local produce, small farmers have potential to increase in their customer base.  Our goal here at FNS is to authorize an additional 200 direct marketing farmers and/or farmers’ markets to accept SNAP benefits and increase redemptions nationally by at least $750,000 each year.  We are on our way to reaching these goals.  At the end of Federal Fiscal Year () , according to AMS, a total of 6,132 farmers’ markets were operating around the United States.  This represents a 16 percent rise from .  Of this total, 1,611 farmers’ markets and direct marketing farmers were authorized by FNS and redeemed $7,547,028 in SNAP benefits.  This is a 263 percent increase in the number of authorized farmers and farmers’ markets and a 49 percent increase in SNAP redemptions over the previous five fiscal years. Under regular SNAP rules, EBT equipment is provided free of charge and the expense is shared by the SNAP state agency and FNS.  For farmers’ markets and direct marketing farmers that do not have access to a land line and electricity necessary for the standard equipment to work,  the markets may elect to use manual paper vouchers or purchase wireless equipment through a third party processor.  FNS reimburses states that wish to provide wireless equipment to farmers and markets at the rate of 50 percent of the cost of equipment as part of the administrative cost associated with benefit issuance.  Under a demonstration waiver, FNS allows markets to implement scrip projects that allow a farmers’ market to obtain one FNS authorization to accept SNAP benefits for all eligible vendors at the market by using a single point-of-sale (POS) terminal.  The scrip (paper, tokens or receipts) is purchased at a centrally-located POS terminal that accepts SNAP benefits and is exchanged for eligible food products by participating vendors.  Many markets also use this process for accepting credit and debit cards. FNS has conducted a congressionally-mandated cost benefit analysis to assess the feasibility of equipping all farmers’ markets nationwide with wireless EBT point-of-sale (POS) equipment.  This analysis focuses on requiring centralized operation of a single EBT terminal to issue scrip, as it is the most cost effective way to equip farmers markets and often the most practical way for markets to manage participation.  It is likely that most farmers’ markets will implement SNAP if funding is made available.   President Obama has included a request for $4 million in the budget to support this effort.

"Posted by Written by Katie Yocum, USDA Rural Development in  Initiatives  USDA Results  Technology  Jun 11,  While the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma is rich in cultural pride, identity and history, its remote location in the rugged terrain of Southeast Oklahoma has severely limited the tribe’s economic development efforts.  But a Broadband Initiative Program grant, made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, will enable Pine Telephone Company (PTC) to use innovative wireless technology to deliver affordable broadband service to portions of this rural, remote and economically disadvantaged region in Southeast Oklahoma. During World War II, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma provided an invaluable service to the United States by pioneering the use of Code Talking, using the native Choctaw language, to prevent enemy forces from intercepting the transmission of army secrets. And in , the Choctaw Nation was awarded the Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award, the highest recognition of support of employees who serve in the National Guard and Reserve.  So while the Choctaw Nation has shown outstanding compassion for the nation and its tribal members, the local economies of Choctaw communities have suffered tremendously.  Of the five counties on tribal lands that will be served by PTC, all of them are plagued with unemployment rates that soar above the state average and a substantial proportion of residents living below the poverty line. PTC spent years testing broadband technologies that would offer reliable internet service to residents of this remote region, and they determined that advanced 3G technology presents the most viable solution. The system is designed to be scalable and to cost-effectively accommodate technology upgrades, so that it will remain viable for years to come. PTC’s system will offer service to nearly 5,000 households, 10 school districts, and 12 volunteer fire departments and ambulance services. With reliable, high speed wireless access, the region will be able to overcome their geographic isolation to stimulate the sustainable economic growth that it needs.  And offering quality internet access to key community institutions, like schools and public safety bodies, will mean better educational opportunities and enhanced health care and public safety for residents of this region. And in addition to the many benefits to be reaped by members of the Choctaw Nation, this Recovery Act project will also create more than 150 jobs over the multi-year construction period.

"Turkey Tips Step 2: Preparing Your Feast  Preparing for Thanksgiving can become hectic. On Tuesday we tried to make your trip to the grocery store a little easier, by explaining the labels you’ll find on turkeys for sale. Now that you have your bird, you’re probably thinking about putting your game face on and getting that meal ready. In between trying to convince your 21-year-old nephew to sit at the kid’s table (because there’s no room at the adult table) and figuring out how you’ll answer your relatives’ questions about where your current relationship is going, we want to help you prepare your meal. With such thoughts possibly running through your head, proper food safety practices are sometimes treated like pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving: always but too often ignored and overshadowed.  Chris Bernstein, Food Safety Education Staff, Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA  Posted in  Health and Safety  Nov 20,   2 Responses",What are some proper food safety practices that should be considered when preparing a Thanksgiving meal?,Proper food safety practices to consider when preparing a Thanksgiving meal include adhering to safe handling and cooking procedures to prevent contamination and ensure the turkey is cooked thoroughly.,"Here are some essential food safety practices to consider when preparing a delicious and safe Thanksgiving meal: 1. **Handle Raw Turkey Safely**: When handling raw turkey, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before and after touching the bird or any utensils that have come into contact with it. 2. **Thaw Turkey Properly**: Thaw frozen turkey in the refrigerator or in cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes. Never thaw a turkey at room temperature. 3. **Cook Turkey to Safe Temperature**: Cook the turkey to an internal temperature of at least 165°F (74°C) to prevent foodborne illness. Use a meat thermometer to ensure the correct temperature is reached. 4. **Separate Raw and Ready-to-Eat Foods**: Keep raw meats, poultry, and seafood separate from ready-to-eat foods like fruits, vegetables, and breads to prevent cross-contamination. 5. **Wash Hands Frequently**: Wash your hands with soap and water frequently when preparing food, especially after handling raw meat or coming into contact with surfaces that may have come into contact with the raw turkey. 6. **Keep Hot Foods Hot and Cold Foods Cold**: Keep hot foods like mashed potatoes, stuffing, and gravy at a temperature of 145°F (63°C) or above to prevent bacterial growth. Store cold foods like salads, cranberry sauce, and pies in shallow containers and refrigerate at a temperature of 40°F (4°C) or below. 7. **Refrigerate Leftovers Promptly**: Refrigerate leftovers within two hours of serving. Discard any leftovers that have been left out for more than two hours or show signs of spoilage. 8. **Use Clean Equipment and Utensils**: Use clean equipment, utensils, and plates to prepare and serve food to prevent cross-contamination. 9. **Label and Date Leftovers**: Label and date leftovers to ensure you use them within a safe time frame (typically three to four days). 10. **Be Mindful of Perishable Foods**: Be aware of the perishability of certain foods, such as dairy products, eggs, and fresh herbs, which may need special handling or storage. By following these proper food safety practices, you can help ensure that your Thanksgiving meal is both delicious and safe to eat.

"APHIS Pleased With Animal Evacuations At Two Flood-Ravaged North Dakota Zoos  In late May, two zoos in central North Dakota were hit hard by flooding.  The disaster prompted the need for a swift evacuation of the animals.  In Bismarck, the Missouri River threatened to submerge the Dakota Zoo and its 500+ animals under as much as seven feet of water, and in Minot the Roosevelt Park Zoo was a potential target of the rising Souris River, which runs directly through the city. During the height of the flooding, APHIS’ Animal Care Program monitored coming from the zoos and kept abreast of river levels.  Inspector Amy Jirsa-Smith contacted zoo officials regularly. She was on-site at both facilities, and helped corral some animals at the Dakota Zoo so they could be transported to other facilities.  However, she is quick to point out that the zoo staff at both facilities, with the assistance of several cooperating state and local agencies, state veterinarians, four neighboring zoos and the National Guard, had everything under control.

"Obama Administration Launches Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture  From record droughts in Kansas to deadly wildfires in California, the United States is feeling the effects of climate change. These same conditions have a dire impact across the developing world, especially for poor, rural smallholder farmers whose very lives are threatened every time the rains arrive late, the floods rush in, or the temperature soars. By , the world’s population is expected to reach nine billion people. Feeding them will require at least a 60 percent increase in agricultural production. There is no greater challenge to meeting this need than climate change. It poses a range of unprecedented threats to the livelihoods of the world’s most vulnerable people and to the very planet that sustains us. In order to ensure that hundreds of millions of people are not born into a debilitating cycle of under-nutrition and hunger, we must address the urgent threat that climate change poses.  Secretary of State John Kerry, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Dr. Rajiv ""Raj"" Shah, Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development  Posted in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Sep 24,   6 Responses",How can addressing climate change be crucial in breaking a debilitating cycle of under-nutrition and hunger for millions of people worldwide?,"Addressing climate change is crucial in breaking the cycle of under-nutrition and hunger because it poses a range of unprecedented threats to agricultural production, which must increase by at least 60% to feed a growing global population.","Addressing climate change is crucial in breaking a debilitating cycle of under-nutrition and hunger for millions of people worldwide because climate change affects food availability, access, utilization, and stability, ultimately impacting nutrition and hunger levels. Here's how: 1. **Impacts agricultural productivity**: Climate change alters temperature and precipitation patterns, leading to droughts, floods, and extreme weather events that can damage or destroy crops. This reduction in crop yields reduces the availability of nutritious food for millions of people. 2. **Affects access to food**: Changes in climate lead to increased competition for resources such as land, water, and energy, making it difficult for small-scale farmers and vulnerable communities to access and afford nutritious food. 3. **Impacts nutrition quality**: Climate change can alter the nutritional value of crops due to changes in soil quality, water availability, and temperature fluctuations. This can lead to a decrease in essential micronutrients like iron, zinc, and vitamin A, which are critical for human health. 4. **Increases migration and displacement**: As climate-related disasters become more frequent and severe, people may be forced to migrate from their homes and communities, disrupting access to food and leading to increased hunger and malnutrition. 5. **Exacerbates existing inequalities**: Climate change disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations, including women, children, and marginalized groups, who often have limited access to resources, information, and decision-making power. By addressing climate change through measures such as: 1. **Transitioning to more resilient agricultural practices** (e.g., agroforestry, conservation agriculture) 2. **Promoting climate-resilient food systems** 3. **Supporting climate education and awareness-raising** 4. **Implementing climate policies and regulations** 5. **Investing in climate-related infrastructure** we can help break the debilitating cycle of under-nutrition and hunger for millions of people worldwide. In summary, addressing climate change is crucial to breaking a cycle of under-nutrition and hunger because it has significant impacts on agricultural productivity, access to food, nutrition quality, migration, and existing inequalities. By taking action to mitigate and adapt to climate change, we can create more resilient food systems that ensure everyone's right to nutritious food and good health.",0.03593216335769571,0.13953488372093023,0.07792207792207793,0.11369509043927649,0.8452231884002686

It only mentions that they made ""conservation improvements"" to put conservation systems to work on their farms, ranches, and forests, but it does not specify what those improvements were.","Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, landowners in the Gulf region have implemented various conservation practices to restore habitats and increase the resilience of their lands. Some specific practices include: 1. **Wetland restoration**: Landowners have restored or enhanced wetlands on their properties through the creation of shallow pools and the replanting of native vegetation such as cordgrass, salt marshes, and mangroves. These areas provide essential habitat for birds, fish, and other wildlife. 2. **Beach nourishment**: Beach nourishment involves pumping sand onto eroded beaches to restore them to their pre-spill condition. This helps protect coastal ecosystems and supports the recovery of beach-dwelling species such as sea turtles and shorebirds. 3. **Dune restoration**: Landowners have planted native vegetation such as beach grasses, dunes, and shrubs on eroded dunes to stabilize the sand and prevent further erosion. These restored dunes provide habitat for wildlife and help protect against storms and sea-level rise. 4. **Shellfish reef restoration**: Shellfish reefs have been restored in areas where they were damaged by the oil spill. These reefs provide essential habitat for commercial and recreational fisheries, as well as supporting water quality and shoreline stabilization. 5. **Native plant reforestation**: Landowners have replanted native vegetation on their properties to restore forests and promote biodiversity. This helps to improve soil health, reduce erosion, and increase the resilience of these ecosystems. 6. **Fish-friendly habitat restoration**: Fish-friendly habitats such as mangrove and marsh areas have been restored or enhanced to provide critical breeding, spawning, and nursery grounds for fish species. 7. **Soil remediation**: Some landowners have implemented soil remediation practices to address oil contamination on their properties. These practices include bioremediation using microorganisms that break down oil, as well as physical and chemical methods of cleanup. 8. **Watershed management**: Landowners have implemented watershed management strategies such as buffer strips and terracing to reduce sediment runoff and improve water quality in local watersheds. These conservation practices have been implemented through a combination of government-led initiatives (e.g., the Natural Resources Damage Assessment process) and voluntary efforts by landowners, NGOs, and other stakeholders. The Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council (RESTORE), created after the oil spill, has also played a significant role in guiding restoration efforts across the region.",1.8022204968028182e-155,0.1016949152542373,0.014598540145985401,0.06295399515738499,0.8189404606819153

"The Makings of a Good Sweet Potato  Sweet potatoes, which are native to the Americas, sustained our founding pioneers with beneficial nutrients like beta carotene, calcium, fiber, and a host of vitamins. No wonder it’s a holiday favorite, especially during Thanksgiving. But what makes a good sweet potato?  Sandra Avant, Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service  Posted in  Research and Science  Nov 06,   Respond to this story","What nutritional factors contribute to making a good sweet potato, according to its native benefits for our founding pioneers?","beneficial nutrients that contribute to making a good sweet potato include beta carotene, calcium, fiber, and a host of vitamins.","A great question about a delicious and nutritious root vegetable! According to Native American traditions, particularly among the Cherokee and other Eastern Woodlands tribes, sweet potatoes were considered a staple crop in North America long before they became popularized by European settlers. Here are some nutritional factors that contribute to making a good sweet potato, based on their native benefits for our founding pioneers: 1. **Rich source of Vitamin A**: Sweet potatoes contain beta-carotene, which converts to vitamin A in the body. This is essential for healthy vision, immune function, and skin health. 2. **High water content**: Sweet potatoes have a high water content, making them a refreshing and hydrating food, especially during the hot summer months when other foods might be scarce. 3. **Rich in antioxidants**: Sweet potatoes contain various antioxidants like anthocyanins, carotenoids, and polyphenols, which help protect against oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell damage. 4. **Good source of dietary fiber**: Sweet potatoes are a good source of dietary fiber, which supports healthy digestion, satiety, and blood sugar control. 5. **Mineral-rich**: Sweet potatoes contain minerals like potassium (helps regulate blood pressure), magnesium (essential for bone health and energy production), and iron (crucial for healthy red blood cells). 6. **Good source of complex carbohydrates**: Sweet potatoes are rich in complex carbohydrates, which provide sustained energy and support healthy gut bacteria. 7. **Supports healthy gut microbiome**: The fiber and other nutrients in sweet potatoes help feed beneficial gut microbes, promoting a healthy gut microbiome. These nutritional factors were highly valued by our founding pioneers, who recognized the importance of sweet potatoes as a nutritious and versatile food source. They were often stored for long periods to provide sustenance during harsh winters or when other foods were scarce. In summary, good sweet potatoes are those that are rich in vitamin A, antioxidants, dietary fiber, minerals like potassium, magnesium, and iron, complex carbohydrates, and support healthy gut bacteria. These nutritional factors make sweet potatoes an excellent addition to a balanced diet!",0.019189885170646914,0.09686609686609687,0.05730659025787966,0.08547008547008546,0.8449516892433167

At USDA, we understand the value of research, and by providing resources to get things started at the local level, we often see amazing results that have positive impact for farmers, agribusinesses and consumers across the country. The Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program (FSMIP), administered by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service, is one of the many ways that USDA makes an investment in the future of agriculture.  Funding practical research projects that focus on innovation and collaboration, FSMIP’s diverse projects reflect the unique marketing challenges and opportunities faced by different agribusiness sectors, local communities and regions.  Sometimes, by solving a specific problem within their state or local area, grant recipients end up addressing issues that have national or industry-wide impact. With the support of FSMIP funds in and , the California Association of Food Banks (CAFB), in partnership with the California Department of Food and Agriculture, was able to dramatically expand its Farm to Family program.  Among several positive outcomes was a pilot project to help food banks access nutrient-dense row crops. Crops like broccoli, cauliflower, and celery are often sorted and separated right in the harvest field.  Products that do not meet supermarket grade are usually left in the field and tilled under.  CAFB worked with two major growers to harvest cull products, providing a steady source of high nutrient vegetables to food banks.  Since the project’s inception, people in need have enjoyed over 8 million pounds of these crops, and food banks now have a regular, permanent supply of nutrient-dense row crops.  This project provides a model for other states seeking to provide a new market for produce growers while meeting a vital food need. A young girl in front of food donations in Oakland, California.

Photo courtesy Alameda County Community Food Bank With FSMIP funding, the Ohio Direct Marketing Team led by Ohio State University used surveys and case studies to evaluate the current marketing strategies and practices of Ohio food producers.  The goal was to determine if and how a web-based marketing system called MarketMaker improved the effectiveness of their marketing efforts.  MarketMaker is currently one of the most extensive collections of searchable food industry related in the country and contains over 400,000 profiles of farmers and other food related enterprises in 19 states and the District of Columbia. This investment continues to benefit Ohio food producers in numerous ways.  The FSMIP study was the first step in developing standardized protocols to evaluate the contribution of marketing tools on reducing transaction costs and leveling the playing field for local food enterprises on a national level. As a result, the Ohio Direct Marketing Team attracted additional funding to develop training modules such as MarketReady to prepare producers to enter new markets.  They also held “Meet the Buyers” forums to bring buyers and sellers together for targeted sales meetings, and developed maps, apps & mobile media marketing tools to help consumers find producers. In , the number of registered producers and users of Ohio MarketMaker increased significantly.  There were more than 5,000 visitors and 679 registered producers by the end of the year.  In , Ohio was one of two states recognized with the first National Food MarketMaker Innovation Awards, sponsored by Farm Credit.  Building on strong food industry partnerships, the “Get Connected” campaign engaged new organizations through customized promotional and educational materials. As a result, the number of registered MarketMaker users nearly doubled from to . The creation of “Get Connected” artwork and marketing resources will benefit the entire national MarketMaker network of states. There are many other tales of innovative and collaborative FSMIP projects, and this year’s projects are no different.  More than half of the 22 projects focus on increasing sales of meat products, aquaculture products, and fresh and processed produce in local and regional food systems. Other research topics include forestry, bioenergy and horticulture. I’m sure that over the next few years—as these great ideas continue to build and have a positive impact on American agriculture—we’ll have even more success stories to share.

"Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiative Coordinator, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Nov 03,  Lesser prairie-chickens benefit from lands where a rancher is using prescribed grazing, according to a new report. Photo courtesy of Nick Richter. Habitat conservation practices make a difference for lesser prairie-chickens. That's the finding of a recent scientific study – the first part of a multi-year study – described in a new report from the Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiative (LPCI). LPCI, led by USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), works with partner organizations and ranchers to improve habitat and address threats to the bird. Since , more than 1 million acres of habitat have been restored on working lands. NRCS works with partners to monitor the outcomes, which helps determine if conservation practices are making a difference, but accurately estimating wildlife populations can be challenging with uncommon, widely dispersed species like the lesser prairie-chicken. A recent study identified a new model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, and it shows encouraging evidence that NRCS-recommended conservation practices through LPCI are working and that large blocks of intact prairie are important to prairie-chicken conservation. The study assessed one year of from the annual aerial survey of lesser prairie-chicken lek sites conducted by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and it looked at four factors that might impact site occupancy — patch size of native vegetation, percent of land cover managed with prescribed grazing; percent of land cover enrolled in USDA’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); and density of primary roads. The research team intends to continue with a multi-year study that assesses additional variables. As the amount of land enrolled in CRP or using prescribed grazing increases, the likelihood that lesser prairie-chickens will occupy that land also increases. Lesser prairie-chickens face many threats, including habitat loss and fragmentation from row-crop agriculture, fire suppression, unmanaged grazing, development, and drought. The species currently occupies just 16 percent of its historic range. But in western Kansas, lesser prairie-chickens have reoccupied portions of their historical range and have even moved into areas outside that historical range. The range expansion coincides with former croplands enrolled and maintained as grasslands through CRP as well as native grasslands managed using LPCI prescribed grazing practices. A team of researchers tested whether there was a quantifiable link between land where ranchers are implementing LPCI prescribed grazing plans or have enrolled their land in CRP and the likelihood of prairie-chickens occupying a landscape. Their results indicate that these habitat conservation efforts are working. After developing an expanded model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, the team found that occupancy increases as prairie patch-size increases, as well as in landscapes with ongoing conservation practices. Specifically, the results indicate that when ranchers are using prescribed grazing or enrolling land in CRP, the likelihood of lesser prairie-chickens occupying that habitat increases significantly. The report’s management recommendations include: Enrolling acreage within the lesser prairie-chicken active range in prescribed grazing or CRP. Maintaining large blocks of native prairie across the range through sustainable ranching. Identifying potential landscapes with willing landowners to develop conservation easements, particularly if combined with prescribed grazing and other proven habitat conservation practices. Implementing prescribed grazing on dispersed patches throughout large blocks of rangeland. Cultivating diverse stands of CRP-enrolled grasslands that serve as connective tissue to larger patches of native prairie. Retaining CRP acreage as grasslands after contract expiration. NRCS outlined its three-year conservation strategy for lesser prairie-chicken conservation, which encourages adoption of many of the above recommendations on 500,000 additional acres, such as prescribed grazing, using easements to protect key habitat corridors, and providing assistance to convert expiring CRP lands to grazing.

"New Study Offers Sage Advice  For many, one of the New Year’s first big chores is to remove a tree from inside their home. Trees, beautiful and useful as they are, do not belong everywhere. Such is the case with trees and other woody species that are expanding into the Western grasslands. Over the years, woody species like juniper, pinyon pine, redcedar and mesquite have encroached on grassland and sagebrush ecosystems, altering these landscapes and making them unsuitable for native wildlife like the lesser prairie-chicken and greater sage-grouse. Encroaching conifers also degrade rangelands for agricultural producers whose livestock rely on nutritious forage.  Spencer Miller, Natural Resources Conservation Service  Posted in  Conservation  Jan 18,   3 Responses",What is the impact of encroaching conifers and mesquite trees on Western grasslands?,"The impact of encroaching conifers (such as juniper, pinyon pine, and redcedar) and mesquite trees on Western grasslands is that they alter these landscapes, making them unsuitable for native wildlife and degrading rangelands for agricultural producers.","The impact of encroaching conifers (such as pine, fir, and spruce) and mesquite trees on Western grasslands is significant and far-reaching. Here are some of the main effects: **Ecological Changes** 1. **Loss of native grasses**: Conifers and mesquite trees shade out and compete with native grasses for water and nutrients, leading to a decline in their populations. 2. **Habitat fragmentation**: The growth of conifers and mesquite creates dense thickets that isolate small areas of native vegetation, making it difficult for wildlife to move through the landscape. 3. **Reduced biodiversity**: As native grasses disappear, so do the animals that rely on them for food and shelter. **Climatic Changes** 1. **Increased fire risk**: The buildup of fuels (such as dead leaves and branches) under coniferous canopies creates a high risk of catastrophic wildfires. 2. **Altered hydrology**: The growth of mesquite trees changes the water cycle, leading to reduced soil moisture and increased evapotranspiration. **Economic Impacts** 1. **Loss of forage and grazing land**: As native grasses decline, so does the quality and quantity of forage available for livestock. 2. **Decreased recreational value**: The encroachment of conifers and mesquite can make Western grasslands less attractive to outdoor enthusiasts, such as hunters, hikers, and campers. **Social Impacts** 1. **Cultural heritage loss**: The transformation of native grasslands into dense woodlands can erase the cultural heritage and traditional knowledge of Native American communities. 2. **Community values affected**: Changes in land use and ecosystem function can impact local economies, community cohesion, and overall quality of life. **Management Challenges** 1. **Restoration and management costs**: Efforts to restore native grasses and control invasive conifers and mesquite require significant financial resources. 2. **Coordination among stakeholders**: Effective management requires collaboration among landowners, managers, scientists, and local communities. The combined effects of encroaching conifers and mesquite trees on Western grasslands pose significant ecological, climatic, economic, social, and management challenges.",0.0404609661791869,0.15160349854227403,0.07038123167155426,0.13411078717201166,0.8512907028198242
"Chief, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Sep 22,  Utah rancher Bill Kennedy worked with NRCS through SGI to improve his working rangelands for sage grouse and livestock. Photo by Jesse Bussard. This past April, we woke up at 3 a.m. and made our way to a blind amid an expanse of sagebrush on a ranch in central Montana. When the sun rose that morning, I saw my first sage grouse--actually, I got to see more than 100 of them!--when the birds arrived at the lek site for their famous tail-shaking springtime courtship dance. Seeing sage grouse in action reminded me how important it is to do what we do here at USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). I saw firsthand how agriculture and wildlife can co-exist and thrive. In the West, we work with over 1,300 ranchers through the NRCS-led Sage Grouse Initiative (SGI) to improve their ranching operations while also helping this iconic bird. It’s been a big year for sage grouse. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) determined last year that the species didn’t merit protections under the Endangered Species Act because of the collaborative conservation efforts underway to help the species. Central to that effort were ranchers, who have stepped forward for many years to make a difference. But last year’s decision did not mean we slowed down our conservation work through SGI. We’re here for the long haul, building on previous successes by implementing our Sage Grouse Initiative 2.rategy, which will conserve an estimated 8 million acres of sagebrush—along with 350+ species that depend on it--by . Sage grouse are an “umbrella species” and an icon of the Western range. When ranchers implement conservation practices that benefit sage grouse, those practices also benefit 350-plus sagebrush-dependent species. Photo by Tatiana Gettelman. With the help of conservation partners, NRCS has conserved 5 million acres of sagebrush rangeland and reduced threats to sage grouse. In the past six years, SGI and ranchers have: Reduced the threat of invasive grasses and wildfire by managing for healthier rangelands on 1.8 million acres. Removed 457,000 acres of expanding conifer to reclaim core sage grouse habitat. Protected 451,000 acres of agricultural land and prime wildlife habitat for 350-plus sagebrush-dependent species. Improved grazing strategies to enhance range habitat on more than 2.7 million acres for sage grouse and other wildlife species. Conserved 12,000 acres and improved 179 acres of wet meadow and riparian areas for brooding hens. Marked or moved 628 miles of high-risk fences to reduce sage grouse collisions by 83 percent. We continue to fine-tune our conservation efforts through science and research. In the past year, we’ve documented how removing encroaching juniper to restore sagebrush benefits songbirds as well as sage grouse. We’ve also studied how and where to reduce the risk of converting sagebrush into cultivated cropland, which we made available on the new SGI Interactive Web Application. This new online mapping tool provides free on rangewide conditions, helping NRCS conservationists and partners plan and prioritize conservation projects. Plus, we now use our successful efforts in sagebrush country as a model for the rest of the country. We are applying what we’ve learned to other priority species and landscapes to replicate success through Working Lands for Wildlife (WLFW). The future of wildlife, agriculture and rural ways of life depend on this shining model of collaborative conservation. SGI uses science, research and tools to improve and fine-tune conservation efforts. Photo by Tatiana Gettelman.  If there’s one thing we’ve learned, it's that, together, we can make a difference. We’re proud of our collective past achievements and look forward to continuing our work with America’s producers to conserve landscapes for future generations.

"Branch Chief, Farmers Market and Direct Market Research Branch, AMS in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Dec 17,  Shed Two at Detroit’s Eastern Market Look up Wayne County, Michigan, home to Detroit, in USDA’s Food Environment Atlas and it is obvious that local residents have some significant challenges in accessing healthful food.  An alarmingly high number of households that lack a car in Wayne County are located further than one mile from the closest grocery store, meaning that many families struggle to get access to fresh and healthy food.   Indeed, the closure of two supermarkets in left Detroit as the largest city in the country without a single full-service supermarket within its boundaries. A recent study indicates that over half a million of Detroit’s residents live in neighborhoods where they must travel twice as far to reach a grocery store than they do to reach a convenience store. As a result, many families are forced to buy their meals at these convenience stores, where microwavable pre-prepared meals and fast food are well-stocked, and fresh and healthy foods are often hard to find. Detroit, in other words, is a food desert. But, there is good news! Eastern Market Corporation, one of the nation’s longest operating public markets has taken on the challenge of addressing Detroit’s significant food access issues. Eastern Market has developed a comprehensive “food hub,”  coordinating aggregation and distribution for many of Michigan’s small and mid-size farmers who are producing the healthy food that Motor City residents need and want.  With nearly 500,000 of Wayne County’s 1.9 million residents relying on SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) for their food purchases, the market director knew that it was important to ensure that his organization could process SNAP benefits. Today, Eastern Market processes up to $30,000 of SNAP transactions per month.  What’s more, SNAP benefits redeemed at Eastern Market are doubled for each participating household with the support of the Fair Food Network, an organization that provides a financial match to SNAP redemptions through its Double Up Food Bucks program. As part of the USDA’s interest in examining  how actively coordinated food hubs can play an important role in eradicating food deserts, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service has partnered with Eastern Market through a cooperative research agreement to expand the availability of fresh, healthful  and locally-produced food throughout Detroit.  Our to-do list includes: Developing more direct-to-consumer marketing activities in neighborhoods challenged by poor public transportation systems; Training farm vendors  about emerging opportunities for direct-to-consumer sales in food desert neighborhoods; Facilitating deliveries between the region’s local growers and organizations who are dedicated to distributing fresh, healthful food directly to Detroit’s neighborhoods in need; and, Educating local residents about available nutrition assistance programs and emerging market outlets. As a food hub, Eastern Market is uniquely positioned to serve all people in Detroit while economic benefits to local farmers, ranchers, and dairies.  Eastern Market and its member tenants provide a bevy of wholesale services that open new markets for the region’s small and midsize producers—including aggregation, distribution, processing and commercial market opportunities.  Eastern Market also houses prepared food businesses (like ravioli and fresh salsa).  They’re even planning to redevelop a full square mile in a dedicated economic development district to bring in additional business incubators, restaurants, retailers, wholesale services and a distribution center – all designed to help rebuild southeast Michigan’s regional food system and eliminate Detroit’s food access problems. By integrating all of these diverse business functions into one centralized, coordinated regional “food hub,” Eastern Market’s business development model can be expected to bring good things to Detroit.

"Celebrating American Agriculture: All USDA Foods are Local to Someone  March is National Nutrition Month. Throughout the month, USDA will be highlighting results of our efforts to improve access to safe, healthy food for all Americans and supporting the health of our next generation.  Fish and fowl, sowing and reaping, nutrition and agriculture… certain words and concepts naturally go hand in hand, and March is a month to celebrate both the foundation and purpose of the American food system. With March designated as National Nutrition Month and March 15 as National Agriculture Day, the time is ripe to reflect on healthy eating goals and to express gratitude for the farmers, fishers, and ranchers who provide the foods to fuel our nation. USDA’s Food Distribution Programs work at the intersection of nutrition and agriculture. Each year, USDA purchases more than 2 billion pounds of food worth nearly $2 billion from American farmers and distributes the food to schools, food banks, Indian Tribal Organizations, disaster feeding organizations, and other charitable institutions and feeding organizations. The programs benefit both ends of the food chain by supporting local agriculture and the economy while also providing a nutrition safety net for vulnerable Americans.

These programs work together to provide a safety net for vulnerable Americans by: * Supporting access to nutritious food through SNAP and school meal programs * Promoting local agriculture through FMPP, NSLP/SBP, and CFP * Enhancing food security and nutrition education through the Gus Schumacher Food and Agriculture Service Learning Program These USDA initiatives demonstrate a comprehensive approach to addressing both hunger and food insecurity, while also supporting local farmers and rural communities.",5.369753552422115e-232,0.03663003663003663,0.014760147601476014,0.03663003663003663,0.8302018046379089
"Got Weeds? Need to hold water in the soil? Mulch can help with these things and more. Mulching is one of the simplest and most beneficial practices you can use in the garden. Mulch is simply a protective layer of a material that is spread on top of the soil. Mulches can either be organic -- such as grass clippings, straw, bark chips, and similar materials -- or inorganic -- such as stones, brick chips, and plastic. Both organic and inorganic mulches have numerous benefits. Mulch helps conserve and extend available water, protects the soil from erosion, reduces competition by suppressing weeds, moderates temperature extremes, and acts as a barrier or visible marker of gardening beds to limit damage by landscape maintenance equipment. Understanding when, what type and how much mulch to spread is important because spreading too much mulch can be damaging to trees and plants.

"What is composting? Composting is the process of recycling organic materials into an amendment that can be used to enrich soil and plants. Types of Compost Bins Typical Compost Bin Tumbler Compost Bin Worm Compost Bin Why Compost? Food scraps and yard waste currently make up 20 to 30 percent of what we throw away. USDA is fighting food waste and you can too. Composting is nature’s way of recycling! Here are a few reasons to get started today:  Feed the soil without using chemical fertilizers.  Keep food waste out of the landfills and prevent greenhouse gas emissions.  Conserve water by building healthy soils. Get Started There are different ways to get started composting today. You can start a backyard composting bin or use worms to do the work. Backyard composting in three easy steps:  Choose a location. A good site is dry in either the sun or partial shade.  Set-up your compost bin. Purchase a compost bin or create an inexpensive bin with wire mesh and 3-4 poles for support.  Get composting. Include 2-3 parts “brown material” (fall leaves, twigs, shredded newspaper, straw, wood chips, and shredded wood) and 1 part “green material” (vegetable and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, crushed eggshells, garden and grass clippings, tea bags without staples) by volume then add water to keep moist. Don’t forget to turn your pile! A monthly rotation is a good rule of thumb. Worm Composting Setup:  Select Container. Purchase a worm bin or make your own from a plastic or wood storage container. Worm bins require holes drilled for aeration and drainage. There are several online sources with instructions to create a worm bin.  Locate bin. The ideal temperature for worm composting is 59-77 degrees F. The bin can be kept indoors or outdoors in the shade. During colder months, insulate the worm bin with blankets, straw, or other material to keep it warm.  Worm Bin Setup:  Worms need bedding such as a mixture of non-glossy paper, cardboard, or leaves. Soak the material for 10 minutes, wring out the water so it is moist but not saturated, and place it in the bin with a handful of soil.  Now you are ready to add your worms. There are over 9,000 species of earthworms, but only 7 are suitable for vermicomposting. The most widely used species is the “red wiggler” which you can buy from a worm grower. Do not use worms from a bait shop or your garden since they will not be able to thrive in your worm bin.  Feed your worms veggie and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, eggshells, and moistened bread. Avoid meat, fish, dairy products, citrus fruits, twigs and branches.

Considering these differences, both methods are suitable for reducing food waste. However, vermicomposting is more ideal for homeowners who: * Have limited outdoor space * Want to reduce odors and pests associated with traditional composting * Can maintain a consistent temperature in their worm bin * Are willing to invest time and effort in managing the worms and their diet For homeowners looking to reduce food waste, either method can be effective. However, if you're short on outdoor space or prefer a more hands-off approach, vermicomposting might be the better choice.","**Backyard Composting vs. Vermicomposting (Worm Composting): Key Differences** 1. **Process:** Backyard composting involves decomposing organic materials like leaves, grass clippings, and kitchen scraps using microorganisms like bacteria and fungi. In contrast, vermicomposting relies on worms to break down food waste into a nutrient-rich compost. 2. **Location:** Backyard composting requires a designated area outdoors, often in a corner of the yard or attached to the home. Vermicomposting can be done indoors or outdoors, but it typically uses a worm bin that is more compact and odor-free. 3. **Materials:** Backyard composting accepts a broader range of materials, including meat, bones, and oils. Vermicomposting primarily focuses on vegetable scraps, fruit peels, coffee grounds, tea bags, and other organic waste. 4. **Maintenance:** Backyard composting often requires more maintenance, such as turning the pile regularly to ensure adequate aeration and decomposition. Vermicomposting is relatively low-maintenance, with worms doing most of the work. 5. **Resulting Compost:** The resulting compost from backyard composting can be coarser and have a higher carbon-to-nitrogen ratio compared to vermicomposting compost. **Suitability for Homeowners** Considering these differences, vermicomposting (worm composting) is often more suitable for homeowners looking to reduce their food waste. Here's why: * **Space:** Vermicomposting requires less space and can be done indoors or outdoors, making it ideal for small backyards or urban areas. * **Odor Control:** Worms are efficient at breaking down organic matter, minimizing unpleasant odors and messes. * **Year-Round Composting:** Vermicomposting can operate year-round, regardless of temperature fluctuations or seasonal changes in food waste generation. * **Nutrient-Rich Compost:** The compost produced through vermicomposting is rich in nutrients, making it an excellent natural fertilizer for gardens and indoor plants. By choosing the right method, homeowners can efficiently manage their food waste, reduce environmental impact, and create a nutrient-rich compost for their garden or indoor plants.",0.035114397121708774,0.408695652173913,0.12227074235807861,0.19130434782608693,0.8679261803627014

In the hustle and bustle of working for the WIC program in the Southwest Region, I travel quite often, attending meetings and ensuring logistics much like many of my fellow federal and state co-workers. Recently I had the privilege to attend the Pottawatomie County Farmers Market five-year anniversary in Shawnee, OK. Having grown up in a very rural town, representing FNS was a learning experience that reminded me of home. The event was a total success, as the market was full of people including farmers, seniors, families and children. Celebrating five years of service, the event included live music, family and children’s activities, and most important of all: fresh fruit and vegetables. I learned that famers drive hours to sell their crops at the market, and it accounts for as much as over two-thirds of their income. Most farmers market customers swear by the produce bought there, as it is much fresher and lasts longer than normal store-bought produce. In some cases, supermarket produce makes a week-long journey of over 1,500 miles before getting into the kitchen. But the most important part was seeing FNS programs like WIC and SNAP EBT represented. All of the farmers were knowledgeable about Farm to School and Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food, and have even started farm tours for children and have working relationships with local schools. Getting fresh vegetables in school cafeterias straight from the farm is great on so many levels! Observing our partnerships at the grassroots stage from farmer to a customer, or farmer to a school sets a tone for the whole region. The relationships I see built are ones that last for years, and I wish the Farmers Market all the best in their future endeavors. Here’s to another five years of successful farming and selling!

"Cover Crops Cover crops are traditionally planted on farms but can be used in gardens. A cover crop is any crop grown to cover the soil and may be incorporated into the soil later for enrichment. Planting cover crops in your garden provides multiple benefits such as controlling erosion, suppressing weeds, reducing soil compaction, increasing moisture and nutrient content of soil, improving yield potential, attracting pollinators, and providing habitat for beneficial insects and wildlife as well as food to animals. Cover crops (grasses, legumes and forbs) recommended for seasonal cover and other conservation purposes include annual ryegrass, oilseed radish, winter cereal rye, and oats used for scavenging unused fertilizer and releasing nutrients back into the soil for the next crop to use. Good cover crops to break up compacted soils are forage radish (also known as oilseed radish) and forage turnip. Similar to commercial nitrogen (N) fertilizers, legume cover crops like crimson clover, hairy vetch and Austrian winter pea can help “grow” some of your N needs. Crop Rotation It has long been a common practice for farmers to vary the crops grown in each field from year to year. This same practice of rotating crops can be applied to small-scale food gardens. Make a plan to grow certain plant families in one area of the garden this season and in a different area next season. For crop rotation to be most effective, don’t plant an area with vegetables from the same plant family more than once every three to four years. Rotating crops can have important production benefits such as increasing yields, improving nutrients and organic matter in the soil, and it can help disrupt the lifecycle of crop pests, reducing chemical use. Don’t forget to add a cover crop to your rotation –especially when the garden is fallow –to reduce soil erosion and improve wildlife habitat.

"Posted by the Food Safety Research Information Office, National Agricultural Library in  Health and Safety  USDA Results  Jul 29,  USDA’s National Agricultural Library launches its latest Web exhibit “How Did We Can?” on home canning in the United States. July is the height of summer grilling season, and throughout the month USDA is highlighting changes made to the U.S. food safety system over the course of this Administration. For an interactive look at USDA’s work to ensure your food is safe, visit the USDA Results project on Medium.com and read Chapter Seven: Safer Food and Greater Consumer Confidence. The USDA’s National Agricultural Library (NAL) recently launched its newest online exhibit, “How Did We Can? —The Evolution of Home Canning Practices.” The exhibit follows the evolution of home canning in the United States and the progression of associated food safety . Canning aids in food preservation by removing microorganisms responsible for decay through heating and creating a seal to prevent recontamination. Home canning held an important role in 20th century food preservation, particularly through the two World Wars, and continues to be practiced today. “How Did We Can?” highlights changes in home canning based on a growing understanding of bacteriology. Around the turn of the 20th century, the four most prominent canning techniques were oven, open-kettle, water bath, and pressure canning. By the end of World War II, the USDA recommended only two techniques: water bath for high-acid foods and pressure canning for low-acid foods. Those recommendations remain the same under the current USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning. During World War I and World War II, canning was touted as being imperative to the war effort on the home front and was referred to as “a real war job” in a Office of War Information poster. Home canning peaked during World War II when over four billion cans were processed in . While home canning has never since reached such a height, it continues to thrive today among home food preservation enthusiasts.

"High-Tech Agriculture Continues to Reap Rewards for Farmers and Society  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Just like a smart phone helps users learn, communicate and make important decisions, smart technology—known as precision agriculture—helps farmers know and apply critical information about the right investments in fertilizer, seed, pesticide and water needed to produce their crops. Through new technologies, farmers produce more efficiently and see an increase in profits while improving stewardship of ecosystems and local communities. To talk about precision agriculture is to talk about mapping the amount of a crop grown per acre (yield) or the types of soils in a given area. It also includes the technology that automatically guides farm machines and controls variables like the rates of seeds, fertilizers or chemicals.  Seth Murray, Senior Advisor for Agricultural Systems, Office of the Chief Scientist  Posted in  Research and Science  Technology  Nov 08,   2 Responses","What investments in fertilizer, seed, and chemicals are most effectively guided by precision agriculture technologies to promote efficient crop production, improve stewardship of ecosystems, and increase farmer profits?",* Fertilizers * Seed * Pesticides,"Precision agriculture (PA) technologies can guide effective investments in fertilizer, seed, and chemicals through various methods. Here are some specific examples: **Fertilizer Investments:** 1. **Variable Rate Application (VRA)**: PA allows for the precise application of fertilizers based on soil type, crop stage, and nutrient requirements. This approach minimizes waste and maximizes efficiency. 2. **Soil Sensors**: Soil sensors can detect nutrient deficiencies or excesses, enabling farmers to adjust fertilizer applications accordingly. 3. **Precision Fertilizer Management (PFM)**: PFM systems use data from PA technologies like satellite imaging, drones, or soil sampling to optimize fertilizer application rates and timing. **Seed Investments:** 1. **Genetic Analysis**: PA enables the analysis of seed traits, such as disease resistance or drought tolerance, to select the most suitable varieties for specific growing conditions. 2. **Precision Planting**: This technology uses sensors or GPS-guided planters to place seeds at optimal spacing and depth, reducing waste and improving germination rates. **Chemical Investments:** 1. **Variable Rate Application (VRA) of Pesticides**: PA technologies can guide the precise application of pesticides based on crop stage, pest density, and weather conditions. 2. **Precision Weed Management**: PA enables farmers to identify weed species, estimate densities, and apply targeted herbicide applications, reducing chemical usage. To promote efficient crop production, improve stewardship of ecosystems, and increase farmer profits, investments in fertilizer, seed, and chemicals should be guided by: 1. **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: Using data from PA technologies, such as satellite imaging, drones, or soil sensors, to inform decision-making. 2. **Integrating Multiple Technologies**: Combining different PA tools, like VRA and precision planting, to optimize crop production and reduce environmental impact. 3. **Farm-Scale Monitoring**: Implementing monitoring systems at the farm scale to track fertilizer, seed, and chemical usage, as well as crop yields and soil health. By adopting these strategies, farmers can: * Optimize resource usage (e.g., fertilizers, seeds, chemicals) * Improve crop yields and quality * Reduce environmental impact (e.g., water pollution, soil degradation) * Increase profit margins through efficient production methods",5.660107365481189e-232,0.01829268292682927,0.0061349693251533735,0.01829268292682927,0.7877321243286133
"Posted by the Food Safety Research Information Office, National Agricultural Library in  Initiatives  Health and Safety  Nov 21,  USDA Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) microbiologist Monifa Peterson demonstrates the addition of reagents for an E. coli non-O157:H7 analysis. Food is necessary and can be quite enjoyable, but it must also be safe to eat. Unfortunately, about one out of six Americans gets sick from eating contaminated food at some point during the year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scientists from USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) work for one of the federal agencies that conducts research to help make the foods we eat safer. To help the public more easily access USDA food safety research information, the department’s National Agricultural Library’s Food Safety Research Information Office (FSRIO) has launched a new “Meet the Experts” online video collection available on the NAL website. FSRIO has collected videos from a variety of sources and organized them in one repository. Current videos highlight ARS food safety research. FSRIO will add other videos to the collection that highlights research and food safety efforts from across USDA agencies. Many foods must travel through different points between the farm and your plate.  Lettuce, for example, is harvested from the field, cooled, processed and packaged, then transported to your grocery store where it is displayed in a cooler waiting for someone to buy it, transport it home or to a restaurant where it finally gets prepared and eaten.  ARS scientists in the produce-safety videos discuss how their research is improving the safety of that lettuce all through its journey to the grocery display cooler.

"US Forest Service Mobilizes to Save Cavity Birds  Small owls, such as western screech and northern saw whet owls, weigh between 3 and 7 ounces, or about the same weight as a small cell phone or a deck of cards. They prefer dark, narrow spaces for nesting and roosting, which is why they are called cavity birds. Their habitat preferences make them prone to using man-made features, such as open pipes, that mimic their natural nesting and roosting cavities. But on some public lands, that natural act of finding habitat in ventilation pipes has led to their death.

However, it is stated that the Forest Service averages 23 million visits annually to ski areas, contributing $3 billion to local economies annually and creating approximately 65,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal jobs.","A great question about skiing and local economies! According to the US Forest Service (USFS), it's estimated that around 7-10% of National Forest System lands in the United States are used for skiable areas. These areas, also known as ""ski areas,"" include ski resorts, cross-country ski trails, snowshoeing routes, and other winter recreation opportunities. As for economic benefits, the impact of ski resorts on local communities can be significant. Here are some statistics: * Ski resorts in National Forests generate an estimated $1 billion to $2 billion in annual revenue. * Each dollar invested in a ski resort returns approximately 3-4 dollars in economic benefit to the surrounding community (Source: USFS). * Ski areas support thousands of jobs, both directly and indirectly, through employment at ski resorts, lodging facilities, restaurants, equipment rental shops, and other businesses that cater to winter recreation enthusiasts. * A study by the National Ski Areas Association found that for every $100 spent on lift tickets, $50 goes back into the local economy in the form of wages, taxes, and goods/services purchases.

"A U.S. Forest Service Ranger Sees Wilderness as the Ultimate Yardstick  For most of his 16 years with the U.S. Forest Service, Dave Warnack spent them boots-on-the-ground. That’s to say that he does not just talk the talk. “Wilderness will be the ultimate index by which I measure my status, progress and overall place in the world,” Warnack says in the film “Wilderness: The Ultimate Yardstick. “I say this because when you enter a wilderness alone, unsupported, you quickly realize that the wilderness doesn’t care about you. It doesn’t care about the grades you got in school. It doesn’t care about your medals, your degrees or the size of your salary. The first time you measure yourself by the yardstick of wilderness, you may quickly find that you are, indeed, very small and perhaps inconsequential.”  Kathryn Sosbe, Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Nov 07,   2 Responses",What does entering wilderness alone and unsupported reveal about one's place in the world?,"Entering wilderness alone and unsupported reveals that one is ""very small and perhaps inconsequential"" according to Dave Warnack.","Entering wilderness alone and unsupported can be a transformative experience that reveals various aspects of one's character, worldview, and relationship with nature. Here are some possible insights: 1. **Vulnerability and humility**: Venturing into the wilderness without support or guidance exposes you to the uncertainties of nature. This vulnerability can foster a sense of humility, as you confront your own limitations and dependence on external resources. 2. **Self-reliance and resourcefulness**: In the absence of external help, you must rely on yourself to navigate the terrain, find food and shelter, and deal with emergencies. This experience can highlight your ability to adapt, think critically, and take responsibility for your actions. 3. **Connection with nature**: Alone in the wilderness, you develop a deeper appreciation for the natural world. You may notice patterns, observe wildlife, or experience the beauty of untouched landscapes. This connection can instill a sense of awe, respect, and gratitude for the intricate web of life. 4. **Emotional resilience**: Wilderness travel often presents unexpected challenges, such as inclement weather, injuries, or encounters with wildlife. These experiences can help you build emotional resilience, learn to cope with uncertainty, and develop a growth mindset. 5. **Interdependence and social connections**: Despite venturing alone, your experience may lead you to reflect on the importance of interdependence and social connections. You might realize that even in solitude, your actions impact others (e.g., fellow travelers, park rangers) or consider how your relationships with others support your personal growth. 6. **Perspective on life's priorities**: Being immersed in nature can prompt introspection about what truly matters to you. As you confront the simplicity and beauty of wilderness living, you may reassess your values and priorities, recognizing that some aspects of modern life are not essential to your well-being or happiness. 7. **Resilience and adaptability in adversity**: Wilderness travel without support requires flexibility and resourcefulness in the face of adversity. This experience can help you develop coping strategies for navigating challenges, build confidence in your ability to overcome obstacles, and appreciate the value of perseverance.

"AMS Administrator in  Research and Science  May 16,  Pictured here with his pet rooster, March, Lue Gim Gong’s work with citrus trees helped develop a frost-tolerant orange after a disastrous winter in Florida. No one should live in this world for himself alone, but to do good for those who come after him. These are the words that Lue Gim Gong lived by.  When he was only 12 years old, Lue left his home and farmer parents in Canton, China and crossed the Pacific Ocean to America.  He lived and worked in San Francisco until he was 16, and then moved to Massachusetts to take a job at the C.T. Sampson shoe factory. At church, Lue met Fannie Burlingame, the daughter of a wealthy farmer and merchant.  She immediately recognized his desire to learn and his natural talent with plants.   He eventually came to live with her family and they helped him become an American citizen in . Along with his green thumb, Lue had a knack for storytelling and a way with animals.  While his personality and desire to learn were larger than life, his body was frail and at some point in his youth he became very ill, possibly with tuberculosis.  His condition was made worse by the cold New England climate, so Fannie suggested he move to DeLand, Florida, where she and her sister owned a house and orchard. Working with William Dumville, Fannie’s brother-in-law, Lue planted orange trees and other fruits, immersing himself in the world of horticulture. In the winter of -95, Florida saw some of the worst freezes in recorded history.  Almost all of the citrus groves were lost—including the ones worked by Lue and Dumville.  Lue’s experiments in cross-pollination became focused on producing fruits that were more tolerant of cold weather. Fannie passed away in , leaving Lue the house and property in DeLand.  Devastated by the loss of “Mother Fannie,” Lue became a bit of an eccentric fixture in the small Florida community.  His pet rooster, March, and two horses named Baby and Fannie were his main companions, but his work with plant varieties continued. In , he was recognized for successfully cross-pollinated a “Hart’s Late” Valencia orange with a “Mediterranean Sweet” to produce a new orange named the “Lue Gim Gong.”  This sweet new variation, later found to be a nucellar seedling of the Valencia, ripened in the early fall and was much more resistant to the cold.  It is sold under the Valencia name today. His achievement won the Silver Wilder Medal, awarded by the American Pomological Society—the first such award for a citrus fruit. Lue also developed an apple that ripened a month earlier than other varieties, tomatoes that grew in clusters, and a peach that would ripen in late November.  His continued efforts with citrus plants also produced varieties of grapefruits that grew singularly (instead of in clumps), a cold-tolerant grapefruit that was slower to drop and a “perfumed” variety that had a heavy fragrance. Lue’s conviction to do lasting good changed the Florida citrus industry and broadened the seasonal range for many orchard-grown trees.  While his life was lived simply and mostly outside of the limelight, he certainly did his best to create something good for the generations of farmers that came after him. USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), celebrates the life of Lue Gim Gong and spirit of the words he lived by.

His notable achievement lies in developing a frost-tolerant orange variety, which greatly impacted the Florida citrus industry. In 1895, Lue Gim Gong successfully crossed a Mandarin seed with a Bahama seed to produce a new orange variety that was resistant to cold temperatures and frosts. This innovative breakthrough led to the creation of the 'Gim Gong' orange tree, which became a highly sought-after cultivar in Florida due to its exceptional tolerance to frost. As a result of Lue Gim Gong's work, the Florida citrus industry experienced substantial growth and development. The frost-tolerant orange variety he created enabled farmers to cultivate oranges with greater ease and reduced crop losses, making it possible for them to expand their operations and increase production. His discovery also helped establish Florida as a major player in the US citrus market. Lue Gim Gong's achievement is widely regarded as one of the most important contributions to the American citrus industry in the late 19th century.

"Be Fire Wise: Preparing Your Home for Wildfire Season  Very often, the difference between saving your home in a wild fire and losing it to the flames is pretty much determined by what you do to prepare your property. The U.S. Forest Service calls it being Fire Wise. I’ve had personal experience in the importance of clearing a wide perimeter around your property to deny fuel—dried wood, grass and trees—to a fire. Back about ten years ago my grandparents’ ranch house near the Cleveland National Forest in San Diego County was spared because of a 150-foot clear space between the flames and the house. And this wasn’t the first time that had happened.

"How Did We Can? - New Online Exhibit Looks Back  July is the height of summer grilling season, and throughout the month USDA is highlighting changes made to the U.S. food safety system over the course of this Administration. For an interactive look at USDA’s work to ensure your food is safe, visit the USDA Results project on Medium.com and read Chapter Seven: Safer Food and Greater Consumer Confidence. The USDA’s National Agricultural Library (NAL) recently launched its newest online exhibit, “How Did We Can? —The Evolution of Home Canning Practices.” The exhibit follows the evolution of home canning in the United States and the progression of associated food safety . Canning aids in food preservation by removing microorganisms responsible for decay through heating and creating a seal to prevent recontamination. Home canning held an important role in 20th century food preservation, particularly through the two World Wars, and continues to be practiced today. “How Did We Can?” highlights changes in home canning based on a growing understanding of bacteriology. Around the turn of the 20th century, the four most prominent canning techniques were oven, open-kettle, water bath, and pressure canning. By the end of World War II, the USDA recommended only two techniques: water bath for high-acid foods and pressure canning for low-acid foods. Those recommendations remain the same under the current USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning.  the Food Safety Research Information Office, National Agricultural Library  Posted in  Health and Safety  USDA Results  Jul 29,   1 Response","What is the primary method through which canning aids in food preservation, as described in the ""How Did We Can?"" online exhibit?",The primary method through which canning aids in food preservation is by removing microorganisms responsible for decay through heating and creating a seal to prevent recontamination.,"The primary method through which canning aids in food preservation, as described in the ""How Did We Can?"" online exhibit, is the removal of air from the container. This process, known as aseptic processing, involves using a heat sterilization process to kill off any bacteria that may be present on the food and in the container itself. The food is then sealed in an airtight container, which prevents new bacteria from entering and eliminates the risk of spoilage. In more detail, canning relies on three main principles: heating, vacuum sealing, and sterilization. Heat kills off any existing bacteria or spores that may be present on the food, while the vacuum created by removing air from the container removes oxygen, which in turn prevents new bacterial growth. This combination of heat and airtight sealing allows for long-term preservation without refrigeration, making canned goods a staple in many cuisines around the world.",0.060293575077124774,0.23728813559322032,0.12571428571428572,0.1807909604519774,0.8820563554763794
"How Does Wildlife Respond When Forest Management Helps to Reduce Wildfire Risk?  Forest managers in the western United States often face difficult choices when it comes to reducing wildfire hazards while also maintaining wildlife habitat in forests that have changed dramatically in the last century. The U.S. Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station and partners are working to find the balance between forest restoration and habitat conservation in a new era of forest management.  Stephanie Worley Firley, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Mar 26,   Respond to this story",What is the optimal approach for balancing forest restoration with wildlife habitat conservation in forests that have been altered by human activities and climate change?,"The optimal approach is to find a balance between reducing wildfire hazards through forest management and maintaining wildlife habitat, taking into account changing conditions.","Unfortunately, there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to this complex question. However, I can provide you with a comprehensive framework for balancing forest restoration with wildlife habitat conservation. **Key Principles:** 1. **Integration**: Combine forest restoration goals with wildlife habitat conservation objectives. 2. **Contextual understanding**: Assess the specific forest ecosystem's history, vegetation structure, and wildlife populations to inform management decisions. 3. **Adaptive management**: Regularly monitor and adjust management strategies as new information becomes available or conditions change. **Step-by-Step Approach:** 1. **Conduct a thorough ecological assessment**: Identify the forest's natural composition, structure, and processes, as well as its altered state due to human activities and climate change. 2. **Establish clear objectives**: Define specific goals for forest restoration (e.g., improving biodiversity, enhancing ecosystem services) and wildlife habitat conservation (e.g., protecting key species, maintaining population viability). 3. **Prioritize conservation areas**: Identify critical wildlife habitats and prioritize their protection while also promoting forest restoration in surrounding areas. 4. **Use a multi-scale approach**: Balance the needs of individual trees, stands, and larger landscape units to ensure ecosystem integrity is maintained. 5. **Implement silviculture and habitat management techniques**: Employ practices like selective logging, thinning, or prescribed burning to promote forest regeneration while maintaining wildlife habitat quality. 6. **Engage stakeholders**: Involve local communities, indigenous peoples, scientists, and other stakeholders in the decision-making process to ensure that diverse perspectives are considered. 7. **Monitor and evaluate progress**: Regularly assess the effectiveness of management strategies and make adjustments as needed. **Tools and Techniques:** 1. **Remote sensing and GIS analysis**: Utilize spatial data to inform management decisions and track changes over time. 2. **Wildlife tracking and monitoring**: Employ techniques like camera traps, acoustic monitoring, or radio telemetry to monitor wildlife populations and behavior. 3. **Ecological modeling**: Develop predictive models to forecast the impacts of different management scenarios on forest ecosystem health and wildlife populations. 4. **Community-based management**: Foster partnerships with local communities to co-manage forests and promote sustainable land-use practices. **Additional Considerations:** 1. **Sustainability**: Ensure that forest restoration efforts are compatible with long-term climate change projections. 2. **Equity**: Address the social, cultural, and economic needs of local communities in the management process. 3. **Flexibility**: Be prepared to adapt management strategies as new information becomes available or conditions change.

"Public Affairs Specialist, APHIS in  Animals  Plants  Apr 16,  Delicious citrus: Scott Bauer, USDA Agricultural Research Service It’s time to grab those gloves and get outside for some gardening!  April is not only a great time to plant citrus trees, but it’s also Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month. Before wielding that shovel, take a few minutes to learn how to keep your trees healthy and prevent the spread of citrus disease. Citrus greening disease, also known as Huanglongbing (HLB), is one of the most severe plant diseases in the world. The disease has devastated millions of citrus trees in the United States and now has the potential to eliminate the citrus industry.  Once a tree is infected with the disease, there is no known cure. Citrus greening is spread by a bug the size of the head of a pin—the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP). When the bug feeds on an infected tree, it becomes a carrier, spreading the disease from one tree to another.  Although the disease is not harmful to humans, fruit from infected trees are not suitable for consumption because of their green color, misshapen appearance and bitter taste. Here are four tips to help get you started with citrus while preventing the spread of citrus greening disease: 1. Be Aware of Quarantines. If you are thinking about buying a citrus plant, be sure not to move it from quarantined states or territories. Not only are you risking spreading citrus diseases by transporting citrus outside of these areas, but it's also against the law. Review the quarantine map at SaveOurCitrus.org. 2. Check the Citrus Plant Supplier. Be a savvy buyer. Citrus plants sold in a regulated state must be sold from a certified vendor and be properly labeled.  3. Keep Homegrown Citrus at Home. Help reduce the spread of citrus diseases by not moving your homegrown citrus fruit or plants from quarantine areas. 4. Inspect Citrus Plants Regularly for Diseases and Insects. Visit our symptom checklist and corresponding photos to identify a plant impacted by ACP, citrus greening, citrus canker, citrus black spot and sweet orange scab. If you detect an infected plant, report it immediately. If you suspect your citrus may be diseased, report it immediately to the USDA.  The USDA’s Save Our Citrus iPhone App offers a convenient way for people to identify and report suspected citrus disease. This free app is available for download from the iTunes store.   To learn more about the Save Our Citrus program, visit www.saveourcitrus.org or follow the program on Facebook and Twitter. USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has declared April as Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month. Throughout the month, APHIS is posting a series of blog entries here and also share invasive plant pest and disease information through our twitter feed. APHIS and its federal and state partners are fighting to protect our communities, our public lands, and our agricultural resources from invasive species. But we can’t do it alone.

Report any suspicious findings to local authorities. 2. **Use clean equipment**: Use sterile pruning tools and do not use them on multiple trees unless they have been properly disinfected between uses. This will help prevent the spread of citrus greening through contaminated equipment. 3. **Prevent insect vectors from visiting your plants**: The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) is the primary vector for transmitting the greening disease. Keep your trees away from areas where ACPs are known to be present, and consider using a physical barrier or repellent around the base of your tree. 4. **Control weeds and debris near trees**: Weeds and plant debris can harbor insects that may spread citrus greening. Regularly remove any weeds and debris from around your trees, and keep the area clean and free of clutter. By following these four tips, you can significantly reduce the risk of spreading citrus greening disease when growing homegrown citrus.",8.76835308245613e-232,0.17167381974248927,0.017316017316017316,0.0944206008583691,0.8413286209106445
"Shoshone National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Nov 19,  Prince Albert II of Monaco poses in between Wapiti District Ranger Sue Stresser and Shoshone Forest Supervisor Joe Alexander. (U.S. Forest Service/ Kristie Salzmann) On a beautiful fall day on America’s first national forest, Prince Albert II of Monaco retraced the steps his great-grandfather took 100 years ago through the wilderness of the Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming. Prince Albert II helped celebrate on Sept. 20 the centennial anniversary of the hunting trip his great-grandfather, Prince Albert I, took with now-historic figures William “Buffalo Bill” Cody and Abraham Archibald Anderson, the first Special Superintendent of Forest Reserves. The successful hunting trip cemented lasting relationships between the men and established an area in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, which is still known today as Camp Monaco. The centennial celebration began with a morning horseback trail ride following a route very similar to one Prince Albert I took a century ago. A local outfitter and fly-fishing guide, Lee Livingston Outfitting Inc., guided Prince Albert II and his party through the changing leaves of the forest where they were greeted with splendid mountain views and a few grizzly bear sightings. The trail ride was followed by a luncheon at the Pahaska Tepee, Buffalo Bill Cody’s original hunting lodge on the Shoshone National Forest. While enjoying the splendor of the historic lodge, guests were treated to the history of the original hunting trip, as well as stories about Prince Albert I and Buffalo Bill Cody.

"Pacific Southwest Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jul 25,  Bob Goodwin, a former California Highway Patrol officer, now works for the U.S. Forest Service as a Tribal relations advisor. (U.S. Forest Service photo) During his 21 years as a California Highway Patrol officer, Bob Goodwin eased tensions during traffic accidents, issued verbal warnings and made arrests—all in a calm and cool way. Now, as Tribal relations advisor for the U.S. Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest Region, Goodwin is again relying on those valuable people and negotiating skills to build relations between Tribal entities and the federal government. Goodwin’s easy-going demeanor, “can do” attitude, and ability to resolve challenging issues make him perfect for the job. As tribal relations advisor, Goodwin, 50, who grew up in Northern California, provides advice and guidance to the regional forester on issues that concern Native Americans. He also works with the region’s national forests and ranger districts on projects that may have an effect on traditional, cultural sites. Goodwin is often called upon to ensure smooth relations when the interests of tribal entities and the Forest Service conflict. He is currently working with the tribes as the Forest Service implements the Forest Plan Revision on the region’s Inyo, Sequoia and Sierra national forests. The Forest Plan instructs the Forest Service on how to manage the resources of a national forest. While the issues have been challenging, Goodwin views the exercise as an opportunity for the Forest Service to strengthen relationships with its tribal partners. “My experiences with the (California Highway Patrol) got me into situations that were very stressful or difficult, where I had to look at all the possibilities on how these things could be resolved,” said Goodwin. Along with his experience with the highway patrol, Goodwin, who is an enrolled member of the Karuk Tribe part Karuk, was elected to the Karuk Tribal Council and served two four-year terms. Despite his tribal connection and experience, he was uncertain about applying for the position with the Forest Service because he wondered whether he could serve the needs of both the agency and the Tribes. But after careful consideration, he determined that his unique experience brings an understanding that would be valuable for both parties. Goodwin says he is particularly interested in protecting natural resources and developing stewardship opportunities for all tribes across the state. “Bob has first-hand experience from the tribal side which gives him a leg up in the job,” said Leaf Hillman, director of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy for the Karuk Tribe.  “He handles tough situations calmly and doesn’t get rattled.”  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Tags:  California  Forestry  FS  Inyo National Forest  Native Americans  OTR  Sequoia National Forest  Sierra National Forest  Tribal","What unique experience and perspective does Bob Goodwin, as a former Highway Patrol officer and Karuk tribal member, bring to his role as Tribal relations advisor for the U.S. Forest Service?","* His background as a calm and effective mediator in stressful situations during his time with the Highway Patrol * His personal connection to the Karuk Tribe through his tribal membership and past service on the Karuk Tribal Council * A firsthand understanding of both the federal agency's perspective and the needs of Native American communities This blend of experiences allows him to navigate complex relationships between the Forest Service and tribal entities, making him well-suited for his role.","Based on the context of Bob Goodwin's background and position, here is a clear answer: Bob Goodwin brings a unique experience and perspective to his role as Tribal Relations Advisor for the U.S. Forest Service due to his dual identity as both a former Highway Patrol officer and a Karuk tribal member.

"USDA Forest Service Chief in  USDA Results  Forestry  Nov 22,  Untreated ponderosa pine woodland compared to an area restored by the Greater Flagstaff Forest Partnership working with the Forest Service in on the Coconino National Forest in Arizona. While people have squabbled over the direction of federal forest management, many landscapes have declined. Take southwestern ponderosa pine, for example. Where thick grasses once waved under big orange-barked pines, thickets of spindly trees now threaten natural and human communities alike through outbreaks of insects and disease, followed by devastating fires. Now people are joining together around common conservation goals to restore landscapes like these. The U.S. Forest Service is working with partners to restore healthy watersheds capable of delivering all the values and benefits that Americans want and need. The goal is to restore landscapes that future generations will describe with the same awe inspired in the first European visitors. In Arizona, environmentalists, local officials, and others have coalesced behind a Forest Service initiative to furnish small-diameter materials from four overgrown national forests to local mills and bioenergy facilities. “I’m hoping to look back on this day as the official end of the forest wars,” said Todd Schulke of the Center for Biological Diversity. The time is right for a restoration economy. The Forest Service is tailoring its programs and projects to a new management environment associated with climate change, demographic growth, and other large-scale drivers of landscape changes that are undermining the health of America’s forests and grasslands. Restoration treatments are based on collaboration with stakeholders to achieve mutual goals across entire landscapes, leading to more jobs and a better future for forest-based communities hard hit by recession. A restoration economy will take time to develop. It will take years to establish confidence and mutual goodwill, overcoming lingering doubts and festering fears and suspicions. In time, however, Americans can unite to achieve their mutual restoration goals through landscape-scale conservation. Joining together, we can link ecological restoration to jobs and economic opportunities for communities across the nation, for the sake of generations to come.

"National Program Leader with the Division of Youth and 4-H, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  Oct 19,  Since its creation more than 100 years ago, 4-H has expanded its focus from the field to the lab to keep pace with developments in agricultural techniques and technologies. Photo courtesy of 4-H. National 4-H Week happens each October, a time when nearly six million youth celebrate their participation in 4-H.  Every year, clubs around the country showcase the great things that 4-H offers young people and highlight the incredible things they do to make a positive impact in their communities. The 4-H clover is one of the most recognized in the country, but it wasn’t always that way.  Like most things, it grew – this case from three leaves. The seeds of 4-H were planted at the start of the 20th century by several adults in different states who were concerned about young people. Clark County, Ohio, claims credit as being the birthplace of 4-H, although the initial groups were called “The Tomato Club” or the “Corn Club.” The times were ripe for a new youth innovation like 4-H. During the late s, public universities’ researchers saw that adults in the farming communities did not readily accept the new agricultural discoveries being developed on campuses, such as hybrid seed corn, milk sanitation and home canning procedures. However, they found that young people were open to new thinking. Rural youth programs became an innovative way to introduce new agricultural technology to their communities. In , Iowa school superintendents Jessie Field Shambaugh and O.H. Benson developed a 3-leaf clover pin with an “H” on each leaf to signify “head,” “heart,” and “hands.” In a meeting, club leaders approved the design of a 4-leaf clover with an H on each leaf, adding “health.” By , the groups were becoming known as 4-H clubs. Congress passed the Smith-Lever Act in , creating the Cooperative Extension System at USDA, which included work of various boys' and girls' clubs involved with agriculture, home economics and related subjects. This action effectively nationalized the 4-H program. Between and , clubs were formed at some historically black land-grant colleges in Southern states opening up 4-H to more African-American youth. As 4-H grew, its focus moved beyond the translation of science to include personal growth so that youth could gain skills to help them transition to adulthood in a contributing, productive and self-directed manner. With its national headquarters located within USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), today 4-H serves nearly 6 million youth in rural, urban and suburban communities in every state and many U.S. military installations around the world. Today’s 4-H’ers tackle the nation's top issues, from global food security, climate change and sustainable energy to childhood obesity and food safety. To improve the nation's ability to compete in key scientific fields and take on the leading challenges of the 21st century, 4-H programs offer a wide variety of science, engineering, technology and applied math educational opportunities, including agricultural sciences, rocketry, robotics, environmental protection and computer science.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Sep 08,  Victoria LeBeaux, national program leader with the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. Photo by Carlos Harris There is no one-size-fits-all approach to career development and, according to one of the nation’s new leaders in agriculture, the course one steers toward a profession in agriculture can be as varied and diverse as the population itself. “I’m not a big fan of the term ‘pipeline’ because it implies that there is only one way in and only one direction you can go,” said Dr. Victoria LeBeaux, a national program leader (NPL) with USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).  “If that were true I certainly wouldn’t be here, since I had no intention of studying agriculture.” As an undergraduate, she studied economics with the goal of working in international development. Prior to starting her doctorate in sustainable agriculture, LeBeaux lived in rural areas in France and Austria and volunteered in Mexico.  Iowa State University ultimately recruited her to complete doctoral training in a three-year NIFA-funded National Needs Fellowship (NNF) program. NNF trains students for masters and doctoral degrees. In some cases it also provides additional post-doctoral training for the Fellows.  For LeBeaux, that additional training meant a six-month stint in Guatemala where she examined how technical assistance providers helped enhance regional food security by advancing sustainable agriculture practices. LeBeaux returned to NIFA in after completing her Ph.D. and subsequent postdoctoral studies, and became an NPL in NIFA’s Division of Community and Education.  In that role she manages about $10 million in federal funding that supports secondary and postsecondary research, education and extension in the food, agricultural, and human sciences. These programs include the Educational Literacy Initiative’s Research and Extension for Undergraduates (REEU) fellowships program.  REEU provides experiential learning opportunities for underrepresented and first-generation college students. In addition, she uses her scientific training to represent NIFA in federal initiatives like USDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food, which helps coordinate USDA programs to strengthen local and regional food networks nationwide. “I sincerely appreciate the opportunities provided though the NNF program,” she said.  “As with many other young people, pursuing doctoral education was not on my radar and would not have been possible had I not had the financial support provided by the grant.  I think we need to create a diverse array of pathways to link young people to careers in agriculture and to show them that whatever they are interested in, there are opportunities in agriculture.” NIFA programs offer grants for K-12 schools and community colleges, such as The Secondary Education, Two-Year Postsecondary Education, and Agriculture in the K-12 Classroom Challenge Grants (SPECA) program; funding for undergraduate and masters level education such as the Higher Education Challenge Grants program and the Multicultural Scholars Program (MSP); and support for doctoral studies is provided by the NNF Fellowship and the Education and Literacy Initiative. NNF supports 45 new masters and doctoral students each year, while MSP supports 35 undergrads. Beyond grants, there are many other ways people can benefit from NIFA. For example, educators can access free curriculum from AITC through its Curriculum Matrix. NIFA is also the home of 4-H National Headquarters that supports the positive youth leadership development. NIFA is also a key partner with the Cooperative Extension Service, which operates offices across the country to provide community education in agriculture, health, nutrition, personal finances, and more. NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

"Smokey Bear Gives Bear Hugs in New Wildfire Prevention Campaign  Imagine dousing your campfire then getting a big bear hug from Smokey Bear, the iconic symbol of wildfire prevention for nearly 70 years. That’s the idea behind three videos in a new series of Smokey Bear public service advertisements released July 12, , designed to raise awareness about wildfire prevention. The Smokey Bear campaign is the longest running PSA campaign in U.S. History. The new ads will feature his well-known tagline, “Only YOU can prevent wildfires.” The new twist is the bear hugs.

In recent years, the campaign's messaging has shifted from a sole focus on preventing forest fires to emphasizing the prevention of wildfires in general. The updated slogan is now: ""Prevent Wildfires."" The revised message places greater emphasis on the shared responsibility for wildfire prevention among all members of society, rather than solely focusing on individual actions. This change acknowledges that wildfires are often complex events involving multiple factors, such as weather conditions, topography, and human activities like arson or accidental ignition. However, the core idea behind Smokey Bear's campaign remains unchanged: to raise awareness about the importance of wildfire prevention and promote responsible behaviors to mitigate the risk of wildfires. The updated message aims to inspire a broader societal shift towards wildfire preparedness and prevention, rather than solely relying on individual actions. Some key points of emphasis in the updated message include: * **Wildfire is everyone's responsibility**: The campaign now highlights that preventing wildfires requires collective effort from individuals, communities, and society as a whole. * **Prevention is more effective than suppression**: By emphasizing prevention, the campaign encourages people to take proactive measures to reduce the risk of wildfires, rather than relying solely on firefighting efforts after a fire has started. * **Wildfires are not just forest fires**: The updated message acknowledges that wildfires can occur in various settings, such as grasslands, brushlands, and other ecosystems.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Jun 11,  Youth learn about computers at a Air Force 4-H camp in New York. (Photo courtesy of 4-H) Military-connected youth have an exciting opportunity to join other members of the military family this summer. These residential and day camps will develop skills and teach the campers new techniques that will help prepare them to be productive citizens. The 16 camps, held in 15 states, are 4-H camps sponsored by Air Force Child and Youth Programs, with programs tailored to meet the needs of both the host unit and regional 4-H programs. Camp themes range from leadership development to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); from sustainable energy to college prep; from drones and geospatial technology to outdoor forestry and farm conservation; and more. In addition to camps sponsored by the Air Force, Purdue University’s Cooperative Extension Service hosts Military Teen Adventure Camps that are open to families in all service branches. Purdue’s program is funded by a grant from Department of Defense and USDA.

"New SNAP E&T Initiatives Aim to Help SNAP Participants Find Jobs  Getting a good job these days takes more than good intentions because today’s jobs require a higher level of skills than ever before.  This is why the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program’s Employment and Training Program (SNAP E&T), administered by states across the country, has such an important role to play in helping SNAP recipients gain the skills they need to find and keep good jobs.  This is also why the U.S. Department of Agriculture is committed to supporting this effort. USDA demonstrated that commitment in two new initiatives launched just this week, the SNAP E&T Learning Academy and a new website for the innovative SNAP to Skills Project, led by the Food and Nutrition Service. The Academy breaks new ground, as a first-ever opportunity that will help address an identified need. You see, though SNAP E&T programs operate across America, we’ve found that there is an opportunity for further sharing of best practices and lessons learned by developing resources that spread the knowledge base throughout the country.

Here are some specific examples: **Initiatives implemented by Secretary Vilsack:** 1. **The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP)**: In 2008, Secretary Vilsack launched the CSP, which provides financial incentives to farmers and ranchers who adopt conservation practices that improve soil health, reduce erosion, and enhance wildlife habitats. 2. **The Agricultural Act of 2014**: During his tenure, Secretary Vilsack played a key role in drafting the 2014 Farm Bill, which included several provisions aimed at promoting conservation efforts, such as the CSP and other programs focused on soil conservation, water quality improvement, and habitat restoration. 3. **Iowa's Soil Health Partnership**: In partnership with the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS), Secretary Vilsack launched a soil health initiative to promote the use of cover crops, reduced tillage, and other conservation practices that improve soil health and reduce erosion. **Initiatives implemented by farmers in Iowa:** 1. **The Iowa Soybean Association's (ISA) Conservation Tillage Program**: Many soybean farmers in Iowa have adopted conservation tillage practices, which involve reducing tillage to minimize soil disturbance and promote soil health. 2. **The Pheasants Forever-led ""Wetlands Reserve Program"" (WRP)**: Some farmers in Iowa have enrolled their lands in the WRP, a program that provides financial incentives for landowners to retire and restore wetland habitats, which help filter water and support wildlife populations. 3. **Cover crop adoption**: Many corn and soybean farmers in Iowa now use cover crops on their fields during the off-season, which helps reduce soil erosion, improve soil health, and promote pollinator diversity. **Additional initiatives:** 1. **The Des Moines River Watershed Initiative**: This is a collaborative effort among government agencies, farmers, and environmental organizations to protect water quality in the Des Moines River watershed. 2. **The Iowa Conservation Program**: This program, led by IDALS and the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), provides financial and technical assistance to farmers and landowners to implement conservation practices that improve soil health, reduce erosion, and enhance wildlife habitats. These initiatives demonstrate a commitment from Secretary Vilsack and farmers in Iowa to protecting environmental resources through conservation efforts.",0.01538975187943661,0.09022556390977443,0.03526448362720403,0.08020050125313283,0.8440989255905151
"NRCS Recovery Act Project Helps Provide New Starts for Residents   For more than 45 years, people who lived in West Virginia’s Dunloup Creek Watershed have dealt with floods. That’s because there’s a scarcity of flat land in the area and residents have had to settle mostly along the creek—the very area that floods during storms. Two major floods in and devastated five low-income communities spread out across two counties in the watershed. The floods destroyed houses, ate away at the stream bank, polluted drinking water and washed away utilities. Damages totaled millions of dollars. Because of the mountainous terrain and far-flung population, traditional flood control measures like dams, channels, floodwalls, dredging and flood proofing were not feasible. Yet many residents were trapped into living in their damaged homes, unable to move out because of perilous financial circumstances.

Flood control strategies often depend on a variety of factors including topography, water flow rates, population density, and existing infrastructure among others. If you're looking for detailed information on this topic, it might be best to consult local or national resources focused on flood management in West Virginia or similar regions with mountainous terrains.",0.030490516656030763,0.15841584158415842,0.08080808080808081,0.11881188118811882,0.857474148273468

"After the Storm, Who Takes Care of the Trees?  Thousands of federal, state, and private agencies have been deployed to areas that were impacted by hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate. These first responders are there to help the people in the storm’s path. However, there is another group of responders that go into storm-ravaged towns to aid the trees: the Urban Forest Strike Teams (UFST).  Patty Matteson, Southern Research Station, Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Oct 25,   3 Responses","What other responders, besides first responders, are deployed to storm-affected areas, specifically focusing on helping trees affected by hurricanes like Harvey?",The Urban Forest Strike Teams (UFST) are deployed to storm-affected areas to aid the trees.,"Besides first responders, several other types of responders are deployed to storm-affected areas to help with recovery efforts, particularly in cases where trees have been impacted by storms like Hurricane Harvey. Some of these responders include: 1. **Urban Forestry and Arborists**: These professionals specialize in tree care and management. They assess the damage to trees, identify potential hazards, and provide guidance on pruning or removing damaged branches. 2. **Tree Service Companies**: Specialized tree service companies, often hired by local governments or insurance companies, are deployed to remove fallen or weakened trees, and prune or trim trees that have been damaged. 3. **Wildlife Experts (e.g., wildlife removal services)**: While not directly related to tree care, these responders may be called in to handle animal-related issues, such as trapped animals in flooded areas or damage caused by wildlife (like rodents) in affected homes. 4. **Environmental and Conservation Agencies**: These agencies might send experts to assess the impact of storms on natural environments, including trees and other vegetation. 5. **Utility Companies' Arborists**: Utility companies often have their own arborist teams that work to restore power lines, towers, and other infrastructure damaged by fallen or weakened trees. 6. **Emergency Management Teams**: These teams are responsible for coordinating relief efforts, including tree removal and debris management. It's worth noting that the specific responders deployed will depend on the severity of the storm, the extent of damage, and local policies regarding emergency response and recovery efforts.",0.01962576968343694,0.0923076923076923,0.046511627906976744,0.06923076923076923,0.8374083638191223
