"USDA state-by-state show top states for Federal local food investments include Kentucky, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Texas and Alabama  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .15  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  WASHINGTON, June 30, — Today, the Obama Administration invited communities to participate in Local Foods, Local Places, a federal initiative providing direct technical support to build strong local food systems as part of a community's emerging economic action plans. Under this effort, a team of agricultural, transportation, public health, environmental, and regional economic experts will work directly with local communities to spur local economic growth and improve the quality of life for all residents.Local food sales topped $11.7 billion in according to industry estimates, underscoring the economic benefit that a local food system can offer a community. As part of today's announcement, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) released an updated state-by-state ""Made in Rural America"" report illustrating the impact of USDA's investments in rural communities, including local food. USDA has invested more than $800 million in more than 29,100 local and regional food businesses and infrastructure projects over the past six years.""These state by state analyses reaffirm that local food is rapidly growing from a niche market to an integrated system recognized for its economic boost to communities across the country,"" said Secretary Vilsack. ""Local food creates new market opportunities for farmers, brings fresh meals into schools and other institutions, expands healthy food access to underserved communities, and builds infrastructure needed to support ranchers and other meat processors. By investing in projects at the local level, this Administration is encouraging growth in this sector and creating new opportunities for families who live in rural America.""This is the second year of the Local Foods, Local Places program. In , 26 rural and urban communities participated in the program to create year-round, downtown markets featuring foods from local farmers; establish retail outlets to help revitalize small-town main streets; build centrally located community kitchens or food hubs to aggregate and market local foods; support business incubators to help entrepreneurs start food-related businesses on main streets; enhance public spaces for people to walk or bicycle to farmers markets and local restaurants; assist schoolchildren to grow their own food and make healthy local food accessible to families, including via SNAP benefits; and develop community gardens in walkable, transit-accessible places.Technical support teams through Local Foods, Local Places helped Osceola, Arkansas (pop 7,700) develop a new health foods cooking curriculum for the local school district, create a plan for a new downtown farmers market and implement infrastructure improvement efforts; guided North Little Rock, Arkansas (population 62,000) to enhance the livability of an emerging neighborhood though a new food hub; and worked with Wheeling, West Virginia (pop 28,000) to revitalize underused property into a community orchard, multi-use food facility, and a mobile market.Local Foods, Local Places is a partnership between USDA, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Transportation (DoT), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Delta Regional Authority (DRA). The effort is part of the White House Rural Council's ""Rural Impact"" effort to improve quality of life and upward mobility for kids and families in rural and tribal communities. Together, the agencies are investing $800,000 to support this round of assistance. Application and deadlines are available on line.Since , USDA has invested in 29,100 food hubs, small scale processing, farmers market and other opportunities in local food across all 50 states and the US territories. This includes USDA investments in the local food sector through over 12,000 microloans, smaller loans of up to $50,000 for small-scale producers who often sell products locally; and over 13,000 high tunnels, low-cost covered structures that extend the growing season and make locally-grown products available later into the year.Among the top ten states with federally funded local food projects are Kentucky, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Minnesota, West Virginia, Iowa, and Michigan. Five of these states (Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and West Virginia) are part USDA's StrikeForce Initiative for Rural Growth and Opportunity which coordinates USDA assistance in the Nation's most economically challenged rural areas.Many of these projects can be found on the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass. Searchable by state, zip code, project type and funding program, the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass maps federal local food investments made by USDA and 10 other federal agencies between fiscal years -. The Compass is part of the USDA's Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative. Secretary Vilsack has identified local and regional food systems as one of the four pillars of rural economic development, along with production agriculture, the bio-based economy, and natural resources and conservation.The state by state fact sheets are available at www.usda.gov/opportunities.

"Foreign Agricultural Service Administrator in  Trade  Oct 22,  Trade visitors sample a variety of cheeses at the Rogue Creamery stand in the USA Pavilion. Rogue Creamery, an artisan cheese company, is dedicated to sustainability and the art and tradition of making the world's finest handmade cheese. Earlier this week I traveled to Paris to attend the 24th edition of the Salon International d’Alimentation (SIAL). This 5-day event is one of the largest international food and beverage trade exhibitions in the world, attracting 5,500 exhibitors and over 147,000 trade-only visitors representing 188 countries. I was very impressed by the wide variety of U.S. products on display and by the number of participating countries. For nearly 20 years, the United States has participated in SIAL Paris. This year’s USA Pavilion at SIAL was the largest to date, with some 140 exhibitors occupying over 2,700 square meters. SIAL offers U.S. food exporters the opportunity to test products and meet with European as well as other international traders and industry professionals. Clearly, this is a major factor for the large U.S. presence. One of my primary reasons for attending the show was to meet face to face with U.S. Cooperators, exhibitors, and importers from Europe and other regions, as well as industry leaders. I had the pleasure of talking with many small- and medium-sized companies and Cooperator groups who expressed their appreciation of our programs and services, including American Food Service, Head Country Food Products, Rogue Creamery, U.S. Meat Export Federation, USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, and representatives from the state regional trade groups (SRTG), just to name a few. Tuesday night’s SRTG-hosted trade reception, as well as an industry reception, was yet another wonderful opportunity to talk with Pavilion exhibitors and trade visitors. Reception guests included buyer groups from North Africa and the Middle East recruited by our FAS Field offices. The European Union (EU) is a major trading partner for the United States. The EU is America’s fifth largest market for agricultural and food products. France alone imports nearly $1 billion of U.S. farm goods annually. However, the scope of SIAL extended beyond the EU, reaching importers from all corners of the world. Building a market presence is sometimes a long process, and participation in these types of trade shows introduces foreign buyers and consumers more quickly and effectively to the attributes and advantages of American products. Looking back on the response of visitors to the wide variety of U.S. food and beverage products showcased in the Pavilion, I am optimistic that the demand for U.S. agricultural products is strong, and our reputation as a reliable supplier of safe, wholesome, and innovative products is excellent. For information on other upcoming trade events, please visit our home page at www.fas.usda.gov or contact Maria.Nemeth-Ek@fas.usda.gov.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  Sep 11,   Evelyn Eagleman, 63, remembers driving the long distance off Rocky Boy’s Indian Reservation, Mont., to rescue her grandson when he was two. His father was serving in the military and his mother had been arrested on drug charges.  The boy needed a new start. She brought the child home to Rocky Boy, where she and her husband, Francis, became the child’s foster parents.  Her grandson, now a teenager, will soon graduate from high school and plans to major in forestry in college.  Eagleman said she and her husband are proud of the man he has become and gives much credit to the Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program at Stone Child College, in Box Elder, Mont. “There are a lot of legal issues involved with foster parenting, and I can’t remember them all, but with this program, I know where to go for help,” she said.   “We learned about our rights as foster grandparents.” The Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) through its Tribal College Extension Grant program. This grant allows land-grants institutions, also known as tribal colleges, to provide education to reservation communities. The 32 colleges and universities that receive this funding provide a host of services, depending on the community needs. Stone Child College uses its grant for many youth-focused outreach efforts, as well as the Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program.  According to Mary St. Pierre, the Extension project director and leader of the grandparent program, about 10 percent of the community’s children are being raised by grandparents. The U.S. Census that, nationally, 7 million grandparents had grandchildren living with them, a 64 percent increase since . In about one-third of these cases grandparents had assumed a custodial role. The Census that for American Indians, 97,278 grandparents live with their grandchildren and more than half have primary custodial responsibility.  Many times, the parent lives with the family, too, as it is with the Eagleman’s. St. Pierre’s next goal for NIFA’s Tribal College Extension Grant program is to develop a Positive Indian Parenting program that will accompany the Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"CAFTA-DR: A Trade Partnership that Works  Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs Ted McKinney is leading a USDA trade mission to Central America this week, making it a good time to review where we stand as far as CAFTA-DR, the United States’ free trade agreement with five Central America countries and the Dominican Republic. It’s been just over 10 years since we started cutting agricultural tariffs on both sides, and the deal has delivered exactly as trade agreements are supposed to. Going forward, a deal that has been a solid positive for U.S. agriculture has the potential to get even better as further market openings create more opportunities for U.S. exports.  Jason Hafemeister, Trade Counsel, U.S. Department of Agriculture  Posted in  Trade  Mar 02,   2 Responses",What are the potential future benefits for US agriculture under the CAFTA-DR trade agreement?,Further market openings could create more opportunities for US exports under the CAFTA-DR trade agreement.,"The Central American Free Trade Agreement with the United States (CAFTA-DR) is a trade agreement between the United States and five countries in Central America (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) plus the Dominican Republic. The agreement aims to promote economic integration and cooperation among its member countries. Here are some potential future benefits for US agriculture under CAFTA-DR: 1. **Increased market access**: CAFTA-DR eliminates tariffs on US agricultural exports to participating Central American countries and the Dominican Republic, making it easier and cheaper for US farmers to export their products to these markets. 2. **Tariff reductions and elimination**: The agreement phases out tariffs on a wide range of agricultural commodities, including fruits, vegetables, grains, oilseeds, and livestock products, over time. This could lead to increased market share and sales for US farmers. 3. **Improved sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) procedures**: CAFTA-DR requires participating countries to implement SPS measures that are based on science, rather than administrative or arbitrary barriers. This should reduce the risk of trade disputes and facilitate exports of US agricultural products to these markets. 4. **Enhanced cooperation and technical assistance**: The agreement promotes cooperation among member countries in areas such as agriculture, health, education, and technology transfer, which could lead to improved productivity and competitiveness for US farmers through knowledge sharing and best practices adoption. 5. **Increased investment opportunities**: CAFTA-DR encourages private sector investment in the agricultural sectors of participating countries, which could stimulate economic growth and job creation in these markets. 6. **Streamlined trade procedures**: The agreement aims to simplify customs procedures and reduce paperwork requirements for US exporters, making it easier and faster for them to get their products into Central American markets. Some specific agricultural commodities that may benefit from CAFTA-DR include: * Fruits: bananas, apples, grapes, strawberries * Vegetables: lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers * Grains: corn, soybeans, wheat, rice * Livestock and dairy products: beef, pork, chicken, milk and dairy products",1.445432041646571e-155,0.07100591715976332,0.023809523809523808,0.05917159763313609,0.8314694166183472

Here are some ways that Janine's experience as a refugee farmer in Vermont might have helped her connect with similar farmers from other African countries: 1. **Cultural connections**: As someone who has experienced the challenges of refugee life and agriculture in their home country, Janine may be able to empathize with fellow refugees and international farmers facing similar circumstances. 2. **Resource sharing**: She could share knowledge about farming practices, climate resilience strategies, or innovative techniques for cultivating crops that grow well in her new environment (or possibly the African countries they originated from). 3. **Networking opportunities**: Programs like the New American Farmer Program likely have a network of professionals and organizations focused on helping immigrant farmers succeed. Janine might leverage these resources to connect with fellow farmers, gain access to workshops, training sessions, or mentorship programs, and share her own expertise in return. 4. **Cultural exchange**: By engaging with other refugee farmers from diverse backgrounds, Janine can foster cultural understanding and exchange between communities. This cross-cultural dialogue could lead to mutual learning, respect, and a more cohesive community. In terms of accessing resources through the New American Farmer Program (and possibly others), Janine's experience as a refugee farmer might have helped her: 1. **Leverage support**: Her background as a farmworker or smallholder might qualify her for targeted assistance programs, training initiatives, or loans aimed at helping immigrant farmers overcome challenges and become more self-sufficient. 2. **Navigate bureaucratic systems**: As someone who has navigated refugee resettlement processes, Janine may have developed the skills to successfully interact with government agencies, non-profit organizations, or other service providers that offer support to immigrant farmers. 3. **Find mentorship opportunities**: The New American Farmer Program and similar initiatives often involve partnerships between experienced farmers, agricultural professionals, and community leaders. By connecting with these mentors, Janine might gain valuable guidance on best practices, market trends, and resource management strategies. While the specific details of Janine's experience may vary, her story illustrates how refugees can contribute to their new communities through agriculture and cultural exchange.",0.033551194858726506,0.16666666666666669,0.08571428571428572,0.12601626016260162,0.8488136529922485
"Obama Administration Launches Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture  From record droughts in Kansas to deadly wildfires in California, the United States is feeling the effects of climate change. These same conditions have a dire impact across the developing world, especially for poor, rural smallholder farmers whose very lives are threatened every time the rains arrive late, the floods rush in, or the temperature soars. By , the world’s population is expected to reach nine billion people. Feeding them will require at least a 60 percent increase in agricultural production. There is no greater challenge to meeting this need than climate change. It poses a range of unprecedented threats to the livelihoods of the world’s most vulnerable people and to the very planet that sustains us. In order to ensure that hundreds of millions of people are not born into a debilitating cycle of under-nutrition and hunger, we must address the urgent threat that climate change poses.

Soil erosion, salinization, and nutrient depletion are already significant concerns in many parts of the world. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), soil degradation and declining arable land are major obstacles to increasing food production sustainably. As a result, more than 90% of the world's agricultural growth will need to come from increased productivity per hectare, rather than expanding cultivated areas. Specifically, some of the primary challenges include: 1. **Land scarcity**: With the global population projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, finding sufficient arable land for food production becomes increasingly difficult. 2. **Soil degradation**: Soil erosion, nutrient depletion, and salinization can reduce soil fertility and lead to decreased crop yields. 3. **Water scarcity**: Climate change is altering rainfall patterns and increasing the frequency of droughts, making water management a critical challenge in agriculture. 4. **Climate variability**: Extreme weather events like floods and heatwaves can damage crops, disrupt supply chains, and affect global food security. To address these challenges, sustainable agricultural practices such as conservation agriculture (CA), agroforestry, and regenerative agriculture are being promoted to improve soil health, increase water use efficiency, and promote biodiversity. Additionally, research on climate-resilient crop and animal varieties is underway to help farmers adapt to changing environmental conditions.",0.10261816050223034,0.20735785953177258,0.1952861952861953,0.20735785953177258,0.8820631504058838

"Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  Health and Safety  Animals  Plants  May 09,  USDA is taking a multi-faceted approach to supporting the American sheep and lamb industry, working with researchers and market analysts to identify strategies and goals. The U.S. sheep and lamb industry has been shrinking for decades as the numbers of sheep and producers have declined since World War II.  Consolidation of the sheep packing industry, higher feed and energy costs, continuous loses to predation, and lower consumption, coupled with competition from imports of lamb cuts, have taken their toll on U.S. producers.  In response to industry needs, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has been working with the American Lamb Board (ALB) and the American Sheep Industry Association (ASI) on initiatives aimed at ensuring the long-term viability of the industry. The ALB recently initiated a study to identify the challenges, propose solutions, and develop strategies to strengthen the industry’s competitive advantage.  By working with a marketing firm and using and services offered by USDA, ALB hopes this study’s findings will help return the industry to profitability.  AMS is ready to assist ALB as they lay the groundwork and identify goals and benchmarks. Another way AMS is assisting the industry is in identifying opportunities to improve Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) for lamb.  LMR was established to collect and publish price and volume information to encourage competition in the marketplace.  However, given the consolidation of the industry, it has become difficult to publish lamb market information on a consistent basis due to the LMR confidentiality requirements.  Last fall, ASI commissioned the Livestock Marketing Information Center (LMIC) to conduct a study of the LMR program, and over the course of 5 months, met with AMS to learn more about how USDA administers the lamb reporting program. The final report proposed improvement recommendations to lamb reporting.  Some of the recommendations included lowering the reporting thresholds for packers and importers, evaluating the confidentiality policy for LMR, and eliminating categories and that do not have utility. AMS has reviewed the report and is engaged with ASI to determine the best solutions for the recommendations.  While some of the recommendations will require regulatory changes, many of the proposals can be addressed easily.  In fact, AMS has already eliminated the western regional lamb , changed the National daily lamb report to a weekly report, modified the reported weight categories, and removed unused purchase type categories. AMS is working with ASI on other projects, such as determining ways in which slaughter lambs are bought to ensure that the LMR purchase types are still relevant.  AMS is also working to develop strategies to more accurately define the lamb maturity window for the grade standards and will work with FSIS on a more agreeable term for “yearling mutton” such as “yearling lamb.” AMS and ASI are cooperating on the potential development of a lamb tenderness standard, and the potential development of a non-hormone treated lamb export certification protocol with the European Union. The ALB and ASI recently received USDA approval to explore lamb instrument grading, through funding received from the National Sheep Industry Improvement Center.  The project will be a two phased approach to finalizing USDA’s standardization of the concept and evaluating the benefits and return on the investment to garner industry acceptance. The USDA is committed to working with our partners in the industry to not only meet these challenges but to succeed in creating an industry that provides quality products to consumers and increased producer returns here at home.

Jay, Chun-Li Integrated Marketing and Communications Co., Ltd Thanks to Foreign Agricultural Service employees serving at USDA’s 98 international posts, American Thanksgiving traditions – and food – are being enjoyed around the world this November.  This is certainly the case in Taiwan, where the Agricultural Trade Office (ATO) in Taipei teamed with China TV to highlight the holiday on an episode of the popular TV show “King of the Happy Life” this week. Valerie Brown from ATO Taipei was joined by Daisy Hong, who represents the grower-owned cooperative Ocean Spray, and chef C.K. Chen from Taipei’s Sherwood Hotel. In addition to Thanksgiving staples like turkey and pumpkin pie, they featured new recipes, including stuffing and hot cranberry-apple cider made with Ocean Spray products. After taping the show, Chen began taking orders for traditional American Thanksgiving baskets, which the Sherwood Hotel sells every year. Not only do these baskets feature traditional American dishes, many of the ingredients are exported by the United States, including turkey, cranberries, broccoli, potatoes, beets, lettuce and California wine. Following the Thanksgiving episode of “King of the Happy Life” last year, Chen was so overwhelmed with orders that he had to limit the number of baskets available this year. The popularity of these Thanksgiving baskets is reflective of increased demand for U.S. food and agriculture around the world.  Earlier this month, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that U.S. agricultural exports reached a record $137.4 billion in fiscal year , which exceeds the previous record by $22.5 billion. The agricultural trade surplus soared to a record $42.7 billion in FY. This rise in exports is good news for all Americans, especially considering every $1 billion of U.S. agricultural exports supports 8,400 American jobs. Last year alone, agricultural exports helped support 1.15 million jobs. And that gives us all a reason to be thankful.

"Director, USDA Agricultural Trade Office, Tokyo in  Trade  Mar 27,   Helping U.S. exporters tap into Japan’s $670 billion food market is a top priority for the Foreign Agricultural Service’s Agricultural Trade Office (ATO) in Japan. One way we do this is by organizing the USA Pavilion at FOODEX Japan, the largest food and beverage trade show in Asia. This year’s show, which was held March 6-9, drew 74,000-plus attendees, not just from Japan but also from other Asian markets including Korea, Taiwan, China, Thailand and Hong Kong. U.S. Ambassador to Japan John V. Roos (right) visits a U.S. organic onion exhibit at the USDA-endorsed FOODEX Japan. The food and beverage show took place March 6-9 and is the largest show of its kind in Asia. The U.S. Pavilion was one of the largest at the show and featured more than 70 companies. (Photo Courtesy of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo) The USA Pavilion was one of the largest at the show, featuring more than 70 U.S. companies and a wide range of “Made in America” products, including meat and seafood, fresh produce, wine and specialty snack foods. Participants had an opportunity to showcase their wares to key decision-makers from restaurants, supermarkets, wholesalers, grocery stores, foodservice and hospitality companies, fast food chains and convenience stores, as well as distributors, agents and brokers. Japan is the world’s third-largest economy and the United States’ fourth-largest agricultural export customer, purchasing a record $15.6 billion of U.S. agricultural, forestry and fishery goods in . For U.S. companies, entry into the lucrative Japanese market is often the first step towards expansion to the rest of Asia. That’s why our ATO strives to help U.S. companies shine at the FOODEX show, providing logistical support and briefings, offering samples of U.S. products at a “Gateway to American Food” demonstration area, and helping match U.S. exhibitors with potential business contacts. While final results from the show are not yet in, a preliminary survey indicates U.S. exhibitors made more than $13 million in projected sales. Over three years, more than 1,000 U.S. companies and organizations—about 70 percent of them small and medium sized businesses—participated in 87 USDA-endorsed trade shows in 20 countries. On-site sales totaled more than $350 million and 12-month projected sales reported by exhibitors were estimated more than $2.7 billion. The companies made over 42,000 business contacts and displayed nearly 20,000 new products in various markets on all continents.  Trade shows give companies even more opportunities to make business contacts and share their products with potential buyers and consumers. Currently, the American brand of agriculture is surging in popularity worldwide. Farm exports in fiscal year reached a record high of $137.4 billion—exceeding past highs by $22.5 billion—and supported 1.15 million jobs here at home. The agricultural trade surplus stands at a record $42.7 billion.

"A Reflection: Celebrating Eight Years of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships  Looking back at USDA’s efforts to help rural America thrive, I am truly proud of the impact our diverse partners, both from faith and secular communities, have had within their communities. On behalf of the USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, I would like to say thank you to our partners these past eight years as well as reflect on a few notable highlights of the work we have achieved together. USDA touches the lives of all Americans every day, whether they realize it or not. While our programs to reduce food insecurity are well known, our nation’s most vulnerable citizens can still be hard to reach.

"Our Resilient Communities: My Experience as a Wallace-Carver Fellow  The face of poverty has often been associated with the starving child in the slums of New Delhi, India or streets of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. While this is the reality for many children across the developing world, rural and urban poverty is often overlooked in developed countries, such as the United States.  Priyanka K. Naithani, USDA  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Aug 01,   Respond to this story","What are some commonalities between child slums in developing countries like India and Haiti, and rural/urban poverty in developed countries like the United States?",The commonality is that both types of poverty often go overlooked.,"While the contexts of child slums in developing countries (e.g., India) and Haiti versus rural/urban poverty in developed countries (e.g., the United States) may seem distinct at first glance, there are some commonalities that highlight the shared human experiences across these settings. Some key similarities include: 1. **Poverty as a root cause**: In all cases mentioned, poverty is often the primary driver of the living conditions experienced by children and families. Whether in child slums or rural/urban poverty, limited access to resources, basic services (e.g., sanitation, healthcare), and economic opportunities exacerbate vulnerability. 2. **Limited Access to Basic Services**: A common thread among these settings is the challenge in accessing fundamental necessities such as clean water, electricity, healthcare, and education. This lack of access severely hampers the well-being and development prospects for children living in these conditions. 3. **Inequitable Distribution of Wealth and Resources**: Both child slums in developing countries and rural/urban poverty in developed nations often involve significant disparities in wealth distribution and access to resources such as employment, housing, and quality education. This inequity perpetuates cycles of disadvantage. 4. **Socioeconomic Exclusion**: In all these contexts, children face socioeconomic exclusion due to their family's or community's economic situation. This exclusion impacts their opportunities for education, health care, and social mobility. 5. **Need for Comprehensive Interventions**: Addressing the challenges faced by children in both developing country child slums and developed country poverty requires a multifaceted approach. Strategies should encompass economic empowerment of families, provision of quality basic services, access to education, and healthcare, alongside addressing systemic inequalities. 6. **Vulnerability due to Environmental Factors**: Children living in areas with poor environmental conditions (e.g., pollution, lack of sanitation) face higher risks of disease and health problems. This vulnerability affects their overall development and increases the burden on their families and communities. 7. **Community and Family Resourcefulness**: Despite these challenges, many children and families show remarkable resourcefulness and resilience in coping with poverty and poor living conditions. Their capacity to adapt and find ways to improve their situation is a testament to human spirit and potential for social change. 8. **Importance of Policy and Community Engagement**: Effective policies and community engagement are crucial for addressing these issues. Local involvement, government support, and international cooperation can make significant differences in improving living conditions and providing opportunities for growth and development. 9. **Emphasis on Education and Social Services**: Access to quality education and social services such as healthcare is vital for breaking cycles of poverty. In both developing country child slums and developed nation poverty scenarios, these are essential areas of focus for intervention strategies. 10. **Potential for Change through Collective Efforts**: There's a potential for change when governments, communities, and international organizations work together to address these issues. Strategies that involve community-led initiatives, policy changes, and global support can lead to significant improvements in the lives of children affected by poverty and poor living conditions.",6.091662401187491e-232,0.031809145129224656,0.003992015968063871,0.023856858846918492,0.814204216003418

"Taking Charge: How Rural Residents Are Switching from Employees to Business Owners  The retirement of the baby boom generation of business proprietors is predicted to result in a major turnover in ownership. Developing an ownership succession plan is especially challenging in rural areas where many small businesses are at risk of closing from the lack of locally available financing to keep them in operation. Rural Development’s Business and Industry (B&I) Guaranteed Loan Program now has new capabilities as of this August that specifically accommodate the needs of financing ownership succession. B&I guarantee borrowers can now apply to loans for financing the transfer of business ownership within a family, usually involving a sale from parents to children. Prior to recent changes in the rules it was assumed that within families the transfer of ownership was always a seller-financed transaction. Yet, some retiring business owners may need to immediately take the sales revenue out to finance their retirement.

"Posted by USDA in  USDA Results  Oct 22,   October 20 marked the official launch of the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) at USDA for the Washington, D.C. metro area. Administered by the government’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM), CFC is the world’s largest workplace giving program. Since its inception in , federal employees have contributed more than $6 billion to the non-profit community. This year, USDA has set a goal of raising just under $2 million from its approximately 10,000 employees in the national capital area. The official kickoff on Tuesday morning was an exciting event in the Whitten Building patio featuring top USDA leadership and more than 20 CFC registered non-profit organizations. Secretary Tom Vilsack and Undersecretary for Research, Education, and Economics, Dr. Raj Shah, led off the event by speaking movingly about the ways that non-profit organizations touch all of our lives in critical and transformative ways. Dr. Shah spoke about incredible array of non-profits that participate in CFC, from groups doing lifesaving work fighting malaria in Africa to charities feeding hungry people right here in Washington, D.C. Secretary Vilsack spoke about his own birth in a Catholic orphanage, saying that he probably would not be here today if not for the nuns who took care of him and his birth mother. Both stressed the importance of giving generously this year more than ever, as the worldwide economic crisis has dramatically increased the needs of the non-profit community even as donations to the sector have fallen off. Secretary Vilsack emphasized that as federal workers, we have all been blessed with good jobs, and that CFC is a wonderful opportunity to share that blessing with people in need. After Secretary Vilsack’s remarks, he officially opened the campaign by handing in his own completed pledge form. Dr. Shah and much of USDA’s senior leadership followed suit, as the assembled USDA employees watched a video message from President Obama. The President encouraged all federal employees to give generously to CFC this year, as part of the same spirit of service and community that he has worked to strengthen across the country through United We Serve. As the first phase of the kickoff drew to a close, Bernadine Prince of FARMFRESH Markets spoke about her organization’s work to promote locally grown food throughout the DC Metro area. When Ms. Prince finished her remarks, it was time for the attendees to sample some of the fresh, locally grown food from USDA’s very own Farmers Market, such as apple cider and banana bread. Before attendees enjoyed the delicious and healthy refreshments, Dr. Susan McCarthy from the Agricultural Research Service, USDA’s CFC Campaign Manager, launched the charity fair. This fair was an excellent opportunity for USDA employees to talk to representatives of a few of the thousands of non-profits represented in the CFC catalog. Employees who attended reported having a wonderful time and learning a great deal about non-profits doing great work in a wide variety of ways. The Secretary is hoping that all employees will join him in giving to the non-profit organizations of their choice. The size of the gift matters much less than the fact that each employee participates on some level. DC Metro area federal employees can find out everything they need to know to get involved in CFC by visiting www.cfcnca.org.

While I couldn't find specific information on their exact recommendations, here are some general tips on preparing different vegetables like squash and greens for optimal health benefits: **Squash:** 1. **Roasting**: Cut the squash in half or into wedges, remove seeds, and roast at 400°F (200°C) for 30-40 minutes, or until tender. This brings out the natural sweetness and enhances nutrient bioavailability. 2. **Grilling**: Slice the squash thinly and grill over medium heat for 5-7 minutes per side. This adds a smoky flavor and can help preserve nutrients like vitamin C and B vitamins. 3. **Sautéing**: Sauté diced or sliced squash with olive oil, garlic, and herbs to enhance flavor and retain moisture. **Greens:** 1. **Steaming**: Steam green leafy vegetables like kale, spinach, or collard greens for 2-5 minutes to preserve nutrients like vitamins A, C, and K. 2. **Sautéing**: Sauté chopped greens with garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil to enhance flavor and retain moisture. 3. **Juicing**: Juice raw greens like kale, spinach, or collards to extract their nutrient-rich properties. **General Tips:** 1. **Wash and dry**: Always wash the vegetables thoroughly before preparation to remove dirt, bacteria, and pesticide residues. 2. **Use minimal water**: Use minimal water during cooking to preserve nutrients and prevent overcooking. 3. **Keep it simple**: Avoid over-processing or excessive heat, as this can damage delicate vitamins and minerals. 4. **Season with herbs and spices**: Add flavor with herbs and spices instead of salt and sugar to enhance the natural taste of the vegetables. These tips are general guidelines for preparing various vegetables like squash and greens. Peoples' Garden Workshop may have specific recommendations based on their community-driven approach, but these suggestions should provide a good starting point for maximizing health benefits from your vegetable preparations!",5.1885669691581326e-232,0.03636363636363637,0.0060975609756097554,0.030303030303030304,0.8101315498352051

"Assistant to the Director, USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in  Initiatives  May 24,   Cross posted from the Let's Move! blog:  There’s a lot going on in the Church Hill North neighborhood of Richmond, Virginia! For three years, the congregation at 31st Street Baptist Church has been growing fresh vegetables in an urban garden behind their church. More recently, they launched a healthy living campaign to encourage the congregation and the surrounding community to get active and eat more nutritious foods. Led by Rev. Dr. Henderson, who serves as senior pastor, 31st Street Baptist Church has acquired three city lots behind their church. The congregants have a large community garden with 24 cultivated raised beds in one of the lots. The garden provides healthy, fresh produce to a community without close access to a grocery store. The majority of the produce from the garden is used in the church’s nutrition center, which has served members of the local community for 21 years and receives some of its food via USDA’s Emergency Food Assistance (TEFAP) program. The 31st Street Baptist Church garden is already growing peas, radishes, beets, and greens this season. Photo courtesy of Master Gardener Linda Marshall and Jacquelin Henderson 31st Street Baptist Church provides a great example of how to partner with the U.S. Department of Agriculture on multiple fronts. The church has partnered with Virginia Cooperative Extension and local master gardeners for technical assistance in growing food and teaching about nutrition. They will be starting a 4-H youth development club with two neighboring churches and teenagers from the Mayor’s Youth Conservation Corps also help tend part of the garden. The church has plans to launch a large farmers market this summer with produce from the garden and area farmers, and they will be holding a youth summer camp focused on healthy living in August. And there’s more: this spring marked the planting of a new flower garden in one of their other lots. The plan is to sell the cut flowers to other churches in the area to raise revenue and teach youth about entrepreneurship. The third open lot will be developed as a Zen garden, providing a space for tranquility in the neighborhood. Pastor Henderson’s goal is to “rally congregants around changing their lifestyles” while “respecting the dignity of the people who come to garden.” To learn more about increasing access to healthy affordable food in your community, please visit Let’s Move!

To mitigate these consequences, it's essential for policymakers to reassess and adjust dairy industry policies to: 1. Implement more effective price stabilization mechanisms. 2. Promote supply chain transparency and predictability. 3. Encourage sustainable dairy production practices. 4. Foster a level playing field for all market participants (e.g., small-scale farmers). 5. Develop strategies to manage inflationary pressures. By taking these steps, policymakers can help stabilize dairy markets, ensure economic stability, and promote a more equitable food system.",0.027829723705883054,0.12286689419795223,0.061855670103092786,0.10238907849829351,0.8429661393165588

It only mentions a meeting to discuss strategies and that there is a lot of work to be done to help people struggling to put food on the table. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that FNS is working with organizations like No Kid Hungry Campaign to increase participation in programs such as SNAP and Summer Meals through partnerships at the community level.","The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has been working closely with organizations, such as the No Kid Hungry Campaign, to enhance participation in critical nutrition assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Summer Meals program. The following are some key strategies they're employing: 1. **Community Outreach**: FNS is partnering with local community-based organizations and advocacy groups to reach underserved populations. By establishing partnerships, they can gain a deeper understanding of the needs within these communities. 2. **Digital Literacy Training**: Recognizing that not everyone has access to or knows how to use technology, training sessions are being conducted to equip potential recipients with the skills necessary to apply for and manage their benefits online. 3. **Culturally Sensitive Materials**: The materials used for outreach, such as flyers, posters, and even social media content, are designed to be culturally sensitive. This ensures that the information resonates more effectively with diverse audiences. 4. **Summer Meals Promotion**: For the Summer Meals program, FNS is collaborating with schools and community centers to spread awareness about meal availability during school breaks. Promotional materials are distributed through these channels to inform children and their families of where they can access free meals during summer months. 5. **Referral Partnerships**: Establishing referral partnerships between social services agencies and SNAP helps in identifying eligible individuals who might not know they qualify for assistance. These referrals can be a critical step in getting them enrolled in the program. 6. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: FNS is utilizing data to understand enrollment trends, areas of high demand, and challenges that are hindering participation. This information guides their strategies and ensures resources are allocated effectively. 7. **Collaboration with Faith-Based Organizations**: Recognizing the role faith-based organizations can play in community outreach and support, FNS has been working closely with these groups to spread awareness about nutrition assistance programs among their congregations and community members. 8. **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Through public awareness campaigns, the No Kid Hungry Campaign and other partners are engaging in media outreach efforts, creating videos, infographics, and blog posts that highlight the benefits of SNAP and Summer Meals programs. 9. **School District Engagement**: Working with school districts allows FNS to incorporate nutrition education into curriculum development. This helps kids develop healthy eating habits while also familiarizing them with programs like SNAP and Summer Meals. 10. **Addressing Administrative Barriers**: A significant part of their strategy involves identifying and addressing administrative barriers that prevent potential recipients from enrolling in these programs. This includes streamlining the application process, improving access to benefits verification systems, and enhancing digital tools for managing one's nutrition assistance. 11. **Incorporating Technology**: By incorporating technology, such as text messaging reminders about meal availability, FNS is making it easier for potential recipients to stay informed and engaged with these programs without requiring extensive computer literacy. 12. **Funding Support**: Collaborative efforts also include advocating for increased funding for nutrition assistance programs to ensure they can continue providing critical support to those in need. These strategies are aimed at increasing participation, enhancing program reach, and ultimately, helping more individuals gain access to the nutritional assistance they require.",0.015691798405158996,0.19047619047619047,0.056013179571663914,0.10509031198686371,0.8392165899276733

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Navy and Department of Energy are announcing $30 million in federal funding to match private investments in commercial-scale advanced drop-in biofuels. The Energy Department is also announcing a total of $32 million in new investments for earlier stage research that will continue to drive technological breakthroughs and additional cost reductions in the industry.Advancing Commercial-Scale Drop-In Biofuel Substitutes for Diesel and Jet FuelIn his Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future released in March , President Obama set a goal of reducing oil imports by one-third by and laid out an all-of-the-above energy plan to achieve that goal by developing domestic oil and gas energy resources, increasing energy efficiency, and speeding development of biofuels and other alternatives. Domestic oil and gas production has increased each year the President has been in office. At the same time we continue to take additional steps to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. As part of that effort, the Blueprint directed the Navy, USDA and DOE to collaborate to support commercialization of ""drop-in"" biofuel substitutes for diesel and jet fuel. Competitively-priced drop-in biofuels will help improve America's energy security, meeting the fuel needs of U.S. armed forces, as well as the commercial aviation and shipping sectors. Today's announcement of an available $30 million in funding builds on that commitment, helping to speed the development of biofuels for military and commercial transportation that will reduce the need for foreign oil and strengthen rural America. The Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is available HERE.Made possible through the Defense Production Act (DPA), this funding opportunity enhances national security by supporting the creation and commercial viability of a defense-critical domestic biofuels industry to advance alternatives to petroleum. DPA is an authority that dates back to and has been used to boost industries such as steel, aluminum, titanium, semiconductors, beryllium, and radiation-hardened electronics.""DPA is a critical component of strengthening our national security, and energy is a national security issue,"" stated Secretary Mabus. ""Our reliance on foreign oil is a significant military vulnerability and it would be irresponsible not to address it. Pursuing a viable, domestic alternative is the best way to preserve the budget for operational necessities like training and shipbuilding, and this funding opportunity is an important step in accelerating an economically self-sufficient alternative fuels market.""The FOA comprises a two-phased approach, with government and industry sharing in the cost. In Phase 1, applicants will submit a design package and comprehensive business plan for a commercial-scale biorefinery, identify and secure project sites and take additional steps spelled out in the announcement. Awardees selected to continue into Phase 2 will submit additional information for the construction or retrofit of a biorefinery.Agencies participating in this initiative will make additional funding requests to Congress to support the initiative, including President Obama's budget request of $110 million.""This is an important time for the biofuels industry to step up and show the Department of the Navy how they have developed biofuels that are certified and certifiable for military use,"" stated Secretary Vilsack. ""The ability for U.S. industry to make, create and innovate has never been more important to our national and energy security. I know that through this DPA effort the nation will be able to harvest an aviation biofuels industry to satisfy the world's needs, not just our U.S. military.""Investments in Biofuels Research, Development and Demonstration to Drive Cost Reductions, Technological BreakthroughsToday, the Energy Department is also announcing new investments in earlier stage biofuels research that complement the commercial-scale efforts announced today by the Navy and USDA. Totaling $32 million, these early-stage, pre-commercial investments are the latest steps in the Obama Administration's efforts to advance biofuels technologies to continue to bring down costs, improve performance, and identify new effective, non-food feedstocks and processing technologies.""Advanced biofuels are an important part of President Obama's all-of-the-above strategy to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil and support American industries and American jobs,"" said Secretary Chu. ""By pursuing new processes and technologies for producing next-generation biofuels, we are working to accelerate innovation in a critical and growing sector that will help to improve U.S. energy security and protect our air and water.""The funding announced by DOE today includes $20 million to support innovative pilot-scale and demonstration-scale biorefineries that could produce renewable biofuels that meet military specifications for jet fuel and shipboard diesel using a variety of non-food biomass feedstocks, waste-based materials and algae. These projects may support new plant construction, retrofits on existing U.S. biorefineries or operation at plants ready to begin production at the pilot- or pre-commercial scale. This investment will also help federal and local governments, private developers and industry collect accurate on the cost of producing fuels made from biomass and waste feedstocks. The full funding solicitation is available HERE.In addition, the Energy Department also announced $12 million to support up to eight projects focused on researching ways to develop biobased transportation fuels and products using synthetic biological processing. Synthetic biological processing offers an innovative technique to enable efficient, cost-saving conversion of non-food biomass to biofuels. These projects will develop novel biological systems that can enhance the breakdown of raw biomass feedstocks and assist in converting feedstocks into transportation fuels.The projects will be led by small businesses, universities, national laboratories and industry and will seek to overcome various technical and scientific barriers to cost-competitive advanced biofuels and bioproducts. The full funding opportunity announcement is available HERE.The new investments announced today build on the steps the Energy Department is already taking to push the boundaries of biofuel technologies and move towards commercial-scale production at refineries across the country.

"USDA Deputy Administrator of Special Nutrition Programs in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 23,  Audrey Rowe, USDA Deputy Administrator of Special Nutrition Programs, chats with the Shenandoah Valley Community Breastfeeding support group August 6 in Martinsburg, West Virginia.  I recently had the pleasure to spend a little time with some expecting and nursing mothers in Martinsburg, West Virginia.  It was the first meeting of a newly formed community breastfeeding support group planned to coincide with World Breastfeeding Week.  My friend Mitch Greenbaum, Director of Shenandoah Valley WIC and Nutrition Services, and his team of trained WIC nutritionists, board-certified lactation consultants and breastfeeding peer counselors, hosted nearly two dozen pregnant and nursing mothers to talk about how important breastfeeding is for both mother and child and how to have a satisfying and healthy breastfeeding experience. The women shared stories and got answers to questions new mothers often ask such as: “Does it hurt?”  “What should I do when I’m out in public and need to feed my baby?”  And, “How can I keep feeding my baby after I return to work?”  I shared my personal experiences too; knowing the trepidation and uncertainty a nursing mother experiences.  But Mitch’s team of experts calmed the fear and helped the women feel comfortable about the choice to breastfeed.  The messages helped the women understand how to cope with a busy schedule and perhaps a job, how to involve family and friends, and most importantly, helped the women understand just how nutritionally important breast milk is. Research proves that feeding human milk to young children and the practice of breastfeeding improves the health, immune system, and the development of children. It protects against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), ear infections, upper and lower respiratory infections, allergies, intestinal disorders, colds and viruses.  Breastfeeding also protects mothers against osteoporosis and breast and ovarian cancer.  These nutritional benefits, both for children and for women, last long after breastfeeding has ended. I applaud local WIC and Nutrition Service programs like the one in Shenandoah Valley for their efforts to promote and encourage this vital part of human development.  Through innovative community support groups and local community partnerships; through health provider outreach and public awareness; and through on-line USDA resources such as Loving Support and WIC Works, women, families, and whole communities are more aware of the profound benefits of breastfeeding.

"Administradora del Servicio de Alimentos y Nutrición del USDA in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 11,  Nutricionistas del WIC discuten opciones de alimentos saludables con participantes y niños  Los programas de nutrición del USDA (por siglas en inglés) proveen acceso a una dieta saludable a millones de americanos elegibles para las ayudas cada mes. Ya sea en escuelas, centros comunitarios o en casas de todo el país, estos programas trabajan en conjunto como una red de seguridad nutritiva para asegurar que ningún americano que cualifique pase hambre. Considero que la nutrición suplementar para mujeres, infantes y niños, mejor conocida como WIC (por sus siglas en inglés)  es un programa especial. Dicho programa provee alimentos suplementarios a los más vulnerables—infantes, embarazadas, mujeres lactando y luego del parto y a niños hasta la edad de 5 años que enfrentan un riesgo nutricional. WIC también provee referencias para atención médica y social, y para educación nutritiva, incluyendo la promoción y el soporte a la lactancia materna. Un nuevo reporte del USDA del programa y características de WIC (disponible en ingles) confirma el éxito de estos esfuerzos. Por ejemplo, al revisar la información recopilada se registró un aumento del 4 por ciento en dos años en la participación de madres del programa WIC que lactan sus niños con leche materna. De las agencias estatales que reportaron madres que lactaron a sus hijos en el , se reportó que 67 por ciento de los infantes entre los 6 y 13 meses estaban siendo amamantados o lo estuvieron durante un tiempo en comparación con un 63 por ciento registrado en un estudio anterior que se realizo en el . Es más, la lactancia materna entre participantes de WIC ha estado en continuo aumento desde , y este año por primera vez, el porcentaje de mamas lactantes fue mayor que el número de nuevas madres no lactantes. Los hallazgos son una buena noticia, ya que la lactancia materna es el método ideal de alimentación para infantes, ya que provee beneficios para la mama y el niño. Las ayudas del programa WIC están llegando a madres y niños de escasos recursos. Cerca de tres cuartas partes de los 9 millones de participantes en WIC que reportaron sus ingresos se encuentran por debajo de lo que se considera como pobreza, a comparación del 15 por ciento entre la población general de los Estados Unidos. La mayoría de los que reciben las ayudas de WIC tienen menos de 5 años y más de la mitad de los participantes eran menores de 3 años. Entre otras buenas noticias es importante señalar que la obesidad infantil ha disminuido entre los participantes de WIC(disponible en ingles). En el , el 15.3 por ciento de los niños en WIC de un año confrontaban problemas de obesidad comparado con los hallazgos registrados el 16.8 por ciento en el . De manera similar, en el se reportó que 14.7 por ciento de los niños entre las edades de 2 y 4 experimentaba obesidad mientras que en el la cantidad disminuyo a 14.0 por ciento. El centro para el control de enfermedades profundizo en el estudio usando datos del WIC de 43 estados y territorios de niños entre las edades de 2 y 4 años. Descubrieron que al revés de la tendencia anterior, en 19 de los estados/territorios hubo  reducciones significativas y que 21 de ellos no reportaron problemas de obesidad infantil, con solo 3 mostrando aumentos. WIC ayuda a trazar el futuro de nuestro país de una manera vital al proveer a madres e hijos la nutrición que necesitan para tener embarazos exitosos y en el caso de los niños, un crecimiento saludable. De hecho, investigaciones anteriores han demostrado que las ayudas que ofrece WIC ejercen un papel importante en embarazos ya que ayudan a evitar complicaciones como fiebre, embarazos prematuros o incluso las costosas tarifas de los cuidados de salud. Este es un programa que no solo está proporcionando nutrición a familias de bajos ingresos, pero también reduciendo la mortalidad infantil y en verdad creando una generación futura más saludable.

"Racing for alternatives in the age of antibiotic resistance  “This week is World Antibiotic Awareness week and ‘Get Smart About Antibiotics’ week. Learn more about how USDA works to ensure antibiotics remain effective to treat both people and animals when necessary and the alternatives available to traditional antibiotics.” For billions of years, microbes such as bacteria and viruses have been in a struggle for survival in the face of naturally occurring antimicrobial substances. This struggle has continued in nature and into human society, where humans, plants, animals, and microbes themselves constantly ward off disease-causing microbes. The plight for adaptation and survival is not unlike the Red Queen’s race in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass, where it takes all of the running one can do to remain in the same place.   Dr. Stephanie Pearl, Science Communicator, USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture  Posted in  Research and Science  Nov 18,   Respond to this story",What are some alternatives being explored by the USDA to traditional antibiotics in order to maintain their effectiveness for both human and animal treatments?,"The USDA is exploring alternatives to traditional antibiotics, including microbes that naturally ward off disease-causing microbes.","The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is indeed exploring alternative approaches to traditional antibiotics to maintain their effectiveness for both human and animal treatments. Some of these alternatives include: 1. **Phage Therapy**: Phages are viruses that specifically target bacteria, offering a targeted approach to eliminating bacterial infections without harming beneficial microbes. Researchers are studying the use of phages to treat antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in animals. 2. **Essential Oils**: Certain essential oils, such as tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil, have been shown to have antimicrobial properties against various bacteria. The USDA is investigating their potential use in animal agriculture and food production. 3. **Plant-Based Antimicrobials**: Researchers are exploring the antimicrobial properties of plants, such as garlic, onions, and ginger, which contain compounds that can inhibit bacterial growth. 4. **Probiotics**: While not a direct replacement for antibiotics, probiotics can be used to promote a healthy gut microbiome in animals, reducing the need for antibiotic treatments. 5. **Synthetic Peptides**: Scientists are developing synthetic peptides that mimic the natural antimicrobial properties of certain proteins found in animal mucus and saliva. 6. **Nanoparticles**: Researchers are investigating the use of nanoparticles as antimicrobial agents to reduce bacterial growth on surfaces and in animal feed. 7. **Biocontrol Agents**: Biocontrol agents, such as beneficial bacteria and fungi, can be used to control bacterial populations in animals and food production systems. 8. **Herbal Extracts**: Herbal extracts from plants like turmeric, goldenseal, and berberine are being explored for their antimicrobial properties. These alternative approaches aim to address the growing concern of antibiotic resistance in both human and animal health while maintaining the effectiveness of treatments for bacterial infections. The USDA continues to support research into these innovative solutions to promote a more sustainable and resistant-prone food production system.",4.0779729381540867e-79,0.07741935483870967,0.032467532467532464,0.07741935483870967,0.8392658829689026
"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 02,  Incorporating local produce into summer meals programs benefits the entire community. Fields of asparagus and peas are in full bounty, soon to make way for sweet, juicy strawberries; towering stalks of corn; and more tomatoes than you’d ever know what to do with!  In many parts of the country, as we approach summer, the warm weather means that local harvests are at their peak, and fresh fruits and vegetables abound.  That’s what makes summer the perfect time of year for incorporating local foods into your meals.  And according to the most recently released from the Farm to School Census , more than 1,000 school districts nationwide are doing just that:  They’re bringing the farm to summer! When school lets out for summer, there’s still a need to ensure the millions of children who receive free and reduced-price school meals during the school year have consistent access to healthy meals.  USDA’s summer meals programs help fill that gap, serving over 191 million meals to children last summer alone!  Community centers, libraries, day camps, churches, and more can all sign up to host a summer meals site through the summer meals programs, but schools make for a particularly good site since they already have food production facilities in place for serving meals throughout the school year.  The Farm to School Census found that more than one in five school districts that participate in farm to school programs report including local foods in meals served through their summer meals programs. Schools serving as summer meals sites often also offer fun, hands-on activities related to local foods that attract and engage kids in their programming.  Farm to summer activities include growing community gardens, taking a field trip to the farm, and conducting taste tests of local produce. But it’s not just the kids that are benefiting; incorporating local produce into the summer meals programs helps the entire community. Farm to summer arrangements can help increase participation for summer meals, provide a source of income for local growers and producers, and reinforce healthy habits promoted during the school year. To find out more about summer meals sites in your area, visit the Summer Site Finder.  Or to get involved yourself, consider becoming a site sponsor or helping raise awareness in your area.

"Posted by Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack in  USDA Results  Rural  Dec 17,   This week, at my request, USDA Rural Development and Farm Service Agency staff kicked off a series of meetings intended to gather ideas about ways to spark job creation and economic growth in rural America. This request is a direct result of the Forum on Jobs and Economic Growth that President Obama hosted at the White House earlier this month. Because of the importance of this effort, I have asked that these meetings be held in every state, and in territories including Guam and Puerto Rico. We intend to complete all of them by February 1 and provide meeting directly to the White House.  Rural Development State Directors along with Farm Service Agency State Executive Directors, are the hosts and those invited to participate include business owners, members of the community, state and local officials, union representatives, non-profit service providers and economists.  The objective is clear:  discuss steps that can be taken to make the economy grow and put Americans back to work. All of these meetings are public events and anyone with an interest in boosting the economy is welcome to attend. Each State and Executive Director will prepare a report on the meeting in their state and the will be provided to the White House. As I travel across the country, I continue to meet Americans who face great challenges.  It’s important to not only find a way to provide them with opportunities, it is necessary to restore their hope.  President Obama believes in nurturing strong, robust, and vibrant rural communities, but the best way to do that is to find a way to provide those living in rural towns with meaningful, financially rewarding jobs. As a former governor and mayor I know how important this effort is. I hope you’ll participate. To learn more, go to the Rural Development Job Roundtables Schedule and the News Release “USDA to Host Roundtables on Jobs, Economic Growth.” More meetings are being scheduled so if you don’t see your state listed, check back or contact your State Rural Development or FSA office for more information.

"USDA One Health Joint Working Group Co-Chair and Deputy Administrator, Animal Production and Protection, USDA Agricultural Research Service in  Animals  Plants  Nov 18,  ARS scientists identifying bacterial pathogens in the lab. Photo by Peggy Greb. Antibiotics are lifesavers. We depend on them to treat bacterial infections and diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis and strep throat, as well as ear infections and infected wounds. In response to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance, veterinarians and producers are moving toward more judicious antibiotic use in food animals, while keeping them healthy and ensuring that our food supply remains safe. This is especially important because certain bacterial strains have become resistant to some of the current antibiotics used to treat infections in humans and animals, escalating the need worldwide to find and develop alternatives to antibiotics. The USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is developing new technologies to address antibiotic resistance and reduce the use of antibiotics through agricultural management, which includes food, animals, crops and the environment—water, soil and climate. This research falls into USDA’s One Health approach when mitigating the problems associated with antibiotic resistance.  One Health is the concept that the health of animals, the health of people, and the viability of ecosystems are intricately linked. A One Health approach embraces the idea that a disease problem impacting the health of humans, animals, and the environment can only be solved through improved communication, cooperation, and collaboration across disciplines and institutions. With its partners, USDA’s objective through this multidisciplinary approach is to preserve, maintain or reduce health risks to animals, humans, the environment and society. USDA has gained in-depth knowledge about antimicrobial resistance through its work on the agricultural environment, animal health and food safety. Over the years, scientists have developed and patented new technologies that could help reduce the use of antibiotics. Discoveries include using natural supplements like vitamin D to treat a condition of dairy cows called “mastitis,” which affects milk quality and production of cattle. Vitamin D, as well as yeast, also has the potential to treat turkey diseases. In addition, scientists have shown that non-antibiotic methods, such as essential oils in citrus, reduce foodborne pathogens found in the gut of animals; that phytochemicals—natural chemicals found in such plants as safflower, plums and peppers—enhance the immune system of chickens; and that certain natural compounds kill foodborne pathogens like Salmonella or Escherichia coli O157:H7. Other research breakthroughs include creating new, effective antimicrobials and vaccines to fight such pathogens as Salmonella and Campylobacter to lower their incidence in chickens and turkeys and help keep consumers healthy. Finding alternatives to antibiotics has become a global issue as the demand for animal food products increases to meet the nutritional needs of a growing population. ARS scientists continue to seek solutions by developing new methods to control and prevent animal diseases and reduce bacterial pathogens in our food supply. ARS scientists are studying a variety of techniques to ensure our food supply remains safe. Photo by Peggy Greb.

By preventing disease, farmers may not have to resort to antibiotic treatment as frequently. 7. **Synthetic peptides**: Synthetic peptides are chains of amino acids engineered to mimic or enhance natural antimicrobial peptide functions. Researchers at USDA-ARS are investigating their potential as a novel method for reducing microbial loads in animals without using antibiotics. These alternatives aim to address the growing issue of antibiotic resistance while also promoting more sustainable and healthier practices within animal agriculture.

"Montana Range Riding Aids Ranchers, Mitigates Conflicts  As silvery moonlight washed across the Montana meadow, it sent long shadows over the grass. Tonight, I didn’t need the gentle clang of the grazing bell to tell me where the horses were feeding. My leggy quarter horse was as brightly silver-white as the full moon. The distant lowing of cows across the meadow confirmed that all was well. Somewhere in the distance, a wolf pack was probably making evening rounds, but tonight they likely wouldn’t visit this meadow. I swung up into my horse trailer’s tack room and wriggled into my sleeping bag as my dogs made way for my arrival. The next morning I’d rise at daybreak and head toward the sound of the cattle.  Jessianne Castle, Biological Science Technician, USDA Wildlife Services  Posted in  Animals  Nov 10,   Respond to this story","What role do wolves play in the ecosystem described in the story, particularly with regards to their interactions with ranchers and livestock?","In the story, wolf packs are mentioned as making evening rounds, but it's implied that they don't visit this particular meadow, suggesting a potential conflict between wolves and ranchers. The text doesn't provide further information on the role of wolves in the ecosystem beyond their possible interactions with ranchers and livestock.","Unfortunately, you didn't provide the story. However, I can still give you a general answer based on typical ecological roles of wolves. In many ecosystems where wolves coexist with ranching activities, they play several key roles: 1. **Predation control**: Wolves prey upon herbivores such as deer, elk, and sometimes even domestic livestock (cattle and sheep). This predation helps regulate the populations of these species, preventing them from overgrazing and maintaining a balance within their ecosystems. 2. **Ecosystem engineering**: By killing certain herbivore species, wolves can create an environment that favors other vegetation types or species that might be suppressed by those herbivores. 3. **Trophic cascades**: Wolf predation affects not only the populations of prey species but also can cascade through other trophic levels within the ecosystem. For example, a decrease in wolf numbers could allow deer populations to increase, leading to overgrazing and changes in vegetation structure that might favor different types of plants or animals. 4. **Ecological integrity**: Wolves contribute to maintaining the ecological integrity of an area by controlling prey populations, which can help prevent degradation of habitats and promote biodiversity. Regarding interactions with ranchers and livestock: 1. **Livestock depredation**: Unfortunately, wolves sometimes target domestic livestock, leading to conflicts between wildlife conservation efforts and agricultural interests. 2. **Predator-prey dynamics**: The presence of wolves can affect the behavior and distribution of livestock, potentially leading to economic impacts on ranching activities. 3. **Human-wolf conflict management**: Efforts to mitigate conflicts between humans (ranchers) and wolves often involve strategies such as wolf population control measures (hunting or lethal removal), compensation for lost livestock, education about coexistence with wildlife, and sometimes the use of deterrents like guard animals or fencing. These dynamics highlight the complex relationships within ecosystems where human activities intersect with natural processes involving wild predators.",0.01281305069282237,0.19318181818181818,0.06285714285714285,0.09659090909090909,0.8355570435523987

"NRCS Mississippi in  Initiatives  May 14,   Many children believe their food comes from the grocery store. But a class of 23 Mississippi second-graders knows better than that – the delicious food they love starts with a seed. Students from Madison Avenue Elementary plant a People’s Garden in Mississippi in honor of the upcoming 150th anniversary of USDA. Students from Madison Avenue Elementary visited a new People’s Garden at an office of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and planted seeds of squash, watermelon, pumpkin, cucumber and, of course, the “Abraham Lincoln” tomato. Earth Team volunteers joined employees from NRCS’ Science and Technology Center to teach the youngsters about growing fruits and vegetables and the history of USDA. They learned of USDA’s upcoming 150th anniversary and its origins with President Lincoln. The People’s Garden effort started three years ago, and this central Mississippi garden is one of more than 1,500 People’s Gardens across the nation. The garden’s star plant is the “Abraham Lincoln” tomato, an heirloom variety first introduced in by the W.H. Buckbee seed company. Not only did they have a chance to get their hands dirty, but they had a party and sang “Happy Birthday” to USDA while enjoying a pumpkin cupcake. Students from Madison Avenue Elementary plant a People’s Garden in Mississippi in honor of the upcoming 150th anniversary of USDA. It would not be a party without conservation mascot Sammy Soil, who made a special appearance. Students also enjoyed meeting the garden’s guard – a scarecrow made from farmers’ clothes and recycled grocery bags. Nancy Magee, an NRCS program expert, organized the event and sees the plantings as a great way to connect students to the origin of food and explain the role farmers play in their lives. The garden is nearby Strawberry Park, a city green space with a busy walking trail. Magee said the garden’s location informs passersby about USDA and the People’s Garden. Plus, it is a beautiful asset to the office, she said. As children were boarding the school bus, after their visit to the new garden, she heard one student tell another, “I’m going to come back in a week and see how they’re growing.” That is exactly what Magee wanted to hear.

Some of these hazards include: 1. **Radioactive contamination**: High levels of radioactive isotopes such as cesium-137, strontium-90, and plutonium-239 remain in the soil, water, and air within the CEZ and Polesie Reserve. These isotopes can be ingested or inhaled, posing a risk to humans and wildlife. 2. **Radiation exposure**: Areas within the CEZ and Polesie Reserve still have elevated radiation levels, which can lead to radiation sickness, cancer, and other health problems for people who venture into these areas without proper protection. 3. **Radioactive hotspots**: There are several radioactive ""hotspots"" or areas with extremely high radiation levels, often near abandoned buildings, within the CEZ and Polesie Reserve. These hotspots can be particularly hazardous to humans and animals. 4. **Contaminated water sources**: Water sources within the CEZ and Polesie Reserve may be contaminated with radioactive isotopes, posing a risk to aquatic life and potentially affecting human consumption. 5. **Mutagenic effects on flora and fauna**: The prolonged presence of radioactive materials can have mutagenic effects on plants and animals in these areas, leading to genetic mutations and other health problems. Despite ongoing efforts to decontaminate the area, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and Polesie Radioecological Reserve remain largely off-limits due to these environmental hazards.",0.02618885311612354,0.08979591836734695,0.07407407407407408,0.08979591836734695,0.8416877388954163

"Research Microbiologist, Agricultural Research Service, National Animal Disease Center in  Animals  Health and Safety  Research and Science  Nov 20,  ARS remains committed to conducting research to our overall understanding of antimicrobial resistance in swine pathogens. This week is World Antibiotic Awareness Week and USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) remains committed to using a “One Health” approach in conducting research that will identify solutions to help prolong the usefulness of a very precious resource—antibiotics. For example, ARS research includes understanding how common production practices might impact antimicrobial resistance and understanding whether certain animal pathogens may be a public health concern. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one bacteria type that is a public health concern because of its resistance to some antibiotics which can make it difficult to treat. MRSA has been found in livestock – mainly in swine. One particular MRSA strain, called ST5, has raised additional public health concerns because it is a major cause of human infections globally. To address these public health concerns, ARS conducted research to determine whether production practices like using in-feed zinc as an antidiarrheal agent contribute to the emergence and spread of MRSA in U.S. swine populations, and if ST5 bacterial isolates from swine and from humans are genetically related. ARS demonstrated that applying zinc in feed does not play a role in the prevalence of livestock-associated MRSA ST5 in the U.S. swine population. More importantly, ARS found that ST5 isolates from agricultural sources are genetically distinct and separate from clinical MRSA ST5 isolates obtained from human clinical settings. Specifically, isolates from agricultural sources were found to be extremely similar to each other within farms and lacked genes typically carried by human isolates. Collectively, ARS indicate that livestock-associated MRSA and clinical MRSA ST5 isolates are genetically distinct and transmission and/or genetic exchange between them is not currently occurring based on the findings in this study. ARS researchers are continuing to build on these results to further determine the distribution and impact of livestock-associated-MRSA ST5 outside of the livestock setting. As we celebrate World Antibiotic Awareness Week, we remain committed to a “One-Health” approach to prevent, not just react to, complex public and animal health issues. The information gained from these studies is important to our overall understanding of animal pathogens, and any potential risks to public health.

Specifically, isolates from swine lacked genes typically carried by human isolates and were extremely similar to each other within farms.","Research has shown that MRSA ST5 isolates from swine (agricultural sources) and humans are genetically closely related. Studies have found a high degree of similarity in the DNA sequences among MRSA ST5 isolates from pigs, people who work with pigs, and patients in hospitals. One study published in the journal PLOS ONE found that 73% of MRSA isolates from swine farms in Spain belonged to the ST5 spa type (a subtyping method for MRSA). Another study in the United States identified a high frequency of MRSA ST5 among humans who worked with pigs, and also detected this strain in patients at hospitals near these farms. The genetic similarity between MRSA ST5 isolates from swine and humans suggests that there is likely an exchange of bacteria between these two settings. This has significant implications for infection control practices, as it indicates the potential for transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria between agricultural settings and human communities.

"Taking a Bite out of the Local Apple in the Windy City  March is National Nutrition Month, and local food plays an important role in providing Americans with fresh, healthy fuel for their bodies. From farmers to financiers to schools and hospitals, there is a lot of passion for sharing good food by supporting strong local and regional food systems. I experienced this firsthand during my trip to Chicago, Ill., where I spoke at last week’s Good Food Festival & Conference. The trip came on the heels of a recent announcement that USDA is making $97 million available to expand access to healthy food and support rural economies.  Grants from my agency -- the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) – make up over $90 million of that funding.  AMS was a sponsor and exhibitor at the trade show, where we shared information with stakeholders about the many resources we have to support local and regional food systems. Through our Specialty Crop Block Grant Program and Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program (comprised of the Farmers Market Promotion Program and the Local Food Promotion Program), AMS supports producers, local food entrepreneurs, and rural and urban communities across the country.

"Media Relations Officer, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Oct 17,  According to the World Wildlife Fund, the American Pika (Ochotona princeps) could be the first mammal victim of climate change (US Forest Service Photo). In Scanning the Conservation Horizon, a report published by the National Wildlife Federation, with support from the U.S. Forest Service and other partners, scientists describe climate change as an increasing threat to species and ecosystems.  Addressing this threat requires the right answers, which can only come from asking the right questions. Through extensive research, U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station scientists have developed a 22-question measurement tool called a System for Assessing Vulnerability of Species.  The tool will help land managers gauge the impact of climate change on land animals and make decisions about protecting threatened species.  Questions evaluate projected changes to animal habitats, physical functions, major life cycle events and interactions with other animal species, and their potential to cope with those changes. Users must chose from three answers associated with each question, which will identify traits and issues related to animal vulnerabilities. One question, for example, asks, “Are specific habitat components for breeding expected to change within the associated vegetation type?”  To determine vulnerability, users of the tool must answer if the breeding habitat components are expected to increase, decrease or be unchanged. Assuming climate change projections are correct, users then will note whether the information available is “adequate” or “inadequate” to assign a score for each question.  If the information is sufficient, an overall score will be assigned, representing the species’ relative vulnerability to climate change. The tool focuses solely on the effects of climate change on land animals. Scores can be used to rank at-risk animal species and identify vulnerability “hot spots” within large landscapes, such as national forests. “This tool doesn’t provide a definitive answer about the extent climate change will affect animal species,” said Deborah Finch, program manager of the Grassland, Shrubland and Desert Ecosystems Science unit of the Rocky Mountain Research Station, “but information is power, and we’re empowering land managers to start assessing vulnerabilities and making decisions about where to direct their limited resources.” Finch, along with Megan Friggens and Karen Bagne, both Rocky Mountain Research Station researchers, developed the questions. They say that users should rely on information gathered from published materials, expert consultation and personal knowledge to complete the questionnaire. A full report of the System for Assessing Vulnerability of Species is available at here.

This information is crucial in making decisions about protecting threatened species by empowering land managers to assess vulnerabilities and direct resources effectively.","The System for Assessing Vulnerability of Species (SAVS) tool requires specific types of information to function effectively. These include: 1. **Species data**: Information about the species, such as its taxonomy, distribution range, population size, and trends. 2. **Habitat and ecosystem data**: Details about the habitats where the species lives, including characteristics like climate, geology, vegetation, and hydrology. 3. **Threats data**: Records of threats affecting the species, including human activities like hunting, pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change. 4. **Conservation status data**: Information on the species' conservation status, such as its Red List category or protected area designation. This information is crucial for making informed decisions about protecting threatened species because it allows users to: 1. **Assess vulnerability**: SAVS uses this data to evaluate the risk of extinction faced by a species. 2. **Identify priority species**: By analyzing the threats and conservation status, SAVS helps identify which species are most in need of protection. 3. **Develop effective conservation plans**: The tool provides insights for prioritizing conservation efforts, allocating resources, and identifying areas where interventions are most likely to be successful. In making decisions about protecting threatened species, this information plays a critical role by: 1. **Informing policy and management decisions**: SAVS data helps inform policies and strategies for conserving threatened species. 2. **Guiding resource allocation**: By prioritizing species based on their vulnerability and conservation status, SAVS ensures that resources are allocated effectively to maximize conservation impact. 3. **Enhancing collaboration and coordination**: The tool facilitates communication among stakeholders, including governments, NGOs, local communities, and scientists, to ensure a coordinated approach to species conservation.

"USDA Farm to School Regional Lead for the Mountain Plains Region and Helen Dombalis, Programs Director and Interim Policy Director for the National Farm to School Network in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Nov 18,  Lunch at a Weld County School District 6 elementary school featuring local products: grass-finished beef, pinto beans, local certified organic apples and greenhouse tomatoes & cucumbers A bin of acorn squash sits on a pallet at the Weld County School District 6 central kitchen, right next to a bin of yellow onions and a 1,000 pound tote of russet potatoes – all locally-grown. A walk through the facility is enough to convince anyone that Weld County School District 6 is committed to scratch-cooked, locally-grown food for its 22,000 students at 35 schools.  In this rural Colorado school district, where over 40 languages are spoken at home and 66 percent of students are eligible for free or reduced price meals, fresh, tasty food is the norm – even down to the green chili, a southwestern favorite roasted in-house, using three varieties of local peppers. About a quarter of the central kitchen is dedicated to processing fresh fruits and vegetables.  Mushrooms are sliced, carrots are shredded and onions are diced. With funding from a USDA Farm to School Grant in , this food hub portion of the kitchen was furnished with tables, wash stations and equipment to process local food for Weld County’s own meals and for other districts in the area. Locally-grown acorn squash and onions stored in the central kitchen for a harvest lunch in November Natalie Leffler is the Food Hub Manager at Weld County School District 6. Her job is to coordinate partnerships with farmers, ranchers and local businesses to source as much local food as possible, defined as grown or produced within a 400 mile radius. Leffler manages an annual procurement to establish relationships and contracts. Growers must submit a food safety checklist with their bid documents, which she confirms with an in-person site visit, so the district can rest-assured that the local products are safe.  Matt Poling, the school district’s Executive Chef, ensures that menu planning, recipe development and production processes maximize the use of local products. The freezer is full of shredded local zucchini (for blending into tomato sauce), mirepoix (the age-old combination of onion, celery, and carrots used as a base for soups) and other local ingredients to incorporate into meals in the off-season.  The team even prepares mashed potatoes made with local red potatoes and home-made gravy. Locally-grown and dried pinto beans are sorted and cooked into refried beans or chili.  Just outside the facility are four giant compost bins designed to turn food scraps from the kitchen into compost for the district’s school gardens, funded through an innovative partnership with the West Greeley Conservation District.  Sometimes El Fuego, the district’s flashy food truck, is parked outside, too. But typically the truck is out roaming the district, serving up favorites like barbacoa street tacos and yakisoba noodle bowls to students and school staff. Four compost bins, funded through a creative partnership with the West Greeley Conservation District, turn food scraps from the central kitchen into compost for school gardens The district goes beyond buying local food – school gardens, student wellness and food education are three major areas of focus. Plans are underway to transform a sandy, unused portion of a nearby schoolyard into an educational farm focused on student engagement and employment.  Called “Growing Grounds,” the project vision includes raised beds, an orchard, a teaching kitchen, hoop houses and a greenhouse.

"AMS Deputy Administrator, Transportation and Marketing Program in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Jun 09,  Columbia Heights Farmers Market shoppers enjoy locally-produced food. USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) grants are helping farmers markets implement creative programs to support local food producers and build healthy communities. Photo courtesy Mr T in DC. Nutritional classes, purple beets, basil pesto and dark roast coffee - it’s not your father’s farmers market.  The entire local food system is maturing and farmers markets are offering more and more community-focused services. Many farmers markets now give their customers a chance to learn about locally-produced foods, in addition to buying and consuming them. USDA is a proud partner and supporter of local and regional food systems through our programs, grants and technical services. USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) grants are helping farmers markets implement creative programs to support local food producers and build healthy communities. One example of an AMS grant success story is Community Foodworks, which manages the Columbia Heights Farmers Market and six other markets across Washington, DC, and Northern Virginia. Leveraging a Farmers Market Promotion Program grant, Foodworks established a new Wednesday evening farmers market to increase access to locally produced food in the Columbia Heights neighborhood. The program included “Bonus Bucks” to give shoppers who use Federal food benefits (SNAP, WIC, Senior FMNP) more purchasing power. The grant also helped Foodworks to develop a mixed-income CSA program – a weekly share from the market’s producers with options for individual or family-sized shares or a subsidized family-sized share for SNAP customers. The new market had a real impact on the community: Over half of the customers reported eating more vegetables since the market opened  A majority of market visitors reported the Bonus Bucks program was the main reason they shopped at the market  Most customers agreed that spending their benefits at the market was easy  In addition to their farmers market efforts, Foodworks offers other creative programs to help support the community.  In partnership with another local social service organization, Foodworks is able to provide fresh, local food home delivery services for seniors. They serve as a site for USDA summer meals, distributing 3-4 dozen snacks to hungry children at their two weekday markets. They also offer community educational classes on nutrition, obesity, and diabetes intervention. In the fall of , Foodworks piloted a new Veterans Vegetable Prescription Program to distribute weekly fruit and vegetable vouchers to eligible Veterans, seeing a redemption rate of 42 percent. These are great innovations and partnerships leveraged by Foodworks.  As we continue to support the marketing and distribution of locally produced foods for U.S. farmers and ranchers, we look to see more impacts resulting from our investments.  Under this Administration, USDA has invested more than $1 billion in over 40,000 local and regional food businesses and infrastructure projects. These activities contribute to USDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food (KYF2) initiative, which coordinates efforts across USDA. Our recently-revamped website provides USDA resources for every point in the local food supply chain, including grants, loans, and other instructional guides.  Additionally, the KYF2 Compass maps local and regional food system investments across the country. More information on how USDA investments are connecting producers with consumers and expanding rural economic opportunities is available in Chapter IV of USDA Results on Medium. “The growth of Community Foodworks and our essential programs couldn't be possible without opportunities like the Farmers Market Promotion Program from AMS,” said Nick Stavely, Community Foodworks Farmers Market & Incentives Program Manager. “We're thankful for the role that the AMS grants played in the organization's expansion and program development.” Photo of Columbia Heights Farmers Market courtesy Mr T in DC.

Information developed by the Center will be made available through the network of USDA Climate Hubs to assist private forestland managers, farmers and ranchers in reaching their conservation goals. With state-of-the-art technology and the development of new tools and techniques, the main objective of the Center is to provide cost-effective and reliable genomic for improved species monitoring. By having more robust information, state and federal managers are better able to evaluate the genetic health and population viability of fish and wildlife species across the landscape. The discovery of a new fish species and the detection of invasive species are among the Center’s many contributions to the advancement of science and management. Imagine an expansive landscape, filled with different and remote terrain, and being asked to determine if the area has been impacted by a new invasive species. This is a daunting challenge that land managers face on a regular basis. One of the Center’s specialties, analyzing samples of environmental DNA, or eDNA, shows great promise in addressing this challenge. This type of DNA has been separated from organisms into the surrounding environment and can be found in soil, water and air. Forest Service scientists are developing ways to determine what species are present by simply sampling a cup of water from locations across the landscape. “eDNA is a highly sensitive method for detecting organisms in low abundance and is generally faster and extremely cost effective compared to traditional methods used to detect exotic or endangered species,” said Dr. Michael Schwartz, director of the center. The use of eDNA is an innovative approach to inventorying and monitoring fish and wildlife species. eDNA is particularly effective for detecting rare species that can be difficult to sample using traditional methods. For example, researchers at the Rocky Mountain Research Station have been working with partners and collaborators on the threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) since . Bull trout is a culturally significant species to several Tribes in the Northwest and Columbia River Basin. It is also a prized game fish, and land management and recreational angling are significantly influenced by whether or not this species is present in a given watershed. This species is particularly sensitive to changes in habitat and is also threatened by the introduction of the nonnative brook trout (S. fontinalis). Forest Service scientists have developed sampling methods to make eDNA surveys a reliable and accessible option for managers to detect the presence of bull trout and their invasive competitor, brook trout. Forest Service scientists continue to develop eDNA techniques for detecting priority fish and wildlife.  eDNA is just one method of non-invasive genetic sampling, which uses forensic-style DNA samples to monitor rare and sensitive species, employed by the Center.

"Research and Development, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Apr 01,  Cedar sculpin (Cottus schitsuumsh). (Emily Harrington/E.H. Illustration) U.S. Forest Service scientists at the Rocky Mountain Research Station in Missoula, Mont., have identified a new species of fish—the cedar sculpin (Cottus schitsuumsh). Although thousands of new species are described by scientists each year, only a small percentage of them are animal species, and even fewer are found in the United States, underscoring the importance of this discovery. Freshwater sculpins, with their characteristic large heads and fins, are bottom dwellers that can be found in cold, fast-moving streams throughout North America. Biologists have long suspected that there were undescribed species of sculpins in the Upper Columbia River Basin, but lacked the tools to recognize them. Cedar sculpin populations were previously thought to be shorthead sculpin (Cottus confusus), an understandable misidentification given that sculpins are notoriously difficult to identify based on their physical features. “Through our collaboration with the University of Montana, we uncovered morphological and genetic evidence demonstrating that two species have been masquerading under a single name for over 50 years,” said Michael Young, a Forest Service research fisheries biologist. The new species of sculpin was discovered in the Coeur d’Alene and St. Joe River basins in Idaho and part of the Clark Fork River Basin in Montana. In naming the species, the scientists consulted with elders of the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, whose historical homeland overlaps with the current range of this fish.  The scientific name for the species, Cottus schitsuumsh, is derived from the name for the Tribe, Schitsu’umsh, which means “those who were found here.” The common name refers to the western redcedar, a tree often found along streams in this region. While not commercially valuable in and of themselves, sculpins are well-known to anglers as a food source for big trout—a famous fly pattern, the muddler minnow, is designed to resemble a sculpin—and as indicators of water quality. The cedar sculpin is abundant in tributaries that also support westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. Forest Service scientists and their partners believe that much hidden diversity remains among sculpin populations throughout the Western U.S., with additional species waiting to be identified. They are dedicated to helping unravel these mysteries in order to conserve and sustainably manage our natural resources. Top, side and bottom view of a male cedar sculpin.

This finding underscores the need to conserve and sustainably manage natural resources, particularly in watersheds that support other commercially valuable or ecologically important species such as westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout.","I couldn't find any information about the cedar sculpin (Cottus schitsuumsh), its discovery in the Upper Columbia River Basin, or its relationship to conservation efforts for the westslope cutthroat trout. It's possible that this is a specific or local phenomenon not widely documented or recognized. However, I can provide some general information about the significance of discovering new fish species and their relation to conservation efforts. Discovering new fish species, such as the cedar sculpin (if it exists), can be significant for several reasons: 1. **Taxonomic importance**: New discoveries can contribute to a better understanding of biodiversity and help scientists classify and understand evolutionary relationships among different species. 2. **Ecological significance**: The discovery of new species can provide insights into their ecological roles, habitats, and interactions with other organisms in their environment. 3. **Conservation implications**: Discovering new species or re-discovering previously overlooked ones can highlight the need for conservation efforts to protect these newly found populations. If the cedar sculpin is related to conservation efforts for the westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi), it's possible that: 1. **Shared habitats**: Both species might inhabit the same or similar habitats, which could inform conservation strategies and habitat protection for both species. 2. **Competition and coexistence**: Studies on the cedar sculpin may reveal insights into how different fish species interact in their environment, potentially shedding light on factors influencing the abundance of westslope cutthroat trout.

"Tree Rings Tell the History of Fire and Forest Health  Why are Rocky Mountain Research Station scientists sampling tree rings in the Pinaleño Mountains of southeast Arizona? Because tree ring samples reveal the history of fire. When fire scorches a tree, the tree floods its wound with sap, which protects the wound from wood rot decay for hundreds of years, as long as fires keep burning at a low intensity.  Diane Banegas, Research and Development, USDA Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Apr 12,   Respond to this story",What role do tree rings play in recording the history of fire events in the Pinaleño Mountains?,Tree rings record the history of fire events by preserving information about when fires occurred and burned at low intensities.,"Tree rings can provide valuable information on the history of fire events in the Pinaleño Mountains by serving as natural, sequential, and dated records. Here's how: 1. **Fire scars**: When a forest fire occurs, it creates a visible scar on the trunk of trees that were exposed to high temperatures. This scar can be visible from one year to several years after the fire, depending on factors such as tree species, age, and environmental conditions. 2. **Tree growth rings**: Tree rings are formed annually, with each ring representing a year of growth. By analyzing the width, density, and characteristics of these rings, researchers can infer environmental conditions during that period, including temperature, precipitation, and fire events. 3. **Dendrochronology**: The study of tree rings is called dendrochronology. By dating tree cores from trees in the Pinaleño Mountains, scientists can reconstruct a timeline of past fire events with high precision. This involves matching ring patterns between trees to establish a continuous record spanning centuries or even millennia. 4. **Fire frequency and severity**: Tree-ring analysis can provide insights into the frequency and severity of fires in the region over time. For example, researchers might find evidence of more frequent fires during periods of drought or increased temperatures. 5. **Historical context**: By correlating tree-ring data with historical records, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how human activities, such as land use changes or fire management practices, may have influenced fire patterns in the Pinaleño Mountains. By analyzing tree rings and the associated fire scars, scientists can reconstruct the history of fire events in the Pinaleño Mountains, providing valuable information on: * Fire frequency, duration, and intensity * Ecosystem response to fires (e.g., changes in vegetation composition or soil conditions) * Potential triggers for fires (e.g., climate change, land use patterns) * Opportunities for managing forests to reduce the risk of future fires The study of tree rings has become a powerful tool for understanding the complex interactions between fire, forests, and climate in the Pinaleño Mountains and similar ecosystems.",0.013022127073771046,0.08287292817679558,0.03333333333333334,0.0718232044198895,0.8367135524749756
"After the Fire - Wood Waste Put to Work  Biochar, or wood waste, is a porous carbon substance that results from burning wood in the absence of oxygen. It is typically created when burning chunks of wood are covered by ash, soil or a lid, which insulates the coals and starves them of oxygen.

Here are some of the observed effects: **Effects on Soil:** 1. **Vitrification**: High temperatures can cause the formation of a glass-like, amorphous substance from the soil's mineral particles. This process, known as vitrification, can lead to a hard, non-porous crust that prevents water and air from penetrating the soil. 2. **Soil Dehydration**: Water is rapidly evaporated from the soil, causing it to become dehydrated and potentially leading to structural instability. 3. **Loss of Nutrients**: The high temperatures can cause the breakdown of organic matter in the soil, releasing nutrients into the atmosphere as gases (such as nitrogen oxides). This can lead to a temporary loss of essential nutrients for plant growth. **Effects on Plant Life:** 1. **Instantaneous Death**: Temperatures above 2,000°F can kill plants instantly by causing their cell membranes to rupture and leading to rapid dehydration. 2. **Complete Carbonization**: The intense heat can completely combust vegetation, leaving behind only ash and a few remaining organic compounds (such as charcoal). 3. **Soil Sterility**: High temperatures can also lead to the death of soil microorganisms, which are essential for decomposing organic matter and recycling nutrients. In summary, extremely high temperatures during wildfires can cause devastating effects on both soil and plant life, leading to immediate loss of vegetation, structural instability in the soil, and potential long-term consequences for ecosystem health.",7.246256251485447e-79,0.16783216783216784,0.07042253521126761,0.1118881118881119,0.8590502738952637

"NRCS Mississippi in  Conservation  Nov 18,  NRCS provided technical assistance to the Choctaws in the creation of Lake Pushmataha, a 285-acre lake in Neshoba County. November is American Indian Heritage Month and offers a great time to recognize the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians for their stellar record as stewards of the environment. The tribe knows the value of land. That’s why it is working with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to improve wildlife habitat in its communities across the state. The Choctaws have used NRCS’ Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) to improve 860 acres in Carroll County on their property Malmasion this year. Malmasion is the site of a plantation that was built among Choctaw hunting grounds. The plantation burned in the s, and the Choctaws purchased the land in . The tribe, through its director of natural resources, Jason Grisham, is implementing wildlife conservation practices that enhance and restore habitat for wildlife. While habitat has improved for deer, this land also provides refuge for other native animals, including turkeys, squirrels and songbirds. Since the tribe started working with NRCS, oak trees are dropping ample acorns, a favorite food of deer and other wildlife. Tribal members are also taking down bigger bucks—many with traditional bows. A big part of wildlife management is the use of prescribed burning for habitat diversity. This practice is not only used by NRCS conservationists, but is also a method the Choctaws have used for hundreds of years and are currently using to enhance this land. Forest management is a big part of Jason Grisham’s (right) duties. Choctaws use the firewood for heat during the winter, but the bulk of it is used during funeral services, where a perpetual fire must be maintained for three days. NRCS tribal liaison Tim Oakes has worked with the tribe’s forestry department on managing the forests, providing technical assistance on thinning. As the habitat matures, the Choctaws cut trees to provide firewood. It is tribal custom to use firewood during funeral services, where a fire is kept burning for three days. The Choctaws are able to meet the demand through proper forest management. NRCS has also teamed up with the Choctaws in an educational project called “Wetland Discovery.” This 600-foot boardwalk meanders through a wetland constructed with WHIP funds. The elevated walkway has signs in written in English and Choctaw describing the native species of plants and animals. Grisham said Tribal leaders have recognized the benefits of working with NRCS in recent years, and that future partnerships are on the horizon.

"Worms at Work, Recycling Food Waste  Did you know that worms can recycle your food scraps? Vermicomposting, or worm composting, turns food scraps into a beneficial soil amendment that can be used in home gardens, landscaping, turfgrass, farms and more. Over one-third of all available food goes uneaten through loss or waste. Composting keeps food waste out of landfills where it decomposes and releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas.  Nina Bhattacharyya, USDA Office of Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production  Posted in  Conservation  Farming  Initiatives  May 04,   1 Response",What benefits can be achieved through vermicomposting food scraps compared to letting them decompose in landfills?,"Through vermicomposting (worm composting), food scraps are converted into a beneficial soil amendment, whereas letting them decompose in landfills releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas.","Vermicomposting, which involves using worms to break down organic matter, offers several benefits over traditional decomposition methods like landfills. Some of these advantages include: 1. **Faster Decomposition Rate**: Worms process the organic materials much faster than other microorganisms and decompose food scraps in a shorter span. This rapid breakdown results in an excellent quality compost. 2. **Improved Odor Control**: Vermicomposting minimizes unpleasant odors associated with decomposition, as the worms consume the materials more efficiently. This reduces environmental nuisance and maintains a clean atmosphere around the composting site. 3. **Higher Nutrient Value**: The compost produced through vermicomposting is rich in nutrients and can be beneficial for gardening and agriculture. It's also more fertile due to the worms' digestion process, which enhances the nutrient availability. 4. **Space Efficiency**: Vermicomposting allows for a compact composting system, reducing space requirements compared to landfills or even traditional compost piles. This makes it ideal for urban settings or areas with limited land use. 5. **No Pathogen Risk**: Vermicomposting minimizes the risk of pathogenic microorganisms in the final product due to the natural antimicrobial properties of worm secretions and waste. 6. **Cost-Effective**: Compared to commercial composting processes, vermicomposting can be a low-cost method for converting food scraps into nutrient-rich soil amendments. 7. **Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: Decomposing organic materials in landfills releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. Vermicomposting does not produce methane and reduces the amount of CO2 released during decomposition. 8. **Year-Round Operation**: Worms can decompose organic matter throughout the year regardless of temperature fluctuations, making vermicomposting a reliable option for continuous compost production. 9. **Aesthetic Appeal**: A well-maintained worm bin is visually appealing and can serve as an educational tool, promoting environmental awareness and sustainability practices. 10. **Waste Reduction**: Vermicomposting effectively reduces the volume of organic waste sent to landfills, aligning with waste reduction goals and minimizing environmental pollution. 11. **Less Water Requirement**: Compared to traditional composting, vermicomposting does not require significant water inputs for decomposition. 12. **Continuous Resource Generation**: The worms used in this process can be reused repeatedly, creating a self-sustaining cycle of resource generation and recycling.",0.019536818665204722,0.11052631578947367,0.05291005291005291,0.09473684210526315,0.8431729674339294
"Posted by Fátima Terry, Deputy Director, USDA Digital Service in  Technology  Aug 12,  The seeds of digital transformation are taking root as application reviews for our agency’s first Digital Service (DS) Fellows cohort are in progress. By establishing a dedicated fellow team at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), we will be able to improve access to USDA resources and programs across the country. Once onboarded this fall, our USDA Digital Service (DS) Fellows will work to accelerate the design, development, and delivery of customer-centric services. To gain insight on digital service best practices, we hosted the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) team at our headquarters in Washington, D.C. last month. Digital Service staff from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and other agencies shared their experience with USDS, how they are addressing current challenges, and what the future of digital services at their agencies looks like. “We are so appreciative of the great collaboration and partnership with USDS as we work to shape a Digital Service team here at USDA, and we learned a lot about how we can continue to drive this great work here across the many mission areas and missions of USDA,” said Arianne Gallagher-Welcher, Executive Director of the USDA Digital Service and Co-Founder of the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program. USDA has seen firsthand the difference digital service can make. As the People’s Department, one of our most important missions is ensuring access to nutritious and safe food. Many of our nation’s youngest children were affected when a manufacturer product recall and weakened supply chains caused an infant formula shortage in . This particularly impacted USDA customers, as families who use our Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC program) buy 56% of all the formula sold in America. With other federal partners, USDA teamed up with the USDS to develop and analyze real-time about the amount of formula available in any given U.S. location. As a result, 388 million bottles of infant formula were imported and deployed to the places that needed it most based on new and analytics. This is just one example of how digital service can deliver solutions for the federal government’s most challenging technology implementation problems. You can learn more about this and other USDS solutions in their Impact Report. Our collaborative partnership with USDS is essential as our new Digital Service team launches. Together, we will build a stronger technology organization at USDA than can more efficiently support our employees and customers in the future.

"Acting National Coordinator for USDA Climate Hubs, Office of Energy and Environmental Policy in  Climate  Farming  Forestry  Research and Science  Aug 08,  In June , Secretary Vilsack outlined a vision for agricultural solutions to environmental challenges, which included creating the Regional Climate Hubs. In , the USDA Climate Hubs were established in to serve as regional centers of climate change information and outreach to reduce risks. The Climate Hubs enhance USDA capacity to deliver science-based knowledge and practical information to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests. Early career professionals joined the Hubs to hone their science communication and engagement skills while supporting the Climate Hubs’ mission. In , Climate Hub Fellows focused on co-developing science-based information to help land managers make climate-informed decisions. Likewise, Hubs brought on interns and post-doctoral researchers. Climate Hubs were able to enhance engagements among land managers and scientists to co-develop science and technology. To mark the 10-year anniversary of Secretary Vilsack sharing his vision for the Climate Hubs, we share two highlights. Dr. Julian Reyes was a Climate Hub Fellow with the Southwest Climate Hub. During his fellowship, he developed, AgRisk Viewer, which empowers decision makers to assess their climate risks by commodity type at the county scale using long-term crop insurance from Risk Management Agency. This tool identifies areas of agricultural production risk due to extreme events to help target locations for adaptation actions. Haley Case-Scott was a Resource Assistance Program intern with the Northwest Climate Hub. During Haley’s internship, she engaged with Tribal Nations supporting government-to-government consultation for the 25th update to the Northwest Forest Plan. Haley also developed communication materials to share information about USDA programs that could support climate adaptation and mitigation. Both Reyes and Case-Scott have also worked with the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy (OSTP) to provide clear, useful, and useable science and knowledge to inform the Administration’s climate, environment, and nature actions and initiatives. “Communities and decision makers need actionable and usable climate information and services. My time with the USDA Climate Hubs has shown the power of co-production ensuring community voices are embedded in our place-based, people-centered work. These perspectives have also helped me in my work at OSTP,” Reyes said. “Serving as a Resource Assistant Program intern with the USDA Northwest Climate Hub was a great experience. It allowed me to take a deep dive into how the federal government works, and provided me the tools needed to build my professional career,” Case-Scott said.

"Key Messages on the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste  Around the world, roughly one-third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted from farm to table, amounting to around 1.3 billion tonnes per year. Covid-19 has exposed vulnerabilities in our food systems and heightened the need to remedy food loss and waste (FLW), both locally and globally.  Celia Hernandez, Program Assistant, Office of the Chief Economist  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Sep 29,   3 Responses",What are the key vulnerabilities exposed by Covid-19 that highlight the need for addressing food loss and waste globally?,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in our global food systems, highlighting the need to address food loss and waste (FLW) both locally and internationally.","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted several key vulnerabilities in global food systems, which have exposed the critical importance of addressing food loss and waste (FLW) worldwide. The main vulnerabilities include: 1. **Food System Fragility**: The pandemic has revealed the fragility of global food systems, particularly in low-income countries, where food availability, access, and affordability have been severely impacted. This highlights the need for more resilient and adaptable food systems that can withstand shocks like pandemics. 2. **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Lockdowns, border closures, and trade restrictions have caused significant disruptions to global supply chains, leading to shortages of essential food items, such as fresh produce and staples like rice and wheat. This emphasizes the need for more robust and flexible logistics systems that can adapt to changing circumstances. 3. **Food Price Volatility**: The pandemic has triggered price spikes in many countries, making food less affordable for vulnerable populations. This underscores the importance of reducing food loss and waste to increase global food availability and stabilize prices. 4. **Vulnerability to Climate Change**: The pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of food systems to climate-related shocks, such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves. Addressing FLW can help build resilience in food systems against climate change impacts. 5. **Food Insecurity and Malnutrition**: The pandemic has led to increased food insecurity and malnutrition, particularly among vulnerable populations, including the poor, women, and children. Reducing FLW can help ensure that more people have access to nutritious food. In response to these vulnerabilities, addressing FLW globally is crucial for several reasons: 1. **Food Availability**: Reducing FLW can increase global food availability by 30-50%, which would be equivalent to feeding an additional 850 million people. 2. **Economic Benefits**: Addressing FLW can generate significant economic benefits, including cost savings and job creation in the agriculture, food processing, and packaging sectors. 3. **Climate Change Mitigation**: Reducing FLW can help mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with food production, transportation, and storage. 4. **Improved Nutrition**: By increasing access to nutritious food, addressing FLW can contribute to improved nutrition and health outcomes, particularly among vulnerable populations. To address these vulnerabilities and reduce FLW globally, the following strategies are recommended: 1. **Invest in Sustainable Agriculture Practices**: Promote sustainable agriculture practices that prioritize crop selection, soil conservation, and efficient water use. 2. **Improve Food Storage and Handling**: Enhance food storage and handling infrastructure to prevent post-harvest losses and ensure safe transportation and storage of perishable foods. 3. **Implement Circular Economy Principles**: Encourage the adoption of circular economy principles in the food sector, including waste reduction, reuse, and recycling. 4. **Support Education and Awareness**: Educate consumers, producers, and policymakers about the importance of reducing FLW and promote behavior change through awareness campaigns.

"Deputy Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service’s Livestock and Poultry Program in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Dec 15,  USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and Purdue University have developed a series of training videos that illustrate proper sanitation assessment techniques to evaluate shell egg processing equipment. While the practices in these videos are in facilities that have USDA grading, they are valuable for any shell egg facility wishing to learn more about good sanitation techniques. To support emerging needs across the egg industry in recent years, AMS reviewed its internal procedures to assess equipment sanitation in shell egg processing plants. The agency visited over 30 shell egg processing facilities across the country to assess equipment sanitation and consistency. In order to document and share findings, AMS partnered with Purdue and ARS to develop this educational video series. The videos take the viewer through each phase of shell egg processing and explain how to inspect each component of the facility for sanitation effectiveness. The 18 videos are a great resource for shell egg processing facilities by illustrating what clean machines and facilities should look like prior to daily verification by USDA grading personnel.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Dec 01,  There are only a few things in life that can bring together and excite a global community, and food and sports are two of those things! USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) is tapping into these uniting experiences by shining a spotlight on high-quality, safe, delicious, and sustainably produced U.S. foods during the FIFA World Cup, underway in Qatar. This groundbreaking effort, organized by FAS’s Office of Agricultural Affairs in Dubai and the U.S. Embassy in Qatar, is introducing nearly 130,000 visitors per day to the great variety and quality of U.S. foods at the USA Pavilion. Located in the heart of Doha, in a fan zone featuring international pavilions, visitors to the USA Pavilion feel as though they’re being transported to the States through the sights, sounds, and smells of everything U.S. agriculture has to offer – including food/ag, education, and tourism. “It’s our mission at the World Cup to introduce the world to our true MVPs, America’s farmers and ranchers who work every day to grow and produce safe, nutritious, sustainable, and delicious foods and ingredients to feed and nourish the world,” said USDA Agricultural Counselor Valerie Brown. “We’ve put together a dream team of U.S. food and commodity groups and celebrity chefs who are looking to score new fans as they kick things up with cooking demonstrations, competitions, and giveaways featuring U.S. ingredients – everything from healthy treats for athletes to decadent game day foods for fans and families. Whether visitors want to learn how to make nutritious snacks with U.S. fruits, nuts, and cheese, or something more indulgent like barbeque, gumbo, and ice cream desserts, the USA Pavilion will offer food lovers from around the world a field of options – all thanks to America’s farmers and ranchers.” According to the latest trade , U.S. food and agricultural exports to the world, and the Middle East in particular, increased last fiscal year (). In , U.S. farmers and ranchers exported a record $196.4 billion of food and agricultural products to the world, of which $6.6 billion was exported to the Middle East, up 20 percent from the prior year. Consumer demand for U.S. foods and ingredients is growing in the region, especially for U.S. tree nuts, dairy products, and beef and beef products, a few of the many ingredients being showcased at the World Cup USA Pavilion in Qatar. “This year the World Cup may be more than 7,ates, but FAS is proudly representing Team USA and our food and ag MVPs back home,” added Brown. “Visitors to the USA Pavilion will travel on a food and ag tour across our wonderful country as their senses discover ingredients and products from Virginia and Louisiana, to Texas, California, Hawaii, and other amazing states in between. This international food and ag marketing and outreach effort is sure to be a win for America as millions of global consumers Try it, Taste it, See it, and Love it, at the World Cup!” For more on the USDA’s activities promoting U.S. food at the FIFA World Cup, Rod Bain with USDA Radio checked in with FAS’s Lucas Blaustein, on the ground in Doha.

"USDA Food Loss and Waste Liaison in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Jun 15,  In the United States, more than one-third of all available food goes uneaten through loss or waste and when landfilled it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. On May 26, , the U.S. Department of Agriculture hosted our first ever USDA Food Loss and Waste Innovation Fair. This free, virtual fair highlighted businesses that are creating or implementing state-of-the-art technical solutions to reduce food loss and waste throughout the food system – from farm to table – and highlighted USDA activities in this space. Three categories of booth holders showcased their food loss and waste activities, products, and innovations. First, the fair highlighted U.S. Food Loss and Waste Champions. In addition to reducing food waste in their operations, several of these food industry leaders — e.g., Sprouts Farmers Market, Sodexo, and MGM Resorts International — committed to fighting hunger by donating safe, excess food to charitable organizations. Secondly, the fair also gave a platform for USDA agencies to share their work on food loss and waste (e.g., research, funding, measurement, outreach). As one example, the joint booth by USDA Foreign Agriculture Service and Feed the Future has information on the U.S. Government’s initiative to simultaneously combat global hunger and food loss and waste. Third, the fair featured USDA-funded organizations that are developing or marketing food loss and waste reducing technologies. Among the innovations was Full Cycle Bioplastics’ patented technology, which makes a compostable bioplastic from organic waste that can help address three global problems at once — reducing food waste, climate change, and plastic pollution.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food Safety Education Staff in  Health and Safety  Jul 01,  This Fourth of July, join the revolution against foodborne illness. Summer’s rising temperatures make picnics a playground for bacteria as families prepare, cook, and eat food outside. Here are some tips to keep you safe: Pledge Allegiance to Cleanliness Wash your hands before and after you handle food:  Wet your hands with clean, running water, turn off the tap and apply soap.  Lather your hands by rubbing them together with soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.  Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds.  Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.  Dry your hands using a clean towel. Don’t have access to a faucet? Carry bottled water, soap, paper towels, hand sanitizer or disposable moist towelettes that contain at least 60 percent alcohol. Use Red, White and Blue Cutting Boards Avoid cross contamination by using separate, different colored cutting boards — one for fresh fruits and vegetables, one for cheeses, and another for raw meats. Spark Up that Grill If you’re grilling at your picnic, remember to cook raw meat and poultry to a safe minimum internal temperature: ground meats at 160 F, whole cuts of meat at 145 F with a three-minute rest time, and poultry at 165 F. Land of the Free-zer Pack coolers with bags of ice, gel packs or even frozen water bottles to store your food. Use an appliance thermometer in your cooler to monitor that your food stays chilled at 40 F or below. For more information about food safety, contact the USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline to talk to a food safety expert or chat live at ask.usda.gov from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.

"University of Georgia, Associate Professor in  Research and Science  Dec 09,  Carbon dioxide emissions from the aviation sector constitute 2.5 percent of global emissions. One way to reduce this carbon footprint is to replace conventional aviation fuel (obtained by refining crude oil) with aviation fuel derived from sustainably produced biomass feedstocks. Carinata (Brassica Carinata), also known as Ethiopian mustard, is an oilseed crop that can be grown across the southern U.S. during winter months. The oil obtained from crushed carinata seeds can be refined to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This could reduce up to 68 percent of carbon emissions compared to a unit of conventional aviation fuel in the U.S. based on the findings of a USDA-National Institute of Fooda and Agriculture funded study recently published in the journal Global Change Biology Bioenergy by Dr. Puneet Dwivedi, Asiful Alam and Farhad Masum. Carinata does not compete with traditional summer crops grown in the region and could potentially provide additional income opportunities to farmers. It improves water quality, prevents soil erosion, and supports soil health. Since it is a non-food crop, carinata-based SAF also avoids the food-versus-fuel debate. The residues after crushing carinata are high in protein and can be used as animal feed. Refining carinata oil produces other valuable bioproducts such as renewable diesel and naphtha. Currently, producing carinata-based SAF costs more than conventional aviation fuel. As part of coordinated efforts to advance sustainable avial fuel, the Biden Administration proposed tax credits for SAF production meet 100 percent of aviation fuel demand by . This incentive could potentially attract investors to establish the necessary supply chain for carinata-based SAF in the southern United States, which could drive demand for the crop and inspire farmers to grow carinata in the region.

It is a promising feedstock for the production of various bioproducts due to its unique fatty acid composition and sustainability benefits. Aside from producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), several other bioproducts can be produced from refining carinata oil, including: 1. **Biojet Fuel**: Similar to SAF, biojet fuel is a drop-in replacement for traditional jet fuels, but it is specifically designed for use in commercial and military aircraft. 2. **Biodiesel**: Carinata oil can be converted into biodiesel through a process of transesterification, which involves the reaction of the triglycerides with an alcohol (such as methanol or ethanol). 3. **Soap and Detergents**: The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) produced from carinata oil refining can be used to manufacture soaps, detergents, and other cleaning products. 4. **Surfactants**: FAMEs derived from carinata oil can also be used as surfactants in various industrial applications, such as textiles, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. 5. **Bioplastics**: Carinata-based bioplastics are being developed for use in packaging, disposable cutlery, and other single-use products. These bioproducts offer a range of sustainable alternatives to traditional fossil fuel-derived materials, while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with their production and use.",4.826522266402496e-232,0.009433962264150945,0.0,0.009433962264150945,0.7937748432159424

Other recent updates include on practice enhancements and bundles supported by the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and soil health performance measures. Two cropland soil health performance measures were added. The Cropland Soil Health and Sustainability measure identifies land units where at least two practices are applied to improve soil health during a single year. Practices include crop rotation, no-till, reduced till, cover crops, and CSP enhancements and bundles. The Cropland Soil Health Management System measure identifies areas where a group of conservation practices and enhancements (or bundles) are applied that address four basic soil health principles: minimize disturbance, maximize soil cover, maximize biodiversity, and maximize the presence of living roots.

"Apprenticeships Develop Inspectors Skills to Protect Organic Integrity  Every year, thousands of farmers, ranchers, and businesses grow and produce organic products – and all these operations are audited by qualified organic inspectors. Organic inspectors visit fields, pastures, or processing plants to conduct annual reviews where they meet with farmers and processors, ask questions, and observe processes. Annual inspections by qualified inspectors strengthen consumer trust in the USDA organic seal and ensure families are getting what they paid for when they choose to buy organic.  Laura Gallagher, NOP Program Analyst, Agricultural Marketing Service  Posted in  Farming  Organic  Apr 24,   Respond to this story","What role do qualified inspectors play in ensuring the integrity of the USDA organic seal and protecting consumer trust when they conduct annual reviews with farmers, ranchers, and processors?","Qualified inspectors play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of the USDA organic seal by conducting annual reviews, asking questions, observing processes, and auditing operations to guarantee that farms, ranches, and businesses are meeting organic standards.","Qualified inspectors play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of the USDA organic seal and protecting consumer trust by conducting annual reviews with farmers, ranchers, and processors. Here's how: 1. **Verification of compliance**: Inspectors verify that farms, ranches, and processing facilities are complying with the USDA National Organic Program (NOP) standards. This includes checking for proper record-keeping, equipment cleaning, pest management, and crop rotation. 2. **Ensuring organic practices**: Inspectors ensure that producers are following organic farming and handling practices, such as using only approved substances, maintaining separate storage areas for conventional and organic products, and adhering to animal welfare standards. 3. **Monitoring for potential non-compliances**: Inspectors monitor farms, ranches, and processing facilities for any potential non-compliances with the NOP standards, such as the use of prohibited substances or failure to maintain accurate records. 4. **Providing education and guidance**: Experienced inspectors provide educational resources and guidance to producers on best organic practices, helping them improve their operations and maintain compliance with USDA regulations. 5. **Supporting continuous improvement**: By regularly reviewing and evaluating farm, ranch, and processing facility operations, inspectors help producers identify areas for improvement, encouraging a culture of continuous quality enhancement. Through these activities, qualified inspectors play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the USDA organic seal, which is essential for: * Protecting consumer trust by ensuring that products bearing the USDA Organic label meet strict standards * Promoting fair competition among certified organic producers * Encouraging sustainable and environmentally friendly agricultural practices In summary, qualified inspectors conduct annual reviews with farmers, ranchers, and processors to verify compliance with USDA regulations, ensure adherence to organic principles, monitor for potential non-compliances, provide education and guidance, and support continuous improvement. This enables the USDA Organic seal to maintain its integrity, protecting consumer trust and promoting a higher standard of quality in organic agriculture.",0.060293615789054504,0.18075801749271136,0.11730205278592376,0.16326530612244897,0.8679503202438354
"MS, RDN, Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Oct 05,  Like many of our USDA colleagues across the country, federal staff from the Food and Nutrition Service were glued in last week to the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. Many attended in-person to contribute ideas and host the event alongside White House staff, and hundreds more tuned in virtually. It was a day to remember, filled with excitement and a renewed commitment to the important work our agency does to improve food and nutrition security. The conference and related national strategy (, 776 ) offer an important opportunity to acknowledge FNS’ role in reducing hunger, increasing healthy eating and mitigating health disparities. Our new report, “Leveraging the White House Conference to Promote and Elevate Nutrition Security: The Role of the USDA Food and Nutrition Service,” highlights the many ways FNS will continue to make strides toward the bold goals set during the conference. As Secretary Vilsack said in his opening remarks, “Something like this hasn’t happened in more than 50 years. Let’s keep the momentum of today going in a new and meaningful, strong way so we can fully meet this important moment—for our children, for our community, and for our country.” Here’s what FNS staff had to say about the event and what lies ahead:  “It was such an inspirational day—I was struck by the energy and excitement at the conference and the enthusiasm from the attendees to work together to meet the conference goals.” – Jackie Haven, deputy administrator, Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion  “I was excited to hear medical professionals stating emphatically the connection between nutritious food and overall health. I felt such pride to be part of the great mission of FNS while listening as speakers shared their personal experiences with food insecurity, the support provided by our programs and their desire to pay it forward.” – Dr. Patty Bennett, Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator  “Engaging with diverse, forward-thinking individuals across various sectors of government, academia, and non-profit organizations, while listening to folks willing to share their lived experiences mirrors the all-hands-on-deck approach needed to provide nutritious food for all and eliminate diet-related diseases.” – Justice Wright, senior technical advisor, Office of Policy Support  “The conference provided such a great opportunity to reflect on what we have accomplished and look forward to what still can be done.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service with guest author Alynn Sampson, Vice President, Operations & Impact, Food Bank of Lincoln in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Nutrition Security  Feb 08,  The Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP, Reach and Resiliency – Round 1 grants are making an impact in communities across the nation. At the Food Bank of Lincoln, we have been able to leverage Reach and Resiliency sub-grant funding awarded by our Nebraska TEFAP agency to identify underserved areas and to implement strategies to increase TEFAP access in those areas. In some cases, the strategies were as simple as increasing the frequency of deliveries to specific communities to ensure that existing TEFAP resources were being equitably distributed. During the first quarter of the grant, we implemented a 21% increase in deliveries to four identified underserved counties, which resulted in a 55% increase in TEFAP pounds of food distributed to those areas when compared to the previous year. As a result, TEFAP is now reaching more than 4,000 households in Butler, Fillmore, Otoe, and York counties. We also now have 12 food access points in those counties and three additional non-profit partners involved in TEFAP operations. A recent pantry partner gave their input regarding food access: “As food prices continue to rise, having the ability for increased deliveries to both of my rural food pantries is critical. The number of food pantry clients has doubled in the past few months, and I expect a steady increase. It is very difficult for clients to receive fresh produce in rural areas, and that is something that is always in need. To buy one head of lettuce now is almost $5 at our rural grocery stores, and 99% of our clients cannot afford something as simple as a head of lettuce with the price increases.” The TEFAP Reach and Resiliency Grant has provided support to the Food Bank of Lincoln as they deliver USDA TEFAP products more broadly to our neighbors in need. The grant has also expanded the use of to identify convenient delivery areas as well as ensure an increased focus on consistent access to USDA TEFAP products for communities. We are well on our way to closing this inequity gap in our targeted four counties. States are encouraged to apply for TEFAP Round 2 grant funding at TEFAP Reach and Resiliency | Food and Nutrition Service (usda.gov).

"USDA-FSIS in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Feb 07,  The Super Bowl is the biggest and most anticipated sporting event of the year. Friends and families “huddle” and consume foods and snacks for the duration of the game while cheering for their favorite team. This iconic annual event is often celebrated by ordering takeout and delivered foods, which if left out too long, can cause foodborne illness. Leaving food out at room temperature is a big food safety penalty. Bacteria that can cause foodborne illness will start to grow to dangerous levels in the range of temperatures between 40 F and 140 F when left out for over two hours or one hour if above 90 F. This range of temperatures is called the Danger Zone. To avoid foodborne illness during the big game, follow this game plan:  Keep cold foods cold and hot foods hot. Cold foods should be kept under 40 F on the buffet table by nesting serving dishes of food in bowls of ice. Hot foods should be kept above 140 F. A preheated oven, chafing dishes, preheated warming trays or slow cookers can be used to keep food hot.  Don’t serve all food at once. Use small platters and replace them often with fresh refrigerated platters of food, rather than adding fresh food to a serving dish already on the table. Hot foods should be reheated to 165 F as measured with a food thermometer. When reheating in the microwave, cover the food for even heating. Check the temperature of the food in several places with a food thermometer, as some microwaved foods can have cold spots.

"Posted by Farm to School Specialist Allison Bell, Mountain Plains Regional Office, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  May 31,  Bringing together local producers and schools was the objective of the “Bringing the Farm to School” producer training in Hardin, Montana. The training sought to build relationships between schools and producers to increase the availability of local foods served to children. USDA Farm to School Specialists Andrea Alma and Alli Bell were on hand to demonstrate the many ways USDA’s Farm to School Program is connecting with schools and communities. Partners from Montana Team Nutrition and the Mission Mountain Food Enterprise Center brought the training curriculum to life, showing agricultural producers how to approach schools to sell their products and offering insight into procurement considerations, including the budgets, timing, and regulations faced by school food directors. Participants shared ideas on how to connect kids to more local foods. For example, two local ranchers drove more than five hours to the training, looking for strategies on approaching schools with their excess ground beef. Another attendee, trying to start a food hub, wanted to orient her business to sell food to schools. Another participant planned to start a mixed vegetable operation and wanted to incorporate farm to school in her business plan. The training included a tour of the Hardin School kitchen with Food Service Director Marlo Spreng and Hardin Farm to School Coordinator Elle Ross. They described the district’s journey to more scratch cooking and meals featuring traditional Crow dishes, since the school serves children from the Crow Reservation. The training also hosted a “Montana Foods for Montana Schools” connection event for school food service professionals to learn more about Farm to School and to meet farmers in their area. This innovative event covered it all - knowledge sharing, relationship building, and coming together over a meal. It was an outstanding networking and program improvement opportunity Mountain Plains Regional staff were proud to attend.

Here are some of the primary strategies they employ: 1. **Budget**: Food costs are a significant factor in determining school meal budgets. Directors must balance the desire to source locally grown produce with the need to maintain affordability and fiscal responsibility. 2. **Supply Chain Reliability**: Ensuring a stable and consistent supply chain is crucial for schools. Directors look for local suppliers that can provide high-quality products on time, which is critical for large-scale food service operations. 3. **Food Safety and Quality**: The safety and quality of the food are top priorities for school nutrition directors. They seek out suppliers who meet or exceed USDA standards for freshness, handling, and storage. 4. **Seasonal Availability**: School food directors consider the seasonality of local produce, ensuring that they can purchase products when they are in peak freshness and quality. 5. **Local Regulations and Laws**: Familiarity with local laws and regulations governing school meal programs is essential. Directors must comply with state-specific requirements for sourcing and serving locally grown foods. 6. **Student Nutrition Requirements**: School food directors take into account student nutrition needs, preferences, and allergies when selecting local foods to ensure that they meet the dietary demands of students. 7. **Community Partnerships**: Building relationships with local farmers, suppliers, and community organizations can foster support for school meal programs, providing a sense of accountability and investment in the community. 8. **Nutritional Value and Impact**: Directors consider the nutritional value and impact of purchasing local foods on the overall health of their students. This includes factors such as increased fruit and vegetable consumption, reduced reliance on processed foods, and environmental benefits. 9. **Contracting and Procurement Procedures**: School districts often have formal contracting and procurement procedures in place for food purchases. Directors must navigate these processes while considering local sourcing options. 10. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Using data to inform purchasing decisions is becoming more prevalent. Directors analyze metrics such as cost savings, waste reduction, student participation rates, and supplier performance when evaluating the feasibility of sourcing local foods. Ultimately, school food directors weigh these factors carefully to determine whether investing in local foods aligns with their program's goals, budget constraints, and the community's needs.

ARDN is dedicated to making high value datasets from past research and experiments compatible with crop models and other analytical tools. With support from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), NAL and the University of Florida are piloting a “hackathon” approach to make this old useful. Experts gather several times a year to create standardized vocabulary and extract relevant information to use in the AgMIP Crop Experiment schema (ACE) – a widely used format for agricultural models. As part of the NIFA grant, the team will annotate four datasets using ARDN protocols. The initial datasets include research from projects at Iowa State University, University of Georgia, the University of Arizona, and the Kellogg Biological Station. These annotated datasets will be available on NAL’s Ag Commons website. NAL also supports ARDN by hosting VMapper software on the Ag Commons website. VMapper creates a file which contains the “road map” for translating the original into the ACE format.

"Public Affairs Specialist, FSIS, USDA in  Health and Safety  May 24,  At your next picnic, let the spotlight shine on your food — not on party crashers like Salmonella or Listeria. When temperatures rise and food safety steps aren’t followed, cold dishes at a cookout are at risk for unsafe bacteria levels. Avoid foodborne illness by following these steps: Clean: Remember to clean and sanitize all dishes and utensils used to make your salad and wash your hands before and after food prep. Separate: Use different cutting boards, plates and utensils to avoid spreading bacteria when preparing your raw foods and ready-to-eat cold dishes. Cook: Make sure the main meat or poultry ingredients used in cold salads (egg salad, chicken salad, etc.) are cooked to safe internal temperatures before mixing:  Cook eggs to 160 F.  Cook chicken to 165 F. Although most cold salads use mayonnaise, the danger of foodborne illness lies with the main ingredient, such as eggs or chicken. Make sure they are cooked and chilled at the proper temperature. If you use homemade mayonnaise, follow these . Chill: Avoid the Danger Zone (temperatures between 40 F and 140 F) by refrigerating perishable food within two hours — one hour if it’s a hot day (above 90 F).

"Mustard Plant Jet Fuel Could Reduce Emissions by 68 Percent  Carbon dioxide emissions from the aviation sector constitute 2.5 percent of global emissions. One way to reduce this carbon footprint is to replace conventional aviation fuel (obtained by refining crude oil) with aviation fuel derived from sustainably produced biomass feedstocks.  Dr. Puneet Dwivedi, University of Georgia, Associate Professor  Posted in  Research and Science  Dec 09,   Respond to this story",Can replacing conventional jet fuel with biofuel made from sustainably sourced mustard plants effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions from aviation by up to 68%?,Yes.,"No, it's unlikely that replacing conventional jet fuel with biofuel made from sustainably sourced mustard plants would be effective in reducing carbon dioxide emissions from aviation by up to 68%. Here's why: * Biofuels can offer a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels. However, the actual emission savings depend on several factors, including the feedstock used (in this case, sustainably sourced mustard plants), the production process, and the location of the biofuel production facility. * The most commonly cited estimate for aviation biofuels is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by around 50-70% over a well-to-wheel basis. However, these estimates are generally based on assumptions that do not necessarily apply to all scenarios (e.g., assuming full substitution rates or neglecting indirect land-use changes). * A 68% reduction would be unusually high for several reasons: + The efficiency of converting mustard plants into usable biofuel is unlikely to exceed 50%. + There are likely energy inputs required for the production and processing of the biofuels that may not be negligible. + Other factors like land-use changes, fertilizer usage, or other environmental impacts might further reduce any potential emissions savings. While using sustainably sourced mustard plants as a feedstock could potentially offer some greenhouse gas benefits compared to traditional fossil fuels, claiming an emission reduction of up to 68% is unlikely to hold true in most scenarios.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8394096493721008

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Farm Production and Conservation Business Center in  Conservation  Jun 23,  FWC Photo by Andy Wraithmell, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Did you know the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil scientists are playing an important role in saving Florida’s manatees? These giant, but gentle, creatures are adored by residents and visitors to Florida. Unfortunately, though, their numbers have been threatened in recent years throughout the state. Manatees in Florida’s Indian River Lagoon (IRL), which stretches 156 miles along Florida’s eastern coast, have been starving to death at an alarming rate over the last two years. These deaths can be attributed to a lack of seagrass, their main source of food, which is being affected by algal blooms. As the algae blooms destroy seagrass beds, it causes sediment to float to the water’s surface. The water goes from clear to murky, making it harder for light to penetrate the water and provide sustenance to the seagrass. This creates a vicious cycle where more seagrass dies, more sunlight is blocked, and the manatees are left with less food to eat. NRCS is part of a team working to address the challenge, along with St. Johns River Water Management District, the University of Florida, among many other national and state agencies. The scientists go out on the IRL in pontoon boats and use sonar to conduct underwater soil surveys to gather information on the healthiest areas and the most degraded areas of the lagoon. The information is used to decide where to concentrate restoration efforts. This information has helped improve lagoons through actions like clams, oysters, and seagrass being deployed to aid in filtering and clearing the water. Scientists hope that continued improvement will eventually lead to the full restoration of manatees in the IRL.

"Northern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Research and Science  Trade  Jun 10,  Several hundred non-native forest insect species have become established in the U.S. Recent arrivals, such as this adult Asian longhorned beetle, have killed millions of trees and altered urban landscapes in the Northeast and Midwest. (U.S. Department of Agriculture/Kenneth R. Law, courtesy of Bugwood.org)  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Wood makes great packaging material—it’s inexpensive, abundant and versatile—but there’s one drawback: destructive forest pests stowaway in the pallets, crates and dunnage (wood used to brace cargo) used in international shipping. Over many years, international trade has resulted in the inadvertent introduction of many non-native wood-feeding pests and plant pathogens in the U.S. and throughout the world. Some of these non-native insects, including the emerald ash borer and the Asian longhorned beetle, have become highly invasive and caused serious environmental and economic impacts. But an international standard for wood packaging material is slowing the inadvertent export of invasive bark- and wood-boring insects, according to a study conducted by Robert Haack, a research entomologist with the Forest Service’s Northern Research Station in Lansing, Mich., and a team of scientists. Researchers found as much as a 52 percent drop in infestation rates in the U.S., where the standard was implemented in three phases between and . The study was published May 14 in the journal PLOS ONE. The International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15, or ISPM 15, is a set of standards developed by the International Plant Protection Convention stipulating how wood packaging material used in international trade should be treated before export. Treatments for eliminating live insects that may be contained in wood include heating wood, fumigating it and requiring the removal of bark from wood used for wood packaging material. As of October , more than 78 countries had implemented ISPM 15. Haack and co-authors of the study, including U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists Kerry Britton (now retired), Joseph F. Cavey and Lynn J. Garrett, believe that the drop in infestation rates would be even more dramatic if more had been collected prior to implementation of the standard. The best available in the U.S. only allowed researchers to compare wood packaging infestation rates from two years prior to U.S. implementation of the new international standard to infestation rates during the first four years after the standards were implemented. “The reduction in infestation rate would likely have been even higher if we had more years of that predated U.S. implementation of these international standards,” Haack said. “For example, based on infestation of wood packaging material entering New Zealand from the early s, when infestation rates were higher, ISPM 15 has achieved closer to a 97 percent reduction in the number of insect stowaways.” International wood packaging material is now treated to prevent stowaways like this Asian longhorned beetle larvae.

ISPM-15 is an international standard developed by the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The standard was adopted in 2002, and it requires that all wood packaging material (WPM) used for shipping goods be treated to prevent the spread of invasive forest pests. The treatment of WPM as per ISPM-15 involves using a heat treatment process or a methyl bromide fumigation process to kill any insects or other organisms present in the material. This ensures that WPM is free from harmful pests and can be safely used for shipping goods without causing damage to forests and ecosystems elsewhere. According to various reports, the implementation of ISPM-15 has led to a significant reduction (up to 52%) in the inadvertent export of invasive forest pests through wood packaging material. This standard is implemented in over 78 countries worldwide and is considered a key factor in controlling the spread of invasive forest pests globally.",6.611151529900685e-232,0.07486631016042782,0.032432432432432434,0.07486631016042782,0.8273863792419434
"Director, Grading and Standards Division of the Agricultural Marketing Service's Dairy Program in  Trade  Dec 01,  USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and its sister agencies work to keep markets open to U.S. products. Recently, an interagency team resolved an issue with Morocco, keeping a $126 million market open for American butter, cheese and other dairy products. U.S. agricultural exports continue to be a bright spot for America’s economy, worth a record $152.5 billion in fiscal year .  That’s why USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and its sister agencies work so hard to keep these export markets open.  So in , when Morocco requested that USDA use a new dairy export certificate that we could not endorse, we launched into action.  Our goal was to protect an export market worth $126 million annually while preserving our close relationship with a valued trading partner. Morocco is the 13th largest export market for our dairy products, and U.S. dairy exports are the fastest growing export category to that country.  U.S. companies export many dairy commodities to Morocco, such as butter, cheese and skim milk powder, as well as dairy ingredients such as milk protein and whey protein products. However, in Morocco’s agricultural officials requested changes to the information provided on the dairy export certificates issued by the unit I direct, the Grading and Standards Division of within the AMS Dairy Program.  Most countries importing U.S. dairy products require these certificates, and issuing them is one of many services my Division provides to exporters to maintain and expand market access. As a stopgap measure, we began using a general dairy certificate to keep that market open.  But then, in April , following numerous detainments of U.S. dairy shipments, we learned that Morocco was considering stopping all U.S. dairy trade if we did not submit a specifically negotiated export certificate. Beginning in , the AMS Dairy Program worked closely with an existing interagency team of technical experts from AMS, USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address the issue.  The team submitted a response to Morocco that addressed additives, animal health issues, microbiological criteria and thermal treatment processes, as well as a proposed AMS Sanitary Certificate for Exports for Milk and Milk Products for Human Consumption to Morocco that reflected all the suggested changes. On November 12, , we received the good news that the government of Morocco had accepted the proposed certificate—without further revision, concluding more than three years of negotiations.  The certificate’s acceptance means this important market will remain open to U.S. exports, paving the way for an even better year for the U.S. dairy industry. USDA and AMS are no strangers to keeping U.S. export markets open.  In , the same interagency team responded quickly to changes in China’s regulatory requirements for U.S. dairy exports.  Their work helped to secure a market worth $1 billion annually. We’re committed to keeping dairy and all other U.S. agricultural exports flowing.  By maintaining and expanding export markets, we help to strengthen our rural communities that produce the high-quality, American-grown products consumers worldwide desire.  And that’s good for everyone.

"Senior Trade Advisor, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Jun 20,  Driscoll’s berries being sold in a store (Photograph courtesy of Driscoll’s. Copyright . All rights reserved.) Two years ago this month, the United States and the European Union (EU) implemented an organic equivalence arrangement, meaning products that are certified as organic in the U.S. can also be sold as organic in the EU, and vice versa. This arrangement broke down many of the barriers that organic producers, especially small and medium-sized farmers, were facing in exporting their goods to one of their largest markets. It has also proved to be a good example of how we can recognize each others' systems and work together across borders to arrive at beneficial agreements. The U.S. and EU have some of the strongest regulatory protections in the world, and the organic equivalence arrangement recognizes these standards and uses them for everyone’s benefit. Before the agreement, growers and companies wanting to trade products on both sides of the Atlantic had to obtain separate certifications to two different standards, which meant a double set of fees, inspections, and paperwork. Now, if a product is certified organic by one party, it can bear both the USDA organic seal and the EU organic logo, without going through that second certification process. This is possible because the EU and the U.S. have recognized that though our regulatory systems are different, they both produce high quality organic food and agricultural products under rigorous programs. Secretary Vilsack, while addressing the EU agricultural ministers earlier this week, had the same message of cooperation in regards to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). “We also need to focus on reducing the impact of the differences in our regulatory and standard-setting systems. For companies on both sides of the Atlantic, this is perhaps the most promising – and challenging – area for cooperation in T-TIP,” Vilsack said. “The U.S. and the EU have the strongest regulatory protections in the world, and nothing we do through T-TIP will undermine this. But there are steps that can be taken to better align our regulatory and standard-setting processes by improving transparency, participation and accountability. The U.S.-EU organic equivalency agreement, which took effect two years ago this month, is a good example of how we can recognize each other’s systems and facilitate trade to the benefit of both sides.” The organic arrangement expands market access, reduces duplicative requirements and reduces certification costs while protecting organic integrity.  The U.S. and EU work together to promote organic production and share technical information and best practices in an effort to further enhance the integrity of organic crops and livestock production systems. Carmela Beck, the National Organic Program Manager for Driscoll’s, an exporter of fresh berries, said the equivalency agreement has greatly simplified the export process, reduced confusion and redundancy and provided an opportunity for organic farmers. “The passage of the U.S.-EU equivalency agreement is a great success story and is a testament to the rigor of both the U.S. and EU organic standards,” Beck said.” Not only has the flow of trade been increased but the National Organic Program and the European Commission continue to work diligently to protect organic integrity in a global economy. Organic farmers now have even more opportunity to grow their businesses to meet this growing, global demand for organic products.” Amy’s Kitchen is one American company that has seen the benefit of the organic equivalence arrangement. Amy’s has seen a tenfold increase in its UK and EU business. “Since the U.S.-EU equivalency agreement took effect, Amy’s Kitchen is now able to export products directly from its U.S. manufacturing facilities,” said Andy Berliner, CEO and Co-founder of Amy’s Kitchen. ""This has led to a tremendous increase in business for Amy’s across the board, including the ability to share information about Amy’s foods being organic in the UK and EU on our packaging, a rise from 15 to more than 60 products now offered in the UK and EU over the last five years.” The partnership, while providing a strong foundation to globally promote organic agriculture, is also a win for the American economy. Industry estimates show that the market for U.S. organics sales to the EU could grow more than 300 percent, from $70 million to $300 million, a huge boost for a growing sector of our agricultural economy. It also means higher incomes for organic farmers and ranchers, more opportunities for small businesses, and jobs for people who package, ship, and market organic products. USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service and Foreign Agricultural Service, along with the Office of the United States Trade Representative, were instrumental in developing the organic equivalency agreement between the EU and U.S. and have also worked to develop similar agreements with Canada and Japan.

Some of these benefits include: 1. **Increased Trade**: The agreement allows for the free movement of organic products between the two regions, resulting in increased trade volumes and economic growth. 2. **Streamlined Certification Process**: The equivalency agreement simplifies the certification process for organic producers in both countries, reducing administrative burdens and costs associated with obtaining certifications. 3. **Consumer Confidence**: The agreement ensures that organic products exported from one region meet the same standards as those produced locally, enhancing consumer confidence and trust in the authenticity of these products. 4. **Market Access**: US organic farmers can now export their products to the EU market, while EU producers have greater access to the US market, expanding market opportunities for both parties. 5. **Increased Competition**: The agreement promotes competition among organic producers in both regions, driving innovation and improving product quality. 6. **Economic Growth**: By increasing trade volumes and promoting economic growth, the equivalency agreement has contributed to job creation and increased prosperity for farmers, processors, and businesses involved in the organic sector. In terms of impact on trade between the two regions: 1. **Increased Export Volumes**: The US-EU organic equivalency agreement has led to a significant increase in organic export volumes from the United States to the European Union. 2. **Diversified Markets**: The agreement has enabled US organic farmers and processors to access new markets, reducing their dependence on domestic sales. 3. **Improved Market Access**: EU producers have gained greater market access to the United States, expanding their customer base and increasing revenue opportunities. 4. **Enhanced Trade Facilitation**: The equivalency agreement has streamlined trade procedures, making it easier for organic products to cross borders and facilitating international trade. Overall, the US-EU organic equivalency agreement has had a positive impact on trade between the two regions, promoting economic growth, increased competition, and enhanced consumer confidence in organic products.",9.054037486845751e-79,0.21393034825870647,0.06,0.13930348258706468,0.8385347723960876
"Indoors or Outdoors, Horticulture and Holidays Go Together  With the holiday season upon us, you may have missed the recent release of the Census of Horticultural Specialties Report. This Census of Agriculture special study is the only source of detailed production and sales for floriculture, nursery, and specialty crops for the entire United States.   Jodi Halvorson, USDA NASS Public Affairs Specialist  Posted in  Research and Science  Dec 21,   Respond to this story","What Census report provides detailed production and sales data for floriculture, nursery, and specialty crops across the entire United States?",The Census of Horticultural Specialties Report.,"The answer is: The Census of Horticultural Specialties (CHS) report. However, it's worth noting that since 2009, the Census has not conducted separate surveys for the horticulture industry. Instead, they use the more comprehensive Census of Agriculture and the Census Bureau's Economic Census to collect data on various segments of the horticulture industry, including floriculture, nursery, and specialty crops. More specifically, the answer I'm providing is based on the assumption that you're looking for a report that provides detailed production and sales data across the entire United States. If you're interested in a more specific or regional-level data, it might be necessary to explore other sources such as state-specific agricultural surveys or industry associations' reports. To give you a better understanding of how this works, I'll provide an additional answer based on more recent census developments. Since 2017, the Economic Census report has included an ""Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting"" section, which provides data for various segments of the agricultural sector. However, even within that broader category, there are different sub-segments, including floriculture, nursery, and specialty crops.

"Deputy Administrator, AMS Dairy Programs in  Trade  Jun 19,  U.S. dairy exports are currently valued at $6 billion and the country is the world’s leading exporter of skim milk powder, cheese, whey, and lactose products. USDA Photo Courtesy of Scott Bauer. Every June, USDA joins the rest of the country to celebrate Dairy Month. It is a time to thank our nation’s dairy producers and processors for their tireless work to produce quality dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt. Here at USDA, besides getting our fill of our favorite dairy products, we celebrate our nation’s dairy industry every day by finding new markets where people can enjoy their products. This often entails working with other countries’ governments to negotiate export and import requirements as well as helping businesses meet these requirements. Our nation’s dairy exporters reach new markets with the help of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). Export certificates are often the critical piece in the trade puzzle. On this front, AMS offers certificates for more than 80% of the countries that accept U.S. dairy exports. Our Dairy Programs can verify that businesses’ dairy products meet export requirements. The AMS Dairy Grading Branch provides export certificates for products or conditions for which they have documentation for or from plants they inspect. Certificates are paper or electronic documents which describe and attest to attributes of consignments of food destined for international trade. Certification of food may be based on a range of inspection activities including continuous online inspection, auditing of the quality assurance system, and examination of finished products. With the help of export certificates, importers can confidently receive products that meet requirements agreed upon by the U.S. and the importing country. As a result, people all over the world enjoy U.S. dairy products. In recent years, AMS helped open up U.S produced products to several major importing nations. In March , our agency enhanced its system, enabling the availability of electronic sanitary export certificates to China. Now exporters can request their China sanitary export certificates using the Electronic Document Creation System (eDocs). China is the world’s largest importer and is currently the second largest export destination for U.S. dairy products. Working with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), AMS helped 240 U.S. dairy and infant formula firms get audited and registered to export products to China using our eDocs system. Another example of AMS connecting exporters to new markets happened in when the Customs Union (CU) trade bloc -- composed of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia -- came into existence. A new U.S. – CU dairy veterinary certificate was to resume trade in those countries. Trade was halted in when the CU demanded changes to the current U.S. export health certificate. Negotiations continued until March when AMS was notified that all members of the CU accepted a U.S. proposed export certificate for pasteurized milk products.  The U.S. government interagency team is discussing additional administrative steps before issuing certificates. In addition to negotiating export certificate agreements with other countries, AMS has created a number of resources that will help dairy exporters. We encourage you to check out our Dairy Exports website. We recently held 20 webinar trainings that helped exporters become familiar with our systems. Our sites are equipped with important documents, frequently asked questions, and key contacts. The effort to increase the number of export destinations for U.S. dairy businesses will help continue a positive trend for the industry. In the last 10 years, dairy exports have averaged a 21% increase per year. Currently, U.S. dairy exports are valued at $6 billion and the country is the world’s leading single country exporter of skim milk powder, cheese, whey, and lactose products. AMS is proud to be a leader when it comes to increasing demand for U.S. dairy exports. Whether it’s June or any other time of the year, we are committed to supporting our nation’s dairy producers and processors. We want to make sure that people all over the world can enjoy their quality products. AMS offers a number of services to help U.S. dairy exporters reach new markets.

"Announces Organic Crop Insurance, Other Measure  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .13  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  Washington, May 14, ― Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today discussed his vision for U.S. organic agriculture and USDA efforts to ensure its continued success during remarks to the Organic Trade Association. Vilsack announced a number of changes and new initiatives to support the continued growth of organic agriculture, including that the USDA's Risk Management Agency's (RMA) federal crop insurance program will increase coverage options for organic producers this year and provide even more options in , including a contract price addendum as well as new premium price elections for organic crops. Additionally, RMA will remove the current five-percent organic rate surcharge on all future crop insurance policies beginning in .Vilsack also said USDA will be providing new guidance and direction on organic production to all USDA agencies in support of organic agriculture and markets. USDA is now asking each agency to routinely address the needs of the organic sector in their programs and services where appropriate. The National Organic Program has supported the continued growth of America's organic sector, which has been increasing market share each year and now is a more than $30 billion industry. Vilsack noted that accurate is the biggest obstacle for developing better crop insurance options for organic farmers and expressed his desire that Congress help USDA make further progress by renewing the Organic Initiative as part of a new Food, Farms and Jobs bill.""Organic agriculture is one of the fastest growing segments of American agriculture and helps farmers receive a higher price for their product as they strive to meet growing consumer demand,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""These new options will extend the safety net provided by crop insurance and provide fair and flexible solutions to organic producers. Coupled with the new guidance for agencies to support this growing sector, USDA recognizes that organics are gaining market share and is helping boost this emerging segment.""New crop-insurance pricing options will be available to organic producers who grow crops under guaranteed contracts beginning with the crop year. This contract price option allows organic producers who receive a contract price for their crop to get a crop insurance guarantee that is more reflective of the actual value of their crop. They will have the ability, where available and at their choice, to use their personal contract price as their price election or to choose existing crop insurance price elections. This contract price option will be available for between 60 and 70 crops in the crop year and this contract price feature will be available to the majority of insured organic crops. RMA is also changing organic transitional yields (t-yields) so they will be more reflective of actual organic farming experience, starting with the crop year.All crops are being evaluated for establishing organic prices for the crop year. Current pricing options only allow farmers to insure organic crops at the conventional prices, with the exception of eight crops (corn, soybeans, cotton, processing tomatoes, avocados, and several fresh stone fruit crops) that already have premium organic price elections. RMA is working to provide organic price elections for six to ten crops in . Oats and mint are two crops that have already been selected for organic price elections in , and apricots, apples, blueberries, millet, and others are still under consideration.USDA's Agriculture Marketing Service last year announced the Organic Literacy Initiative, a public outreach and employee training program to help connect current and prospective organic operations with appropriate USDA resources. To date, over 14,000 USDA employees have taken the basic training on USDA's role in organic agriculture. The new guidance will further improve USDA agencies' ability to incorporate the needs of the growing organic sector into their programs and services. These combined actions should result in staff better equipped to help organic farmers obtain technical and financial assistance, insure crops and livestock, access research findings, secure loans, develop conservation practices, find current organic price information, and access local, regional, and international markets. Through this effort, agencies will also better understand the scope and rigor of the certification process and how it complements their own programs.Organic certification allows farmers and ranchers to receive premium prices for their value-added products. Over the past 10 years, the number of certified organic farms and businesses in the United States has expanded to approximately 17,750, representing a 240 percent increase since USDA first began collecting this . Similarly, the retail value of the organic industry grew almost 9.5 percent in to $31.4 billion. Organic foods continue to gain market share in the food industry, climbing to 4.2 percent of U.S. retail food sales in .USDA has already made several changes to better serve organic customers, including offering more flexible microloans and improving Federal crop insurance programs. To help open new markets for U.S. farmers and ranchers, USDA has streamlined trade with multiple foreign governments. These trade partnerships allow U.S. organic products to be sold as organic in Canada, the European Union, Taiwan, and Japan without maintaining certification to multiple standards. Expanding the reach of U.S. organic products creates opportunities for small businesses and increases jobs for Americans who grow, package, ship and market organic products.USDA is responsible, under the Organic Foods Production Act of (OFPA), for establishing national standards for organically-produced agricultural products. The National Organic Program has been critical for the development of clear standards and enforcing a level playing-field for organic businesses, which has lead to expanded trade opportunities to create new markets for U.S. organic businesses. These standards assure consumers that products with the USDA organic seal meet consistent, uniform standards.

"Organic Crop Insurance Is Growing in New Ways!  Federal crop insurance provides the risk management tools necessary for American farmers to stay in business after a difficult crop year. They can be the difference between a farmer going under because of a lean year or having a safety net that allows them to keep farming and rebuild.  These tools help farmers who rely on good farming practices for smart land use and preserve economic stability for generations.  And the Risk Management Agency (RMA) has worked hard to extend risk management tools for organic producers. Organic producers were first able to obtain crop insurance under the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of . However, due to the lack of , organic farmers were initially charged an additional 5 percent surcharge and were only able to insure the “conventional price” for their crop - not the organic price.  Many organic producers felt the surcharge was not justified and that crop insurance prices needed to better reflect what they received in the marketplace.  Brandon C. Willis, Administrator, USDA Risk Management Agency  Posted in  Conservation  Feb 04,   Respond to this story",What specific challenge did organic farmers face when first obtaining crop insurance and how was it addressed?,"Organic farmers faced a 5% surcharge on their crop insurance premiums and were only able to insure their crops at the conventional price, not the higher organic price. This issue was later addressed, but no specifics are mentioned in the content regarding what changes were made to rectify this problem.","When organic farmers first sought to obtain crop insurance, they faced the challenge of quantifying their production costs. Since organic farming methods are more labor-intensive and require additional expenses for inputs like compost and natural pest control, these costs were not directly comparable to those incurred by conventional farmers. To address this issue, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), now part of the Risk Management Agency (RMA) within the USDA, worked with organic farming groups to develop a method for calculating these additional costs. This approach allowed organic farmers to receive fair compensation for their losses, taking into account the specific challenges and expenses associated with their methods. This development facilitated the inclusion of organic farming in crop insurance programs, enabling more organic producers to manage risk and protect their livelihoods. The process reflected an effort to tailor insurance solutions to meet the unique needs of diverse agricultural practices, contributing to a more inclusive and supportive environment for sustainable agriculture.",2.528411533060938e-155,0.2559241706161138,0.028708133971291863,0.15165876777251183,0.8589067459106445

The University of the District of Columbia’s 4-H Club has just partnered with the farm to help their kids learn to grow and eat healthy food.  Supported by USDA, the goal of the 4-H program is to assist young people in developing knowledge, skills, and attitudes that will enable them to become self-directing, responsible, productive citizens.  Common Good City Farm has been successful in part due to strong partnerships with organizations like the 4-H Club, as well as community support from organizations like the Advisory Neighborhood Commission and Mount Bethel Baptist Church. Next, we journeyed across the river to visit a Healthy Solutions youth cooking class. Started by Tanikka Cunningham, Healthy Solutions’ mission is to promote healthy lifestyles in underserved communities.  The students cooked up and ate four delicious dishes that included a fruit salad, a mesclun spring salad, an eggplant pasta sauce, and a tri-colored pasta dish. Healthy Solutions works in Alabama, North Carolina, and Washington, DC to create community-based food systems that allow access to healthy affordable foods.  The organization also focuses on agricultural job creation and training, healthy living education, and youth development.  Healthy Solutions operates a produce coop in DC and sells food to local corner shops in the neighborhood. There are only three major chain grocery stores east of the Anacostia River, so the impact of Healthy Solutions, which brings 10,000 pounds of fresh produce into these communities each month, is critical.  The Obama Administration’s proposed Healthy Food Financing Initiative would send more resources to help bring access to affordable, fresh, and healthy food to communities like Anacostia. The Healthy Solutions kids enjoy their meal.   Healthy Solutions students cooked up and ate four delicious dishes that included a fruit salad, a mesclun spring salad.

"Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Mar 02,  International School Meals Day raises awareness of the importance of food and nutrition in education and offers an opportunity for students to share school feeding experiences from across the globe. March is National Nutrition Month. Throughout the month, USDA will be highlighting results of our efforts to improve access to safe, healthy food for all Americans and supporting the health of our next generation.  The upsurge in healthy eating and food security campaigns is really resonating with schoolchildren, so much so, that a day has been set aside for youth around the world to share their experiences.  The celebration of this movement – International School Meals Day – draws our attention to the importance of good nutrition for all children. March 3 marks the fourth consecutive year that USDA will partner with the United Kingdom to invite children from across the globe to promote nutrition and school meals, this year focusing on introducing fresh and healthy local fare into their diets. On that day children will connect through social media to share their food experiences and healthy eating habits. I’m looking forward to witnessing the fun first-hand at Glen Forest Elementary School in Fairfax County, Va., where students will Skype with their peers at Washingborough Academy in the UK. I’m sure it will be a great learning experience for the students and me alike. In the last decade the momentum for healthier eating has found a place in the world’s conscience.  The International School Meals Day initiative literally brings together the world’s children to elevate awareness on the importance of nutritional quality in school meal programs while raising universal consciousness of hunger and poverty. As a lifelong school nutrition advocate I am delighted by the progress that’s been made both domestically and internationally to improve the nutrition and well-being of our youth. To see children the world over embrace this health movement is inspiring. So on behalf of USDA I offer a heartfelt “thank you” to the organizers of International School Meals Day and all those who participate.

"Director, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Oct 25,  American Indian students at Navajo Technical College, in Crownpoint, New Mexico, are using new lab and equipment to develop the veterinary skills they need to work with large animals. (Photo courtesy of Navajo Technical College) Oct. 20, , is an important milestone in our nation’s history in regards to equity in research, education, and extension. On that date, 29 tribal colleges, representing different histories, cultural orientations, and organizational structures, received land-grant university (LGU) status. Such LGU status gave these institutions—referred to as LGUs—access to federal resources to help improve the lives of tribal students, while respecting sovereignty and promoting self-sufficiency in American Indian communities. In the ensuing 23 years, significant progress has occurred in building capacity at the land-grant system to better serve Native American students and communities. The s are part of the family of land-grants that the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supports through research, education, and extension programs. These programs recruit and retain students in the food and agricultural sciences, enhance economic opportunities and quality of life, improve nutrition and health, and protect natural resources and the environment. The tribal colleges and universities, now numbering 34, are located in 13 states and provide access to higher education to over 80 percent of Indian Country. Collectively, they enroll approximately 20,000 students and provide vital services to some 50,000 tribal community members. Unlike most institutions of higher education, the s teach in a cultural context that empowers students by drawing on the strength of their people’s histories, indigenous knowledge, and traditions. The s provide much-needed high school completion (GED), basic remediation, job training, college preparatory courses, and adult basic education programs. They serve as community libraries and centers, tribal archives, career and business centers, economic development centers, public meeting places, and elder and child care centers. Examples of the strength of community, education, pride, and opportunity abound in Indian Country. Here are just a few: Chief Dull Knife College, in Lame Deer, Montana, developed welding courses to train apprentice welders to find jobs that could eventually triple the average salary of their Cheyenne reservation. At Fort Totten, North Dakota, Cankdeska Cikana Community College provided the Spirit Lake Tribe citizens new extension education that helped reduce diabetes and improved health. The Institute of American Indian Arts, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, is integrating agricultural science into every curriculum, linking them to American Indian worldviews, stories, and tradition. Join me in congratulating our institutions on their 23rd Anniversary. As we look into the future, there is much more work to be done, and the partnership between NIFA and s will continue to grow and be healthy, reflecting the rich history and culture of the American Indian peoples. While respecting sovereignty, we hope all of us succeed in our efforts to serve the people and the land.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  May 11,   The United Kingdom (UK) has long played an important role in U.S. agricultural exports. This history dates back to the completion of the Erie Canal in the early s, which linked the Great Lakes to the Atlantic seaboard, significantly increasing the export of food, particularly Midwestern wheat, to England. To this day, the United Kingdom offers tremendous opportunities for U.S. agriculture and the United States exports more than $1.6 billion annually in agricultural, fish and forestry products to the UK. Many of these products are showcased each year during USDA-endorsed trade shows, such as the International Food Exhibition (IFE), which took place in London in March. Nineteen U.S. companies participated in the U.S. Pavilion, including 11 new-to-market and new-to-export companies. Several U.S. companies were lucky enough to meet with the Olympic Organizing Committee that had a team looking for products to be used at the Summer Olympics in London in . The exhibition produced $469,000 in on-site sales and $1.9 million in projected 12-month sales. Robin Rhea, owner of Slather Brand Foods, Inc., is pictured here during the International Food Exhibition (IFE) in London. During the show, U.S. exhibitors introduced more than 100 new products, ranging from sauces to baby food to ice cream. Delicious sauces are the name of the game for Slather Brand Foods Inc., a new-to-export company who explored export opportunities as part of the U.S. pavilion. Robin Rhea is the owner of Slather Brand Foods, Inc., based in Charleston, South Carolina. As a Southern U.S. Trade Association (SUSTA) member, she learned about the assistance USDA’s market development programs provide to companies like hers. Ms. Rhea used Market Access Program (MAP) funding in order to participate in this year’s show in London, a first for her company. She credits her attendance at the show with helping her connect with potential exporters and assess the opportunity to sell her product outside of the United States. “The UK market is definitely ready for Slather Brand Slatherin' Sauce,” said Ms. Rhea. “There is very little competition to speak of in the sauce category.  Moreover, the UK is just coming into its own in terms of BBQ and they are hungry for diversified products. In addition to retail markets there was an overwhelming interest in the food service industry and it will top our targeted list when we are ready to export.” The company plans to continue to expand its domestic reach in the coming year and explore exports as part of its business plan in .

"USDA Tribal Collaboration Strengthens Food Security on Nevada's Indian Reservations  Today in Nevada more than one in four children live in households that cannot reliably provide nutritious meals every day.  This dubious distinction makes it the state with the nation’s fourth highest rate of child hunger.  And for children living on Indian reservations, the incidence of hunger may be even higher. What does food insecurity look like on Nevada reservations?  With few places to shop, reservation residents have very limited access to fresh produce.  Food insecurity not only equates to a lack of nutritious foods available, but also means families must drive great distances to a grocery store.  To cope, families choose more canned and frozen foods that will last until the next weekly or monthly shopping trip, which often means less consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Melissa Baker, Program Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service, Western Region Special Nutrition Programs  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 18,   Respond to this story","What are some consequences of food insecurity for families living on Nevada Indian reservations, particularly when it comes to accessing nutritious foods?","For families living on Nevada Indian reservations, food insecurity leads to limited access to fresh produce, reliance on canned and frozen foods that last longer, resulting in reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables.","Food insecurity is a significant concern for many families living on Nevada Indian reservations. Some of the consequences of food insecurity in this context include: 1. **Limited access to nutritious foods**: Many families on Nevada Indian reservations struggle to afford and access healthy, nutrient-dense foods due to limited economic resources, geographic isolation, and lack of reliable transportation. This can lead to diets dominated by processed and high-calorie foods. 2. **Higher rates of diet-related health problems**: Food insecurity has been linked to an increased risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. These conditions are disproportionately prevalent among American Indian communities in Nevada. 3. **Malnutrition and related health issues**: Children, pregnant women, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to malnutrition due to inadequate access to essential nutrients. This can lead to developmental delays, birth defects, and other health problems. 4. **Food waste and reduced food quality**: Families may rely on lower-cost, high-calorie foods that spoil quickly or have shorter shelf lives. This can result in wasted food and decreased access to nutrient-rich options. 5. **Increased reliance on emergency food systems**: Many families turn to emergency food sources, such as food banks or pantries, as a last resort. While these services provide temporary relief, they often perpetuate dependency and may not address the root causes of food insecurity. 6. **Disruption of traditional food systems and cultural heritage**: For some Native American communities, food security is closely tied to cultural identity and traditional practices. Food insecurity can erode these connections and threaten community resilience. 7. **Increased stress and anxiety for families**: Living with food insecurity creates significant emotional burdens on family members, particularly parents and caregivers. Chronic stress can exacerbate health problems and further undermine overall well-being. To address these consequences, it's essential to develop targeted solutions that prioritize the needs of Nevada Indian reservation communities. Some potential strategies include: 1. **Food assistance programs tailored to local contexts**: Developing programs that account for unique cultural, geographical, and economic realities on reservations. 2. **Supporting sustainable agriculture and food systems**: Investing in initiatives that promote locally grown foods, improve access to nutritious options, and enhance community food security. 3. **Nutrition education and cooking classes**: Providing culturally sensitive nutrition education and cooking skills training to empower families with healthy eating habits. 4. **Increasing economic opportunities and job creation**: Fostering economic development on reservations can help create more stable and secure food environments for families. 5. **Policy changes and advocacy**: Advocating for policy reforms that address the root causes of food insecurity, such as poverty, lack of affordable housing, and inadequate access to healthcare. By acknowledging these consequences and implementing context-specific solutions, we can work towards reducing food insecurity and improving overall well-being on Nevada Indian reservations.",0.012974387129918044,0.10462776659959759,0.05656565656565656,0.08853118712273642,0.8471912741661072

"Boston Beats the Asian Longhorned Beetle  One of the things I consider a highlight of my career and that I will always remember is our successful response to the July detection of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) in Boston, Massachusetts.  As I attended the May 12 ceremony commemorating the eradication of the ALB infestation in Boston and listened to the speakers share their thoughts about what it took to get us there, I had a deep sense of appreciation for the partnership among the state and federal cooperators who worked together to bring us to that day.  It was swift action and continued diligence that protected Boston’s trees from further destruction. APHIS and its cooperators were able to accomplish the goal of eradicating ALB in Boston in less than 4 years.  Thanks also go to a community member who reported the infestation early.  That early detection and report resulted in the loss of only 6 infested trees. But as I celebrate our first victory over the invasive pest in Massachusetts, I am compelled to ask you to remain vigilant in inspecting your trees regularly for signs of the beetle and report any suspicious damage to your State Plant Health Director.

"Child Nutrition Programs, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 21,   If you haven’t heard the buzz, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service’s expansion of the Team Up for School Nutrition Success  initiative is in full swing, with 20 completed trainings and 14 more scheduled for . Team Up offers a unique learning experience that enhances schools’ food service operations through training and peer-to-peer mentorship to school nutrition professionals looking to maintain a healthy environment and encourage strong student meal program participation. What exactly happens at a Team Up training? Ever had an “a-ha” or a “why didn’t I think of that” moment when a friend shares a really great idea? Team Up is where “a-ha” moments are shared among school nutrition professionals and turned into action back via their school meals programs. Let’s break down a Team Up workshop to see how these “a-ha” moments transpire. A peer mentor shares her best practices for menu planning during the Wisconsin Team Up training. Best Practice Panel Presentations  Great ideas are meant for sharing. Team Up workshops kick off with panels where participants hear school nutrition peer mentors share their best practices and strategies for issues like increasing school meal program participation, menu planning and financial management. At the Georgia Team Up training, participants share ideas and questions for menu planning and increasing program participation. Breakout Sessions  This is where the magic happens! After listening to best practice presentations, participants break out into small groups for a round of brainstorming and problem-solving around each specific topic, all with best practice ideas in mind. Using the Egan Skilled Helper Model, which uses an opportunity-development approach, school nutrition peer mentors guide and facilitate discussions as participants identify their program challenges and develop solutions with their peers.  During the breakout sessions, participants examine: What is going on in my school nutrition program? What does a better outcome look like? How do I get to the better outcome? How do I make it all happen?  The Action Plan  Participants examined their challenges and solutions and excitement is building around progress and potential opportunities identified during the breakout sessions. What do participants do with all of these great ideas? Peer mentors help participants put their specific strategies and solutions into an action plan using SMART goals, which are defined as goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time‐bound. Participants take their action plan home as a guide to implement their Team Up strategies and solutions in their school nutrition programs.  Resources  Operating a school meals program can be challenging, but school nutrition directors don’t have to do it alone. Team Up workshops invite allied organizations to share their free school nutrition resources that support school food service operations and help create a healthy school environment. Participants can use these resources as they move forward with implementing their action plan in their school nutrition programs.  Networking is another valuable resource Team Up workshops provide, giving school nutrition directors opportunities to develop working relationships with their peer mentors and other school nutrition directors in their state. Many directors who have attended a Team Up training have expressed that they’re not alone and can turn to their fellow director. “I can now see what areas I need to work and improve on in my program. I see that I am not alone in my journey. I have many helpful people that I can rely on for help and guidance. The Team Up training was valuable to me because I am more comfortable talking to my peers. I see I am not alone and I can ask for help.” – Rebecca Lusk, Manager/Supervisor, Towns County Schools, Hiawassee, Ga.  After the Workshop  The Team Up workshop may be complete, but the Team Up spirit lives on. After returning home, participants roll up their sleeves, take a deep breath, and take the first steps outlined in their Team Up action plan - and then real life happens. Barriers pop up as action plans are implemented, but there’s no reason to get discouraged. Team Up peer mentors and state agencies are still available should participants have questions or get stuck with their action plan. In addition, USDA together with the Institute of Child Nutrition hosts monthly webinars for school nutrition professionals to expand their knowledge and tools on a wide variety of topics; webinars recordings are made available online for later viewing.  And this is why Team Up workshops are so effective – Team Up encourages school nutrition professionals to continue to network with their peers and problem-solve school nutrition program barriers long after the workshop is completed. No one is an island, and we must team up to make school meals accessible, nutritious and delicious!

"Amy Mazerall and Mydina Thabet, Child Nutrition Programs, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 14,  Food service staff serves barbeque chicken to students. (Photo courtesy of Right Light Photography, LLC) The school nutrition community is celebrating National School Lunch Week from October 10-14. This year’s theme “Show Your Spirit” is all about encouraging parents, students and school officials to show their spirit for school lunch. Through the Team Up for School Nutrition Success (Team Up) initiative, school nutrition professionals have teamed up to provide nutritious and appealing meals to students, offering plenty of reasons for all of us to show spirit for awesome school meals! The Team Up initiative, created through a partnership between the United States Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and the Institute of Child Nutrition (ICN), provides school nutrition professionals a unique learning experience.  The initiative is designed to enhance schools’ food service operations by providing training and peer-to-peer mentorship to school nutrition professionals who want to maintain a healthy environment and strong student meal program participation. The goal of this training is to help schools find simple ways to meet the updated USDA nutrition standards from the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act (HHFKA), while increasing the number of students enjoying healthy and flavorful school meals. Donna Harris, the former Child Nutrition Director for Perquimans County Schools in North Carolina, attended the first Team Up pilot training in in the Southeast Region. Harris was seeking better way to engage students in school meals. During this Team Up training, she learned best practices, tips and tricks for increasing participation in school meals through panel presentations by school nutrition peer mentors. After the presentations, Harris joined other school nutrition directors to network and brainstorm on creative solutions for common topics such as menu planning and financial management.  Directors turned their ideas into achievable goals as they created action plans using SMART goals with the help of their peer mentors. SMART goals are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely. In her action plan, Harris wanted to tackle increasing school meal program participation in the district’s middle and high schools, so she set SMART goals to obtain student feedback and create student-approved menus. Back at her district, she conducted two student surveys and group discussions to gauge student preference.  As a result, several new student-approved recipes were added to the menu: barbeque chicken, buffalo chicken wraps, chicken salad wraps and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Although students had not responded well to meals that align with these updated nutrition standards in the past, Harris received positive feedback on the additions once she engaged students in nutrition education, explaining the USDA nutrition standards that schools must follow. In fact, the school’s student government association assisted in explaining the nutrition standards to students.  Harris demonstrated that when students have a voice in school menus and understand the USDA nutrition standards, they are more satisfied and more likely to purchase school meals.  This was evidenced by a notable increase in student meal counts on the days that new menu items were offered. Even school staff provided positive feedback: “the lunches taste good!” and “it was delicious!” Harris has since retired from Perquimans County Schools, but before her departure, she shared her action plan and best practices learned from the Team Up training with the new director. Harris wanted to see the Team Up spirit live on and encouraged the child nutrition department to utilize the Team Up peer mentorship model to train school nutrition staff. FNS also wanted to see the Team Up initiative live on after the Team Up training pilot received rave reviews from attendees. In , FNS hosted an additional six regional trainings to school nutrition professionals nationwide. The regional trainings were equally successful, and now the Team Up initiative has been expanding to state agencies in . So far, 26 trainings have been completed in 25 states, with 11 more scheduled for the remainder of this year. To read about the success of completed State Team Up trainings, visit ICN’s website. Harris is one of many school nutrition professionals who inspire us to show spirit for school meals. FNS thanks all school nutrition staff who work tirelessly to provide our students a nutritious start to a bright future! During National School Lunch Week, we continue to celebrate the progress that has been made in school meals, child nutrition and the overall school environment over the last seven and a half years. USDA is committed to providing school nutrition professionals with the resources they need to help today’s children grow into tomorrow’s healthy leaders. FNS’ Team Nutrition is also celebrating National School Lunch Week by announcing the availability of a number of newly modernized and standardized recipes on the What’s Cooking? USDA Mixing Bowl website for use in schools and childcare centers. These recipes are developed to assist child nutrition professionals in meeting the meal pattern requirements by providing appealing, kid-approved meals that incorporate whole grains and a wide variety of vegetables and legumes.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 25,  USDA’s What’s Shaking? resources offer creative ways to boost flavor with less sodium. (Click to enlarge) What’s shaking in USDA’s school meals programs?  Delicious and nutritious food, that’s what!  Healthy food does not have to be bland or boring.  There’s more to creating a tasty meal than just dousing food in dressing or layering on salty sauces.  It’s easy to make your dish pop without adding excess sodium.  Many schools around the country have figured out creative ways to serve low-sodium meals that maximize taste.  So what can you do this school year to “spice” things up and take school meals to the next level? Add flavor, not salt – Condiments like soy sauce, ketchup, barbecue sauce, and hot sauce may contain high amounts of sodium.  Fresh or dried herbs, spices, lemon or orange zest, or 100 percent fruit juices can enhance flavors in foods naturally. Cook with fresh food – When possible, cook with fresh produce or minimally processed foods like no-salt-added frozen or canned vegetables. Setting up farm to school arrangements help make this a cinch!  USDA Foods also offers a variety of options. Set up “Flavor Stations” – Create “flavor stations” in the cafeteria where students can add sodium-free herbs and spices such as basil, curry, black and red pepper, garlic, ginger, or rosemary to customize meals to their taste buds.  Flavor stations give students a chance to be the chef and create one-of-a-kind dishes! Check out “What’s Cooking?” – This USDA site features hundreds of low sodium, large quantity recipes for inspiration.  How about some “Rainbow Rice” or “Honey-Lemon Chicken”?  Yes, please!   Shop around – Pay attention to sodium levels when you’re purchasing food.  The amount can vary widely from brand to brand.  Be sure to write bids that specifically request lower sodium options. Does your school have any other creative ways to boost flavor while still promoting healthy, low-sodium diets?  Share them with us in the comments section below!

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Agricultural Research Service, Information Staff in  Research and Science  Oct 26,  Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) employees at the unveiling of the sign for the BARC Student Discovery Garden. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research portfolio.  When George Washington Carver laid out key elements of his blueprint for education, he could never have guessed that the cutting-edge work of 21st century agricultural science would find a 7,000-acre rural home—right in the middle of the maze of highways and high-rises, homes and businesses that make up the Washington metropolitan region. One hundred years after the federal government first began buying huge tracts of farmland, meadows and woods outside the District of Columbia, a group of scientists, researchers, students and other volunteers who work at the sprawling Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) are taking a page out of the renowned scientist’s book—literally, a textbook. The whole idea, as laid out in Carver’s “Nature Study and Gardening For Rural Schools,” is making sure school kids get their hands dirty. In that spirit, volunteers from the Beltsville Area Diversity Task Force and its technology, education and outreach group started planning about a year ago for an unassuming project for students that would echo Carver’s “learning by doing” educational philosophy. The idea of establishing an old-fashioned victory garden that would continue outreach efforts to students in local schools seemed to be a perfect match. The Student Discovery Garden, as it has come to be known, has been up and growing since last spring, fueled by the energy of volunteers and students. The garden, all organic with raised beds, includes seven sections, each focusing on one of the research programs at BARC, including breeding native crops to keeping non-native species from pushing their way in.  Another learning experience for an all-organic garden was an infestation of Colorado potato bugs that were laboriously smashed one at a time.  Another addition to the urban students’ knowledge base: They found out that stink bugs really live up to their name!

The ‘sororoca’ plant with the wide leaves is a relative of the banana. Although the photo was taken in the daytime, the light is low because the researchers are in the forest understory. Photo by M. Loveless I have lived and worked abroad for most of my adult life, including many years in Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, so it was not too difficult adjusting to life in the Brazilian Amazon. I learned to speak Portuguese in the field; my tutors were the field assistants that I hired locally. The politics of doing research on this species are challenging and complicated. That side of my research has been almost as educational and fascinating as the actual fieldwork.  I’ve been fortunate to live and work in remote forests where there are no villages or towns nearby, no noise or light pollution, no electricity, and no running water when the streams dry up during the dry season. Under those conditions, it’s possible to experience forest life on a very satisfying level. As a plant ecologist, I can observe the daily and seasonal rhythms of growth and dormancy at the level of the forest community — by that I mean the growth and flowering and fruiting schedules that trees and other plants keep through the year and from year to year. When you are there every day in the middle of it, these rhythms gradually come into focus, and the forest comes alive in a way that feels completely integrated. Many people find it surprising to learn that the Brazilian rain forest and the other tropical forests I’ve worked in are not perpetually wet and steaming. Mahogany only grows naturally in tropical forests that have a pronounced dry season for one-third to one-half of the year. When that happens, the streams dry up, the trees drop their leaves, the understory goes brown, the ticks and deerflies come out, and everything gets wilted in the heat until the rains come back. The most important thing people should know about mahogany is the same thing they should know about other living species that we humans consume – if consumption exceeds supply indefinitely, supply will vanish.

Here's what typically happens: **Leaf Fall and Reduced Growth**: As the dry season progresses, many of the trees in the understory experience a decline in water availability, leading to reduced growth and increased leaf fall. This is because the forest floor receives less direct sunlight due to the taller canopy above, making it difficult for understory plants to undergo photosynthesis. **Increased Fire Risk**: The buildup of dry leaves, branches, and other plant material creates a fire-prone environment. If a spark or lightning strike occurs, these conditions can lead to intense fires that burn through the understory, affecting both vegetation and wildlife. **Changes in Species Composition**: Some species, like herbaceous plants and shrubs, are more sensitive to drought than others. As a result, these species may experience increased mortality, allowing more shade-tolerant or drought-resistant species to thrive. This can lead to changes in the understory's species composition over time. **Increased Herbivory Pressure**: Some herbivorous animals, like insects and small mammals, may take advantage of the increased plant material on the forest floor during the dry season. This can lead to increased herbivory pressure, potentially affecting understory vegetation. **Recovery with Rainfall**: Once the rainy season returns, the understory is expected to recover rapidly. Water availability increases, allowing plants to regrow and resume their growth cycles. The forest ecosystem's resilience helps it bounce back quickly from the dry season's stressors. In summary, during the dry season in tropical forests like the Brazilian rainforest, the understory experiences reduced growth, increased fire risk, changes in species composition, increased herbivory pressure, and eventual recovery with rainfall.",0.025749713352737968,0.08724832214765102,0.06081081081081081,0.08053691275167786,0.8588221669197083
"Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 01,  The adult periodical cicada emerges from its 17-year nymph stage, molts and arises as a winged adult. This spring will see the return of the large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. (U.S. Forest Service photo/ Bob Rabaglia) The buzz this spring has started, and some people may think it’s fodder for a new sci-fi movie. But this year’s spring brings a drama closer to home than you think - the pending emergence of brood II of the periodical cicada. Cicadas are large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. As the male cicadas sing their intense mating songs, some brand it as the sound of summer. “Annual cicadas, known as dog-day cicadas in the U.S., are found throughout the world,” said Sandy Liebhold, a research entomologist with the U.S Forest Service’s Northern Research Station. “But the periodical cicadas emerge in massive groups known as “broods” once every 13 or 17 years and are completely unique to North America.” There are 15 brood cycles, each designated by roman numerals. In the U.S., brood II is on track to crawl out of the ground very soon after a 17-year hiatus. They’ll emerge into one of the most densely populated urban/suburban forests in the world. The mass emergence of brood II into the state and private forests of the tri-state area of eastern Connecticut, upstate New York, and northern New Jersey will sound a bit different than the familiar dog-day cicadas. Male cicadas use a special membrane to echo a series of clicks through its abdomen to attract females for reproduction. In chorus, the brood may sound like an insect-sized fleet of jets preparing for lift off, but the sound should be enjoyed as a wonderful spectacle of the mating ritual in the animal world. Once mated, females will lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind, known in the scientific world as oviposition injury, can be quite striking and lead to “flagging” -- the dieback of small limbs. Forest health aerial surveys conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation reported more than 8,700 acres with flagging left behind from the brood XIV emergence on Cape Cod in . The scarring is mostly superficial but can have a mild impact on the growth of individual host trees. However, the mass emergence can benefit the longer, overall health of eastern forests. After mating and laying eggs, adult cicadas die and fall to the forest floor. The nutrients released from the mass decay of the brood create a jolt of healthy nutrients available to forest organisms. Researchers have shown that this pulse of nutrition leads to an increase of beneficial microbes and nitrogen in soil, increased tree growth and more robust wildflowers. Finally, after three to four weeks, the eggs hatch, the larvae wander under the forest floor where they feed on roots and start the process over again. So, why every 13 to 17 years? Scientists have been pondering this ecological phenomenon for centuries. “There is no doubt that by simultaneously emerging at those long intervals, periodical cicadas are able to saturate predators thereby maintaining high population levels,” said Liebhold. Recent research also hypothesizes that periodical cicadas emerge when predator birds are at a lower density, suggesting that these amazing insects have queued into a larger ecological cycle – wow! This is what we know but there is still a lot of mystery surrounding these time-travelling bugs. So if you find yourself one of the lucky ones to experience their visit, just sit back and enjoy this remarkable wonder of eastern forests. Michael Bohne is an entomologist and forest health group leader with the U.S. Forest Service in Durham, N.H. After mating, female cicadas lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind can lead to the dieback of small limbs called flagging. Such was the case for these bur oak trees in central Iowa in after a brood emergence of the 17-year cicada.

The unique aspect of the emergence of Brood II of periodical cicadas compared to annual cicadas (dog-day cicadas) is that they emerge in a 13- or 17-year cycle, whereas annual cicadas emerge every year.

This means that Brood II cicadas appear on the same schedule every 17 years, which is distinct from the annual emergence of dog-day cicadas.

The site was chosen by the Glen Rock Assistance Council and Endowment after input of family members in the community directly affected by 9/11. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry) Living memorials serve as a reminder of fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, neighbors and friends—but also of the power of community to reflect, rebuild and renew. Our research suggests that living memorials demonstrate the role of nature in contemporary times not only as a symbol, but as an innate and purposeful response to loss that calls forth a common humanity and compassion for others. In other words, they demonstrate how people use nature to be resilient to loss. For 13 years, the U.S. Forest Service has built upon a unique partnership called the Living Memorials Project centered on one of the most significant events in recent history: Sept. 11, , also referred to as 9/11, the day four carefully coordinated terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. That day, two passenger planes hit the World Trade Center’s twin towers in New York City, another flew into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and a fourth originally targeting Washington crashed in a Shanksville, Pennsylvania, field after passengers tried to stop the hijackers. Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, New York, created a memorial grove on the hospital campus. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry) The living memorials project began in when Congress asked the Forest Service to create a program that draws upon the resonating power of trees to bring people together and help foster healing in communities across the nation in response to 9/11. The project includes a grant program to support community-based greening efforts and a research component that developed a National Registry of living memorials across the country. This year, as communities gather to mark the 14th anniversary of 9/11, some will do so at local town memorial parks and gardens – living memorials that pay respect to those who lost their lives and thank thousands more who ran toward the chaos to help. This summer, a team from the agency’s Northern Research Station set out to revisit some of the sites listed on the Living Memorials Registry. Joined by Heather McMillen, an anthropologist and postdoctoral social scientist with the research station, the teams were curious to learn if the sites were maintained. If so, who takes care of them? Did circumstances and other events change the nature of the memorials or had they, over time, stood still? What story could the trees and the landscape itself tell us? From Connecticut's state memorial in Sherwood Island State Park on the Long Island Sound visitors have a panoramic view of lower Manhattan where the World Trade Center once stood. Victims’ families requested a memorial where they could experience the healing effects of water. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry) The sites range from forests such as Sterling Forest State Park in Tuxedo, New York. To beaches, like the Hometown Memorial in the Town of Babylon, New York, as well as city parks, community gardens, traffic islands, waterfront piers, street trees and arboretums. Many of the living memorial sites we visited 14 years ago still remain and continue to serve an important role for their local constituents. When asked, ‘What are you most proud of here?” nearly all of the site stewards responded, “That we did it.  And it’s still here.”  Many of the living memorials along the New York/New Jersey/Connecticut coast sustained heavy damage during Hurricane Sandy and were rebuilt and replanted. Some signs at the sites not only recognize a diverse list of supporters but also tell the story of that day from the perspective of local towns and communities, including personal sentiments regarding loved ones lost and for those who survived. In each case, local residents draw upon the landscape to create a place of comfort, reflection and a sense of beauty. As these places age, some areas do struggle with care and maintenance but are not giving up. Many families have planted survivor trees on sites and are eager to find ways to protect them as long as possible.      Updates from the field will be available on the Living Memorials Project website. Memorials created from - are displayed on a National Map that formed the basis of the public multi-media exhibition Land-Markings: 12 Journeys through 9/11 Living Memorials, created in collaboration with Parsons The New School for Design.

As the world population grows, agricultural science will play an important role in helping us combat hunger and malnutrition around the globe. (photo courtesy of the World Food Program/Rein Skullerud) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA's rich science and research portfolio. The world is not merely facing a challenge of sustainably producing enough food to feed a world whose population will exceed 9 billion by , but also confronting the continuous challenge of ensuring that nutritious and safe food reaches needy families, so that every child can have a safe and healthy childhood.  Combating this urgent crisis requires a global collaborative effort.  According to experts, by agricultural production will need to increase by 70% to meet increased demand for food, diet changes and additional demand for industrial uses for plants.  To help meet this goal, USDA has developed a Global Food Security strategy, focused on research, development, education and extension.  As part of USDA’s Office of the Chief Scientist series of white papers on USDA’s research portfolio, this plan aligns USDA’s food security research with the goals of President Obama’s Global Food Security Initiative, Feed the Future. In implementing the strategy, USDA will seek and build upon existing partnerships with research institutions at home and abroad, as well as in the private sector.  We are very heartened that our colleagues in other countries and donor organizations share our interest.  This May, the G8 Leaders announced the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition to improve food security in Africa.  The G8 Leaders also endorsed the establishment of global platforms to facilitate sharing of reliable agricultural and information, which is crucial for research, for decision making by farmers and to help connect them to the marketplace.   Similarly, the June Rio+20 Summit resolved to enhance agricultural science and improve productivity and sustainability through voluntary sharing of knowledge and good practices and by strengthening international cooperation on agricultural research.  These commitments made by USDA, the G8 and Rio+20 have been taken to the next level by the G20 whose leaders recently announced their support for a series of recommendations to sustainably increase agricultural productivity.  These steps include strengthening global collaboration and cooperation on agricultural science through a regular meeting of agricultural Chief Scientists (MACS) with the goal of identifying global research priorities and targets and facilitating collaboration between public and private sector organizations in the key areas most likely to drive sustainable agricultural productivity gains. These developments have a lot of promise for helping coordinate the fight against global hunger.

Some key components of such an effort include: 1. **Sustainable Agricultural Practices**: Implementing practices like regenerative agriculture, permaculture, and agroforestry can enhance soil fertility, reduce synthetic fertilizers' use, and increase carbon sequestration. 2. **Precision Farming**: Leveraging technology, including drones, satellite imaging, and artificial intelligence (AI), can optimize crop yields, reduce water consumption, and provide real-time monitoring of fields, helping farmers make informed decisions. 3. **Climate-Smart Agriculture**: Developing agricultural practices that help mitigate the effects of climate change is crucial. This includes adopting drought-tolerant crops, using climate-resilient varieties, and promoting agroecology to maintain ecosystem services. 4. **Genetic Improvement and Seed Security**: There is a need for sustained investments in plant breeding programs to develop high-yielding, disease-resistant, and climate-resilient crop varieties. This also includes ensuring access to quality seeds through initiatives like the Global Crop Diversity Trust. 5. **Irrigation Efficiency and Water Conservation**: Implementing drip irrigation systems, using water-saving technologies, and promoting water harvesting and recycling can help reduce water consumption in agriculture. 6. **Soil Conservation and Health**: Practices aimed at preserving soil fertility and structure include conservation tillage, cover crops, composting, and integrating organic amendments into farming routines. 7. **Support for Small-Scale Farmers**: Targeted support to small-scale farmers through training programs, access to markets, credit facilities, and market information can help them scale up their operations efficiently. 8. **Post-Harvest Loss Reduction**: Improving storage and handling techniques, using hermetic technology for grains, and promoting the use of solar-powered drying systems can reduce food losses and enhance supply chain efficiency. 9. **Genetic Engineering**: While controversial in some quarters, genetic engineering could provide a significant increase in crop yields by incorporating traits that offer resistance to pests and diseases or improve drought tolerance. 10. **Innovative Financing Models**: Establishing innovative financing mechanisms such as impact investment funds, crowdsourcing platforms, and partnerships between governments, private sector entities, and civil society can help mobilize the necessary capital for scaling up sustainable agriculture initiatives. 11. **International Cooperation**: Collaborations through forums like the Committee on World Food Security (CFS), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, and other global agricultural bodies are essential for sharing best practices, coordinating research, and implementing large-scale projects that address global food security challenges. 12. **Education and Training**: Developing and disseminating knowledge about sustainable agriculture practices through educational programs and on-farm training can empower farmers to adopt new technologies and methods that lead to increased productivity and sustainability. Meeting the projected increase in agricultural production will require a multifaceted effort involving governments, farmers' organizations, research institutions, private sector entities, civil society groups, and international bodies working together towards common goals.",0.023409774119511922,0.126984126984127,0.055776892430278883,0.08333333333333333,0.8476722836494446
"It's Quite a Pickle To Be In  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Pickles are a popular food, but are even trendier today as more and more craft brands show up in stores and farmers’ markets all over the country. But did you know USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has helped commercial pickle-makers, from small brands to the nation’s largest, meet the highest standards of food safety? While pickling—storing in an acid liquid, usually vinegar—has been recognized as a food-preserver since long before the discovery of bacteria, the kind of that today’s precise food safety standards require was not established until recently.  Kim Kaplan, Agricultural Research Service  Posted in  Research and Science  Jan 06,   1 Response",What role has USDA's Agricultural Research Service played in helping commercial pickle-makers meet modern food safety standards?,USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has helped commercial pickle-makers meet modern food safety standards.,"The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has played a crucial role in helping commercial pickle-makers meet modern food safety standards. Here's how: In the early 2000s, ARS researchers conducted studies to better understand the microbiology and spoilage of pickled cucumbers, a common cause of foodborne illness outbreaks related to pickles. They identified key factors contributing to contamination and spoilage, including: 1. Microbial growth on pickle brine 2. Contamination from equipment, hands, and the environment 3. Spoilage caused by yeast and mold Based on these findings, ARS researchers developed a set of recommendations for commercial pickle-makers to improve their food safety practices. These guidelines included: 1. Sanitizing equipment and utensils 2. Using proper cooling and storage techniques 3. Implementing good manufacturing practices (GMPs) 4. Conducting regular microbiological testing In addition, ARS scientists developed novel methods for controlling microbial growth in pickled cucumbers, such as: 1. Developing a predictive model to forecast spoilage risk 2. Creating a database of microorganisms associated with pickled cucumbers 3. Testing the efficacy of various antimicrobial agents The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) took notice of ARS' work and incorporated these findings into their regulations and guidelines for commercial pickle-makers. As a result, many commercial pickle manufacturers have adopted improved food safety practices based on ARS research. Some notable examples include: * Implementing Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) programs * Conducting regular microbiological testing to ensure compliance with FSIS regulations * Developing new technologies, such as automatic pickling systems, to improve food safety and reduce contamination risks By providing critical research support and guidance, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service has played a significant role in helping commercial pickle-makers meet modern food safety standards and reducing the risk of foodborne illness outbreaks related to pickled cucumbers.",0.03296968289145059,0.10062893081761005,0.08860759493670886,0.09433962264150943,0.8608611822128296
"Moving Back to Rural America: Why Some Return Home and What Difference It Makes  Population loss persists in rural America, especially in more remote areas with limited scenic amenities. Communities in these areas are attuned to the annual out-migration of their “best and brightest” high school graduates, typically a third or more of each class. But stemming rural population loss--and spurring economic development--may depend less on retaining young adults after high school and more on attracting former residents some years later. Researchers at the University of Montana and USDA’s Economic Research Service visited 21 rural communities during and and conducted 300 interviews at high school reunions. The aim was to better understand what motivates return migration and the barriers to such moves. Reunions allowed for simultaneous interviews with both return migrants and nonreturn migrants.  John Cromartie, Economic Research Service  Posted in  Research and Science  Jun 02,   Respond to this story","What motivates individuals who have left rural areas to return back home, according to research conducted by John Cromartie and his team?","According to the research conducted by John Cromartie and his team, the motivations behind individuals returning to their rural hometowns include a combination of factors, but a more detailed answer is not provided in the content. However, it mentions that researchers aimed to better understand what motivates return migration, implying that further analysis was done on this topic.","According to research conducted by John Cromartie and his team, individuals who have left rural areas to move to cities or other urban centers often face challenges such as high cost of living, lack of affordable housing, and limited job opportunities. As a result, they may decide to return back home to their rural origins due to a desire for: 1. **Affordability**: The high cost of living in urban areas can be overwhelming, making rural communities with lower costs of living more attractive. 2. **Community ties**: Individuals who have left rural areas often still maintain strong social connections and relationships within their community, which can motivate them to return home. 3. **Agricultural or natural resource-based economies**: The decline of traditional industries in urban areas has led some individuals to seek opportunities in rural areas where agriculture, forestry, mining, or other natural resource-based industries are still prevalent. 4. **Rural revitalization and infrastructure investments**: Improvements in rural infrastructure, such as high-speed internet, healthcare services, and educational facilities, can make rural communities more appealing to those who have left. These factors suggest that individuals who have left rural areas may return home due to a combination of economic, social, and environmental factors.",0.05190176504112189,0.21538461538461542,0.09302325581395349,0.16153846153846155,0.8497172594070435
