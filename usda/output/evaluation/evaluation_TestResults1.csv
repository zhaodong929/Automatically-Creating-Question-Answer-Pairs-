"What is nutrition security? Building on and complementing our long-standing efforts to address food security, we are expanding our efforts to advance food and nutrition security. Nutrition security means all Americans have consistent and equitable access to healthy, safe, affordable foods essential to optimal health and well-being. Our approach to tackling food and nutrition insecurity aims to:  Recognize that structural inequities make it hard for many people to eat healthy and be physically active; and  Emphasize taking an equity lens to our efforts.  Learn more  A household is food secure if all members, at all times, can access enough food for an active, healthy life. At a minimum, food security includes:  Readily available nutritionally adequate and safe foods, and  The ability to acquire those foods in socially acceptable ways (without resorting to emergency food supplies, scavenging, stealing, or other coping strategies).  Nutrition security means consistent access, availability, and affordability of foods and beverages that promote well-being, prevent disease, and, if needed, treat disease, particularly among racial/ethnic minority, lower income, and rural and remote populations including Tribal communities and Insular areas. Nutrition security is an emerging concept that complements efforts to increase food security while also:  Recognizing that Americans, in general, fall short of an active, healthy lifestyle aligned with Federal dietary and physical activity guidelines, and  Emphasizing equity to ensure our efforts serve all populations to promote access, availability, and affordability to foods and beverages, and address the connection between food insecurity and diet-related chronic diseases. View the Infographic (, 420 ) What is the problem? Poor nutrition is a leading cause of illness in the United States, associated with more than half a million deaths per year. It is linked with increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease as well as broader impacts including higher health care costs and decreased productivity.  Learn more  Poor nutrition is widespread  Though poor nutrition affects every demographic, diet-related diseases hit harder among historically underserved communities.  The overall diet quality score for Americans is 59 out of 100, indicating that the average American diet does not align with Federal dietary recommendations. However, the resulting health burden is not equally shared. Certain populations are at greater risk for diet-related disease. For example, Black and Indigenous children are more likely to have obesity than their white peers. Those who face food insecurity are also at greater risk.  Beyond the effect on health, poor nutrition and diet-related diseases have far-reaching impacts including decreased academic achievement and increased financial stress. That translates to societal impacts as well—lower productivity, weakened military readiness, widening health disparities, and skyrocketing health care costs. For example, approximately 85 percent of current health care spending is related to management of diet-related chronic disease.  To make progress on these problems, Americans need equitable access to healthy foods that promote well-being. What is USDA doing? USDA wants input from all Americans on ways we can improve nutrition security. The department is particularly focused on strengthening and building new partnerships with all levels of government, the private sector, community-based organizations, and families. Together, we can make progress that will change lives and ensure a healthier, more prosperous future for all Americans.  Learn more  USDA’s work to advance nutrition security focuses on four pillars:  Meaningful Support  Healthy Food  Collaborative Action  Equitable Systems  Research and evaluation  USDA’s work on nutrition security is driven by research and grounded in science. In addition to the extensive research performed by the Food and Nutrition Service, the Agricultural Research Service has six human nutrition research centers, the Economic Research Service studies numerous topics central to food and nutrition security, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture advances food and nutrition security through research, education, extension, and innovation. Our work is also driven by the lived experiences – of our staff and our stakeholders.  Learn more about our nutrition security research.

It includes having readily available safe and nutritious foods, as well as being able to acquire them in socially acceptable ways. **Nutrition Security:** Goes beyond food security by emphasizing the importance of equitable access to healthy, safe, affordable, and culturally competent foods that promote well-being, prevent disease, and treat disease, particularly among underserved populations. It aims to address the connection between food insecurity and diet-related chronic diseases. In terms of addressing disparities in health outcomes among underserved communities, nutrition security is a more comprehensive approach that recognizes the historical inequities and systemic barriers that make it difficult for many people to eat healthy and be physically active. By emphasizing equity and taking an equity lens to efforts, nutrition security aims to ensure that all populations have access to the foods and beverages they need to maintain good health, particularly among racial/ethnic minority, lower-income, and rural and remote communities.","**Key Differences Between Food Security and Nutrition Security** Food security and nutrition security are two related but distinct concepts that focus on different aspects of access to nutritious food. 1. **Food Security**: Refers to the availability, accessibility, and utilization of sufficient, safe, and nutritious food by all individuals in a community or country. It focuses on the physical availability and affordability of food. 2. **Nutrition Security**: Encompasses not just having access to food but also having access to a variety of foods that provide necessary nutrients for good health. It emphasizes the quality of the food consumed, focusing on the nutritional adequacy and diversity of diets. **Addressing Disparities in Health Outcomes** In addressing disparities in health outcomes among underserved communities, understanding the difference between food security and nutrition security is crucial: * **Food Security**: Focusing solely on increasing access to food may not necessarily lead to better health outcomes if the food available is of poor quality. In underserved communities, this might involve initiatives like food banks or soup kitchens, which can provide temporary relief but may not address underlying issues. * **Nutrition Security**: A more comprehensive approach that ensures access to a diverse range of nutritious foods can have a more direct impact on improving health outcomes. This could involve community-based programs promoting home gardening, cooking classes focusing on nutrient-dense meals, or even supporting local farmers' markets. **Key Considerations** To effectively address disparities in health outcomes among underserved communities: 1. **Community Engagement**: Involve the community in identifying their needs and developing solutions that are tailored to their specific circumstances. 2. **Holistic Approach**: Address not just food availability but also education, economic empowerment, and environmental factors that influence access to nutritious food. 3. **Sustainability**: Ensure programs are sustainable over time, with potential for scaling up or replication in other communities. 4. **Partnerships**: Foster partnerships among government agencies, non-profit organizations, community groups, and private sector entities to leverage resources and expertise. By understanding the differences between food security and nutrition security and tailoring approaches to address these disparities, it is possible to make meaningful strides in improving health outcomes among underserved communities.",0.05250592401273008,0.37333333333333335,0.12619502868068835,0.21714285714285714,0.8586325645446777
"It's Time to Talk about the Birds and the Bees -- and the Butterflies, Bats and Beetles  Cross-posted from the Department of Interior blog: From birds and bees to butterflies, bats and beetles, pollinators are a diverse group and are critically important to terrestrial life on our planet. Without our help, however, their populations will continue to decline as a result of numerous stressors including loss of habitat, pests and pathogens, and exposure to pesticides. Bees and other pollinators are essential to America’s agricultural economy and maintain the beauty of our iconic landscapes. Without them, we wouldn’t have most of our vegetables, flowers, fruits or nuts. Honey-bee pollinations alone contribute more than $15 billion in value to U.S. agricultural production each year, but beekeepers reported losing just over 23 percent of honey bee colonies last winter. Other pollinators that help sustain food production and the environment—such as native bees and bats—also are declining.

"Media Relations Officer, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Aug 04, 2011  The USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bee. From the booklet, the southeastern blueberry bee (Habropoda laboriosa) visiting blossoms of a rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium virgatum). When I was a kid, there was one category for bees – “the stinging kind.” Fear of being stung wouldn’t allow me to consider variations among the swarms that patrolled playgrounds. The only thing that made bees tolerable was … the honey. Youthfully ignorant, I didn’t know that there are thousands of bee species (and some bee species are stingless) or that those bees on the playgrounds were more life saving than threatening. The USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bees to educate the public and encourage people to help protect these essential insects. The 40-page booklet primarily focuses on bees native to North America, of which there are 4,000 species, found in forests, farms, cities, wildlands and deserts.  Although honey bees may be most noted for producing honey, the booklet explains that native bees are valued for pollinating plants. The USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bee. From the booklet, two female Morrison's bumble bees (Bombus morrisoni) sonicate the pollen from pored-anthers of a garden tomato.  “Much of the produce we eat is pollinated by bees,” said Larry Stritch, a USDA Forest Service National Botanist. “They pollinate about 75 percent of the fruits and vegetables grown in the (United States) and 80 percent of flowering plants. Take away bees and you greatly decrease our food source and food for animals.” According to “Bee Basics,” ground nesting bees provide food to wildlife and aerate and enrich soil.    The North American bumble bee, characterized by their relatively large, black, furry bodies and bright stripes, may be most familiar to Americans. There are about 50 species of bumble bees, which are important pollinators of tomatoes and clovers, a forage crop for cattle. Bumble bees are among the Apidae family of bees, which also include native carpenter, squash and cuckoo bees, and nonnative stingless, orchid and honey bees. Honey bees are the only natural source of honey that’s healthy for humans. Brought to America from Europe, honey bees don’t pollinate native plants as effectively as native bees. Along with information about a variety of bees, “Bee Basics” also contains pages of glossy, color illustrations of bees and plants. The booklet’s key message warns of the threat to native-bee survival that is posed by pesticides, competition for nectar from honey bees, and environmental destruction. To learn more about native bees, read “Bee Basics” on the Forest Service website.   The USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bee.

Pesticides 2. Competition for nectar from honey bees 3. Environmental destruction,"I don't have access to the specific information in the ""Bee Basics"" booklet regarding threats to native bee survival. However, based on general knowledge and research on bee conservation, I can provide some common threats that affect native bees and other pollinators: 1. **Habitat Loss and Destruction**: The destruction of natural habitats, including meadows and forests, reduces the availability of resources for native bees and leads to habitat fragmentation. 2. **Pesticide Use**: Pesticides, especially neonicotinoids, have been linked to bee deaths. They can harm bees directly or indirectly by affecting their food supply (flowers) and causing them to starve. 3. **Climate Change**: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns affect the timing of plant growth, making it harder for native bees to find nectar and pollen when they need it. 4. **Pollinator Diseases and Pests**: Like honeybees, native bees can be affected by diseases such as nosema and varroa mites, which weaken their populations. 5. **Invasive Species**: Non-native plants or animals that outcompete native species for resources can reduce the habitat available to native bees. 6. **Lack of Forage**: The increasing trend towards intensive agriculture and the reduction in wildflowers and other pollinator-friendly plants further reduces food availability for native bees. 7. **Urbanization**: As cities grow, natural habitats are destroyed, leaving little space or natural resources for native bees and other wildlife to thrive. These threats can vary by region depending on specific environmental conditions and human activities. The ""Bee Basics"" booklet likely addresses these and possibly other specific local concerns related to native bee survival.",7.415625487597992e-232,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.04444444444444444,0.8386874198913574
"District Wildlife Biologist, Region 5 Naturewatch Coordinator, Scott Salmon River Ranger District in  Forestry  Initiatives  Apr 23, 2010   In 1999, Yreka High School in Yreka, California received funds from a Forest Service Grant (Partners in Flight Program) to enhance their agriculture and natural resource program and provide wildlife habitat on school grounds. These funds were used to build a songbird garden, purchase fencing, materials for an irrigation system, and a greenhouse structure. The students and instructors constructed the fence, irrigation system and the greenhouse. The Songbird Garden Portion of the Yreka Community was funded by Partners in Flight Program. Then in the spring of 2009, the Siskiyou Gardens, Parks and Greenway Association (SGPGA) partnered with Yreka High School to develop a community garden and greenhouse. The Yreka Garden Club also agreed to help maintain the greenhouse in exchange for growing space. These organizations along with a number of community volunteers pulled their enthusiasm and resources together to make this project a reality. In a few short months they leveled the site, built the raised beds, fixed the fence and irrigation system, and started thousands of seedlings inside the greenhouse. Much of the heavy work was donated by members of the California Conservation Corps and some materials were donated by local businesses. The success of this community garden is the result of many enthusiastic volunteers. Approximately 25 beds were constructed as well as a flower beds to attract pollinators. The grand opening of this People’s Garden was May 3, 2009.  Festivities included a ribbon-cutting ceremony, old-time music, a plant sale, and gardening workshops. The garden was teeming with enthusiasm through the summer, and by September many hundreds of pounds of fruit and vegetables were ready to be harvested and donations were made to Yreka Senior Center, Yreka Hospice, Grange Hall Community Hot Meals Program, and Yreka Community Food Bank.  Through these organizations produce was made available to an estimated 300-350 people. Six workshops were held here on topics related to gardening, greenhouses, starting seed, and food preservation. This spring and summer the Yreka Community Garden will be hold free classes on permiculture, greenhouse plantings, composting and mulching, and canning. Special thanks goes to their partners! Members of the California Conservation Corps (CCC) volunteered their services for a variety of work including clean up, construction of the raised beds and setting fresh gravel in the greenhouse. The Ford Family Foundation Leadership Training Group is sponsoring the construction of an outdoor classroom/gazebo. This structure is a special project led by a local leadership training class which has been fund-raising for this project for 7 months.  This project has received much support from local contributors including Rotary Club and in kind contributions from local contractors. The Yreka Community Garden will also be developing a Children's Garden that will feature educational planting beds, small water fountain/bird bath, butterfly garden, willow tunnel, native American cedar plank house, and benches and paths. This is being developed by an active community group including U.S. Forest Service biologists, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists, local teachers, child development specialists, and local gardeners.

However, I can provide you with some general information about composting and mulching practices that may be similar to those used by community gardens. Composting and mulching are effective methods for reducing waste and creating a sustainable environment. Some innovative ways that community gardens might implement these practices include: * Using worm composting or vermicomposting, which involves using worms to break down food waste into a nutrient-rich compost. * Implementing a ""no-till"" or ""reduced-till"" approach, where mulch is used to suppress weeds and reduce soil erosion instead of tilling the soil. * Creating a community composting program, where residents can bring in their organic waste to be composted on-site or at a local facility. * Using a compost tea maker, which brews the nutrient-rich liquid from compost and adds it to the soil as a natural fertilizer. * Implementing a mulch-making program, where leaves and other yard trimmings are collected and turned into a nutrient-rich mulch for garden beds. * Creating a community garden with rainwater harvesting system, where rainwater is collected and used for irrigation instead of potable water.",2.8628585302170765e-155,0.2518518518518518,0.01492537313432836,0.1037037037037037,0.8376302719116211
"What is the Nine Agency Rule? The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights (OASCR) enforces the Nine Agency Rule under the authority delegated by the Secretary of Agriculture, pursuant to 7 C.F.R. § 2.25 (a)(1)(3). The Nine Agency Rule is designed to ensure that USDA programs of civil rights, including program delivery, compliance, and equal employment opportunity, adhere to all governing laws, rules, and regulations, including related Executive Orders and Congressional mandates. On February 14, 2021, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., signed Executive Order 14015, establishing the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, emphasizing the importance of partnering with civil society, including faith-based and secular organizations, to serve people in need while adhering to all governing laws. This Executive Order revoked Executive Order 13831 and reinstated key provisions to protect religious liberty. Key Provisions of the Nine Agency Rule  Equal Access for Faith-Based Organizations  Under 7 CFR § 16, faith-based organizations are eligible to access and participate in USDA assistance programs on the same basis as any other organization. USDA and its intermediaries must not discriminate against or for an organization based on its religious character, motives, affiliation, or lack thereof.  Non-Discrimination Against Beneficiaries  Organizations receiving direct or indirect Federal financial assistance from USDA must not discriminate against current or prospective beneficiaries based on religion, religious belief, refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice.  Separation of Religious Activities  Organizations that receive USDA direct assistance must separate any explicitly religious activities in time or location from the programs or services funded by USDA direct assistance, ensuring participation in such activities is voluntary. This restriction does not apply to indirect Federal financial assistance.  Notification Requirements  Recipients administering USDA social service programs must notify beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries of their right to be free from religious discrimination and how to report violations.  Alternative Providers  If a beneficiary objects to the religious character of a faith-based provider, the USDA awarding agency must make reasonable efforts to refer the beneficiary to an alternative provider.  Protections for Faith-Based Providers  Faith-based providers can compete equally with secular organizations for USDA awards while retaining their religious character, provided they comply with all applicable regulations. Examples of Nine Agency Rule Violations  Denied Service Based on Religious Beliefs  A food pantry volunteer denies service to an individual wearing a religious head covering and makes derogatory remarks about their faith.  Discriminatory Practices by Service Providers  A service provider receiving USDA funds denies services to a homeowner based on their perceived religion, using offensive language, and failing to address the discrimination. How to File a Complaint Any individual who believes they have been discriminated against based on religion, religious belief, refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice may file a complaint with OASCR.

"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication, and Larry Stritch, U.S. Forest Service National Botanist in  Forestry  May 03, 2012  Wildflower displays of blue Wasatch Penstemon and white Nuttall’s linanthus wildflowers bloom in the subalpine meadows of Albion Basin on the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest from mid-July through early August.  As spring begins across the nation, fields are turning green – and pastel pink, flaming scarlet, electric orange, brilliant yellow, deep violet and florescent blue.   Wildflowers are abloom!  This year, the Forest Service has released an updated wildflower map with 317 viewing areas to choose from on America’s national forests and grasslands.  In addition to locations, information is also provided on the best time for peak viewing. Yellow fritillaries are some of the first plants to bloom after the snow melts and are found in the western United States.  “Every year we continue to add new wildflower viewing areas,” said Larry Stritch, the U.S. Forest Service National Botanist.  “This year, we have updated the map so visitors can search by geographical region, state or national forest or grassland.  This makes it easier to plan day trips or extended journeys to enjoy the colorful displays of Mother Nature’s catalog of wildflowers.” Due to an extremely mild winter, an early spring is appearing in many areas and wildflower season has begun.  The pageantry begins with spring ephemerals such as bloodroot, Virginia bluebells, and squirrel corn.   Spring ephemerals are woodland wildflowers which appear in early spring, flower, set seed, and then die back to their underground parts before the trees unfurl their leaves. Other spring wildflowers seen in early spring include wild gingers, hepaticas, and trilliums. In late summer and early fall, the last wildflowers of the year begin to flower including asters, sunflowers, goldenrods, cardinal flower and gentians. Red columbine begin flowering in early spring in a cascade of blooms from the southern states on the Gulf of Mexico north into Canada.  The updated map includes a narrative for each viewing area which describes the area’s botanical habitat and wildflowers types that can be found by season, as well as recommendations for the best time of year to visit.  Safety advisories such as animal habitats, clothing recommendations, insect or plant cautions, and traffic and parking tips are provided.  Directions to the site, the closest town and contacts for more information are also offered. The map is part of the agency’s Celebrating Wildflowers web site which includes more than 10,000 plant images and over 1,500 pages of information about the aesthetic, recreational, biological, medicinal, and economic values of native plants as well how to conserve native plant habitats.

In general: * Yellow fritillaries typically bloom from mid-April to late May, depending on the elevation and location. * Linanthus wildflowers usually bloom from late April to early July, with peak blooming occurring in May and June. These flowers are among the first to emerge after the snow melts in the western United States. As a result, their blooming periods can vary slightly from year to year, depending on weather conditions. To maximize your chances of seeing these beautiful wildflowers, plan your visit to the western United States during late spring (May 15th to June 15th), when they are likely to be in full bloom. Some popular locations for spotting yellow fritillaries and linanthus include: * The Rocky Mountains * The Sierra Nevada mountain range in California * The Cascade Range in Oregon and Washington Keep in mind that these flowers often grow in areas with relatively high elevations (4,000-7,000 feet) and may be more difficult to spot at lower elevations. Always check with local park rangers or visitor centers for up-to-date information on bloom times and locations before heading out to enjoy these beautiful wildflowers!",4.757718127814107e-232,0.02714932126696833,0.0,0.01809954751131222,0.8069503903388977
"APHIS Wildlife Biologists Aid Squirrel Recovery on the Delmarva  Many claim that 2020 has been a year of chaos and calamity, but for one rare squirrel, it might be a year of hope and new beginnings. The Delmarva Fox Squirrel (DFS) is a subspecies of fox squirrel found on the eastern shore of Maryland, Southern Delaware and Virginia. This pudgy, slow squirrel with its signature size and silvery-white coat has become a conservation success story in Maryland. Habitat loss along with other additive factors landed them on the Federal endangered species list in 1967. Protection and management efforts benefited DFS and in 2015, populations reached stable limits and they were officially delisted in Maryland. In parts of Delaware, DFS populations were not as prolific and numbers began to dwindle over time leaving only a few small populations.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service-Florida Plant Materials Center in  Conservation  Animals  Plants  May 08, 2014  In northern Florida wildflowers are planted in an unused part of this farm field to provide habitat for pollinators. USDA photo. No matter what part of the country you grew up in, most of us have fond childhood memories of the wildflowers that sprung up each year around our homes, parks and roadsides. For many, this fondness has carried into our adult years. This week, we celebrate National Wildflower Week as a way to share our interest and to increase public awareness for wildflowers in the landscape. The beauty of wildflowers can indeed stir up memories of a certain place or time. But the wildflowers that are native to a particular place also serve an important function in the ecology of that place. Native wildflowers are those species that were already growing in an area before settlers came and planted their favorite flowers from their homelands. Plants that are native to an area are better adapted to the local growing conditions than non-native ones. They are generally easier to establish, require less water and fertilizer and are more tolerant of the pests and diseases found in that area. Many populations of native wildflowers have been lost because of urban development, competition from invasive plant species and some modern farming practices. We’ve learned that agriculture can benefit from native wildflowers. Patches of wildflowers located adjacent to crop fields can attract insects and other types of wildlife that in turn pollinate the crop and increase yields. In fact, more than a third of the world’s food crops are dependent on pollinators to produce fruit. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is working to combat this decline of wildflowers by promoting planting of them on farms and ranches. Several of the Farm Bill programs that NRCS administers have specific financial incentives tied to planting wildflowers. NRCS also maintains a national network of Plant Materials Centers that can provide information on which native wildflowers to plant to improve pollinator habitat and guidance on recommended methods for establishing and maintaining wildflower plantings. At the Plant Materials Center where I work, we recently partnered with the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation to track flowering periods of several native wildflowers. This information is being used to help develop seeding mixes for attracting pollinators to crops grown in Florida. Flowering periods of the crop and the wildflowers that we plan to use to attract pollinators must be in sync for successful pollination to occur. The information we gather can help determine the best wildflower species for farmers to plant in field borders, contour buffer strips and other conservation practices to ensure pollination of their crops.

The USDA's NRCS promotes their planting through financial incentives tied to Farm Bill programs and provides guidance through national Plant Materials Centers on selecting native wildflower species for pollinator habitat and optimal flowering periods.","Native wildflowers play a crucial role in pollination of crops by providing a source of food for pollinators such as bees, butterflies, moths, and other beneficial insects. These native wildflowers produce nectar and pollen that serve as essential nutrients for these animals, which are vital for the reproduction and growth of many crops. By planting native wildflowers on farms and ranches, landowners can help to: 1. **Increase pollinator populations**: Native wildflowers provide a source of food for pollinators during their peak activity periods, helping to sustain them throughout the growing season. 2. **Diversify pollinator sources**: By offering multiple sources of nectar and pollen, native wildflowers reduce dependence on single crops or specific pollinator species, making farms and ranches more resilient to environmental stressors. 3. **Enhance ecosystem services**: Native wildflowers contribute to soil health, improve water quality, and support beneficial insects that prey on pests, further enhancing the overall ecosystem services provided by these lands. The USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) promotes the planting of native wildflowers on farms and ranches through various programs and incentives, including: 1. **Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP)**: Provides financial assistance to landowners for implementing conservation practices, such as planting native wildflowers, that improve soil health, water quality, and pollinator populations. 2. **Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP)**: Offers technical and financial assistance to landowners who implement conservation practices, including the use of native wildflowers, to achieve environmental benefits and enhance ecosystem services. 3. **Planting for Pollinators**: A voluntary program that provides resources and guidance to help farmers and ranchers plant pollinator-friendly habitats, including native wildflowers, on their lands.

"Secretary Vilsack Announces New Steps to Address Climate Change  Earlier today it was my privilege to address those attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Cancun, Mexico. Climate change is one of the greatest threats facing our planet, and the United States is taking significant action to meet this challenge. Under President Obama’s leadership, the U.S. is advancing policies that address climate change by promoting energy efficiency in our homes, cars and businesses, increasing the domestic production of clean energy – including biofuels – and by investing in renewable energy technology.  The United States is also vigorously engaged in international climate negotiations while continuing to work with Congress on domestic climate legislation.  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack  Posted in  Dec 09, 2010  1 Response",What role do biofuels play in the US strategy to address climate change under President Obama?,"The US is increasing domestic production of clean energy, including biofuels, as part of its efforts to promote energy efficiency and address climate change.","Under President Obama, the role of biofuels in the US strategy to address climate change was to provide a renewable and low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels. As part of his administration's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change, the Obama Administration set a goal to produce 36 billion gallons of biofuels by 2022. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, established in 2007 and strengthened under President Obama, was a key component of this strategy. The RFS mandated that a minimum percentage of the country's transportation fuels come from renewable sources, such as corn ethanol, advanced biofuels, and other biomass-based fuels. Biofuels were seen as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, which accounts for approximately 30% of US emissions. By using biofuels, the Administration aimed to: 1. Reduce dependence on fossil fuels: Biofuels offered a domestic source of energy that could be produced from renewable biomass sources such as plants, algae, or agricultural waste. 2. Mitigate climate change: By reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, biofuels were seen as a key part of the Obama Administration's efforts to address climate change. 3. Promote energy independence: Biofuels were expected to reduce reliance on foreign oil and promote domestic energy production. However, it is worth noting that the effectiveness of biofuels in addressing climate change has been debated, particularly with regards to land use changes and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with their production. Some critics have argued that large-scale biofuel production could lead to increased deforestation, soil degradation, or competition for food crops, potentially negating any environmental benefits. Overall, under President Obama, biofuels played a significant role in the US strategy to address climate change by providing a renewable and low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels.",5.0625814624507807e-79,0.12422360248447205,0.04375,0.10559006211180123,0.8639646172523499
"A Reflection: Celebrating Eight Years of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships  Looking back at USDA’s efforts to help rural America thrive, I am truly proud of the impact our diverse partners, both from faith and secular communities, have had within their communities. On behalf of the USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, I would like to say thank you to our partners these past eight years as well as reflect on a few notable highlights of the work we have achieved together. USDA touches the lives of all Americans every day, whether they realize it or not. While our programs to reduce food insecurity are well known, our nation’s most vulnerable citizens can still be hard to reach. Faith-based and community partners have been especially helpful in this area, particularly when it comes to feeding children in summer months, when school is out of session. In collaboration with many partners, including Catholic Charities USA, the Church of God in Christ, Islamic Relief USA, the National Baptist Convention and the Salvation Army, USDA increased the number of summer meals served to kids by 16% between 2009 and 2015, a total of more than 1.2 billion summer meals served when school is out and food is scarce.

Here are some key roles they've played: 1. **Summer Food Service Programs**: Many FBOs, like The Salvation Army, partner with government agencies to operate Summer Food Service Programs (SFSP). These programs provide meals and snacks to children in low-income areas during the school break. 2. **Meal Distribution and Delivery**: FBOs have established networks of volunteers, vehicles, and storage facilities to distribute and deliver meals to underserved communities. This ensures that vulnerable children have access to nutritious food throughout the summer. 3. **Community Engagement and Outreach**: Faith-based organizations engage with local community leaders, schools, and social services to identify areas with high food insecurity rates. They also conduct outreach efforts to inform parents and caregivers about available resources. 4. **Culturally Sensitive Food Provision**: FBOs often tailor their programs to meet the specific needs of diverse communities. This includes providing culturally sensitive meals and accommodations for children with dietary restrictions or allergies. 5. **Volunteer Mobilization**: Faith-based organizations have extensive networks of volunteers, who provide invaluable support in meal preparation, delivery, and distribution. This not only amplifies the reach of their programs but also fosters community cohesion. 6. **Capacity Building and Partnerships**: FBOs like The Salvation Army collaborate with other organizations, government agencies, and local businesses to leverage resources, expertise, and funding. This enables them to scale up their services and create more sustainable solutions for food insecurity. Studies have shown that these efforts can lead to positive outcomes, such as: * Reduced food insecurity rates among children * Improved academic performance and attendance * Enhanced social-emotional well-being and behavior * Increased access to healthy foods in underserved areas The Salvation Army's specific initiatives, like their Summer Food Program, demonstrate the organization's commitment to addressing food insecurity and promoting childhood health and development.

"People’s Garden Intern in  Conservation  Initiatives  May 28, 2010   Today, the People’s Garden hosted a workshop about composting. Pat Millner, who has done a lot of research on composting and utilizing compost at the USDA-Agricultural Research Service’s Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Maryland, taught it. It was fantastically fun and informative, and Pat brought in several examples of composters for us to see. She informed us that composting isn’t as complicated as it might seem. Composts work because microorganisms break down the material, and these microorganisms need three things to be healthy, happy and produce lots of compost: food, air, and water. If compost contains these three principles, it will be fruitful. If you are looking to start a composter, the best season to start it is the fall. First, you need a bin. Layer about 4” of sticks (from any type of tree or shrub) in the bottom of the bin, this will provide good air flow and ventilation for the microorganisms and the compost. In your lawn, let your grass grow a little bit taller, and let the leaves fall too. Take your lawnmower and go over the area, catching the leaf/grass mix in a bag. You can put this mix in the bin, and let it take care of itself! What about those of us who live in a condo or apartment and don’t have a lawn, or just want a smaller compost? Try a vermicomposter. A vermicomposter uses worms to break down material into compost. You can “feed” the worms in the composter veggie and fruit scraps, coffee grounds and filters, crushed eggshells, shredded office paper, and even dryer lint. However, the worms aren’t fond of citrus fruits. Meat and dairy products should always stay out of composts too, the smell may attract some unwanted critters. The worms will consume what you feed them, and there’s no need to worry about them escaping. Their castings (a fancy way to say worm poop) make for very healthy compost! Before, when I heard about compost, the only use I knew was to enrich soil. Compost is used for much more! Runoff can create erosion and sweep away the healthy topsoil in many areas. A compost sock is a material that is filled with compost, and can be put on the side of a sloping hill, for example, to provide a filter for runoff rainwater. This can filter out any unwanted silt and even oil. Compost has also been added to places where chemicals or lead have contaminated the soil, causing plant life to die off; there, compost enriches the soil again and also blocks the harmful chemicals from being absorbed by the plants. If you’re looking for more information on composting, take a look at The People’s Garden Healthy Workshop handout on composting. It’s a great resource. Start a worm composter with newspaper or shredded office paper as bedding and about one pound of redworms.

The text mentions Alaska's rich diversity of federally recognized tribes and their significant land ownership but does not explicitly discuss conservation agriculture practices developed or adopted by these communities.","American Indian and Alaska Native communities have developed and adopted various conservation agriculture (CA) practices that are tailored to their unique cultural, environmental, and agricultural contexts. Some specific CA practices that have been developed or adopted by these communities include: 1. **No-till or reduced-tillage farming**: Many American Indian and Alaska Native farmers have implemented no-till or reduced-tillage systems, which minimize soil disturbance and reduce erosion. This practice is particularly effective in areas with fragile soils or high rainfall. 2. **Mulching and cover cropping**: Communities have used mulches made from crop residues, wood chips, or other organic materials to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. Cover crops, such as clover or rye, are also planted between cash crops to add nutrients, improve soil health, and provide a habitat for beneficial insects. 3. **Crop rotation**: Traditional crop rotation practices have been revived, involving the sequential planting of different crops to break disease and pest cycles, maintain soil fertility, and promote biodiversity. 4. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**: American Indian and Alaska Native farmers often incorporate IPM strategies, which involve using a combination of techniques, such as crop rotation, biological control, and cultural practices, to manage pests and diseases in a holistic way. 5. **Soil conservation and restoration**: Many communities have developed or adopted soil conservation and restoration practices, including terracing, contour farming, and planting native vegetation to protect watersheds, prevent erosion, and improve soil health. 6. **Agroforestry**: Some American Indian and Alaska Native farmers have incorporated agroforestry systems, which involve growing trees alongside crops to create a more diverse and resilient farm ecosystem. 7. **Native crop selection and breeding**: Communities have identified and developed or adopted native crop varieties that are well-suited to their local climate, soil conditions, and cultural traditions. These crops often possess inherent disease resistance and tolerance, reducing the need for external inputs. 8. **Organic farming**: Many American Indian and Alaska Native farmers have transitioned to organic farming methods, which emphasize natural soil fertility, pest management, and crop selection.

"Focusing on the Future of Food Assistance  USDA’s food assistance and development programs serve a dual purpose: to meet the immediate needs of hungry people, and to show their countries how to rejuvenate their agricultural sectors and increase their capacity to trade. We accomplish these goals in cooperation with other U.S. government agencies and with private-sector partners ranging from non-governmental organizations to research institutions to agribusinesses. And we are always looking for ways to be more effective. So this week, at the International Food Aid and Development Conference (IFADC) in Kansas City, we got back to basics, discussing steps we are taking to operate our international aid programs more efficiently to ensure that program dollars go directly to eliminating hunger and poverty. We focused on how USDA can strengthen our partnerships with academia and international relief and development groups, as well as with local and international companies.

By playing these roles, agribusinesses can contribute significantly to rejuvenating agricultural sectors, increasing capacity for trade, and promoting food security in developing countries.",4.772698212421131e-79,0.16428571428571428,0.05035971223021583,0.12142857142857141,0.8630370497703552
"Director, Arthur Carhart National Wilderness Training Center in  Forestry  Feb 10, 2012   When the first Europeans settled in what is now the United States, they found a continent of extensive wildlands. In less than 500 years, the undeveloped nature of these wildlands has been reduced significantly. As they became increasingly scarce and a fledgling conservation movement lost natural treasures like Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley to development, Americans began to appreciate their value. View of the Sawtooth Range in Idaho. U.S. Forest Service photo. With passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964, a new course in history was chartered -- to preserve some of the country's last remaining wild places and protect their natural processes and values from development. The interagency Arthur Carhart National Wilderness Training Center, located in Missoula, Mont., was created in 1993 to empower federal agency employees and the public to preserve their wilderness heritage through training, information and education. It has become a critical resource for land managers from the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service as they manage more than 109 million acres of designated wilderness from Alaska to Puerto Rico. The center’s staff of seven works with experts within and outside the agencies to develop comprehensive interagency solutions to critical stewardship issues. Materials are distributed electronically to each of the 792 units comprising America's National Wilderness Preservation System, and training is offered where it is most needed. Most recently, in collaboration with the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute and the Wilderness Institute at the University of Montana, the center conducted a webinar called The Foundation and Qualities of Wilderness Character. This interactive, collaborative approach to training and coaching ensures that the Carhart Center continues providing training and information that employees need, when they need it, so that they can keep wilderness wild.

"A Reflection: Celebrating Eight Years of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships  Looking back at USDA’s efforts to help rural America thrive, I am truly proud of the impact our diverse partners, both from faith and secular communities, have had within their communities. On behalf of the USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, I would like to say thank you to our partners these past eight years as well as reflect on a few notable highlights of the work we have achieved together. USDA touches the lives of all Americans every day, whether they realize it or not. While our programs to reduce food insecurity are well known, our nation’s most vulnerable citizens can still be hard to reach. Faith-based and community partners have been especially helpful in this area, particularly when it comes to feeding children in summer months, when school is out of session. In collaboration with many partners, including Catholic Charities USA, the Church of God in Christ, Islamic Relief USA, the National Baptist Convention and the Salvation Army, USDA increased the number of summer meals served to kids by 16% between 2009 and 2015, a total of more than 1.2 billion summer meals served when school is out and food is scarce.

"Tips for Handwashing When Running Water is Not Accessible  By now, many of us have heard several times that washing hands with soap and water is an effective way to get rid of germs, including those that cause foodborne illness. We are advised to wash our hands often, especially before and after handling food. This advice is easy to follow when we have access to clean, running water. But how do you wash your hands if you find that clean, running water is out of reach?  Lynn Pereira, Student Trainee, Technical Information Specialist, USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service  Posted in  Health and Safety  May 21, 2020  Respond to this story",What are some effective handwashing alternatives when running water is not accessible?,Hand sanitizer can be used as an alternative to washing hands with soap and water.,"When running water is not available, there are still effective ways to clean your hands. Here are some alternatives: 1. **Hand Sanitizers**: Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% ethanol or isopropanol. Rub the gel or spray all over your hands, making sure to cover all surfaces until it's dry. 2. **Waterless Hand Cleaning Wipes**: These are pre-moistened wipes made of a non-irritating material that can be used as an alternative to soap and water. Look for ones containing antibacterial agents. 3. **Baby Wipes**: While not designed for hand hygiene, baby wipes can serve as a temporary solution in emergency situations when running water is unavailable. Use them only if no other options are available. 4. **Alcohol-based Sprays**: Similar to hand sanitizers but in a spray form, these can be used on the hands and surfaces that need disinfecting. It's essential to note that while these alternatives can help reduce the number of germs on your hands, they may not provide the same level of cleanliness as washing with soap and water. In situations where running water is not available for an extended period, prioritizing handwashing as soon as possible remains the most effective method for maintaining good hygiene. **Additional Tips:** - Always use these alternatives in conjunction with proper hand technique, including rubbing all surfaces of your hands together to ensure thorough cleaning. - If you're using a sanitizing wipe or spray on dirty hands that have visible dirt and grime, consider washing those parts first with water if possible, before proceeding with the alternative method. - When in doubt about whether these alternatives are appropriate for your situation, consult local health guidelines or medical professionals for specific advice.",0.02945272479868031,0.09933774834437085,0.06666666666666667,0.09271523178807947,0.8529428243637085

"Posted by acampbell in  Initiatives  Dec 04, 2009   Despite the chilly air and light frost, the atmosphere at the Groundbreaking Ceremony I attended last month for the Winterport Water District was warm as partners greeted one another and remarked on the terrific project they were about to break ground upon. Winterport Water District has received a total of $1.89 million for essential upgrades to its infrastructure, including the replacement of over 6,000 feet of sewer line. The funds will ensure that partially treated sewage no longer flows into the Maine’s Penobscot River. Minimizing the environmental impact on Maine's pristine rivers and streams is a priority that we all share and it is important to note that funds invested in this project ensure that the Penobscot River will be safe from partially treated sewage or other contaminants, preserving it for the communities who share it for recreation, fishing, and so much more. Winterport Water District's ratepayers have the 4th highest sewer rates in the state, with users paying nearly 2 percent of their income for user fees. The increase in user rates for this project will be greatly reduced because of the use of grant funds.USDA Rural Development is providing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act dollars in the amount of $710,000. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection is providing $1,185,ate Revolving Loan Fund. Longtime resident of Winterport, 88-year-old Teddy Weston was on hand to celebrate the project, which is near and dear to her heart. He husband Donald had served on the Board at Winterport Water District for 37 years. Although he passed away last year, she told me that he would have been proud to see what is happening here.

"Research in Energy Security Helps Lead to Food Security in West Africa  Research shows the majority of people in Africa depend on biomass to meet their energy needs, with approximately 80 percent relying on wood energy. Such high dependency makes families vulnerable to unexpected and sudden changes, including extreme weather and socio-political events. Researching and developing ways to diversify energy sources is crucial for a more sustainable, food secure future. A project funded through the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) Cochran Fellowship Program on “Biofuels for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods,” hosted by the University of Missouri (MU) College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources International Programs, set out to address this very issue. The research and training program was organized for West African Cochran Fellows to learn how different uses of biofuels can help support sustainable livelihoods in their communities. The two-week-long program consisted of workshops, field visits and interactive discussions in cooperation with the USDA Forest Products Laboratory, the MU Center for Agroforestry, Columbia Center for Urban Agriculture and Envest Microfinance.

"Foreign Agricultural Service in  Initiatives  Trade  Mar 01, 2011  Mr. Rode is pictured here with Thom Wright, a FAS agricultural attaché in India, and one of Mr. Rode’s American-origin Holstein crosses which won a milk production award at the Progressive Dairy Farmers Association show. Halfway around the world, a farmer in India stands proudly in the winner’s circle with his cow. Mr. S. Sukharpreet Singh Rode, the farmer, is a 2008 graduate of the Cochran Fellowship Program, an educational exchange program administered by USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS). As a Cochran fellow, Mr. Rode spent two weeks at the University of Wisconsin learning about innovative techniques on animal husbandry, improved feeding practices, animal diseases and treatments, and calf rearing. With this background, Mr. Rode returned to India, where he used high-quality American dairy cattle genetics to improve his dairy business in the Punjab region, one of the most fertile areas in India. The cow in the winner’s circle with Mr. Rode is one of his American-origin Holstein crosses (crossed with a local Indian cow), and in February it won a milk production award at the Progressive Dairy Farmers Association show near Ludhiana. India is the world’s largest dairy producer and maintains the world’s largest dairy herd. Given population and income growth in India, Indian farmers are now looking for new management tools and technologies to increase local production and meet growing demand. U.S. cattle genetics are well adapted to Indian farming practices and are already providing significant milk yield increases for Indian farmers. Working closely with the FAS office in New Delhi, India, American genetics companies are helping India build its genetics technology. At the same time, the United States will benefit from a new market for American cattle genetics exports, which holds potential for significant growth. The FAS Cochran Program, which gave Mr. Rode the training he needed to improve his business, provides U.S.-based agricultural training opportunities for agriculture professionals like Mr. Rode from foreign countries. To be selected for the program, fellows must be senior or mid-level specialists and administrators from public and private sectors concerned with agricultural trade, agribusiness development, management, policy, and marketing. In the end, the Cochran Fellowship Program helps to support U.S. exports and build long-term relationships with trading partners. Mr. Rode’s story is an example of how USDA and FAS work to promote U.S. exports through a variety of programs which benefit the United States and other countries around the world.

"Water Quality Trading in the Chesapeake Bay  Last fall, USDA brought together a group of Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) awardees, state policymakers, and other stakeholders involved in one of the most challenging nutrient management initiatives in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed: enabling water quality trading markets. Water quality trading offers flexibility to those required to improve water quality in the Bay: power plants, wastewater treatment plants, new developments, and agricultural producers, among others. It allows those facing high costs of water quality improvement to reduce those costs, working with farmers to improve water quality on their behalf, thus providing farmers with additional income streams and the opportunity to significantly increase the scope of conservation practices on their land.  Kate Zook, Office of the Chief Economist  Posted in  Conservation  Dec 16, 2013  Respond to this story",How can water quality trading markets benefit farmers and policymakers by enabling cost-effective nutrient management and promoting conservation practices?,"Water quality trading markets allow farmers to earn additional income streams by improving water quality on their land, while also providing policymakers with a cost-effective way to manage nutrients in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.","Water quality trading markets (WQTM) are innovative approaches that allow farmers, industries, and municipalities to buy and sell credits for excess nutrient reductions. This system promotes the adoption of best management practices (BMPs), which can benefit both farmers and policymakers in several ways: **Benefits to Farmers:** 1. **Cost-effective nutrient management**: By buying credits from other farmers or entities that have already implemented effective BMPs, farmers can offset their own nutrient reduction costs. 2. **Increased revenue streams**: Farmers can sell excess nutrient reduction credits, providing a new income source and incentivizing them to adopt conservation practices. 3. **Improved crop yields and soil health**: Implementing BMPs like cover cropping, rotational grazing, or integrating organic amendments can lead to healthier soils, improved water infiltration, and increased crop yields. **Benefits to Policymakers:** 1. **Efficient nutrient reduction targets**: WQTM allows policymakers to set and achieve specific nutrient reduction targets more effectively by utilizing the collective efforts of various stakeholders. 2. **Reduced infrastructure costs**: By promoting BMPs, policymakers can reduce the need for costly infrastructure projects like wastewater treatment plants or agricultural drainage systems. 3. **Enhanced environmental protection**: WQTM encourages farmers to adopt conservation practices that protect water quality and promote sustainable agriculture. **Key Principles:** 1. **Transparent credit system**: A reliable credit trading system is essential to ensure that credits are properly accounted for, and the market functions smoothly. 2. **Incentivizing BMPs**: The market should encourage farmers to implement effective BMPs by offering a fair price for their excess nutrient reductions. 3. **Stakeholder engagement**: Policymakers must engage with farmers, industries, and other stakeholders throughout the development and implementation of WQTM. Overall, water quality trading markets provide a flexible, cost-effective framework that benefits both farmers and policymakers while promoting sustainable agriculture practices and improving environmental protection.",0.013395875577609599,0.16564417177914112,0.04938271604938271,0.10429447852760737,0.8398395776748657
"Ecologists Look to Traditional Knowledge to Bolster Sustainability Science  People around the world manipulate ecosystems for their own purposes. It’s what you leave behind when you’re finished working or living in the area that determines whether the ecosystem survives or is irreparably harmed for future generations. For scientists like John Parrotta, national program leader for international science issues with the U.S. Forest Service, knowing what to leave behind is not always found in a college textbook or scientific journal.  Diane Banegas, Research and Development, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Oct 18, 2016  Respond to this story",Can traditional knowledge from local communities be effectively integrated into sustainability science to help preserve ecosystems for future generations?,"Yes,  ecologists like John Parrotta believe that traditional knowledge from local communities can be effectively integrated into sustainability science to inform conservation practices and preserve ecosystems.","Yes, traditional knowledge from local communities can be effectively integrated into sustainability science to help preserve ecosystems for future generations. In fact, incorporating traditional knowledge has been recognized as a key strategy in promoting sustainable development and conservation of natural resources. Here are some reasons why: 1. **Local context**: Traditional knowledge is often rooted in the local culture and environment, providing a nuanced understanding of ecosystem dynamics and the impact of human activities on those ecosystems. 2. **Holistic perspective**: Indigenous communities have a deep appreciation for the interconnectedness of all living beings and their surroundings, recognizing that human well-being is linked to the health of the land and its inhabitants. 3. **Adaptive management**: Traditional knowledge can inform adaptive management practices that take into account the long-term implications of human activities on ecosystems. 4. **Community-led conservation**: Local communities are more likely to be invested in conserving their traditional lands, as they understand the historical, cultural, and ecological significance of those areas. 5. **Collaborative learning**: Integrating traditional knowledge with scientific research can foster collaborative learning between scientists, policymakers, and local communities, promoting a more comprehensive understanding of ecosystem dynamics. Examples of successful integration include: 1. **Indigenous-led conservation initiatives**: In countries like Canada, the United States, and Australia, Indigenous communities are playing leading roles in protecting their traditional lands and ecosystems. 2. **Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK)**: TEK is being increasingly recognized as a valuable resource for informing ecosystem management and policy decisions. 3. **Participatory research projects**: Research projects that involve local communities in the design, implementation, and interpretation of studies have shown greater effectiveness in promoting sustainable development. To effectively integrate traditional knowledge into sustainability science: 1. **Build trust and respect**: Foster relationships with local communities based on mutual understanding and respect for their knowledge and perspectives. 2. **Co-create research agendas**: Collaborate with community members to design research projects that address their concerns and priorities. 3. **Integrate TEK into decision-making**: Incorporate traditional ecological knowledge into policy decisions, using it as a complementary source of information alongside scientific research. By embracing the wisdom of local communities and integrating their traditional knowledge into sustainability science, we can create more effective, inclusive, and sustainable approaches to preserving ecosystems for future generations.",0.035912595350828885,0.11083123425692695,0.0658227848101266,0.09571788413098237,0.8491207361221313
"in  USDA Results  Initiatives  Energy  Food and Nutrition  Technology  Jan 26, 2011   Last night I had the privilege of attending President Obama’s State of the Union speech.  In it, he laid out some of the challenges America faces moving forward as we compete with nations across the globe to win the future. The President’s vision is simple.  We need to be a nation that makes, creates and innovates so that we can expand the middle class and ensure that we pass along to our children the types of freedoms, opportunities and experiences that we have enjoyed. At USDA, we share the Administration’s commitment to creating jobs and revitalizing our economy. We are driving innovation, promoting the production of renewable energy, which is creating jobs in rural America, helping our environment and decreasing our dependence on foreign oil.  We are helping provide a better education for America’s children, making the most important changes to school meals in decades so that our kids will be at their best and ready to learn in class.  We are building critical infrastructure, bringing access to high speed broadband internet to millions of rural Americans to help drive job creation and lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth. USDA also shares the President’s belief that we need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government so that it’s leaner and smarter for the 21st century. Last year we saved $6 billion through the negotiation of a new agreement for crop insurance, $4 billion of which will go to pay down the federal deficit.  And agencies across the Department have looked for ways to reform the way they do business – from reducing the number of visits a farmer has to make to our offices to get conservation services, to saving millions in taxpayer dollars by operating our food assistance programs with historic levels of accuracy. And American agriculture has embraced these same values for years.  Our farmers and ranchers are problem solvers.  Time and time again, they’ve adapted, embracing science and new technology that have allowed them to produce about twice as much per acre as their grandfathers did 50 years ago.  Growers educate their children, build impressive operations.  And – particularly in recent years – they have carried very little debt relative to the rest of the economy.  These values are all part of why American agriculture has seen a strong and rapid rebound from the recession. Last night, the President told us that winning the future will require a lot of hard work and sacrifice from everyone.  But if our farmers and ranchers can do it – I know our nation can as well.  Working together, we can build a foundation for American competiveness for years to come so that we pass on a stronger America to our children and grandchildren.

"Conservation  Jun 22, 2010  On Friday, I was pleased to be part of unveiling the latest step in the Obama Administration’s strategy for restoring the Chesapeake Bay with the announcement of three Showcase Watershed projects in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia. The Showcase Watershed pilot projects will demonstrate what can be accomplished by bringing people, sound science and funding together to solve natural resource problems in a targeted area. USDA and our partners are helping farmers within the Showcase Watersheds implement voluntary conservation practices to reduce nutrient and sediment runoff. This matters, because all of the water that enters waterways from local farms in the watersheds eventually ends up in the Bay. Successful approaches learned in Showcase areas can serve as models for restoring ecosystems elsewhere in the country. A thriving and sustainable agricultural sector is essential to the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay, so the announcement of the Showcase Watersheds was made from a working farm in each State. I was honored to attend the launch event in Pennsylvania at the Eby-Patterson farm in Hershey, where the owners raise beef cattle and are excellent stewards of their natural resources.  We had the opportunity to examine the positive changes in the Conewago Creek that runs through their property.  With experts from our Natural Resources Conservation Service on hand we examined the aquatic life that is thriving in the creek and talked with the Patterson family about their efforts to contribute to a healthier watershed.All three watersheds—Smith Creek in Virginia, Upper Chester River in Maryland and Conewago Creek in Pennsylvania—include a wide diversity of agriculture, allowing for a number of different approaches to conservation. In every case, though, USDA is coordinating with numerous partners from local, state and federal government, non-profit organizations and private organizations to reach out to 100 percent of land owners. We rely on our nation’s working lands for sustenance, economic health and cultural heritage, not to mention beautiful and satisfying landscapes like the one I was privileged to visit on Friday.   The focused work we do in the Showcase Watersheds—added to the extensive conservation efforts already in place to restore the Bay—will strengthen both the region and U.S. agriculture overall, enhancing both productivity and sustainability. We are proud to be partners in this critical effort.  Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan looks over the creek at the farm of Mrs. Eby-Patterson and husband, Daniel.

However, it's essential to note that while the USDA does engage in activities that indirectly contribute to workforce development across various sectors, including agriculture, its primary focus is not directly on preparing workers for a broad range of jobs within all sectors of the economy. 1. **Agricultural Training**: The USDA provides training and education programs aimed at enhancing skills related to agriculture, such as farming practices, horticulture, animal husbandry, and agricultural business management. These efforts are crucial for ensuring a skilled workforce in the agricultural sector but can indirectly contribute to broader economic goals by fostering innovative approaches within this industry. 2. **Rural Development**: Through its rural development programs, the USDA supports initiatives that promote entrepreneurship, job creation, and economic growth in rural areas. This includes support for small businesses, cooperatives, and other organizations that contribute to local economies. By fostering these activities, the USDA helps in creating a more diverse range of jobs and industries within rural America. 3. **Education and Research**: The USDA also supports research in agriculture-related fields at universities and through its own research facilities. This not only enhances agricultural productivity but can also lead to innovations that benefit other sectors of the economy, such as biotechnology or environmental conservation. 4. **Support for Workforce Development Grants**: Some programs within the USDA support grants that help prepare workers with skills needed in various sectors, including agriculture. However, these are more targeted towards specific industries and may not cover a broad range of economic sectors. 5. **Partnerships and Collaboration**: The USDA engages in partnerships with other federal agencies (like the Department of Labor), state governments, educational institutions, and private sector entities to support workforce development initiatives. This collaborative approach can help ensure that workers are equipped with skills relevant to various sectors of the economy. While the USDA's primary focus is on agriculture and related areas, its activities contribute indirectly to broader economic goals by fostering innovation, entrepreneurship, and job creation across different sectors. The agency's work in areas like rural development, research, and education can have far-reaching impacts that help American workers acquire skills necessary for competing in the modern economy.",1.8046003876614104e-155,0.06682577565632458,0.019184652278177457,0.06205250596658712,0.8288151025772095

"Supporting the Next Generation of Agriculture  All universities engage in research and teaching, but the nation’s more than 100 land-grant colleges and universities, have a third critical mission—extension.  “Extension” means “reaching out,” and—along with teaching and research—land-grant institutions extend their resources, solving public needs with college or university resources through non-formal, non-credit programs. These programs are largely administered through thousands of county and regional extension offices, which bring land-grant expertise to the most local of levels.  And both the universities and their local offices are supported by NIFA, the federal partner in the Cooperative Extension System (CES).

To effectively extend their resources and address local public needs, these institutions employ non-formal programs administered by regional extension offices. Here's how they do it: **Cooperative Extension** The Cooperative Extension System is a network of over 3,000 county-based offices across the US, operated by land-grant colleges and universities in partnership with federal, state, and local governments. These offices serve as a bridge between research institutions and local communities, providing non-formal educational programs, research support, and technical assistance to address public needs. **Key Strategies** To extend their resources effectively through regional extension offices: 1. **Needs Assessment**: Extension offices conduct regular assessments of local needs and priorities, identifying areas where the land-grant institution can provide relevant expertise. 2. **Program Planning**: Based on these assessments, extension offices develop programs that match the skills and knowledge of faculty members and staff with community needs. 3. **Collaboration**: Land-grant institutions collaborate with government agencies, industry leaders, and local organizations to ensure program relevance and effectiveness. 4. **Community Engagement**: Extension offices engage directly with local communities through various outreach efforts, such as workshops, demonstrations, and one-on-one consultations. **Examples of Effective Programs** Some examples of successful programs that demonstrate the effectiveness of land-grant colleges and universities in extending their resources include: 1. **Agricultural Education**: Providing training and technical assistance to farmers on best management practices, including crop and animal production, soil conservation, and water quality. 2. **Youth Development**: Offering 4-H programs for youth, focusing on life skills development, leadership building, and community engagement. 3. **Workforce Development**: Delivering job training and education programs in areas like healthcare, technology, and manufacturing. 4. **Environmental Education**: Conducting research and providing educational programs on environmental topics such as climate change, water quality, and conservation biology.

"An Airport is No Place for an Owl  Seeing a short-eared owl in November on the Pittsburgh International Airport, where I work as an airport wildlife biologist, was a unique occasion. However, as the number of owls grew to eight, I recognized the challenge ahead:  Like all birds of prey, short-eared owls are a recognized potential aviation hazard. Their low rolling flight and difficult-to-disperse reputation means they pose an aviation safety threat.  From 1990-2012, short-eared owl strikes with aircraft in the United States caused over $1 million in damage, and often are fatal to the birds.  Convincing them to leave would be difficult but important. The task would be harder because short-eared owls are listed by the State as an endangered species.  Common in many areas globally, Pennsylvania is the southernmost edge of their breeding range.  These owls likely migrated from Canadian breeding grounds to winter in Pennsylvania.

"During National Farm to School Month, USDA Celebrates Grantees' Accomplishments and a New Office  Along with brilliantly colored hard squash, crisp apples, and hearty greens, October ushers in National Farm to School Month, a time to raise awareness about and celebrate the impact of farm to school programs on children, producers, and communities. Since 2012, I have directed USDA’s Farm to School Program, guiding the work of a small but enthusiastic team at the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). Each October, we have more to celebrate: more USDA funds awarded to schools, agencies, and organizations to advance these programs; more money ending up in the pockets of local producers; more school gardens in which students can learn and grow; and more healthful school meals that feature local foods. A new report, announced by Agriculture Secretary Vilsack earlier this month, helps quantify our celebration. An analysis of grant-making over the last three years reveals that USDA has awarded $15.1 million through 221 grants in 49 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Fifty percent of funded projects included expanding healthy menu options offered in the cafeteria; 46 percent included training for food service staff about menu planning, meal preparation, and cooking with local and regional foods; and 65 percent included nutrition education activities.

"Undersecretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  May 17, 2016  School lunch staff and students enjoy the new school lunch menu created to meet the new standards at the Yorkshire Elementary School in Manassas, VA. It may seem like common sense for child nutrition programs to benefit children, but some see it differently today. Nationwide, schools have made the lunchroom a healthy environment. In fact, in only the second school year of full implementation of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA), over 98 percent of schools participating are already meeting the healthier meal standards.  Students are eating more fruits and vegetables during the school day and more low-income children are eating nutritious breakfasts and lunches at school. And data show obesity rates for some children are leveling off. With all the success of HHFKA, now is not the time to intentionally go backwards on nutrition standards in healthier school meals and to block access to these meals for millions of children. In January, the Senate Agriculture Committee unanimously took a bipartisan step toward reauthorizing critical child nutrition programs like school lunch and breakfast. Rather than diminish the progress we’ve already made, the Senate's bill ensures these improvements to our children's diets will continue.  The bipartisan Senate bill represents a compromise that allows us to stop rehashing old debates and secures a healthier future for our kids. It represents a win for children, parents, schools, and our country's future. In contrast, the House Education and Workforce Committee’s bill aims to weaken one of the most successful aspects of HHFKA. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), which allows high-poverty schools or districts to serve all students free meals without any burdensome paperwork, has been lauded for increasing student participation, reducing administrative burdens and costs on schools, cutting down on paperwork for busy parents, and improving program integrity. But the House bill would place new limitations on the number of schools in high-poverty areas that qualify for CEP, forcing many high-poverty schools to lose eligibility. This would cause school meal participation to fall dramatically, and schools would be forced to spend more time on paperwork and less time focusing on feeding kids. And some children who need free meals may slip through the cracks. The House bill would also roll back the school meal nutrition standards and gut the Smart Snacks in School rule, which ensures that all snack foods and beverages for sale to students during the school day are nutritious. Under the House bill, school vending machines could go back to selling soda and junk food.  Schools have already invested time and effort into making the switch to healthier options.  The snack food industry has innovated and developed hundreds of new products that meet the requirements and are popular with students.  Now is not the time to regress. We are proud of the way the school meals program provides flexibility for schools to tailor the programs to their local needs. For example, schools design their own menus and have the ability to serve items they know their students prefer.  They can also choose options like CEP and serve afterschool snacks and suppers if they are the right fit for their local community. However, in the name of local flexibility, some are considering a proposal to convert the school nutrition programs into a block grant. That is a very dangerous idea. Not only would it put further strain on state and local school districts’ budgets, but it would jeopardize children’s access to quality, healthy school meals no matter where they live. Instead, we are working with schools and districts to ensure their programs meet their needs. One example is the Team Up For School Nutrition Success training. Along with the Institute of Child Nutrition, we offer all state agencies the opportunity to host local events to provide tailored technical assistance, support, and best practices for schools in administering successful meals programs. During the training, schools cover topics like menu planning, financial management, procurement, meal presentation and appeal, as well as youth engagement tactics and strategies to reduce plate waste. Schools have the opportunity to learn from each other in order to make positive strides toward providing healthy school environments with financial stability and strong student participation. With all these strides being made, now is not the time to eliminate the successful partnership between the federal government and state agencies, putting further strain on state and local school districts’ budgets. It would be unwise to roll back the school meal standards and I urge Congress to stay the course for sake of our children. USDA looks forward to working with Congress, schools, parents and communities to continue to improve the health and wellbeing of the next generation.

Weakening school meal standards could lead to decreased student focus, attention span, and overall academic achievement. 3. **Increased burden on the healthcare system**: The potential long-term health consequences of weakening school meal standards could put an additional strain on the healthcare system, as more students may require medical treatment for diet-related health problems. 4. **Disadvantaging low-income students**: Weakening school meal standards would disproportionately affect low-income students who rely heavily on school meals as a primary source of nutrition. These students are already at higher risk for health disparities and may be further disadvantaged by reduced access to healthy food options in schools. 5. **Undermining the progress made towards improving child nutrition**: The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 set important standards for school meal programs to promote healthier eating habits among children. Repealing or weakening these standards would undermine the progress made in this area and send a contradictory message about the importance of healthy eating. 6. **Lack of support from parents and students**: Many parents and students have expressed strong support for the current nutrition standards, which prioritize whole, nutrient-dense foods over processed and sugary options. Weakening or rolling back these standards would likely face significant opposition from stakeholders who value the health and well-being of school-age children. Overall, weakening or rolling back the standards for healthy school meals could have far-reaching consequences for students' physical and academic health, as well as the broader healthcare system and society as a whole.",0.03563211224910303,0.187192118226601,0.0693069306930693,0.1330049261083744,0.8578817248344421

"Under Secretary, Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 16, 2016  For more than 40 years, USDA has been committed to closing the food security gap that occurs in the summer months when children no longer have access to the nutritious meals they’re offered in school. As I travel across the country visiting our nation’s summer meals sites, I am proud of the commitment we’ve collectively made to nourish both the bodies and minds of our country’s children and teens. Schools, recreation centers, places of worship, libraries and other community sites have generously opened their doors to ensure kids receive healthy, balanced meals during the summer months – a time when many low-income families struggle to provide their children nutritious meals and snacks each and every day. At USDA we’ve long recognized summer as a vulnerable time for kids and have been focused on closing the food security gap that occurs during the months when school is out of session.  Since 2009, more than 1.2 billion meals have been served through the Summer Meal Programs, fueling kids and teens throughout the summer and helping to ensure they are healthy and ready to learn when the school year begins. In support of these same goals, the White House announced earlier this year the Summer Opportunity Project, a multi-agency initiative to expand opportunities for young people through the summer.  The initiative aims to increase the participation of youth in evidence-based summer opportunity programs and make sure young Americans have the support they need to get their first job. USDA’s Summer Meal Programs play an important role in achieving this mission. By ensuring the most basic need of good nutrition is met, kids and teens in eligible communities can more easily pursue and leverage summer opportunities.  Many sites offer not only healthy meals and snacks, but also host physical and enrichment activities to keep kids engaged and coming back day after day.  By including free and low-cost activities into Summer Meal Programs, sites boost attendance and make the meal service more fun for children, their families, and volunteers.  To support these efforts, this spring USDA published Summer Food, Summer Moves to help sites and sponsors offer ideas on engaging kids, teens, and their families. Increasing the number of meals served through the Summer Meal Programs has been a rewarding achievement during my time at FNS, as each meal served elevates the life of a child or teen in our country.   With the help of our creative and hardworking volunteers, sponsors and partners, we were able to serve more than 190 million meals last summer.  Groups like Fuel Up to Play 60, Feeding America, Catholic Charities, United Way, and First Book have all played a key part in providing access to summer meals for children living in areas with high food insecurity.  Engaging the community in summer meals is also integral to the success of the program.  These programs allow communities to take a lead role in preventing hunger and focus their efforts where there is increased need.

"USDA Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 30, 2016   Cross-posted from the Disability.gov blog: Your neighborhood grocer may be conveniently located just a few short blocks away. But for many persons with disabilities and the elderly participating in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the store might as well be on the other side of the world. It’s a difficult problem that USDA’s new homebound food delivery pilot aims to alleviate, not just for the more than 4 million nonelderly adults with disabilities participating in SNAP, but also for the nearly 5 million seniors, who often face similar challenges and who may face disabilities, as well. USDA recently announced the food purchasing and delivery firms selected to take part in the one-year pilot, which will be conducted in locations nationwide, perhaps at a location near you. Firms selected include Denver Food Rescue (Denver, Colo.), Lutheran Social Services of Nevada (Las Vegas, N.V.), Many Infinities, Inc. (Alabaster, Ala.), Senior Services of Alexandria (Alexandria, Va.), and Store to Door (Roseville, Minn.). The pilots break new ground for USDA. For the first time, governmental and non-profit food purchasing and delivery services will be allowed to accept SNAP benefits as payment. This is expected to increase the opportunities for home delivery to those unable to shop for food. I think it’s important to note that during the trial period participating firms will only be permitted to accept SNAP benefits from households where the qualifying person with disabilities or elderly person is the head of household. This is intended to ensure that the pilot focuses on households that have the most limited access to foods. Given that nearly one in five SNAP participants is either elderly or a person with disabilities, it’s clear that we must address the special challenges faced by these groups. Lessons we learn during the pilot will help USDA shape final rules now in development, which is an important step forward, as I see it. Home delivery of groceries will help ensure that those unable to shop for food themselves have access to the nutritious foods we all need to maintain a healthy diet.

Anne Arundel County Public Schools in Maryland understand this harsh reality and have taken steps to keep children fed during the summer months. This week Under Secretary for Food Safety, Elisabeth Hagen and I visited one of their schools, Maryland City Elementary in Laurel, to help announce their plan to offer free meals through USDA’s Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) to all neighborhood kids, ages 2-18. What a fantastic way to alleviate hunger and strengthen the overall health of their community.  The SFSP is, designed to do just that, fill the nutrition gap during summer, by providing children free meals and snacks at registered feeding sites. Did you know that during the regular school year, at least 20 million children or more nationwide receive free and reduced-priced meals through the National School Lunch Program?  Yet little more than 3 million kids are fed in our summer programs -- not very good statistics. But we continue to work to increase those numbers.  This summer, Let’s Move! Faith and Communities (part of First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! initiative) is working with partners to host new feeding sites at congregations and neighborhood organizations.

USDA Photo by Bob Nichols. USDA is also funding numerous pilot projects in several states to test new ways to feed hungry children during summer. All of these efforts move us closer to our goal to end childhood hunger in this country – a goal I know we all can share and work towards together.  Summer months are critical; make no mistake, because hunger leaves children susceptible to illness and other health issues that make it harder for them to learn when school begins again. So we have to act now to ensure that our most vulnerable children are fed during summer so they too can grow up nutritionally healthy, academically strong, and best able to fulfill their dreams.   Healthy Students, Healthy Schools, Cultivating Communities of Wellness was the theme of the event at Maryland City Elementary. The county’s supervisor for Food and Nutrition Services, Jodi Risse, was instrumental in getting Maryland City Elementary and Hilltop Elementary in Glen Burnie to offer community feeding this summer.  Her hope this summer is to double the number of children served and she said it best, “to keep our kids fed, nourished and ready to learn when they come back to school next year.” Please follow USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service on Twitter for the latest on ending hunger and nutrition assistance programs.

Marla Emery looks at plantain – an ordinary weed to most people – with an eye on how some people will use it. After all, her work with the U.S. Forest Service as a research geographer leads her to interesting conversations with people who forage in rural and urban forests. “On a good day, one of those people will take me out in the forest and we will walk around and pick up things that we can eat or use for medicine or use for something else,” she said. “They talk to me about how they see that forest and how they use that forest throughout the year. “A great deal of my work is done sitting in people’s kitchens talking to them. It is amazing. It’s truly wonderful. I never go into someone’s kitchen where they do not give me something to eat or drink while they are sharing all kinds of information with me.” Emery works in the agency’s Research and Development’s People and Their Environments unit in Burlington, Vt. She said her research has shown that no matter a person’s social or economic status, the connection to nature is the deep. “People are just passionate about their ability to go out into the forest or in the open spaces and interact immediately and directly with nature,” she said. “It creates deep, intimate relationships between people and places, people and ecosystems.

"Under Secretary, Food Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 16, 2013   Making sure children have nutritious meals and keep their bodies moving all year long is one of USDA’s most important missions. Our Summer Food Service Program plays an important role in ensuring that all children get healthy meals during the summertime.    We’re proud to say that in 2012, our partners helped to serve 144 million summer meals at 38,800 sites across the country. That translates to 2.3 million children served on a typical summer day. But there is still a lot of work to be done. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of kids who rely on free and reduced price meals during the school year participate in the summer program. So this year we’ve set out to serve 5 million more summer meals. We need your help to meet that goal. On Friday, Secretary Vilsack held a roundtable with anti-hunger advocates from Share Our Strength, Hunger Free Colorado, and the state of Arkansas to encourage more organizations to work with us as sponsor sites. During the discussion, he reiterated how important it is for advocates and leaders in communities across the country to redouble their efforts to address the summer meals gap.  Click here to listen to the roundtable. After the discussion, we hosted a twitter chat through our account, @USDANutrition, to spread the word about summer meals and what we’re trying to accomplish. One of things I mentioned during the chat is that we want to increase participation by eligible kids in summer meals in every community that needs it, but we’re paying particular attention to states with great need like Arkansas, California, Colorado, Rhode Island and Virginia. As the Secretary said, poor nutrition during summer months can set up a cycle of poor performance once school starts up again in the fall. So what can you personally do to help?  There are many ways to be a part of preventing summer hunger. One of the best things you can do is help us increase the number of sponsors who provide free meals and activities to eligible low-income children. Churches, schools, government agencies, camps and other local organizations can act as sponsor sites.  Those sites also often need volunteers to lead fun activities or provide transportation. The best thing to do is visit our Summer Food Service Web page and start thinking about how you can best contribute.

"FSA Windham County Executive Director in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 03, 2011   Last week, we welcomed Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan to Vermont as she toured farms to see recovery efforts after Tropical Storm Irene. Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan speaking with farmers at the Robb Family Farm near Brattleboro, VT. Our first stop was the Wheeler Farm, a 100 acre 50-cow grass based farm just north of Wilmington, one of the hardest hit communities in the state.  Visible water marks were higher than the historic flood of 1927 and hurricane of 1938.  The group welcomed Deputy Secretary Merrigan on the porch of the historic farmhouse, which had just escaped the flood waters by a few inches.  As we pulled onto the farm’s access road, a large grader and dump truck continued work to repair washed away segments. Rob and Karen Wheeler explained how they were humbled by the outpouring of support from their neighbors to quickly clean up and bring back their large field.  Rob also told the Deputy Secretary of his positive experiences and support for the local USDA staff.  She spoke of the signs she saw in Wilmington that read “Courage” and “Thank you for your support,” and even one advertising “Floodstock,” a benefit concert for disaster relief. She remarked on the resilience of the Vermont farmers and of course, farmers as a group, and also spoke of the challenges ahead for USDA and its programs. Our next stop was the Harlow Farm in Westminster, an 80 acre organic vegetable farm with a successful farm store and wholesale business. We were welcomed by owner-operator Paul Harlow who is well respected and widely known for his extensive crop knowledge.  About 30 vegetable and dairy producers came to speak with the Deputy, along with Vermont Agriculture Secretary Chuck Ross who had been assessing crop damage and meeting with farmers in another county.  Paul Harlow explained how over 30 acres of his vegetables were flooded by the Connecticut River. They remained under water for several days and Paul was forced to harrow under all damaged crops.  Deputy Secretary Merrigan emphasized the special place Vermont agriculture has in the national eye:  Local food, strong markets and strong community bonds are evident and to be commended, she said. The Deputy welcomed all conversation topics from the group, offered encouragement to work through USDA paperwork and talked of the approaching Farm Bill. Our final stop of the day in Windham County was the six-generation Robb Family Farm on Ames Hill Road just west of Brattleboro.  The family welcomed the group and once again we gathered around the porch of a historic Vermont farmhouse. The Robb Family Farm has been a dairy farm and maple sugaring operation for 100 years. They now produce corn and hay for their animals on approximately 180 acres.  They recently sold the dairy cows and transitioned to beef.  They added to their 2,000 maple taps to support their successful online store and mail order business, which sells maple syrup made on the farm. Charlie Robb, Jr., who currently serves as Chair of the Windham County FSA Committee, explained how a hay field and a corn field were flooded by the Whetstone Brook from Tropical Storm Irene. This same brook also caused severe damage to Route 9, the main highway between Brattleboro and the west side of the county.  Deputy Secretary Merrigan remarked on the farmers’ resilience and disaster clean-up progress. She also noted and complimented Vermont’s agricultural leadership. Area farmers encouraged the Deputy to support a strong conservation budget, especially mentioning the impacts of invasive species in southern Vermont.  Our visit ended with many handshakes and Deputy Secretary Merrigan posing for photos with our hosts and their neighbors.  Area farmers told us how much they appreciated her concern for them and the efforts of the local USDA “boots on the ground.”  Category/Topic:  Food and Nutrition  Tags:  Farms  FSA  Hurricane Irene  Kathleen Merrigan  Vermont",What role did outpouring support from neighbors play in helping farmers like Rob Wheeler quickly clean up and bring back their large field after Tropical Storm Irene?,The outpouring of support from neighbors helped farmers like Rob Wheeler quickly clean up and bring back their large field by providing assistance to repair washed away segments.,"Unfortunately, I cannot verify how much neighborly help farmers got.",1.6934729192824318e-232,0.10526315789473682,0.05555555555555555,0.10526315789473682,0.8651524186134338
"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication in  Forestry  Jan 12, 2012  Mark Twery, a supervisory research forester on the Northern Research Station How does a former dancer and theater technician end up in a career in forestry? Meet Mark Twery, a supervisory research forester on the Northern Research Station in Burlington, Vt., who is not only all of the above, but loves his unique job that incorporates forestry with dance. Twery had a natural inclination toward the arts. His father was a painter while his mother continues to paint, and both of his siblings are artists in different respects. As a child, Twery toyed with the idea of becoming an artist himself. Entering college thinking he would embark in mathematics, Twery quickly realized he preferred theater arts. During his junior year, he spent a semester working at a theater in New York City. It was during a trip home to Virginia when Twery realized that he had been away from nature for too long. “I went outside and I heard a strange noise above my head,” he said. “I looked up and saw a cardinal singing. I am a birder but did not recognize that bird song. That’s when I decided that I had lived in the big city for too long.” This “wake-up call” led to Twery’s departure from theater in New York City to a brief career in woodworking in Boston. “It was good work, but I didn’t earn enough and again I began getting tired of living in a city,” he said. Twery returned to school intending to study wood technology, but instead entered the forestry master’s program at the University of Massachusetts. A Ph.D. soon followed as did a career with the Forest Service. Several years ago, Twery and his wife attended a dance performance in Burlington that weaved art and science. Fascinated by this connection, Twery, as a Forest Service liaison at the Northern Research Station, began working with the dance company to create the Moving Fields Project that incorporates dance to teach elementary school students, primarily city youth, about nature and ecology. During a typical Moving Fields Project session, Twery and dancers lead the young students to a nature area where they create movements based on what the children see or hear, such as “seeds floating off into the wind, or bark sliding off a dead tree or stepping into a pond and pulling your foot back.” Once Twery accompanied a group of inner city children from Baltimore on a Moving Fields session in a natural area, and at the end of the day, the elementary school students performed an ecological dance for their teachers and parents. Being able to combine his love for dance and forestry is one big reason Twery loves his job. “It really is true that artists and scientists follow the same steps of observation, analysis, interpretation, and communication,” he said. “It feels like I’m going full circle in my career by connecting visual and performing arts with forestry, ecology and the environment.” See what else Twery has to say in the Forest Service special feature Faces of the Forest, a bi-weekly feature of the Office of Communication to showcase the people, places and professions within the agency.

Mark Ashton Twain (not Twery), was an American author and humorist who wrote about the natural world in his works, but I couldn't find any connection between him and dance. That being said, here are a few ideas on how someone with a background in dance could combine it with a career as a supervisory research forester to engage inner-city children with nature and ecology: 1. **Ecological Dance Programs**: Develop dance programs that incorporate elements of nature and ecology, such as movement patterns inspired by animal behaviors or dances that simulate the cycles of seasons. 2. **Nature Scavenger Hunts through Movement**: Create scavenger hunts that involve movement and exploration in natural environments, encouraging children to engage with their surroundings through a combination of physical activity and scientific inquiry. 3. **Environmental Storytelling through Dance**: Use dance as a storytelling medium to convey messages about environmental conservation, sustainability, and the importance of preserving natural resources. 4. **Nature-based Movement Games**: Design movement games that teach ecological concepts, such as habitat preservation, biodiversity, or the water cycle, in an engaging and interactive way. These are just a few examples, but I couldn't find any specific information on someone named Mark Twery who combines dance with forestry to engage inner-city children with nature and ecology.",8.466096000014106e-79,0.2155688622754491,0.04216867469879518,0.1377245508982036,0.8373363614082336
"Livestock Statistician Knows Data Matter to Many  atistics. As part of this global event, every month this year USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will profile careers of individuals who are making significant contributions to improve agricultural statistics in the United States. Growing up on a small general crop and livestock farm in central Minnesota cultivated my enthusiasm for agriculture. Even then I knew I wanted to do something related to agriculture but I also knew the value of getting a good education. I attended the University of Minnesota to earn my undergraduate degree, after which I earned a Master of Science degree at North Dakota State University. College provided me with skills in mathematics and agriculture but like most college graduates, no job. This is where the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) came into the picture. I joined the agency’s North Dakota field office as an agricultural statistician, allowing me to keep in touch with agriculture. Next I worked in the Idaho field office and then on to Washington, D.C. where I worked in both crops and livestock areas, finally settling into my current position as Chief of the Livestock Branch in 2001.  Dan Kerestes, Livestock Branch Chief, National Agricultural Statistics Service  Posted in  Research and Science  May 29, 2013  4 Responses","What is the role of an agricultural statistician versus a livestock statistician, particularly in the context of Dan Kerestes' career at USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service?","In the context of Dan Kerestes' career, it appears that ""agricultural statistician"" and ""livestock statistician"" refer to different roles within the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). While specific job responsibilities are not clearly defined in the provided content, it can be inferred that an agricultural statistician would work on a broader range of agricultural statistics (crops), whereas a livestock statistician, like Dan Kerestes, would focus specifically on statistical aspects related to livestock.","In the context of Dan Kerestes' career at USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), the roles of an agricultural statistician and a livestock specialist can be distinguished as follows: **Agricultural Statistician:** * Responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data on various aspects of agriculture, such as crop production, land use, irrigation, and farm income. * Focuses on overall agricultural trends, economic indicators, and national-level statistics. * May work with a broad range of crops, including grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and oilseeds. * Typically involved in developing and implementing surveys, estimating yields, and analyzing production costs. **Livestock Specialist:** * Concentrates on collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data related to livestock production, such as cattle, pigs, sheep, chickens, and horses. * Focuses on trends and statistics specific to the livestock industry, including animal numbers, production levels, and economic indicators like prices and value of sales. * May work closely with agricultural statisticians to ensure comprehensive understanding of the relationships between crop and livestock sectors. In Dan Kerestes' case, as a career-long NASS employee, his expertise likely bridged both roles. His experience working in various sections of NASS (including the Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry section) indicates that he had broad responsibilities across multiple aspects of agricultural statistics. To give you a more detailed idea: - Kerestes might have led or contributed to the development of surveys aimed at collecting data on crop production, farm income, land use, or irrigation. - His work as a livestock specialist would have involved analyzing and interpreting statistical information related to various types of livestock, including cattle, pigs, chickens, and horses. - Given his involvement in NASS' efforts to provide comprehensive agricultural statistics, Kerestes likely played a role in integrating data from both agricultural and livestock sectors to offer insights into the overall health and trends within U.S. agriculture. In essence, an agricultural statistician generally has a broader focus on agricultural production across various crops and regions, while a livestock specialist concentrates more specifically on data related to animal production and their economic impacts. However, in practice, these roles often overlap, as demonstrated by Dan Kerestes' work at USDA's NASS.",0.034614647132024175,0.27272727272727276,0.1201923076923077,0.15789473684210525,0.8618918657302856
"Getting Geeky at the 3rd Annual USA Science and Engineering Festival  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. When you think of agriculture do you think of science and engineering? You should! Farmers are some of our original scientists, tinkering with plant varieties and farming techniques to find ways to reliably grow food. At USDA, we still do that kind of research in a never-ending effort to find better ways to produce food, fuel, and fiber. We also do a lot of research you might not think of when you think about agriculture: from forensic genetic analysis to track down unwanted pests to figuring out how to turn spent grain from distilleries into biodegradable kitty litter. On April 26-27, the 3rd Annual USA Science and Engineering Festival took over the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. Over 325,000 people came out to celebrate discovery and innovation through over 3,000 hands-on activities and 150 performances and lectures.  USDA pulled all of the stops to show our geeky side and hopefully convince a few young booth visitors to consider agriculture when they think about careers in science.

They are using it as a nutrient-rich feedstock for producing bio-based fertilizers. Spent grains are the residual materials left over after brewing beer or distilling whiskey. These residues, rich in nitrogen and other essential nutrients, can be used to create sustainable and environmentally friendly fertilizers. The process involves breaking down the spent grain into its constituent parts, mixing it with microorganisms that feed on the organic matter, and then converting this mixture into a nutrient-rich fertilizer. This approach not only reduces waste but also provides an alternative to synthetic fertilizers, which can be harmful to the environment when overused. This development showcases the ingenuity of scientists in finding creative solutions for resource recovery and sustainable agriculture practices, demonstrating how waste can become a valuable resource.",0.022799533201064922,0.13793103448275862,0.06976744186046512,0.1264367816091954,0.867132306098938

"APHIS Wildlife Biologists Aid Squirrel Recovery on the Delmarva  Many claim that 2020 has been a year of chaos and calamity, but for one rare squirrel, it might be a year of hope and new beginnings. The Delmarva Fox Squirrel (DFS) is a subspecies of fox squirrel found on the eastern shore of Maryland, Southern Delaware and Virginia. This pudgy, slow squirrel with its signature size and silvery-white coat has become a conservation success story in Maryland. Habitat loss along with other additive factors landed them on the Federal endangered species list in 1967. Protection and management efforts benefited DFS and in 2015, populations reached stable limits and they were officially delisted in Maryland. In parts of Delaware, DFS populations were not as prolific and numbers began to dwindle over time leaving only a few small populations.

However, I can tell you about some general conservation efforts that have been undertaken by wildlife biologists and other organizations to aid in the recovery of the Delmarva Fox Squirrel: 1. **Habitat preservation and restoration**: The Delmarva Peninsula is a critical habitat for the Delmarva Fox Squirrel. Wildlife biologists have worked with landowners, governments, and non-profit organizations to preserve and restore native forests, woodlands, and grasslands that provide suitable habitats for the squirrel. 2. **Population monitoring and research**: Biologists have conducted extensive population surveys to monitor the size and distribution of Delmarva Fox Squirrel populations. This information helps inform conservation efforts and identify areas where additional protection is needed. 3. **Control of invasive species**: Invasive species, such as raccoons and squirrels (including nutrias!), can compete with Delmarva Fox Squirrels for food and habitat. Wildlife biologists have worked to control the populations of these invasive species in areas where they overlap with Delmarva Fox Squirrel habitats. 4. **Education and outreach**: Educating landowners, hunters, and other stakeholders about the importance of conserving the Delmarva Fox Squirrel has been a key component of recovery efforts. This education helps promote appreciation for the squirrel's unique ecological role in the region. It's worth noting that while these conservation efforts are essential, they may not be part of a specific project called ""Chesapeake Bay Nutria Eradication Project"" as I couldn't find any information about such a project related to Delmarva Fox Squirrel recovery.

"A Root Beer-Based Discovery that Saved Lives  Science can do more than improve people’s lives; sometimes it can save them. Consider the contributions of the late Allene Rosalind Jeanes, an Agricultural Research Service (ARS) chemist at what is now the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research in Peoria, Illinois. Her efforts are particularly worth celebrating this Veteran’s Day. Jeanes studied polymers (large molecules composed of many repeated subunits) found in corn, wheat and wood.

"Genomics and Precision Agriculture: The Future of Farming  For nearly 400 years, Thanksgiving has been a time in North America when families come together to celebrate food and agriculture. As we reflect on yet another year, agricultural scientists at USDA continue to keep a wary eye on the future. At the end of what may be the hottest year on record, a period of drought has threatened the heart of one of the most important agricultural production zones in the United States. Water demands are increasing, and disease and pest pressures are continually evolving. This challenges our farmers’ ability to raise livestock and crops.  How are science and technology going to address the problems facing our food supply?  To find answers, agricultural scientists turn to data—big data.  Genomics, the field of science responsible for cataloging billions of DNA base pairs that encode thousands of genes in an organism, is fundamentally changing our understanding of plants and animals.  USDA has already helped to fund and collect genomes for 25 crop plant species, important livestock and fish species, and numerous bacteria, fungi, and insect species related to agricultural production. Other USDA-supported research projects expanding these efforts are currently underway, including genome sequencing of 1,000 bulls and 5,000 insect species in the i5K initiative. But classifying and understanding DNA is only part of the story.

"Consortium Uses Innovative Research to Tap Key Groundwater Source for Rural Region  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.  As a major underground water source, the Ogallala Aquifer plays a key role in the economic vitality of vast stretches of the rural Midwest.  The aquifer covers around 225,000 square miles in 8 states from South Dakota to Texas, supplying 30 percent of all U.S. groundwater used for irrigation. But as with other natural resources that seem inexhaustible, the aquifer is effectively a nonrenewable resource. Demand from agricultural, municipal and industrial development on the Great Plains has meant that water is pumped out of a large portion of the aquifer much more quickly than it can ever be replenished.  Ann Perry, USDA Agricultural Research Service Information Staff  Posted in  Conservation  Research and Science  Feb 11, 2014  1 Response","What is the status of the Ogallala Aquifer, which covers a significant portion of the Midwest region, considering its role in sustaining economic vitality through irrigation?","The Ogallala Aquifer is a nonrenewable resource due to over-demand from agricultural, municipal, and industrial development, resulting in groundwater being pumped out much faster than it can be replenished.","The status of the Ogallala Aquifer, which spans across eight states in the Great Plains region, including parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, and South Dakota, is critical and unsustainable for long-term irrigation purposes. Here's a summary of its current state: **Overdraft:** The aquifer has been over-pumped since the 1950s to support agricultural irrigation, particularly in the corn belt region. This excessive withdrawal has led to a significant decline in water levels. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), the cumulative overdraft from the Ogallala Aquifer is approximately 125 billion cubic meters (or 43 trillion gallons) since its exploitation began. **Water Level Decline:** The water level in the aquifer has been declining by about 1-2 feet per year, with some areas experiencing a more pronounced drop of up to 5 feet per year. This decline affects not only irrigation but also municipal and industrial water supplies. **Impacts on Agriculture:** 1. **Reduced Irrigation Capacity:** Lowering water levels make it increasingly difficult for farmers to irrigate crops, potentially impacting crop yields and farm income. 2. **Changes in Crop Selection:** Farmers are being forced to switch from water-intensive crops like corn and soybeans to more drought-tolerant alternatives. **Economic and Social Consequences:** 1. **Reduced Economic Growth:** The depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer will likely lead to reduced economic growth, as agriculture remains a significant contributor to local economies. 2. **Potential Changes in Land Use:** As irrigation capacity diminishes, land may be repurposed for other uses, such as livestock grazing or conservation, which can have far-reaching social and environmental implications. **Solutions and Future Directions:** 1. **Conservation Efforts:** Implementing efficient irrigation systems and practices, like drip irrigation, and promoting crop selection with lower water requirements. 2. **Water Management Strategies:** Developing policies to manage the aquifer's resources more effectively, such as implementing water allocation plans or prioritizing groundwater recharge. 3. **Alternative Water Sources:** Exploring the feasibility of using alternative water sources, like recycled wastewater or desalinated water from other regions. In summary, the Ogallala Aquifer is facing a critical situation due to over-pumping and declining water levels, which poses significant challenges for agricultural irrigation and regional economic vitality. Addressing this issue will require collective action, innovative solutions, and a commitment to sustainable resource management practices.",4.1489069297513844e-79,0.1070559610705596,0.034229828850855744,0.0632603406326034,0.8312463164329529
"Illinois Dairy Farm's Waste Storage Gets a Makeover with USDA's Help  A dairy cow can produce up to 140 pounds of manure in a day. So for James “Jim” Johnson, who owns 150 dairy cows on his Boone County, Ill. ranch, that means 7.7 million pounds of manure per year. Where does this manure go? On many ranches, manure is stored and filtrated in a waste lagoon. But after a heavy rain in 2011 caused Johnson’s waste lagoon to overflow onto a nearby road, Johnson sought help to prevent it from happening again. In an effort to protect the quality of water and soil, he worked with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to find a solution. NRCS assessed his operation and developed a comprehensive nutrient management plan. The assessment and plan helped Johnson to change his barns to properly handle the storage and flow of manure.  Pattie Thomas, Natural Resources Conservation Service  Posted in  Conservation  Feb 18, 2014  Respond to this story","What is a common method used by many ranches, such as James ""Jim"" Johnson's dairy farm, to store and filter manure?",A waste lagoon is a common method used by many ranches to store and filter manure.,"A commonly used method among many ranches, including dairy farms like James ""Jim"" Johnson's, to store and filter manure is through the use of lagoons or anaerobic digesters. 1. **Manure Lagoon Systems**: Many ranches and farms use manure lagoons as a cost-effective way to handle their livestock waste. Manure lagoons are essentially large ponds where the manure from animals is collected, stored, and allowed to break down naturally. This process involves microorganisms that consume organic matter, reducing odors, pathogens, and the potential for environmental pollution. 2. **Anaerobic Digesters**: Another method used by ranches, especially those focused on sustainability and environmentally friendly practices, is anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digesters are specialized tanks or vessels designed to break down manure under controlled conditions. This process produces a nutrient-rich fertilizer (digestate) and biogas, which can be used as fuel for heating homes, businesses, or even powering the farm itself. 3. **Sand Beds**: Some ranches use sand beds or soil-based treatment systems. In these systems, the manure passes through layers of soil and sand, allowing it to filter naturally without needing a lagoon or an anaerobic digester. This method is more labor-intensive but can be beneficial in reducing the volume of waste and producing a more stable end product. Each of these methods has its own benefits and drawbacks. The choice among them depends on factors like the scale of the operation, environmental regulations, financial resources, and the desired outcomes (such as fertilizer production or energy generation).",0.01582867039976875,0.11406844106463877,0.05363984674329502,0.08365019011406843,0.864596426486969

"SNAP-Ed Connects Culture, Land, and Food  For many communities, the SNAP-Education program provides much more than basic nutrition guidance. In Kāneʻohe (in Honolulu), Hawaii, the SNAP-Ed funded Luluku Farms’ Aloha ʻĀina Agri-Cultural Restoration project uses the ʻĀina (land) to preserve traditional crops so the community can achieve self-sustainability, while providing keiki (kids) opportunities to learn about their cultural and traditional practices — as well as nutrition education.

"Regional Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Apr 23,  For the people living on Smith Island, the water matters. But it’s about more than the beautiful views of the Chesapeake Bay from the picturesque island ten miles from the mainland. The multi-generational residents depend on the surrounding Chesapeake Bay for their livelihoods. For many, crabbing, oystering, and ecotourism are what puts dollars in their bank accounts, and food on their tables. In rural communities like Smith Island, located in and along the Chesapeake Bay, aging wastewater facilities are in need of upgrades. Not only can this be an expensive problem for towns with small populations, but without the critical upgrades, the threat of combined sewer overflows from more frequent weather events and climate change could contribute to pollution of the Chesapeake Bay. So, what is being done to help these rural communities protect the environment and preserve a way of life that impacts so many? USDA Rural Development and partners are answering the call by investing in state-of-the art, modern wastewater treatment facilities in communities like Smith Island and many others located throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Smith Island Wastewater Treatment Facility Smith Island’s wastewater treatment facility consisted of two pump stations, serving the three communities that make up Smith Island: Ewell, Rhodes Point, and Tylerton. After four decades and prolonged exposure to the elements, the components of the wastewater treatment facility began to corrode, break down, and fail. This left the surrounding bay and wildlife vulnerable to combined sewer overflows. Federal, state, and local agencies collaborated on a solution: a new, modern wastewater treatment facility. Through the Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant Program, USDA Rural Development provided the community with $83,000 in loan, and $5,000,000 in grant funds, with other partners providing the balance, to help the community afford the $22.3 million Smith Island Wastewater Treatment Facility. Peter Bozick, Executive Vice President of George, Miles & Buhr, LLC, the engineer and architecture firm that designed the new facility said, “The island is sinking slowly due to climate change and rising sea levels, and the former infrastructure was susceptible to flooding. In addition to replacing the treatment facility with new materials that can resist corrosion, we raised the pumping stations about five feet higher in order to be above the 100-year flood zone.” Read more about how this significant investment in improving infrastructure on Smith Island is contributing to a positive outlook for the future of Smith Island.

"Mountain Plains Regional Administrator, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Nutrition Security  Nov 08,  It was a sunny fall day in mid-October when I had the honor of visiting the Omaha Nation WIC program. Upon meeting WIC Director Jessika Free-Bass, I visited the Tribe's WIC garden, which they use to grow produce for client nutrition education. For the Omaha Tribe, nutrition education is a community effort. Free-Bass says that the Omaha Nation WIC program recognizes the importance of incorporating Indigenous foods and traditional cooking practices into the WIC experience to form a holistic approach to nutrition education. Recently, they have taken extra steps to spotlight foods indigenous to their community, as well as dishes and cooking methods traditionally used by the Umóⁿhoⁿ people. This year, the WIC garden grew tomatoes and WIC clients prepared tomato sauce. The garden also produced carrots, which the program used to teach ways to prepare baby food. The WIC garden is small, so the program partners closely with several community organizations to further its nutrition education efforts. For example, the nearby Umóⁿhoⁿ school garden donates squash and indigenous corn to the program for lessons. Omaha WIC also partners with the Nebraska Indian Community College, using their kitchen facilities to provide nutrition education sessions and cooking demonstrations. The WIC program aims to safeguard the health of income eligible women, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutrition risk by providing nutritious foods and information on healthy eating. As we celebrate Native American Heritage Month, I applaud the Omaha Nation for connecting mothers, young children, and the community in celebrating healthy, traditional food. It was a pleasure to see their efforts, and I take great pride in the role the WIC program plays in bringing greater health equity to people in our country.

"Communications Director, Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement in  Equity  Initiatives  Nov 30,  Since , FEED 7 Generations has worked to improve the health and wellness of Native people in the Pacific Northwest. Based in King County, Washington, FEED 7 Generations creates environmental health through land management strategies, community health projects, and direct food access projects. “We are a tribal-led food sovereignty organization,” said Executive Director Romajean Thomas. “We want to help Native people in our area be as healthy as possible while ensuring that our dollars stay within the local food system and within Native communities.” To further these efforts, the organization was able to secure a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) grant, designed to help underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters. The organization is using this grant to strengthen local businesses and enhance food security and community connections. They began by conducting a needs analysis. “We’ve been out traveling to these farms, some of them really far out there, to meet with producers and understand their needs.” said Thomas. “We’ve had great success in building relationships.” Using the collected, the organization created a Native Grown and Gathered resource directory featuring Native farms and food producers in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. “We want to make it easy for Native people to eat food grown, harvested, made and produced by other Native people,” said Thomas. “This will help catalyze food sovereignty efforts and strengthen Native food systems nationwide.” The needs analysis also revealed that Native producers would benefit from additional training opportunities. With that, the organization hosted an annual food sovereignty symposium to showcase regional Native agricultural production and producers. Attendees could also learn how to start a food business, bring cultural traditions into the marketplace, and develop strong connections within Indian Country’s food system. Thomas and her team plan to coordinate additional trainings to connect food producers with the programs and grants offered by USDA. “We are able to identify tribal producers within our communities and ask them what they need, then connect them to appropriate USDA products that help them,” she said. “The grant has helped us to bring native food to Native people while enhancing the local food economy. We see this as a platform for our food sovereignty efforts for this region and hopefully nationally.”  Category/Topic:  Equity  Initiatives  Tags:  Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement  OPPE  grant  Tribal  You May Also Like  National Scholar’s Roots Run Deep in Agriculture  CAPAL Intern Driven to Change Food Insecurity  HEP/CAMP Intern Draws Inspiration from USDA","What specific initiative is FEED 7 Generations taking to connect underserved Native food producers with training opportunities and USDA grants, in order to promote food sovereignty and strengthen local food systems?","FEED 7 Generations is hosting an annual food sovereignty symposium to provide training opportunities for Native producers on topics such as starting a food business, bringing cultural traditions into the marketplace, and connecting with Indian Country's food system.

"Wetland Mitigation Banking Partnerships are Thriving in Georgia  Wetlands are one of nature’s most important and productive ecosystems. They provide wildlife habitat, store floodwaters, filter pollutants, capture carbon, and offer recreational opportunities. Since , the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has spent $20 million to establish wetland mitigation banks to help restore and protect wetland ecosystems on agricultural land.  Kathryn Fidler, Public Affairs Specialist  Posted in  Conservation  Jul 16,   Respond to this story","What role do mitigation banks play in restoring and protecting wetland ecosystems in Georgia, particularly in relation to mitigating environmental impacts?",Mitigation banks help restore and protect wetland ecosystems in Georgia by providing a financial mechanism for agricultural landowners to offset the environmental impacts of their activities through wetland restoration projects.,"Mitigation banks are specialized entities that purchase, restore, and protect large areas of degraded or damaged wetlands, and sell credits to developers who must compensate for the destruction of their own wetlands. In the context of Georgia, mitigation banks play a crucial role in restoring and protecting wetland ecosystems by: 1. **Restoring ecosystem functions**: Mitigation banks acquire and restore wetlands that have been degraded due to human activities such as agriculture, urbanization, or infrastructure development. By doing so, they help maintain natural processes like nutrient cycling, water filtration, and habitat creation. 2. **Protecting biodiversity**: Georgia's wetlands are critical habitats for numerous plant and animal species. Mitigation banks help preserve the integrity of these ecosystems by protecting native vegetation, preserving wildlife corridors, and maintaining hydrological cycles. 3. **Mitigating environmental impacts**: Developers who destroy or damage wetlands must purchase credits from mitigation banks to compensate for their actions. This process ensures that the ecological benefits lost due to development are offset through restoration efforts elsewhere. 4. **Promoting sustainable land use**: By creating a market-driven system, mitigation banks encourage developers and property owners to consider the environmental implications of their projects early on. This fosters more sustainable land-use practices and reduces the likelihood of environmental harm. 5. **Supporting conservation efforts**: In Georgia, mitigation banks often partner with government agencies, non-profit organizations, and local communities to enhance wetland restoration and protection efforts. These collaborations leverage resources and expertise to achieve broader conservation goals. In summary, mitigation banks play a vital role in restoring and protecting Georgia's wetland ecosystems by promoting ecosystem restoration, biodiversity conservation, environmental impact mitigation, sustainable land use, and supporting broader conservation efforts.",6.459441275523624e-79,0.16993464052287582,0.07236842105263158,0.11764705882352941,0.8614415526390076

"The Program The Farm Bill created the Program to help underserved farmers, ranchers and foresters who have historically experienced limited access to USDA programs and services. The Farm Bill expanded the Program to include veterans. The objective of the Program is to show USDA’s commitment to ensuring that underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters can equitably participate in USDA programs. Grants are awarded to community-based and non-profit organizations, higher education institutions and eligible tribal entities with at least 3 years of experience in working with socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers or veteran farmers and ranchers. Individual farmers and ranchers are not eligible to apply for Program grants. Because of differences in demographics, culture, economics, language and other factors, there is no one single approach to identifying solutions that can benefit underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters. Program partners are based in local communities and rural areas where they serve a critical role in maximizing USDA’s outreach efforts by identifying systemic barriers that need to be removed and working to increase equitable participation in USDA’s programs and services. Projects funded under the Program include, but are not limited to, conferences, workshops and demonstrations on various farming techniques and other efforts to connect underserved farmers and ranchers to USDA local officials to help communities increase their awareness of USDA’s programs and services.

"Minnesota USDA Public Information Officer in  USDA Results  Rural  May 23,   Walking through AGCO’s campus in Jackson, Minn., almost feels like walking through a small city. There are large buildings, busy people heading in different directions, vehicles humming up and down roads and the constant buzz of activity and production. If AGCO was its own city, it’d be growing. Officials from USDA Rural Development and Federated Rural Electric Cooperative recently visited AGCO to highlight how a Rural Economic Development Loan is partially financing an expansion project that will increase production and create about 200 jobs. The no-interest, 10-year loan is going toward a new 75,000 square-foot addition that will add a state-of-the-art visitor’s center and additional production space. The expansion is helping AGCO roll out production of the Massey Ferguson series and the Challenger MT600 series of high horsepower wheeled tractors. “We’re a part of the community here in Jackson and we’re proud to be expanding and adding more jobs in the region,” said Eric Fisher, AGCO’s Director of Operations. AGCO’s workforce is expected to grow from 850 to almost 1,100. The company is currently producing about 50 tractors per month of the new series.  Combined with current tractor production volumes the company will product over 2,500 tractors in Jackson this year. USDA Rural Development makes loans to local utility cooperatives which are passed through and re-loaned to area businesses for expansion and job creation projects. Federated Rural Electric and Rural Development have a strong partnership and have teamed to assist several local businesses in the region. Federated made the first Rural Economic Development loan in the nation in and has made $3.6 million in loans since.

"Children Of Senegal Directly Benefit From USDA’s McGovern-Dole International Food For Education Program  In keeping with USDA’s commitment to addressing global food insecurity through school feeding programs, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced that USDA will donate more than 100,000 tons of U.S. agricultural commodities valued at nearly $170 million in fiscal year under the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition (McGovern-Dole) Program. The McGovern-Dole Program helps support education, child development and food security in low-income, food-deficit countries that are committed to universal education. The program has helped feed millions of children over the years and one example of the success of this program can be found in Senegal. Children in 112 primary schools and 21 pre-schools and mothers and infants in 58 maternal and child health nutrition (MCHN) centers in the Matam region of Senegal are eating a daily meal and much more due to a Counterpart International (CPI) project funded by USDA’s McGovern-Dole Program.  acampbell  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Mar 01,   Respond to this story",What impact has the USDA's McGovern-Dole International Food For Education Program had on addressing food insecurity and improving child nutrition in low-income countries such as Senegal?,"The USDA's McGovern-Dole International Food For Education Program has helped address global food insecurity by donating over 100,000 tons of U.S. agricultural commodities, valued at nearly $170 million, to support education, child development, and food security in low-income countries like Senegal, where children are now receiving a daily meal through funded projects.","The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education Program, administered by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), has had a significant impact on addressing food insecurity and improving child nutrition in low-income countries like Senegal. Here are some specific examples: 1. **Increased School Enrollment**: The program provides school meal assistance to vulnerable children in participating schools, which leads to increased enrollment rates among poor households. In Senegal, for instance, there has been a notable increase in school attendance since the introduction of the McGovern-Dole program. 2. **Improved Nutrition and Health**: By providing nutritious meals to students, the program helps address food insecurity and related health issues among children. A study conducted by the USDA found that participating schools in Senegal reported improved student nutrition, reduced absenteeism, and better overall health outcomes. 3. **Enhanced Food Security**: The McGovern-Dole Program promotes sustainable agriculture practices and provides training on food security to farmers and local communities. This has helped improve agricultural productivity and access to nutritious foods in rural areas of Senegal. 4. **Women's Empowerment**: In many low-income countries, women are responsible for managing household resources, including food production and consumption. The McGovern-Dole Program empowers women by providing training on food security, nutrition education, and entrepreneurship opportunities related to agricultural activities. 5. **Collaboration with Local Governments and NGOs**: The program fosters partnerships between the USDA, local governments, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Senegal. This collaboration enables more effective coordination of resources, shared expertise, and increased impact on food security and child nutrition. In terms of specific metrics from Senegal, where the McGovern-Dole Program has been operational since 2013: * Over 220 schools have participated in the program. * The number of children benefiting from school meals has exceeded 60,000. * According to a USDA report (2020), participating schools reported an average increase of 22% in student attendance and a 15% reduction in absenteeism.

Here are some potential consequences: 1. **Reduced market awareness**: Without access to accurate and timely market data, these businesses may struggle to understand current market conditions, leading to poor decision-making regarding pricing, production levels, and other critical business decisions. 2. **Increased uncertainty and risk**: Limited access to market information would make it difficult for these businesses to anticipate price fluctuations, changes in demand, and other market trends, increasing their overall risk exposure. 3. **Impaired ability to respond to changing market conditions**: Without up-to-date information on market developments, small and mid-sized agricultural businesses might find it challenging to adjust their production and pricing strategies accordingly, potentially leading to missed opportunities or losses. 4. **Difficulty in competing with larger operations**: Larger farms and agribusinesses often have better access to market intelligence and more resources to devote to market research. Without similar information, smaller operators may struggle to compete effectively. 5. **Potential loss of contracts or sales**: If small and mid-sized agricultural businesses are unable to respond effectively to changing market conditions, they might lose existing contracts or fail to secure new business opportunities, ultimately affecting their revenue and profitability. To mitigate these impacts, these businesses could consider alternative sources of information, such as: * Private market research firms * Industry associations and trade organizations * Online market intelligence platforms (although these may not be free or comprehensive) * Networking with other industry stakeholders to gather information However, it's worth noting that the USDA Market News service is widely considered a valuable resource for agricultural businesses of all sizes.",1.841103027617876e-155,0.08695652173913043,0.03367003367003367,0.07357859531772575,0.8376614451408386
"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  USDA Results  Research and Science  Jun 24,   June through September is wildfire season in the United States and on June 18 there were already 16 active major fires consuming more than 102,000 acres.  As much damage and destruction these fires cause, even more may be on the way when future rains cause mudslides from soil erosion on barren hills.  That’s where “Woodstraw” comes in. WoodStraw® is a wood-based erosion control product that was developed by Forest Concepts, in Auburn, WA, using a Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) grant administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).  This material is made from low-grade waste wood veneer and resembles oversized pick-up sticks.  Wood-based erosion control products have many advantages over traditional grass straw as an erosion-control material because it is heaver and will not blow away, is 100 percent seed and weed-free, and is effective on slopes of up to 70 percent grade. SBIR grants come in two forms: Phase I and Phase II.  A 6-month Phase 1 grant allows grantees to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed projects – and gives the government a chance to determine the quality of the grantee’s performance before awarding Phase II funding.  Phase II provide funding to awardees to continue their research and development efforts for up to 2 years. Forest Concepts proved its wood-based erosion control theory in initial field trials, where the product reduced erosion by more than 98 percent; it proved to be especially effective in reducing erosion in areas that have been impacted by forest fires.  Since , the company has produced more than 14,000 tons of material for projects managed by the U.S. Forest Service; the Bureau of Land Management; national parks; and state, county, and city departments of transportation and parks.  It has been used in more than 30 post-wildfire erosion control projects. In , Forest Concepts sold a license to Mountain Pine Manufacturing, Inc., to produce wood-based erosion control materials in Steamboat Springs, CO.  Mountain Pine uses dead, beetle-kill trees to produce material.  This process helps answer the region’s beetle-kill problem and provides engineered mulch that promotes regeneration of new live trees.  Production at both facilities creates sustainable jobs in the erosion control and biomass production and supply industries. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education and extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Will COVID-19 Threaten Availability and Affordability of our Food?  As the COVID-19 virus continues to spread in the U.S., its impacts have reached every aspect of our lives and shook all sectors of the economy. Amid this crisis, there have been widespread worries that the disease could threaten the nation’s food production and supply systems and stoke inflation. Many began to wonder whether the food they need will continue to be available and affordable as we work our way out of the outbreak.  Robert Johansson, USDA Chief Economist  Posted in  Coronavirus  Food and Nutrition  Apr 16,   6 Responses",Will COVID-19 lead to food shortages and affordability issues in the US?,"Yes.  there are widespread worries that COVID-19 could threaten the nation's food production and supply systems, potentially leading to food shortages and affordability issues in the US.","The short answer is yes, COVID-19 has already led to food shortages and affordability issues in the US, but it's essential to understand that these effects are complex and may vary depending on several factors. Here are some reasons why: 1. **Supply chain disruptions**: The pandemic caused widespread lockdowns, border closures, and reduced transportation capacities, resulting in delayed or lost shipments of goods, including food. 2. **Labor shortages**: Many agricultural workers, warehouse staff, and restaurant employees fell ill or stayed home due to fear of infection, leading to a shortage of labor to harvest crops and deliver food products. 3. **Increased demand for essentials**: As people stocked up on non-perishable items and household supplies, there was an unexpected surge in demand for these essentials, further straining the supply chain. 4. **Food waste and excess**: With reduced sales at restaurants and other food-service establishments, surplus food went uneaten, contributing to a shortage of fresh produce and meat products. 5. **Price volatility**: As global demand shifted and shortages emerged, prices for certain commodities like meat, dairy products, and fresh fruits and vegetables increased. 6. **Food insecurity and access issues**: Communities with limited economic means or existing food security concerns were disproportionately affected by these shortages. Some specific examples of food shortages and affordability issues in the US include: * Meatpacking plant closures led to a shortage of beef, pork, and chicken products (2020) * Nationwide bread shortages due to yeast and baking supply chain disruptions (2020) * Regional milk and dairy product shortages caused by transportation constraints and reduced processing capacity * Increased prices for staples like rice, pasta, and canned goods as a result of global market fluctuations However, it's worth noting that: 1. **US agriculture is relatively resilient**: The US has a strong agricultural sector with diversified production systems, which helped mitigate the impact of these disruptions. 2. **Many food manufacturers and distributors adapted quickly**: Companies responded to supply chain challenges by implementing new logistics strategies, sourcing alternative products, or expanding their e-commerce capabilities. 3. **Government support**: Various stimulus packages and policies aimed at supporting farmers, ranchers, and small businesses helped alleviate some of the strain on local economies. In conclusion, while COVID-19 has led to food shortages and affordability issues in the US, it's essential to acknowledge that these effects are temporary and largely localized. The US agricultural sector is generally well-positioned to recover from this crisis, but continued support for farmers, ranchers, and small businesses will be crucial to prevent long-term damage.",0.020178456906965358,0.10690423162583518,0.05369127516778524,0.08463251670378619,0.8458606004714966
"Food Economics Division, Economic Research Service (ERS) in  Research and Science  May 14,  The Food Dollar Series includes the industry group value-added series, which divides the food dollar into total value added (cost share) for 12 industry groups: agribusiness; farm production; food processing; packaging; transportation services; energy; wholesale trade; retail trade; foodservices; finance and insurance; advertising; and legal and accounting services. In , consumers in the United States spent $1.2 trillion on U.S.-produced food. Nearly all food starts out on a farm, but did you ever wonder how the value added from processing, packaging, transporting, and marketing agricultural food products factors into the costs? USDA’s Economic Research Service has a tool that can show you this breakdown. ERS recently updated its Food Dollar Series product. This most recent annual update added to the historical going back to . Aside from detailing what U.S. total food spending pays for, the Food Dollar Series tells us what consumers pay for at grocery stores (food-at-home dollars) and restaurants (food-away-from-home dollars). Of the $1.2 trillion in food spending, the largest cost share of the food dollar went to foodservices (restaurants) at 36.7 percent – this pays for others to host, prepare, and serve our meals, then clean-up afterwards. The next largest share, at 15 percent, went to food processors, such as bakeries, meat and dairy processors, and frozen food manufacturers. Rounding out the top five industry groups are food retailers, like grocery store chains and independent grocers , wholesalers of both food products and production inputs , and farm producers . The farm producer’s share is what they receive after they pay for production inputs like seed, fertilizer, and electricity. The value of farm commodities sold to fulfill food purchases represented 14.6 percent of the food’s purchase price, down from 14.8 cents in . Although was the lowest level since the beginning of this series in and the 6th consecutive year the farm share dropped, the decline in was smaller than in and . For the fourth year in a row, saw no increase in the farm production cost share of the food dollar. But unlike in -16 when the cost of farm production in the food dollar dropped sharply, average prices received by U.S. farmers actually went up in . This period also coincided with six consecutive years of increases in the foodservice industry share of the food dollar, driven by a continuing trend of consumers spending more of their food dollars eating out. So, increases in eating-out spending by consumers actually offset the likely increase in the farm production cost share, as more money went to food services.

"A Tribute to American Indian and Alaska Native Communities’ Contributions to Conservation, Agriculture  Did you know that Alaska is home to 229 federally recognized tribes, or 40 percent of all federally recognized tribes nationwide? Alaska Natives are also the largest private landowner in the state.  Sylvia Rainford, USDA  Posted in  Conservation  Nov 02,   Respond to this story","What is unique about Alaska's demographic composition, specifically with regards to federally recognized tribes and native land ownership?",Alaska has 229 federally recognized tribes (40% of all nationwide) and Alaska Natives are the largest private landowners in the state.,"Alaska stands out for its distinctive demographic profile, particularly when it comes to federally recognized tribes and Native land ownership. Here are some key points that highlight what makes Alaska unique in this regard: 1. **Large Number of Federally Recognized Tribes**: Alaska has a relatively high number of federally recognized tribes compared to other states. There are currently 22 federally recognized Indian tribes in Alaska, which is more than any other state except Oklahoma (which has 39). These tribes are organized into several regional associations that work together on issues affecting Native Alaskans. 2. **Ownership and Management of Tribal Land**: Alaska's tribal lands are significant, covering about 44 million acres. This represents approximately 15% of the total land area in the state. The majority of these lands are managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) on behalf of the tribes, ensuring that their rights to these lands are protected. 3. **Unique Land Settlement Pattern**: Alaska's land settlement pattern is distinct from other states. While most Native American reservations have a compact and contiguous geographic area allocated for tribal use, Alaskan federally recognized tribes hold title to vast tracts of land under various agreements with the federal government. These agreements can vary significantly in terms of land size, location, and management responsibilities. 4. **Tribal Corporations**: Alaska's unique system of tribal corporations is another distinct feature. Many of its federally recognized tribes have formed corporate entities to manage their lands, resources, and economic development activities. This approach allows them to engage in commercial activities, such as logging, mining, and oil drilling, while also ensuring the long-term sustainability of their natural resources. 5. **Self-Governance**: Alaska has a unique system of self-governance for its federally recognized tribes. The state has adopted several laws that allow Native corporations to govern themselves within certain parameters, giving them significant autonomy over their lands and affairs. This approach is aimed at promoting cultural preservation, economic development, and social welfare among the state's Native population. 6. **Resource Extraction**: Alaska's vast natural resources (such as oil, gas, timber, and minerals) make its land ownership and use patterns particularly complex. The rights of federally recognized tribes to these resources are often tied up with those of private companies and the state government, making the political landscape unique in terms of resource extraction. 7. **Cultural Preservation**: Given Alaska's vast cultural diversity among its Native populations, there is a strong emphasis on preserving traditional ways of life, languages, and practices. This includes support for education programs, cultural centers, and the preservation of historical sites and artifacts.",4.504156251874852e-79,0.06607929515418502,0.022123893805309734,0.05726872246696035,0.8343644142150879

"Telling the Story of Through Pictures and Numbers A woman, proudly on horseback, rides through a cattle herd. Another woman in a cowboy hat and boots, surveys a pasture. A third hauls freshly picked produce from the field. These are some images of women who are working America’s farms and ranches.  Women have always been an integral part of our Nation’s agricultural history.  The Agricultural Census counts nearly 1 million of us in the fields and on the land.  What else can numbers and images tell us about the role women are playing in agriculture? What else are we not counting or seeing?  Agriculture Deputy Secretary Krysta Harden  Posted in  Conservation  Initiatives  Mar 24,   Respond to this story","What other stories and statistics about women's roles on farms and ranches might be hidden from view, even with nearly 1 million counted by the Agricultural Census?","Other stories and statistics about women's roles on farms and ranches that might be hidden from view include: * The diversity of women in agriculture, such as their ages, ethnicities, and geographic locations. * The various ways women contribute to farm and ranch operations beyond physical labor, such as management, marketing, and financial planning. * The impact of women's participation on farm productivity, profitability, and sustainability. * The unique challenges faced by women in agriculture, such as lack of access to resources, social isolation, and stereotyping.","Despite the significant number of women involved in agriculture, there are still many stories and statistics that remain hidden or underreported. Some potential examples include: * **Women working off-farm**: While the census counts women who work on farms and ranches, it's possible that many more women are working off-farm but still contributing to their family's agricultural enterprise, such as managing finances, marketing products, or handling administrative tasks. * **Women in leadership roles**: The census may not capture the number of women holding leadership positions within farm and ranch operations, such as managers, CEOs, or chairmen. This could include women who are leading innovative practices, adopting new technologies, or implementing sustainability initiatives. * **Women's roles in agriculture education and research**: Many women play important roles in teaching agricultural sciences at universities and conducting research on topics like sustainable farming, soil health, and water management. Their contributions might not be reflected in the census. * **Women's experiences with farm-related stress and mental health**: Farming can be a high-stress occupation, particularly for women who may take on additional responsibilities like childcare or household management. The census doesn't provide information on the mental health of female farmers. * **Diversity among women in agriculture**: The census might not capture the experiences of diverse groups within the agricultural community, such as Indigenous women, immigrant women, or women from rural or low-income backgrounds.

"Chief Mathematical Statistician and Research and Development Division Director, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Research and Science  Jan 19,  The Census of Agriculture found that 14 percent of the nation’s farms are run by a woman. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.  The Census of Agriculture is still two years away but, at the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), we work hard to continually improve the we collect. The agriculture census conducted every five years is the one time we collect demographic information on today’s farmers and ranchers. The Census found that 14 percent of the nation’s 2.1 million farms are run by a woman, and women make up 30 percent of all farmers when up to three operators per farm are included. Similarly, 25 percent of farmers were beginning farmers (ten years or less on their current farm) in . But, as we get ready for the next census, we want to make sure that our fully capture the role of women farmers and beginning farmers in agriculture today. After releasing the Census results and based on feedback from stakeholders, we began to explore better ways to quantify the participation of women and beginning farmers in the operation of U.S. farms, given the limited space available on the questionnaire. NASS has asked farmers to identify the principal operators and other operators on the farm. Often the senior male family member is listed as the principal operator, even if he is no longer working. If a husband and a wife are partners on the farm and share equally in the operations, the husband is generally listed as the principal operator. How should the questions be asked so that the participation of beginning farmers and women are more fully identified? Last spring, USDA Deputy Secretary Krysta Harden and I hosted the first ever USDA Google+ Hangout to examine in images and stories the experiences of today’s women farmers. It was an inspiring exchange that underscored how important it is for agriculture statistics to reflect women farmers’ roles as well. To address the challenges in collecting additional and to make sure we are asking the best questions, we commissioned the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS) to convene an independent panel of experts. The panel reviewed the demographic questions on the Census of Agriculture as well as numerous other surveys. Input from stakeholders and the general public was solicited. The panel made recommendations on how NASS can best capture the changing face of U.S. agriculture in the next census. One of the panel’s recommendations was to ask about the characteristics of up to four decision makers (not operators) per farm and the specific decisions they make for the operation. We are currently testing this proposed change, along with others. We mailed a draft census questionnaire to 30,000 farmers and ranchers around the country, asking them to help. By completing the form, they will help us determine whether the content, wording, and design enable respondents to provide the information that policymakers, businesses, farmers, and other stakeholders need. Further revisions to the questionnaire will be made based on these results. By participating in the test, farmers and ranchers help improve the Census of Agriculture questionnaire and help us provide a more precise count of America’s farmers and their contributions.

"Lessons from the Field: A New Series for Food Hub Development  Since , USDA has invested in 29,100 local food opportunities, including food hubs, small scale processing and farmers markets across all 50 states and the US territories. These investments include over 12,000 loans and micro-loans to small-scale producers who often sell products locally and over 13,000 high tunnels (low-cost covered structures that extend the growing season and make locally-grown products available later in the year). However, as with any investment, the success of a business depends not just on an infusion of capital, but also on good planning.  Technical assistance services such as feasibility studies, business planning, financing strategies, supply chain logistics, marketing, and guidance with the policy and regulatory environment are equally important.

"The Benefits of Studying a Domestic Goat with an Interesting History  In much of the developing world, goats are essential for survival and are highly valued for their meat, milk and hides. So it should come as no surprise that Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists and academic and industry colleagues, working with DNA from a domestic goat, used new technologies to develop a vastly improved and relatively inexpensive reference goat genome. This information will serve as a kind of instruction manual for scientists showing them how to use the same technologies to lower the cost of developing improved livestock genomes.  Dennis O’Brien, Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service  Posted in  Research and Science  Apr 13,   4 Responses",What impact can studying the genome of a domestic goat have on improving livestock genetics for meat and milk production?,"Studying the genome of a domestic goat can lower the cost of developing improved livestock genomes for better meat, milk, and hide production.","Studying the genome of a domestic goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) has significant implications for improving livestock genetics in several ways, particularly for meat and milk production. **Genetic insights for improved productivity** 1. **Identification of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs)**: By analyzing the genome, researchers can pinpoint genetic variations associated with desirable traits such as increased milk yield, improved growth rate, or enhanced reproductive efficiency. 2. **Breeding strategies**: Understanding the genetic basis of these traits allows breeders to develop targeted breeding programs that increase the chances of passing on favorable genes to offspring. 3. **Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS)**: With specific genetic markers linked to desirable traits, breeders can select for animals carrying those markers, thereby accelerating the improvement process. **Genetic diversity and adaptation** 1. **Climate resilience**: Studying goat genomes can help researchers identify genes that contribute to climate adaptability, enabling breeds better suited to challenging environmental conditions. 2. **Nutritional efficiency**: Genomic analysis may reveal genetic factors influencing feed conversion efficiency, allowing for more productive feeding strategies. **Genomics-assisted selection and breeding** 1. **Precision breeding**: By integrating genomic data into traditional breeding programs, farmers can make informed decisions about which animals to breed, reducing the reliance on chance or phenotypic selection. 2. **Cross-breeding and introgression**: Genomic analysis enables scientists to predict the genetic outcome of cross-breeding programs, facilitating the transfer of desirable traits between breeds. **Biotechnology applications** 1. **Gene editing and expression**: Advanced genomics can facilitate the development of gene-edited animals that exhibit improved productivity or disease resistance. 2. **Synthetic biologies**: Understanding goat genetics also has implications for developing new animal products, such as milk with enhanced nutritional profiles or meat with improved taste and texture. In summary, studying the genome of domestic goats provides valuable insights into their genetic makeup, enabling researchers and breeders to make data-driven decisions about livestock selection and breeding.

"Delivering Along the Food Value Chain  A recent trip back home to Louisiana sparked memories of a simpler time when old trucks full of fresh produce rumbled down dusty roads to deliver goods to the local market. The Census of Agriculture tells us that 50,000 farmers and ranchers nationwide are now selling to local retailers and that 150,000 of them are selling their products directly to consumers. Although these farmers and ranchers are still using this direct approach, the agricultural industry is certainly more dynamic today.  This means that producers need to follow a strategic business model. The reality is that food can go through a lot of steps to reach the consumer. Before it is served on the table, food travels from the field to the truck to the packing house to the store. My agency, the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has many programs that support business entities involved in the food chain, including farmers markets and food hubs.

To navigate the complexities of the modern food value chain, farmers and ranchers can: 1. **Monitor Food Safety Regulations**: Stay informed about changing regulations and standards for food safety, labeling, and certification. 2. **Stay Informed About Market Trends**: Research consumer preferences and market trends to remain competitive and adapt their marketing strategies accordingly. 3. **Develop Strong Supply Chain Partnerships**: Build relationships with reliable suppliers and distributors to ensure efficient delivery of products to consumers. By implementing these strategies, farmers and ranchers can effectively market and sell their products directly to consumers while navigating the complexities of the modern food value chain.",0.00894891449392728,0.12147505422993492,0.030501089324618737,0.07375271149674621,0.8223859071731567
"Growing a Community - One Family at a Time in Huron, S.D.  There are stark differences between Huron, South Dakota, and the Thailand Refugee Camp where the Maung Family started their journey. There are cultural differences, language barriers, and vast contrasts between the way people live and work in these two pinpoints on opposite sides of the globe. The Maung family journeyed from Thailand and have been welcomed into the community of Huron, South Dakota. They are enjoying the American culture and are adjusting well to life in their new community. It takes strong community partners working together to create thriving communities and improve the quality of life in rural areas. Even though the Maung family has limited knowledge of the English language, that barrier did not prevent them from pursuing the American dream of homeownership through USDA.

"USDA Rural Development Idaho Public Information Officer in  Initiatives  Rural  Jan 05,   Wow, the first emergency call out of the new fire station.  As I pulled into the driveway of the new Heyburn, Idaho, Fire Station for the ribbon cutting, I was greeted with the red lights flashing on the fire truck as the fire crew rushed to their call.   Initially, I thought about how much faster the crew can respond to the family who needs their help due to the improved location of a new station, thanks in part to the USDA Rural Development Community Facilities Direct Loan program, with funds for this particular station being provided through the Recovery Act of .   But then my thoughts turned back to the two days prior, when the volunteers gathered at the new station for an additional training session.   Some of the volunteers on that truck were the same volunteers at the training, who were once again taking time away from their paid jobs, to ensure their neighbors and employers have access to the same emergency services that I take for granted living in the Boise metropolitan area. Volunteer Fire fighters are known for providing emergency services, but now I began to see how they also contribute to the economic opportunity of this rural community.  Their commitment not only saves local tax dollars, but also helps build a solid economic foundation.  We know that construction related jobs were saved during the construction of the new station, but how many jobs will be created or saved as a result of the emergency services provided through the fire fighters service? During the grand opening, it felt as if the entire community turned out for the ribbon cutting.  Most of the organizations involved in the planning, funding, and construction were present as well.   Afterward, I was told how the voters in the Minidoka County Fire Protection District overwhelming supported the bond for the new station.   A sense of pride came over me - I was fortunate just to be a part of this celebration, I was honored to have met these fine men (and woman) who sacrifice for their community, and I was proud to work for USDA Rural Development where we have such great partners and a loan program that helps rural communities provide adequate facilities, equipment, and training to their well deserving volunteers.

"Caribbean Hub Director in  Mar 17,  Dr. Guillermo Ortiz of the University of Puerto Rico and rancher Neftali Lluch of the Lajas Valley in Puerto Rico discuss various practical steps to combat rising temperatures and prolonged drought. Photo credit: University of Puerto Rico We are living in historic moments in the world’s response to climate change. Last December in Paris, delegates from 196 countries signed an agreement to work towards curtailing greenhouse gas emissions and to keep global warming to “well below” 2 °C degrees. This is a big step, but there is still much work to be done and the agricultural sector has an important role to play. Agriculture, forestry, and land degradation contribute just under a quarter of anthropogenic GHG emissions, mainly from deforestation and agricultural emissions from livestock, soil and nutrient management.  Climate change also poses a great challenge for food security and nutrition. It can reduce yields and affect where and how food is produced. As the risks of natural disasters increase, farmers need to modify how they produce food in order to become more resilient to prolonged droughts, excessive rains, floods, and more intense storms. Farmers in the Caribbean are among the most strongly affected by climate change, as Caribbean countries are in general highly vulnerable to climate change due to their geography and socioeconomic status. So what farming practices can tropical producers use to adapt and minimize the impacts of climate change? The USDA Caribbean Climate Hub, located at the US Forest Service International Institute of Tropical Forestry in Puerto Rico, is partnering with Universities and farmers in the U.S. Caribbean to release ADAPTA, a series of demonstration projects that communicate the best adaptive practices available to tropical producers. ADAPTA logo As part of the series, we are developing videos and factsheets that highlight adaptation practices in dairy, plantain, fruit and vegetable, and forest production. ADAPTA is part of an integrated communications plan to deliver climate adaptation practices to a diverse set of producers that builds on the assessment of risk and vulnerabilities that we completed last year to better understand the potential effect of climate change on agriculture and forestry in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. “Cattle & Dairy Farming in the Tropics” is the first video released and highlights adaptation practices for tropical dairy producers. Dairy is an important farming practice in Puerto Rico and St. Croix, involving more than 50,000 acres and generating over 25,000 jobs. Drought and heat have been hitting producers hard and have had detrimental effects on the livestock and dairy industries by making cattle more susceptible to worms, ticks, and dairy cattle becomes stressed and produce less milk. As grasses died due to lack of rain, producers in the U.S. Virgin Islands were forced to take measures ranging from collecting tree limbs and branches for fodder, to relying on imported feed and even culling herds. Pastures were so over taxed, that many will have to be re-sown completely at great cost to farmers. In Puerto Rico, producers saw their costs rise as they relied ever more heavily on imported feed. Many also saw their production go down as heat stress and lack of nutrients took their tolls on local herds. Unfortunately, climate models in the region are predicting dramatic changes in rainfall cycles, in which prolonged periods of drought are interrupted by intense rainfall events. However, there are measures that farmers can take to reduce the impacts of drought and increased temperatures, as showcased in the first video of the ADAPTA series. We believe Caribbean producers are some of the most innovative in the world. Through this project we hope to highlight and share how local farmers are adapting to remain successful in the face of climate change and other challenges. The Caribbean Hub is promoting cooperation by providing open venues and forums to address climate vulnerability as part of the USDA Regional Climate Hub comprehensive strategy to help farmers mitigate and adapt to climate change. The Climate Hubs are integrating efforts of the USDA Agricultural Research Service, National Resource Conservation Service, the US Forest Service, and other USDA agencies with state governments, local universities, and non-profits to help coordinate and streamline efforts to ensure the vitality of US working lands in the face of climate change.

"Agricultural Marketing Service Deputy Associate Administrator in  Research and Science  Feb 12,  Currently a proposal for an Organic R&P is getting closer to Step 1 in the creation process. While a proposal has not been formally submitted to USDA, a proponent group is working with stakeholders to develop a draft. USDA photo courtesy of Sam Jones-Ellard. We often talk about the many ways research and promotion (R&P) programs benefit both ag industries and the consumer. Our nation’s farmers and ranchers leverage these programs and the pooled resources they collect to help overcome marketing barriers and connect with consumers. R&P programs are self-help initiatives that are national in scope and funded by the industry to help these businesses continue to strengthen their rural economies and the communities they support. To form a new R&P, there are specific steps that the industry and USDA follow:  STEP 1: A proponent submits a proposal to USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), which oversees all national R&P programs. The proposal typically includes an analysis of the industry, the program’s objective, and its potential impact on small businesses. While there are specific requirements needed for a proposal, the proponent can tailor the proposed program to best meet a specific industry’s needs. For example, some proposals include different eligibility requirements to vote in their referendums or an exemption for small producers, handlers and importers. STEP 2: USDA publishes the proposal in the Federal Register, soliciting public comments so that prevailing industry thoughts are incorporated into the final program. This is important because these programs will use pooled resources from across the industry to invest in creative marketing campaigns and innovative research projects that will support all of the industry’s growers, handlers, processors, manufacturers and importers. STEP 3: After the comment period ends, USDA reviews and analyzes the comments to determine whether the program has merit to move forward. STEP 3a: If a review of comments shows general consensus or agreement among the industry stakeholders, USDA moves forward with the proposal and a second proposed rule is published in the Federal Register to announce a referendum so the industry can vote on the rule. STEP 3b: If a review of the public comments suggests that a proposal needs to be re-evaluated, there are two options:  1) if the comments suggest a need to adjust parts of the proposal, a supplemental proposed rule can be published to modify parts of the proposal and request that the industry provides further comments; 2) the proposal is terminated. STEP 4: USDA conducts a referendum, allowing eligible parties to vote on whether or not the measure is approved. STEP 5: If the referendum is approved by the eligible voters within the industry, USDA issues a final rule implementing the program. For proposals that request a delayed referendum, the program will be announced as a final rule with a referendum to be held at a later date. STEP 6: Nominations from the industry are collected and a board is appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture to represent the interests of the entire industry. USDA seeks nominations from the industry for board members and alternates. These steps are intended to help the farmers and businesses establish a framework that will work across an entire industry and make the broadest positive impact for everyone involved.  Industry research and promotion programs have played an important role in shaping the agricultural landscape and yielding positive results for farmers and businesses throughout the country. For example, when research supports adding lean pork to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension – or DASH – eating plan, it helps consumers create healthy menus to meet their nutritional needs and it helps pork producers connect with a larger consumer base. And an August economic analysis found a return on investment (ROI) of $8.87 for every dollar the peanut industry invested into the National Peanut Board activities over the last 5 years. These are just a couple of ways that research and promotion programs are making a positive contribution for our nation’s agricultural businesses. USDA is committed to supporting these industry-driven programs, and ensuring that they address the needs and help meet the challenges faced by today’s farmers and agricultural businesses. Currently a proposal for a Hardwood Lumber R&P has reached Step 3 in the process. Public and industry comments are being evaluated by USDA. Photo courtesy of IndoGemstone.

"Secretary Perdue Proclaims April as ‘Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month’  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .19  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@oc.usda.gov  (Washington, D.C., April 1, ) – Spring is a popular time to move, but unfortunately, people aren’t the only ones on the move. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue today signed a national proclamation (, 579 ) to declare April “Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month,” during a critical time when damaging invasive species known as Hungry Pests emerge and can be easily spread in the things people pack and move, such as outdoor items like grills, gardening equipment, wading pools and bicycles or patio furniture. Hungry Pests are a real problem. They attack trees, plants and agriculture, costing the United States about $40 billion each year in damages and expensive eradication and control efforts. Household moves increase the risk for the spread of these invasive species, since people can potentially transport them to new areas. About 35 million Americans move every year, making the possibility of transporting invasive pests high. For instance, federal and state inspectors often find gypsy moth egg masses on outdoor household items and recreational vehicles in non-infested areas. The United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS) is offering a free checklist for household moves that includes suggestions and tips for reducing this risk. The agency is also working with the United States Postal Service’s My Move program to help educate the moving public about the things they can do to help prevent the spread of Hungry Pests. “Hungry Pests can hide inside plants, fruits, vegetables and firewood, and spread in a number of ways, like on outdoor items you move to a new home or on an RV that has been parked outside and driven cross-country,” said Kevin Shea, APHIS Administrator. “It only takes one person to start a new infestation, which is why we all need to be careful and understand how to stop invasive pests.” Here are key ways the public can help:  Moving to a new home. Help protect your new city and neighborhood from invasive pests by removing eggs masses and insects from your patio furniture, grills, bikes and other outdoor items – before they are loaded onto the moving van or storage pod.  Traveling within the United States. Before doing an out-of-state trip, make sure your car, RV or other outdoor vehicle is cleaned first. Check the wheel wells, bumpers and other hard-to-see areas to make sure they are free of soil, egg masses, and insects. In addition to moves, pests can also be spread by:  Mailing homegrown plants, fruits and vegetables. Commercially bought goods are regulated to meet government standards, including those for invasive pests, but items grown in a home garden are not. If you live in an area quarantined for a specific pest, don’t mail produce or plants from your garden to others. Contact your local APHIS office for more information.  Moving untreated firewood. Invasive pests like the emerald ash borer and Asian longhorned beetle burrow inside wood to lay their eggs. Don’t take untreated firewood with you, for example, on camping trips. Instead, buy certified, heat-treated firewood or responsibly gather wood at your destination.  Traveling internationally. It’s tempting to want to return with an unusual plant, a souvenir made from plants or wood, or even a piece of fruit as a snack for the plane trip home. However, U.S. laws prohibit many of these items from entering the country because they could harbor an invasive pest. Contact your local APHIS office to find out what’s allowed. And always declare these items to U.S. Customs and Border officials when you land. Failure to do so could result in unexpected delays and fines.  Buying plants for your garden. When buying garden items in person, be sure to ask the retailer if they comply with federal and state quarantine restrictions to ensure their plants are free of invasive pests. Before you buy plants online, check if the seller is in the United States. If they are in another country, you might need an import permit or other documents to legally bring the items into the United States. Contact your local APHIS office for more information. Finally, learn more by going to www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests or join the conversation on Facebook and Twitter. The website includes photos and descriptions of each Hungry Pest, and a Pest Tracker to find those in your state.

"International Affairs Fellow, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Feb 26,  Targeting over 80 crops, the Fall Armyworm poses a significant threat to global food security. USDA researchers tackle tough problems critical to American agriculture. Addressing how to nurture heathy soils, improve crop yields, or prevent livestock diseases, they carefully plan experiments and analyze that can lead to better on-farm decisions and more productive practices. But even scientists can’t always predict how far their work will eventually go. Recently, USDA researchers in Florida have seen their work take on unexpected relevance in Africa with the outbreak of an invasive crop pest. Fall Armyworm (FAW, Spdoptera frugiperda) is a destructive pest that can feed on 80 different crop species, including corn. Native to the Americas, USDA has studied FAW since the s. U.S. farmers currently manage it through integrated pest management approaches, combining the use of pesticides, genetically engineered crops, and other technologies and techniques. FAW was first reported in Africa in , and has now been documented in more than 30 African countries. Although we have decades of experience managing FAW in the United States, it is relatively new to African farmers, where corn is a staple crop for more than 300 million subsistence farmers and small-scale producers. The international community has mobilized to address this growing crisis, with U.S. Government agencies contributing their own expertise. USDA’s significant experience with the pest in the U.S. has positioned it as a trusted source of technical information on FAW biology and control measures. Studies by USDA scientists Robert Meagher and Rodney Nagoshi (Insect Behavior and Biocontrol Research, Gainesville, FL) provided valuable technical insights in the recently released Fall Armyworm in Africa: A Guide for Integrated Pest Management. With tips on pest identification, available technologies, and best practices for managing FAW, this guide was jointly produced under the U.S. Government’s Feed the Future initiative by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and the CGIAR Research Program on Maize (CRP MAIZE). Research that started out with the objective of helping U.S. corn farmers increase their yields is serving double duty now, playing a role in African food security. Although you can’t predict what agricultural issues the future may hold, you can count on USDA research having a global impact. USDA scientists provided expertise and training for the new guidebook countering the Fall Armyworm’s destruction of African crops. Recently, USDA shared FAW information in the Feed the Future information booth at the recent USDA Agricultural Outlook Forum.  Category/Topic:  Research and Science  Tags:  Office of the Chief Scientist  Florida  invasive pests  integrated pest management  Feed the Future  USAID  Research","What US-based research on the Fall Armyworm, initially conducted for domestic crop yield improvement, has since taken on unexpected global relevance in addressing food security concerns in Africa?","USDA researchers' work on managing the Fall Armyworm, initially aimed at improving U.S. corn yields, is now being applied to address food security concerns in Africa due to the pest's invasive spread across 30+ African countries.","The research you're referring to is likely related to the work of Dr. Bruce Tabashnik and his team at the University of Arizona's Entomology Department. In the 1990s, researchers at the University of Arizona conducted studies on the Fall Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) as part of a project aimed at improving crop yields in the US through the development of Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) crops. These genetically modified crops were designed to produce their own insecticides, targeting pests like the Fall Armyworm. However, as the global food security situation began to deteriorate in the early 2000s, particularly in Africa, these same researchers redirected their focus towards developing a more comprehensive understanding of the Fall Armyworm's impact on food production. The key breakthrough came with the discovery that Bt crops could not only control local pests but also reduce the prevalence of the invasive Fall Armyworm. By leveraging the existing research and adapting the insights gained from studying Bt crops in the US, scientists were able to develop effective management strategies for the Fall Armyworm on a global scale. This shift in focus enabled them to contribute meaningfully to addressing food security concerns across Africa. The outcomes of this redirected research are twofold: 1. **Improved crop yields**: By controlling pest populations effectively using Bt crops or similar methods, farmers in Africa can now maintain higher levels of crop productivity. 2. **Enhanced food security**: The capacity to manage the Fall Armyworm more efficiently means that staple crops (which often serve as primary sources of food) are less vulnerable to damage and loss. This research demonstrates how a project initially conducted for domestic purposes can evolve into a global initiative addressing broader, interconnected challenges like food security.",7.279427932319537e-79,0.17337461300309598,0.06853582554517133,0.11764705882352941,0.8550588488578796
"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Apr 09,  Spotted lanternfly. (USDA photo by Lance Cheung) (Editor’s note: Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue on April 1 proclaimed “Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month.” The following illustrates some of the research that USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture supports to control invasive pests in agriculture.) Good things come in small packages, right? Not always. Oftentimes, what may appear to be a vibrant field of pastoral charm or gently blowing golden waves of grain are actually battlefields where small invading armies threaten the nation’s economic, social, and environmental well-being. “Nearly every terrestrial, wetland, and aquatic ecosystem in the United States has been invaded by non-native species, with economic losses estimated at $137 billion per year,” said Robert Nowierski, national program leader for biobased pest management at USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). NIFA is in the vanguard of the fight to control, mitigate, and eradicate invasive pests, through funding and national program leadership. NIFA’s invasive pest portfolio includes sponsorship of four Regional Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Centers; establishment of the National Plant and Animal Diagnostic Laboratory Networks; and funding State Agricultural Experiment Station projects, the regional research and extension efforts of multi-state committees, and plant production and protection research conducted through the Small Business Innovation Research program. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques, such as biological control, habitat manipulation, modification of cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, and minimizing the use of pesticides. Benefits of IPM include greater survival of a pest’s natural enemies, slower development of pesticide resistance, less pest resurgence, fewer outbreaks of secondary pests, less negative impact on the environment, and greater worker safety. In addition, many farmers report greater profits because they’ve reduced their expenses on pesticide. NIFA’s programs support projects from research discovery, through research and development, to extension education and implementation of plans. Some of the higher profile invasive pest projects include the brown marmorated stink bug, spotted wing drosophila, West Nile virus, and the spotted lanternfly. According to Nowierski, the spotted lanternfly is probably the showiest of the invasive species pests. “I was on an invasive species field tour last year and visited a farmer’s grape vineyard severely impacted by the spotted lanternfly. He lost half-a-million dollars from spotted lanternfly damage to his 40-acre vineyard in !” NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

"International Programs and Ellita Willis, Office of Communication in  Conservation  Apr 12,   Migratory species play unique ecological roles because of their intrinsic beauty and significance in culture and identity.  Despite this, bats, birds, butterflies and dragonflies face a multitude of threats both in the US and in Latin America and the Caribbean where they migrate during the winter. If these habitats are not protected, the tremendous US domestic investment in conserving these species is wasted. Receiving the award for “Communities in Conservation” are Luisa Lopez, Counselor at El Valor and Vincent Jordan, participant in El Valor's Adults with Different Abilities Program. They are holding one of the products of this program—a monarch butterfly made for Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead. An award ceremony for conservation of birds, bats and butterflies was recently held in Atlanta.  The Wings Across the Americas event paid special tribute to partnerships that contribute to conservation efforts. Successful conservation work typically happens through partnerships—recent award-winning projects were no exception.  All of the Forest Service employees receiving awards shared the stage with partners from a myriad of organizations.  They included universities, volunteer and conservation organizations as well as private firms.  Awards were given this year in categories of: international research and partnership; research and partnership; habitat and management; bat conservation; butterfly conservation and, for the 2nd year, for urban communities in conservation.

"Customer Support Communications Specialist, USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in  Animals  Plants  Mar 14,  Scott Kravetz participates in the Bird Health Awareness Week webinar. USDA photo. As part of Bird Health Awareness Week, USDA recently hosted a webinar on “Growing Chicks into Healthy Chickens.”  Dr. Martin Smeltzer, Andy Schneider (aka the “Chicken Whisperer”) and Dr. Claudia Dunkley spent an hour helping backyard bird owners learn more about keeping their flocks healthy.  Around 300 people participated in the webinar, most of who are just getting started with backyard birds. The goal of Bird Health Awareness Week is to help protect backyard birds from disease. The webinar focused on the cute little baby birds known as chicks. Now, I am not a poultry person, but I love eggs, so I thought this would be something interesting to learn.  I found out that raising backyard poultry is a growing trend.  People like to raise chicks into adults for their eggs, and for the entertainment value of having birds in their backyard. I didn’t know there were so many rules when it comes to starting a flock. You need to think about why you want to raise backyard birds and what you intend to do with them.  You also need to find out if it is legal where you live - check city and local ordinances and find out if you need a permit.  If you have one, you should also check with your Homeowners Association.   Look to see if inspections or other steps are to start a flock, and be sure to buy chicks from a National Poultry Improvement Plan- approved source to ensure they start out healthy. I was surprised to find out that young chicks must be separated from older birds, for them to be secure and safe from disease.  Let chicks grow into birds in a separate, clean environment before introducing them into your flock that contains older birds. There are two major diseases that can threaten backyard birds - Avian Influenza and Exotic Newcastle Disease. The webinar discussed six simple steps to help protect your birds from disease.  We also learned what potential signs of illness might include and what to do if you think your birds might be sick. Are you considering raising birds or want some tips for adding to your current flock?  The full webinar is available online, including nutrition tips and other information to help you grow a healthy and happy flock in your own backyard!

Photo courtesy of Ray Hammerschmidt With support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), the National Plant Diagnostic Network has grown into an internationally respected consortium of plant diagnostic laboratories dedicated to enhancing agricultural security by protecting health and productivity of plants in agricultural and natural ecosystems.  Dr. Ray Hammerschmidt, President of the National Plant Diagnostic Network, discusses this partnership and the benefits all Americans receive in the following guest post: Superheroes really do work among us. But, instead of capes and cowls and ice palaces and caves, they are often found in a lab at a public university or state agriculture department, wearing lab coats and working over a microscope. These men and women work daily to protect our communities and crops from dangerous pests and pathogens.  They are plant pathologists, entomologists, nematologists, weed scientists, and other plant scientists who work diligently to mitigate the impact of endemic, emerging, and exotic pathogens and pests that attack agricultural, forest, and landscape plants in the United States. We live in a global society where people, food, and materials travel in and out of our country 24 hours a day.  In addition to natural introduction of pathogens and pests – such as the hurricane that brought soybean rust to the United States – our ports, highways, and airports are also entryways for new insects and diseases that hop a ride on cargo containers, suitcases, and even travelers’ clothing. Whether it is citrus greening disease (which is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid and threatens citrus production), emerald ash borer (an exotic beetle that has killed millions of ash trees in North America), or purple loosestrife (which invades our wetlands and displaces native vegetation), plants, pests, and pathogens threaten our food and water supply and, potentially, our economic security. The scientists, engaged with the National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN), are on the front lines and protect us from these threats by providing timely and accurate diagnostics. Established in , NPDN represents individuals from land-grant universities, federal agencies, state departments of agriculture, and other stakeholders and is an internationally respected consortium of plant diagnostic laboratories. NPDN provides a cohesive, distributed system to quickly detect and identify pests and pathogens of concern. NPDN laboratories immediately report their findings to appropriate responders and decision makers. To accomplish its mission, NPDN has invested in diagnostic laboratory infrastructure and training, developed an extensive network of first detectors through education and outreach, and created an enhanced communication network among public agencies and stakeholders responsible for responding to and mitigating new outbreaks. Their work is supported in part by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). NPDN labs routinely support national, state, and local response to disease and pest outbreaks. They have trained and registered 11,480 first detectors nationwide. In addition, NPDN labs have been involved in more than 1 million diagnoses, and this number climbs daily. The network serves as a model for efficiency, communication, and integration across jurisdictions, especially in rapid response situations. Federal funding for the NPDN network is essential to continue to protect our agriculture jobs and global trade. More importantly, NPDN scientists protect our economic security by fighting against pests and pathogens, sometimes long before they are even detected in the field and have started to do damage. Superheroes do walk among us – protecting us from harm and ensuring that we all have a better tomorrow.

"APHIS Public Affairs, Fort Collins, CO in  Animals  Plants  Dec 14,   APHIS' National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) recently received the Colorado Governor’s Award for High-Impact Research for its development of the GonaConTM Immunocontraceptive Vaccine (GonaCon).  The award was one of four given to Colorado-based labs for their cutting-edge research with global impact. The Colorado state Chief Operating Officer Don Elliman presented the award to NWRC’s Dr. Lowell Miller during a banquet hosted by CO-LABS. CO-LABS is a consortium of research universities, businesses, state and local governments and economic development councils with a mission to educate the public about the value of Colorado's 24 federal research labs. GonaCon is the first single-shot, multi-year immunocontraceptive vaccine for use in mammals. It was registered in by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as the first wildlife contraceptive for use in female white-tailed deer.  Not only might this new tool be useful as part of urban white-tailed deer management plans where traditional options are limited, but it also shows promise in other areas, such as disease prevention. GonaCon has been successfully tested in other mammal species, including elk, feral horses, bison, prairie dogs, ground squirrels, and feral dogs and cats.  In addition to wildlife management research, NWRC and collaborator studies include the development of a combined GonaCon-rabies vaccine for use in feral dogs and raccoons, contraception for companion animals, and the prevention of adrenocortical disease in pet ferrets and spread of brucellosis in bison.  The vaccine is being used for research purposes in the United States, Mexico, Europe, New Zealand and Australia.  Future NWRC research with GonaCon likely will involve studies to support expanded registration to other species, develop oral delivery systems, and prevent transmission of wildlife diseases.

"USDA and Partners Work to Eliminate Invasive Nutria From Maryland’s Eastern Shore  Word has it that legendary actress Greta Garbo could be seen wearing nutria fur coats back in the day, and nutria fur coats can still be found in vintage clothing stores around the world. Nutria, sometimes called swamp rats, were first introduced into the United States in the s to be used in the fur trade. However, when the fur trade collapsed in the mid ’s thousands of nutria were released by ranchers who could no longer afford to feed and care for them. This invasive rodent, about half the size of a beaver, damages wetland ecosystems by eating away at their delicate vegetation. Nutria have since been found in at least 20 states.

Some of the most significant effects include: 1. **Habitat Destruction**: Nutrias are herbivores that feed on a wide variety of aquatic plants, grasses, and other vegetation. They can consume large quantities of plant material in a short period, leading to: * Loss of biodiversity: By consuming native vegetation, nutrias can disrupt the food chain and alter the composition of local ecosystems. * Soil erosion: The removal of plant cover can lead to soil instability and increased sedimentation in waterways. 2. **Water Quality Degradation**: Nutrias contribute to water quality issues through: * Feces and urine contamination: Their waste can pollute water sources, making them unsuitable for human consumption or recreational use. * Algal blooms: Excess nutrients from nutria feces can stimulate algae growth, which can lead to oxygen depletion in waterways. 3. **Native Species Displacement**: Nutrias compete with native species for resources, leading to: * Reduced populations of native herbivores and carnivores * Changes in community composition and structure 4. **Economic Impacts**: The invasion of nutria can have significant economic consequences, including: * Losses in agricultural production (e.g., rice, corn, and other crops) * Increased costs for water treatment and management * Negative impacts on recreational activities (e.g., fishing, boating) 5. **Human Health Risks**: Nutrias can carry diseases such as leptospirosis, which can be transmitted to humans through contact with contaminated water or soil. 6. **Increased Biotic Potential**: Nutrias are prolific breeders and can rapidly colonize new areas, leading to: * Population explosions * Increased competition for resources among native species The consequences of releasing invasive nutria into wild ecosystems can be severe and long-lasting.

"From Devastation to Restoration  Wildfires in sagebrush and other range ecosystems are increasing in frequency and severity, often in relation to drought conditions and intrusive species like cheatgrass, a non-native, highly flammable invasive species that establishes itself as a monoculture and crowds out native grasses and forbs. “What’s preferable to a monoculture is a diverse plant community that includes native grasses, forbs and shrubs,” said Francis Kilkenny, leader for the Great Basin Native Plant Project, a joint effort of the U.S. Forest Service and the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management, or BLM.  Diane Banegas, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Feb 11,   Respond to this story",How do invasive species like cheatgrass contribute to the increased severity and frequency of wildfires in sagebrush ecosystems?,"Invasive species like cheatgrass contribute to the increased severity and frequency of wildfires in sagebrush ecosystems by establishing themselves as monocultures, crowding out native grasses and forbs, and increasing flammability.","Invasive species like cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) play a significant role in contributing to the increased severity and frequency of wildfires in sagebrush ecosystems. Here's how: 1. **Fuel buildup**: Cheatgrass is a highly flammable, non-native grass that quickly grows and spreads, forming a dense mat on the ground. As it dries out over the summer months, it creates a fire-friendly environment by accumulating a large amount of fine fuels (small twigs, leaves, etc.). This creates a perfect ""matchstick"" condition for wildfires to spread rapidly. 2. **Fuel load**: Cheatgrass can grow up to 3-4 feet tall, forming a continuous layer of dry vegetation that fuels fires. As the grass grows and dies, it builds up a large fuel load, making it easier for fires to ignite and spread. 3. **Ignition sources**: The presence of cheatgrass increases the likelihood of human-caused ignition events, such as accidental campfires or discarded cigarettes, which can quickly spread into larger wildfires. 4. **Wind conditions**: In sagebrush ecosystems, strong winds are common during the summer months, which can fan small fires into massive blazes that sweep through the landscape, destroying everything in their path. 5. **Competing for resources**: Cheatgrass competes with native vegetation (like sagebrush) for water and nutrients, weakening the resilience of the ecosystem to wildfires. When cheatgrass dominates, it reduces the diversity of plant species, making the entire system more susceptible to fires. 6. **Changing fire regimes**: Invasive grasses like cheatgrass have altered the traditional fire regime in sagebrush ecosystems, shifting from low-frequency, high-severity fires to high-frequency, low-severity fires. This change allows invasive grasses to thrive and further exacerbates the risk of wildfires. The combined effects of these factors contribute to the increased severity and frequency of wildfires in sagebrush ecosystems, making it more challenging for land managers and conservationists to restore and maintain healthy, fire-resistant ecosystems.",0.04331182725145079,0.1466275659824047,0.08849557522123894,0.12903225806451613,0.8575304746627808

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Jan 09,  Roadside sign promotes Texas recovery attitude. No one knew when Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas on August ates. Texans along the Gulf Coast saw cities demolished, peak wind gusts as high as 130 mph, unprecedented rainfall of more than 50 inches that caused catastrophic flooding in areas, the death of 88 Texans, displacement of thousands of residents and more than $200 million dollars in agricultural losses. Traveling through Refugio to Victoria after Hurricane Harvey I saw the devastation to homes, businesses and the lives of so many – it brought tears to my eyes. Then I saw a sign that summed up Texans’ resilience – “Harvey was strong, Texas is stronger.” I immediately turned around and took a picture. Diebel (left) discuss NRCS assistance options with NRCS District Conservationist Kevin Isom. And strong is what farmers and ranchers have to be in their daily lives faced with the challenges of working in agriculture, especially when dealing with Mother Nature. Rancher Stephen Diebel of Diebel Cattle Company, rode out Hurricane Harvey at his family’s century old ranch in Victoria. He was unsure what devastation the daylight hours would reveal after listening to howling winds and pounding rain throughout the night. He knew it was one of the worst hurricanes he had been through during his time on the ranch. When dawn finally broke, Diebel’s first sight was the twisted metal of outbuildings and barns, sheets of metal like crumpled pieces of paper laying scattered across his pastures. The pastures and roads were covered in water as far as he could see. A sense of relief washed over him after seeing the calves alive and well. He had feared they had been killed when the hay barn collapsed. The calves often sought shade and shelter there. “I was in disbelief that the weather could cause such a mess. It’s hard to comprehend the workload ahead of you,” said Diebel. A busy cow-calf operation with many items on the daily “to-do” list like calf weaning were put on the back burner as the more immediate needs were undertaken by Diebel, his family and ranch crew. Diebel said the hurricane put the operation behind 30 to 45 days on cattle weaning since they had to get power lines fixed and water wells going again. He was able to scout the ranch looking at other damages and found the windmills had taken their last spin during the storm. The bent blades made the systems inoperable. Diebel, whose family has worked with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) on conservation efforts for several generations, realized one of his first calls needed to be to Kevin Isom, district conservationist with NRCS in Victoria. He knew NRCS would likely have assistance available to help replace the windmills with solar water pumps and panels to get the water flowing again. “With the cost of repairing windmills going up each year, it only made sense to take this opportunity to look at improving the efficiency and dependability of our watering systems with solar,” said Diebel. “The NRCS technical assistance through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) have helped make improvements to maximize the land and natural resources, such as brush management, range planting, cross fencing, and conservation enhancements.” He filed an early exemption with NRCS so he was able to obtain bids and start the process of installing the solar pumps and solar panels. The early exemption does not guarantee funding for USDA programs, but it does allow the producer to install the practice before funding is awarded. Thankfully, flooding concerns were less severe on the Diebel ranch. He contributes this to the family’s conservation practices, particularly rotational grazing that keeps pastures covered in forage and builds healthy soil. The healthy soil was able to soak in the rain instead of ponding for days in the fields. As I watched the cattle enjoy the green grass that was abundant after the rain and listened to Diebel talk about how thankful he was that his family and friends were safe, I knew that even when faced with Mother’s Nature’s wrath, he like other Texans would rally together to rebuild and be stronger as a result of Hurricane Harvey.

This allows the soil to soak up rain instead of ponding, reducing flooding concerns and making it easier to recover after a disaster.","Rotational grazing and other conservation agriculture practices can indeed help mitigate damage from severe weather events like Hurricane Harvey. Here are some ways in which they can be beneficial: 1. **Soil Erosion Prevention**: Rotational grazing helps maintain soil cover, reducing erosion caused by heavy rainfall or flooding. By allowing pasture to grow back between grazed areas, the risk of soil being washed away is significantly reduced. 2. **Water Holding Capacity**: Soil with high organic matter content can hold more water, making it less prone to flooding and runoff. Conservation practices like rotational grazing help improve soil health by increasing its carbon and nutrient content. 3. **Reducing Runoff**: By allowing vegetation to grow on land instead of being grazed constantly, the risk of runoff is significantly reduced. This helps in preventing water-borne pollutants from entering rivers and streams, which can be critical in areas prone to flooding like Hurricane Harvey's path. 4. **Lessen Sedimentation**: The reduced erosion and runoff mean less sediment in waterways. This can reduce the need for dredging operations post-flooding, saving resources and money. 5. **Crop Resilience**: Practices like conservation tillage and cover cropping help prevent soil crusting and promote root growth. These factors enhance crop resilience against extreme weather conditions. 6. **Reduced Soil Salinization**: In regions where heavy rainfall is followed by prolonged droughts, practices that improve water infiltration can reduce the risk of soil salinization. 7. **Enhanced Nutrient Cycling**: Rotational grazing ensures that livestock nutrient demands are met from within the farm or ranch itself, reducing the need for external inputs like synthetic fertilizers. This helps in maintaining a healthy and balanced ecosystem. 8. **Improved Water Quality**: By reducing runoff and erosion, these practices contribute to better water quality, which is crucial for human consumption and aquatic life. 9. **Increased Carbon Sequestration**: Healthy soils can sequester carbon more effectively, contributing to climate change mitigation efforts. 10. **Adaptation and Resilience**: These agricultural management practices enhance the overall resilience of farms and ranches against extreme weather events like Hurricane Harvey. They are not just helpful in mitigating damage; they also support long-term recovery by promoting soil health, which is key for agriculture's adaptability to climate change. In summary, adopting conservation agriculture practices can significantly reduce the impact of severe weather events on agricultural land, infrastructure, and ultimately, human life and livelihoods.",0.022470139191169726,0.16055045871559634,0.05529953917050691,0.11009174311926606,0.8483334183692932
"The Year of the Flood  Incidents described as “thousand year storms and floods” and “the worst U.S. disaster since Hurricane Sandy” claimed the lives of more than 58 people in Louisiana, West Virginia and South Carolina over the last year.  These disasters often remind us of the devastating impacts that families and their communities face after they strike. After emergency life saving operations, food and shelter assistance are the most important priorities with which emergency managers must contend.  It was during these times that the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) responded to 22 incidents by providing needed nutrition assistance.  More than half of these disasters involved severe and widespread flooding, including the most recent floods that affected residents in 22 parishes in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  Cora Russell, Office of Emergency Management, Disaster Response Coordinator, USDA's Food and Nutrition Service  Posted in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Sep 13,   1 Response","What were some of the top priorities for emergency managers after the devastating floods described as ""thousand year storms"" that occurred in Louisiana, West Virginia, and South Carolina?","After the devastating floods described as ""thousand year storms"", the top priorities for emergency managers were food and shelter assistance, followed by emergency life saving operations.","After the devastating floods in Louisiana, West Virginia, and South Carolina, which were indeed referred to as ""thousand year storms,"" emergency managers faced numerous challenges. Here are some of their top priorities: 1. **Search and Rescue Operations**: The first priority was to locate and rescue people stranded by the floodwaters. Emergency responders focused on reaching isolated areas, especially in rural communities where access was limited. 2. **Shelter and Mass Care**: Providing safe shelter for those affected was crucial. Emergency managers set up emergency shelters, evacuation centers, and other mass care facilities to accommodate displaced individuals and families. 3. **Water Supply and Sanitation**: Ensuring access to clean drinking water and maintaining sanitary conditions were top priorities. Emergency responders worked to restore or establish water treatment plants, and provide portable toilets and sanitation facilities where needed. 4. **Food Distribution**: Providing food to those affected was essential. Emergency managers coordinated with local non-profit organizations and government agencies to distribute food, especially in areas where access to grocery stores was limited. 5. **Health Services and Medical Care**: The risk of waterborne illnesses and other health concerns increased after flooding. Emergency responders prioritized providing medical care, vaccinations (if necessary), and mental health support to affected individuals. 6. **Infrastructure Assessment and Repair**: Assessing the damage to critical infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and utilities, was crucial. Emergency managers worked with engineers and contractors to repair or replace damaged infrastructure, ensuring public safety and access to essential services. 7. **Communication and Coordination**: Effective communication between emergency responders, government agencies, and affected communities was vital. Emergency managers established incident command systems, coordinated with national and state authorities, and provided regular updates on the situation. 8. **Environmental Assessment and Remediation**: The floodwaters carried pollutants, debris, and hazardous materials, posing a significant risk to human health and the environment. Emergency responders prioritized assessing and remediating contaminated areas to prevent long-term environmental harm. 9. **Long-Term Recovery Planning**: As the immediate response phase concluded, emergency managers began planning for the longer-term recovery of affected communities. This included assessing damage, identifying resources needed for rebuilding, and coordinating with local governments and stakeholders to support the recovery process. 10. **Mental Health Support**: The emotional toll of the floods was significant, especially among children and vulnerable populations. Emergency responders recognized the importance of providing mental health support and counseling services to affected individuals. These priorities were not exhaustive, but they reflect some of the key challenges faced by emergency managers in response to these devastating ""thousand year storms.""",0.01086112938547878,0.0948081264108352,0.04081632653061225,0.08126410835214448,0.8482066988945007

"Rural Development Arizona Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  Jan 24,   Rain poured through the roof of the old Black Canyon, Arizona, fire station, making the floor slippery and rusting the tin that covered the roof. Nonetheless, the one ambulance and fire truck that would fit into the aging metal shed still faired better than the other five vehicles parked outside. Those vehicles were not only pelted by rain and hail, but Arizona’s scorching sun baked them during much of the year—rotting the tires, fading the paint, and drying out the parts and equipment. Parking the vehicles outside also meant that the theft risk was greater, which increased insurance rates. A dilapidated trailer from the 70s was parked next to the shed. Three bunk beds were crammed into the small bedroom for use by fire crews. “It’s hard to recruit firefighters when they have to be housed in those conditions,” said Fire Chief Tom Birch. On January 21, a large crowd gathered to officially cut the ribbon for a new fire station for Black Canyon City. The new building has plenty of room—which means that all of the Department’s vehicles can be parked inside. It also has office space, a reception area, kitchen and three bunk rooms. The total project cost was $1.5 million. USDA Rural Development funded over half of that total. The Fire Department and their long list of building fund contributors made up the difference. That list of community supporters took two full pages of small type to list in the grand opening program. Chief Birch was joined at the ceremony by Fire District Board Members past and present, and the contractor and architect for the new facility. Also on hand were Arizona State Director of USDA Rural Development Alan Stephens, Bureau of Land Management District Manager Angelita Bulletts, Yavapai County Supervisor Tom Thurman and USDA Community Programs Director Leonard Gradillas. “Because of the distances involved in this rural area, our volunteers are to be here at the station during their shifts,” said Birch. “Morale has soared since we got the new station.” The Spacious interior of Black Canyon City Fire Department Building-Residents line up for a potluck meal.  There are lots of other pluses with the new fire station.  The station is built on land close to the interstate for rapid deployment, and because the vehicles can be parked inside, BCCVFD was upgraded to a Class 5 insurance rating—significant because that means lower rates which get passed along to their customers. Three days after Chief Birch and his crew moved into the new fire station, they were called upon to help with a fire in the brush land to the north. “We had a call from the State Forester asking if we could help by providing a pre-stage location for their rapid-response team,” said Birch. “There would have been no way we could have provided that kind of support and assistance before,” he added. “We had the space to be able to accommodate the equipment and the personnel. Our efforts helped ensure that the brush fire did not become a bigger disaster.” To find out more about how USDA’s Community Facilities Programs can help your community, click here.

"New Resource to Aid Land Managers in Adapting to Climate Change  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .16  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  WASHINGTON, Feb. 1, — The U.S. Forest Service today released a new report, Effects of Drought on Forests and Rangelands in the United States: A Comprehensive Science Synthesis, that provides a national assessment of peer-reviewed scientific research on the impacts of drought on U.S. forests and rangelands. This report will help the Forest Service better manage forests and grasslands impacted by climate change.""Our forests and rangelands are national treasures, and because they are threatened, we are threatened,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""This report confirms what we are seeing, that every region of the country is impacted by the direct and indirect effects of drought conditions and volatile weather patterns. Sixty million Americans rely on drinking water that originates on our 193 million acres of national forest and grasslands. They support 200,000 jobs and contribute over $13 billion to local economies every year.""The report establishes a comprehensive baseline of available that land managers can use to test how well their efforts to improve drought resilience and adaptation practices are working nationwide. Major findings from the report include: Drought projections suggest that some regions of the U.S. will become drier and that most will have more extreme variations in precipitation. Even if current drought patterns remained unchanged, warmer temperatures will amplify drought effects. Drought and warmer temperatures may increase risks of large-scale insect outbreaks and larger wildfires, especially in the western U.S. Drought and warmer temperature may accelerate tree and shrub death, changing habitats and ecosystems in favor of drought-tolerant species. Forest-based products and values – such as timber, water, habitat and recreation opportunities – may be negatively impacted. Forest and rangeland managers can mitigate some of these impacts and build resiliency in forests through appropriate management actions.""Since , fire seasons have grown longer and the frequency, size and severity of wildland fires have increased,"" said Vilsack. ""Among the many benefits of having this solid baseline is the improved ability to identify where restoration work can help forests adapt and prosper while minimizing the threat and impact of future wildfires.""The assessment, a broad review of existing drought research, provides input to the reauthorized National Integrated Drought Information System ( NIDIS), established by Congress in , and the National Climate Assessment ( NCA), produced every four years to project major trends and evaluate the effects of global climate change on forests, agriculture, rangelands, land and water resources, human health and welfare, and biological diversity. Together these serve as key, science-based, resources for anyone working to maintain or improve public and private lands in the face of a changing environment.Edited by Forest Service scientists in partnership with Duke University, the document provides a valuable new tool to inform discussion, planning and implementation of adaptation strategies for land managers and policy makers. The collaborative effort, authored by 77 scientists from the Forest Service, other Federal agencies, research institutions and universities across the United States, examines ways to understand and mitigate the effects of drought on forests and rangeland including the 193 million acres of National Forest System lands.The implications of the findings of this report are likely to have far-reaching effects on the environment for the foreseeable future. As climate change drives temperatures increases and precipitation patterns change, drought–and associated disturbances such as insect outbreaks and wildfires-will only get worse across many areas of the United States.The mission of the U.S. Forest Service, an agency of the Department of Agriculture, is to sustain the health, diversity and productivity of the nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations. The agency manages 193 million acres of public land, provides assistance to state and private landowners and maintains the largest forestry research organization in the world. Public lands managed by the Forest Service contribute more than $13 billion to the national economy each year through visitor spending alone. Those same lands provide 20 percent of the nation's clean water supply, a value estimated at $7.2 billion per year. The agency also has a direct or indirect role in stewardship of about 80 percent of the 818 million forested and woodland acres within the U.S., including 100 million acres of urban forests where most Americans live. is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

"Conservation Outreach Intern in  Conservation  Forestry  Jun 05,   The beauty of watching a flock of birds migrating on the wing is a sight many enjoy.  Protecting their habitats to help them on their journeys is part of the work that U.S. Forest Service employees across the nation do every day. “Forests and grasslands managed by the U.S. Forest Service are critical to maintaining migratory bird populations, but Forest Service involvement goes well beyond the boundaries of Forest Service lands,” said John Sinclair, National Wildlife Program leader. “By working in local, regional and international partnerships, we conserve migratory bird species and their habitats across the Americas.” One such partner is, Wings Across the Americas, which invests in international conservation efforts. They use Forest Service experience and expertise to improve bird conservation at home and abroad. Scarce federal dollars are leveraged through partnerships with other agencies, non-governmental conservation organizations, local communities and private/corporate sources to ensure long-term sustainable projects that benefit birds throughout their range. The recovery of the Kirtland’s Warbler, a small song bird, is one of the success stories of the Forest Service International Program’s work with Wings Across the Americas.  As recently as , the Kirtland’s Warbler population was at an all-time low. Only 167 singing males were left. Female Kirtland’s warbler on a nest - Huron-Manistee National Forest.

The result was staggering.  By , there were already more than 2,000 singing males.” As part of ongoing partnerships and Obama's America's Great Outdoors Initiative, federal agencies like the Forest Service, Environment for the Americas and the Bureau of Land Management are working together to train Latino youth in community outreach and bird research techniques through the Celebrando las Aves Playeras (Celebrate Shorebirds) Project.

They kicked off the first day with an all-camp meeting where students were introduced to staff, sang songs and learned camp rules. Campers met their counselors (one parent and one high school student) and moved into one of the 19 cabins. Then they spent the afternoon at challenge courses, cabin development classes and listening to encouraging stories to help gear them up for a successful week away from home.

Campers spent their time outside of class singing songs, hanging out with new friends and at special evening activities acting in skits, listening to stories from counselors and folk dancing. The week culminated with Wilderness Night, where students and counselors built campfires and created their own shelters out of sheets of plastic and rope. The night brought a little rain but the consensus on Friday morning was that campers had a safe and great time. Forest Camp started in at the Fall Creek Fish Hatchery when employees of the Alsea Ranger District of the Siuslaw National Forest felt that local kids could benefit from more exposure to natural resources. They worked with Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Starker Forests and small local schools to formulate a plan that resulted in a successful week long residential camp. More than 3,500 kids have attended Forest Camp since its inception. Partners providing instruction at camp include: Siuslaw National Forest, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Starker Forests, Benton County Soil and Water Conservation District, Eugene District Bureau of Land Management, Salem District Bureau of Land Management, Pacific Northwest Research Station and many independent volunteers.

However, no specific safety measures are mentioned in the content provided regarding campfire safety or other evening activities.","I don't have specific information on any particular camping event or location. However, I can provide general information on common safety measures that are typically taken at campsites to ensure campers stay safe during evening activities and campfire use: 1. **Established Campsite Perimeter**: Campsites usually have a designated area for campfires. To prevent accidental fires or injuries from stray flames, this area is typically marked with clear boundaries. 2. **Fire Pits and Rings**: Many campsites provide fire pits or rings to contain the fire within a safe area. These are designed to collect sparks and embers, reducing the risk of larger fires spreading beyond the campsite. 3. **Supervision by Camp Staff**: During evening activities, especially when building campfires, camp staff often supervise campers closely. This ensures that safety guidelines are followed and any potential hazards can be quickly addressed. 4. **Safety Briefings and Rules**: Before allowing campfires or engaging in other potentially hazardous evening activities, camps typically provide a briefing on safety rules and procedures. These briefings might include information on firewood storage, the safe handling of flammable materials, and what to do in case of an emergency. 5. **Access to Water**: Having access to water is crucial for extinguishing fires quickly if they get out of control. Camps usually ensure that there's a nearby source of water available. 6. **First Aid Kits on Site**: First aid kits are always available at campsites. This ensures that any injuries can be promptly treated, reducing the risk of complications from minor issues. 7. **Emergency Plans and Procedures**: Campsites often have detailed plans in place for emergency situations, including fires or medical emergencies. These might include evacuation procedures, communication plans with local emergency services, and protocols for handling various types of incidents. 8. **Regular Fire Inspections**: To maintain safety standards, camps might conduct regular inspections of campfires to ensure they are being used safely and efficiently, with adequate supervision by camp staff. 9. **Education on Wilderness Safety**: Many camps provide educational sessions or workshops on wilderness safety, which cover the risks associated with campfire use, such as burns from sparks, firewood storage, and potential hazards in the area. 10. **Regulations Compliance**: Camps are required to comply with local, state, and national regulations regarding environmental protection and public safety. These regulations often mandate specific practices for campfire management, such as not burning certain types of materials or ensuring that fires are fully extinguished before leaving them unattended. While these measures can minimize risks associated with evening activities at campsites, including building campfires, the actual implementation of these safety measures can vary significantly from one camp to another.",2.1517933431455012e-155,0.12704918032786885,0.016460905349794237,0.08196721311475409,0.8306190967559814
"USDA Seeks Grant Applications for Projects to Test Fruit and Vegetable Incentives  Like other Americans, folks participating in the USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) need to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables. As USDA’s Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, it’s a fact that I recognize and a fact we’re working to address in innovative ways. In recent weeks, USDA requested a new round of applications for grants provided under the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) grant program and launched a handy FINI grantee locator map. The FINI grant program, if you’re unfamiliar with it, was authorized by the Farm Bill and provides grants to test incentive strategies and technologies designed to help SNAP participants better afford fruits and vegetables.

"USDA Food and Nutrition Service, Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 18,   I get to learn about a lot of great local initiatives when I make visits around the country.  On a recent trip to Dallas, I visited Metrocrest Social Services, a community resource agency in Farmers Branch, Texas, that provides services to families in crisis and helps them make plans for the future. The purpose of the visit was to learn how outreach workers from the North Texas Food Bank come to this office to assist clients submit applications for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Camilla Zimbal, social services director, gave me a tour of the agency, and showed me some of the other services available to clients. One of the highlights of this one-stop shop is a food pantry at which pantry clients may select groceries once a week. In addition to the canned and boxed food, they can also select fresh-from-the-garden fruit and vegetables. Camilla Zimbal, social services director for Metrocrest Social Services, explains how they get fresh produce for their clients to Audrey Rowe, administrator for Food and Nutrition Service. Community gardeners, farmers and individuals donate locally grown produce weekly to Metrocrest.  Produce is harvested early each Saturday morning from three nearby community gardens and a local high school garden and brought to Metrocrest for volunteers to wash, sort and display in time for a 9 a.m. opening. While clients are limited to once-a-week groceries, they may come in at any time for fresh produce. On a recent Saturday morning, over 40 people came in just for the produce. During peak growing season, when tomatoes and cantaloupes are ripening, even more clients show up for the delicious fresh produce, which is then delivered twice a week. Volunteers at Metrocrest provide recipes and cooking instructions for folks that may not have much experience cooking fresh foods. Recently, frozen chicken was available at the pantry. Volunteers made sure clients went home with some fresh herbs and cooking instructions for the chicken. Those who choose to donate fresh food also enjoy a benefit—providing fresh produce is a great way to give back to the community by helping fight hunger and promote healthy eating. Zimbal gave an example of a local couple in their seventies who picked bushels of ripe peaches from trees in their backyard and brought them to the pantry.  This was a delicious and special treat for clients and a sweet way for the couple to help others. Another example of thoughtfulness was the recent donation of tomato plants so clients could grow their own tomatoes. This kind of local food sharing is a great example of ways farmers and backyard gardeners can give back to the community and help provide healthy food to those in need.

Excess produce is often donated to local food banks and pantries. 2. **Gleaning Organizations**: Groups like Gleaners and Food Finders coordinate with farmers, ranchers, and gardeners to collect surplus produce that would otherwise go to waste. This produce is then distributed to food banks, pantries, and other hunger relief organizations. 3. **Backyard Garden Donations**: Home gardeners can donate excess produce from their gardens to local food pantries or shelters. Some cities have organized ""garden-to-table"" programs where residents can drop off fresh produce at designated collection points. 4. **Farmers' Market Produce Recovery Programs**: Some farmers' markets now have programs that collect unsold, unspoiled produce and redistribute it to local food banks, soup kitchens, and other hunger relief organizations. 5. **Food Recovery Hubs**: Organizations like Feeding America's Food Recovery Hub program connect local food banks with excess produce from grocery stores, restaurants, and farms. This produce is then distributed to individuals in need. 6. **Volunteer Gleaning Teams**: Groups of volunteers, often school children or community groups, can be organized to help harvest surplus crops on local farms. This produce is then donated to food pantries and shelters. 7. **Direct Donations from Local Farmers**: Some farmers donate excess produce directly to local food pantries or accept donations in-kind for items like seeds, fertilizers, or equipment that benefit their farm operations. 8. **Crowdsourced Produce Collection**: Online platforms and social media campaigns can be used to coordinate the collection of surplus produce from individual households, gardens, or farms, which is then donated to food banks and pantries. In Dallas, Texas, specifically, Metrocrest Social Services has partnered with local organizations like Gleaning Dallas and Food Rescue US to collect and distribute fresh produce to their food pantry clients.

"NRCS Helps to Keep Native American Traditions Alive  The 567 federally-recognized Native American Tribes are unique in their own way—from their languages and family structure, to their clothing and food. Tribes are working hard to revive their roots to help reconnect their heritage to the land, rekindle their spiritual bonds and cultural traditions, and raise awareness amongst future generations; especially tribal youth in line to inherit the land. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) works with the tribes like the Choctaw Indians, comprised of nearly 10,ates, to farm and harvest hickory king corn and other heirloom white varieties, and process them to make hominy. Hominy is made from dried corn kernels, but it is expensive to purchase. NRCS provides the tribe with technical assistance to help transform idle land into a hominy-making enterprise–enabling the tribe to provide their own locally-grown, fresh produce, and cut their expenses by growing the corn.

Zoonotic diseases are illnesses that can be transmitted from animals to humans, such as leptospirosis, hantavirus, and rat-bite fever. Here's how researchers studying Norway rats contribute to the prevention of these outbreaks: 1. **Surveillance**: By tracking the movement and behavior of Norway rats in urban areas, investigators can identify potential sources of zoonotic disease transmission. This information helps health authorities target high-risk areas and implement control measures. 2. **Disease monitoring**: Researchers study the prevalence of zoonotic diseases among Norway rat populations. This data enables them to monitor disease trends and predict outbreaks, allowing for proactive measures to be taken to prevent human exposure. 3. **Vector-borne disease identification**: By analyzing the presence of zoonotic pathogens in Norway rats, investigators can identify vectors (e.g., ticks, fleas) that transmit diseases between animals and humans. This information helps inform public health strategies aimed at reducing vector populations and preventing disease transmission. 4. **Urban ecology studies**: Understanding the urban ecosystem and how it supports rat populations is essential for effective control measures. Researchers study factors like food availability, shelter, and water sources that contribute to rat infestations. This knowledge enables targeted interventions to reduce rat populations and prevent disease spread. 5. **Development of public health strategies**: By analyzing data on Norway rats and their associated zoonotic diseases, investigators can inform the development of evidence-based public health policies and interventions. These may include vector control programs, rat population management strategies, and human education campaigns to prevent disease transmission. By studying Norway rats in urban environments, researchers contribute significantly to: 1. **Early detection**: Identifying potential disease outbreaks before they occur. 2. **Prevention**: Implementing targeted measures to reduce the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. 3. **Public health preparedness**: Ensuring that healthcare systems are equipped to respond effectively to emerging disease threats.

"Posted by the Equity Team in  Equity  Aug 01,  Growing up in a diverse community in Manhattan, USDA Equity Commission’s Elizabeth Lower-Basch understood the importance of civil rights, unions, and equity at a young age. Inspired by her upbringing, Lower-Basch went on to earn a master’s degree in public policy and began her career with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). At HHS, Lower-Basch worked on cash assistance and learned more about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the impact it has on millions of people. Lower-Basch’s desire to expand equitable access to food assistance for all who needed it grew from her experience working on SNAP and assisting children, seniors, and working people struggling to put food on the table. Following her time at HHS, Lower-Basch went to the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) where she currently serves as the Deputy Executive Director for Policy. CLASP works to develop and implement federal, state, and local policies that improve the lives of those in need. In her role, Lower-Basch provides leadership, strategic guidance, and support for the organization’s policy and advocacy agenda. Her work at HHS and CLASP has directly informed her contributions on the Equity Commission where she brought forward recommendations on how USDA can improve its efforts to reduce poverty and promote food and nutrition security. “I’m happy to represent those who cannot afford – or have the capacity to – take on volunteer opportunities such as this [Equity Commission], and to tell their story and advocate for their wellbeing and food security,” she said. The four nutrition-focused recommendations Lower-Basch introduced were shaped by her experience with the community partnership group at CLASP where she heard firsthand how limited or lack of access to programs and services can impact families. In the recommendations, the Equity Commissions asks USDA to continue to encourage state SNAP agencies to administer SNAP in a way that treats applicants and participants with dignity and respect and to consult with those with lived experience of poverty as they administer the programs and provide technical assistance on how to do so. In addition, the Equity Commission recommends the review and update of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP), which forms the basis of SNAP benefits, to reflect the needs of today’s consumers and supporting legislative action to remove eligibility restrictions on SNAP that disproportionately limit access to nutrition supports by Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC). “It was important for us to ensure the recommendations were informed by real people with lived experience, not just academia, so that they are actionable and impactful,” Lower-Basch explained. Nutrition programs are especially important during the summer when school is out, and childhood food insecurity is highest. USDA is taking action to address this through its Summer Nutrition Programs, or SUN programs. New for summer , SUN Bucks, also known as Summer EBT, is providing $120 in grocery benefits for eligible kids for the summer. SUN Meals and SUN Meals To-Go are also providing expanded options for kids to get meals at schools, parks and other locations. The expansion of summer benefits and nutrition support is proven to reduce child hunger in the summer by 33% while improving children’s diets. In addition, USDA has made updates to the WIC food program, increased SNAP benefits, improved the nutrition of school meals, expanded access to school meals at no cost to families, and more. All of these actions further the goal of equitable nutrition assistance for those in need, a pillar focus in the Commission’s Final Report. Since the release of the Equity Commission’s Final Report with 66 recommendations, USDA has been partnering with the Commission Members to host Regional Convenings across the country to engage stakeholders in meaningful conversations on agriculture and equity issues as well as opportunities that exist in their region and how USDA can be of service. “These convenings showcase how interconnected we all are and how much USDA does – and can do – for our communities,” Lower-Basch said. “Equity means everyone has a chance. We have an obligation to be pro-active rather than neutral in extending opportunities and supports.” “It’s not just the big policy or recommendation that’s important, it’s the details that matter too,” Lower-Basch concluded. “The equity journey includes making sure steps are being taken to implement the recommendations and policies so that all customers of USDA receive a fair shot at a prosperous, successful life.” The Equity Commission Final Report is available in both English (, 2.0 ) and Spanish (, 1.7 ).

This engagement aims to address systemic barriers and disparities in program delivery. 2. **Equity in Farm Service Agency Programs**: The USDA's Farm Service Agency has been working on initiatives to increase equity in its programs. This includes providing greater support for socially disadvantaged farmers, enhancing data collection and analysis to identify patterns of inequitable treatment, and implementing policies to address these disparities. 3. **Food Security and Justice Initiatives**: Some community-based projects and advocacy groups are pushing for reforms within the USDA that would better align food assistance programs with the needs of marginalized communities. This might involve streamlining application processes, improving access to nutritious food in underserved areas, or increasing support for local farming initiatives. 4. **Engagement with Local Communities**: The USDA has been trying to engage more effectively with communities that are disproportionately affected by hunger and food insecurity. This includes listening to their concerns, gathering feedback on program effectiveness, and identifying innovative solutions to these challenges. 5. **Advancements in Technology and Data Analysis**: The USDA is also exploring the use of technology and data analysis to identify inequities in food assistance delivery. This could help pinpoint areas where systemic barriers exist or policies need adjustment to ensure equal access to nutritional support. While I can provide some context on these topics, it's essential to consult the most current resources from the USDA for the most accurate information about their specific actions and initiatives regarding equity in food assistance programs.",5.873404680172838e-79,0.2517482517482517,0.03278688524590164,0.1351981351981352,0.8300250768661499
