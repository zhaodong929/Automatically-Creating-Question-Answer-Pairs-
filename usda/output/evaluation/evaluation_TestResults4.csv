"The People's Garden Apiary, installed in , is located on the roof of the Jamie L. Whitten Building and has homed up to approximately 80,000 Italian honey bees. USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Bee Research Lab in Beltsville, Maryland, helps keep these colonies of bees strong and healthy so they can pollinate crops growing in the People's Garden and neighboring landscapes. They also produce delicious honey! Beehives are often important elements of urban gardens due to the pollination services they provide. They’re also big business. Honeybees pollinate $ates each year, including more than 130 types of fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Honeybees also produce honey, worth about $3.2 million in according to USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). How are hives constructed? The beehives are wooden box-like sections stacked on top of each other. Each box (or super) holds 8-10 wooden frames which include a thin sheet of wax foundation in each frame. The bees build their combs on these foundations. How is honey extracted? Honey is stored in the combs in the upper parts of the hive. When the bees have filled the combs in the upper section with honey and covered them with wax caps, the beekeeper takes them away to extract the honey. Are honey bees native to the United States? Honey bees are not native to the United States. The scientific name for honey bee is Apis mellifera. Since humans first began keeping honey bees, their principal aim has been the harvest of honey. Beekeepers select the appropriate type of honey bee based on temperament, physical characteristics, disease resistance, and productivity. Italian honey bees were selected for the People's Garden Apiary because they are most often used in commercial beekeeping in the United States. These bees have a relatively gentle disposition and are good honey producers. They are not the most resistant to disease, but they excel in most other areas. There have been some queen survivorship issues in both of the People's Garden colonies, which actually mirrors what's going on in the rest of the country. Queen health is an issue for everyone who buys queens, commercial or hobbyist. The exact underlying reasons for poor queen survivorship is unknown, but the ARS lab is actively researching this problem.","What are some common characteristics of constructed beehives used in commercial beekeeping, and how do they facilitate honey production and harvesting?","In commercial beekeeping, beehives are typically wooden box-like sections stacked on top of each other, with 8-10 wooden frames per super, containing a thin sheet of wax foundation. This design allows bees to build combs for honey storage in the upper parts of the hive, which can then be extracted by the beekeeper when the combs are filled and capped with wax.","In commercial beekeeping, constructed beehives are designed to provide a safe, efficient, and productive environment for bees to thrive. Here are some common characteristics of these hives and how they facilitate honey production and harvesting: **Common Characteristics:** 1. **Standardized Size and Shape**: Constructed beehives have standardized sizes (e.g., Langstroth or Dadant hives) that allow beekeepers to easily manage and inspect the colonies. 2. **Vertical Hives**: Most commercial beehives are vertical, allowing bees to easily navigate between boxes and reducing congestion within the hive. 3. **Boxed Frames**: The frames within the hive are designed with a specific size and spacing to accommodate the queen's brood nest, honeycomb cells, and other bee activities. 4. **Protective Roofing**: Hives have roofs that protect bees from the elements (e.g., rain, wind) and predators. 5. **Portability**: Constructed beehives are designed to be moved easily between locations for inspections, harvesting, or re-locating colonies. **Facilitating Honey Production:** 1. **Easy Access**: The vertical design of the hives allows beekeepers to inspect the colony without disturbing bees, promoting a healthy and productive environment. 2. **Controlled Temperature and Humidity**: Constructed beehives often have insulation and ventilation features that regulate temperature and humidity levels within the hive, conducive to optimal honey production. 3. **Managers' Ease of Inspection**: With standard-sized hives, beekeepers can quickly locate issues or areas for improvement, enabling them to intervene when necessary. **Facilitating Honey Harvesting:** 1. **Frame Design**: The specific frame design allows bees to easily create new comb cells and fill them with honey. 2. **Capped Comb Cells**: Bees store honey in sealed (capped) combs that are easy to identify and extract during harvesting. 3. **Easier Extraction**: Constructed beehives make it easier for beekeepers to access the honeycomb frames, facilitating efficient harvesting. 4. **Minimizing Damage**: Standardized hives minimize the risk of damaging the comb or disturbing bees when extracting honey. By understanding these characteristics and benefits, commercial beekeepers can effectively manage their colonies and optimize honey production and harvesting in constructed beehives.",0.01606223645519745,0.19338422391857507,0.04603580562659847,0.11704834605597964,0.8289280533790588

"It's ideal to have host plants and nectar plants growing in your garden if your goal is to attract butterflies. Selecting what to plant varies enormously based on what butterfly species you wish to attract. Butterflies will roam in search of food and egg-laying sites for many miles—even hundreds to thousands—of miles. Butterflies lay their eggs on host plants that the emerging caterpillars will eat. Different species of butterflies prefer different types of plants to lay their eggs on. Milkweed and Monarch Butterflies The monarch butterfly however is very specific and only lays her eggs on species of Asclepias - commonly known as milkweed. Each fall, millions of monarch butterflies migrate from the United States and Canada to overwintering areas in Mexico and California and make the return flight in spring. Threats, including loss of milkweed habitat, are having a devastating impact on monarch populations. By planting milkweed you can help save the monarch butterfly.","What is the primary host plant that Monarch Butterfly caterpillars eat, and why is it crucial to have this plant in your garden to support their life cycle?","The primary host plant for Monarch Butterfly caterpillars is milkweed (Asclepias), which is crucial to have in your garden as the caterpillars will only eat this specific type of plant, making it essential for supporting their life cycle.","The primary host plant for Monarch Butterfly (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars is the Milkweed Plant (Asclepias spp.). Milkweed plants are vital for Monarchs because the caterpillars feed exclusively on these plants. The toxins from the milkweed, called cardenolides or cardenolide glycosides, are transferred to the adult butterflies, making them unpalatable and toxic to predators. This defense mechanism helps protect the monarchs throughout their life cycle. Having Milkweed in your garden is crucial for supporting Monarch caterpillars' life cycle because they need this specific plant to develop from egg to pupa stage. Without milkweed, Monarchs cannot complete their metamorphosis, and their populations will decline or become extinct.",0.09877354725822875,0.41958041958041953,0.21276595744680848,0.2937062937062937,0.9057444334030151

"Administrator, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Nutrition Security  Apr 25,  Setting kids up for success. It’s what every parent, guardian, and educator wants for our nation’s schoolchildren. They understand the power that small changes have to make a big difference in the learning environment. That’s why here at USDA, we recently announced a generational investment in our children’s futures through updated school nutrition standards. Right now, schools across our country are serving breakfasts and lunches to nearly 30 million children every day. Healthy school meals that represent the main source of nutrition for more than half of these students and are an essential part of the educational landscape — like teachers, books, or computers – helping to unlock kids’ full potential in and out of the classroom. It is no surprise that poor nutrition and diet-related diseases are correlated with lower academic achievement, worse health outcomes, and more behavioral problems for kids. We recognize the tremendous work that educators and school nutrition professionals do every day to ensure our children are fueled to thrive. Healthy school meals are an essential element of a quality education and are a part of the solution to promote children’s health. We know that this work is not easy, which is why the Biden-Harris Administration has made historic investments to help schools provide healthy and nutritious meals to students. School breakfast offers the jump start to a great day. It sets the tone for the rest of the day, especially for children. It’s why kids who eat breakfast have increased alertness and improved moods throughout the morning, fostering a better learning experience. What’s more, studies find that students who participate in school meal programs consume more whole grains, milk, fruits, and vegetables during mealtimes and enjoy better overall diet quality. These pivotal updates we are making to school nutrition standards have been shaped by a host of stakeholders, including parents, devoted teachers, school administrators, school nutrition directors, and industry leaders, and are informed by the latest Dietary for Americans. These new standards allow us to take the next step in putting kids’ health at the forefront by:  Reducing the amounts of added sugars in school meals, especially at breakfast.  Making it easier to offer healthy proteins at breakfast.  Scaling back sodium levels over time.  Continuing to emphasize fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains, to give kids the right balance of nutrients for healthy, tasty meals. That’s not all. We are also providing flexibilities to make it easier for schools to accommodate vegetarian diets and the cultural and religious food preferences of students. This way, every child has access to the nutritious foods they desire and deserve to nourish their bodies and minds. We encourage educators to uplift these school meal enhancements as an opportunity to maximize the impact of what they do best – educate. Because it’s that commitment to inspire that enables all students to thrive. For that important gift, our nation couldn’t be more grateful. To learn more about the updated school nutrition standards, please visit the USDA Food and Nutrition Service website.

"What is a native plant? A native plant is a plant that is a part of the balance of nature that has developed over hundreds or thousands of years in a particular region or ecosystem. Note: The word native should always be used with a geographic qualifier (that is, native to New England [for example]). Only plants found in this country before European settlement are considered to be native to the United States. There are many benefits of landscaping and gardening with native plants including conserving water, protecting soil from erosion, and creating habitat and providing food for many different animals including birds, pollinators, and small mammals. Simply by growing native plants gardeners can bring enormous beauty to a community and joy to its residents. In addition, native plants are easy-to-grow and require minimal maintenance.

"The benefits of trees Trees can provide many benefits in gardens and in urban environments. They produce fruit, like apples, peaches and figs, and also provide shade and wildlife habitat. Food forests support forest ecosystems and connect communities with nature. Trees of different sizes produce nuts and fruit, while their shade can support a variety of fresh, flavorful mushrooms, herbs, and berries. Trees also improve air quality and retain water. Check out the new Tree Planning and Planting Guide: A Guide for Reforesting Cities and Towns, produced by U.S. Forest Service and partner, the Green Infrastructure Center. The online guide includes a tool to guide communities on where to plant trees to maximize urban cooling across an entire city. Did You Know?

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Apr 10,  For many American farms, the apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree. The Robison and Stennes family orchards combined equal more than 200 years of growing apples in Washington. The Robison family has been growing apples in Chelan, Washington since the s. Today, Jake – the fourth generation of the Robison family – lives on the early-19th century plot that was used to grow some of the earliest apples to be harvested in Washington. “It’s fascinating that the land we are farming today has been used for apples since nearly the beginning of apple farming in the state of Washington – a unique piece of history,” said Jake Robison. The Stennes family has been growing apples in Pateros, Washington, for more than 130 years, and it continues to modernize its planting, crop management, and harvesting practices. “We’re using self-propelled worker platforms for more efficient work, using robotic harvesting prototypes. Plus, we just purchased our first electric and fully autonomous tractors,” Mark Stennes told FAS. Furthermore, the Stennes orchards have several hundred acres of certified organic production methods and practice Integrated Pest Management to minimize pesticide usage. The Pacific Northwest microclimate has enabled growers to experiment with this specialty crop. Robison Orchards produce a wide assortment of apple varieties. “We see Granny Smith, Honey Crisp, Cosmic Crisp, and other varieties as excellent options of high-quality apples for foreign markets,” said Dave Robison. “We just got to get them there.” Both family farms view the recent trade win of India reopening its market to U.S. apples as beneficial for apple farmers across Washington. The Washington Apple Commission (WAC) and FAS India worked together to regain market access for American apple growers. After retaliatory tariffs were lifted last summer, $10.8 million of U.S. apples were exported to India. This had an almost immediate impact for American apple growers; the market in India opened at the beginning of apple-picking season up in the Pacific Northwest. “Since the tariffs were imposed, other apple origins such as Turkey, Poland, and Iran, took control of the Indian market share, dropping the market share for Washington growers from 53 percent to less than 1 percent in 4 years,” Mark shared with FAS after traveling to India with the WAC in December. “Now that the tariff has been removed, we’ve seen Washington gain back some of the market share that was lost. India is now our fourth largest export market.” USDA is committed to strengthening U.S. exports of apples and other specialty crops. In , specialty crop exports totaled $24.6 billion. FAS is part of the Specialty Crop Competitiveness Initiative (SCCI), which identifies foreign market access and improves domestic production and processing practices. Growing and exporting Washington apples is a prime example of the future-facing American agriculture USDA is working with farmers to achieve. An example of this is FAS’s recently announced Assisting Specialty Crops Exports (ASCE) initiative, which will help expand specialty crop exports. ASCE investments will enable the specialty crops industry to address the many non-tariff barriers it faces when opening or expanding export markets.

That is the approach that USDA has taken in its partnership with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) National Internship Program. As a current employee with the USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and a former HACU intern, I am glad to help continue this tradition. The HACU National Internship Program helps talented students in more than 400 colleges and universities gain valuable experience through paid internships at federal, private, and non-profit organizations. USDA has been a leading organization working with the program, hosting nearly HACU student interns since . I am part of the nearly 46% of former HACU interns who earned the opportunity to stay on board with the federal government after finishing my degree. I accepted the opportunity to continue my career at the USDA after two eventful summers interning with the AMS Commodity Procurement Program. During my tenure as an intern, I applied what I learned in my education and work experience. My time was spent helping develop and implement a new budget tracking system, overlooking a $2.6 million budget, developing budget procedures, and providing support to the daily branch operations. I also got a chance to help develop and implement a new invoicing process using the new Web Based Supply Chain Management System (WBSCM). The WBSCM is now used by AMS to make purchases for the National School Lunch Program and other federal nutrition assistance programs. As I look back on my experience as a HACU intern working at AMS, I really appreciate the way the program works with USDA and other organizations. After applying for the program through my school, the University of Puerto Rico at Aguadilla Campus, HACU placed me in an organization and position that matched my educational background. Working with the Commodity Procurement staff turned out to be a great fit for me. AMS Administrator Anne Alonzo with students at the HACU National Internship Program summer farewell event. Photo courtesy of Karen Comfort, AMS Special Assistant to the Administrator Looking to the future, I am confident that other HACU interns will have similar experiences at USDA and other partner organizations. I recently had the pleasure of attending the HACU National Internship Program summer farewell event where AMS Administrator Anne Alonzo inspired all. She gave the keynote address alongside Principal Deputy Under Secretary for the Department of Veterans Affairs Robert L. Jesse. It was great to hear Administrator Alonzo encourage the interns to be fearless as they carve out their career paths. She also stressed that they can achieve anything when they are passionate about the fields they choose. I am glad to hear that my office will be welcoming two talented HACU interns this fall. I am excited to be able to share with them my positive experiences and encourage them to tell others about the program¡¯s success with AMS and other USDA agencies. I know that the internship will place them on track for long, fruitful careers and that they will help others follow in their footsteps.

This whole-of-society strategy was designed to end hunger, improve nutrition and physical activity, and reduce diet-related diseases and disparities. And the Biden-Harris Administration remains focused on the Strategy. At a recent White House event, partners pledged nearly $1.7 billion in new commitments cultivated through the White House Challenge to End Hunger and Build Healthy Communities. Our efforts to advance food and nutrition security also integrates the Secretary¡¯s goal to make MyPlate a household name. As I explain in this video, MyPlate has been our national symbol for healthy eating for more than a decade. MyPlate.gov provides the guidance, tools, and resources that translate the - Dietary into actionable steps anyone can use. We are making our MyPlate materials more culturally, contextually, and linguistically responsive. And we work with more than rategic Partners across a variety of sectors to use common messages to communicate to consumers that it¡¯s never too early or too late to start eating healthy. We even launched a MyPlate Instagram, which is loaded with healthy eating tips and recipes. Agriculture Secretary Vilsack Celebrates Progress on Tackling Food and Nutrition Insecurity As we celebrate the power of nutritious food, we are proud of all we¡¯ve accomplished over the last two years, but we know we can do more and do better, together. Please explore our innovative tools and stay connected. We look forward to working together to help everyone in this country access nutrition education through MyPlate.

These strategies are based on a four-pillar approach, working across USDA's eight mission areas, as described in the provided content.","The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) employs several key strategies to advance food and nutrition security in the United States. These strategies include: 1. **Investing in Nutrition Programs**: The USDA administers various nutrition programs, such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children), and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR). These programs provide essential nutrients to vulnerable populations. 2. **Promoting Local and Sustainable Agriculture**: Through initiatives like the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food (KYF2) initiative, the USDA supports local food systems, organic farming, and sustainable agriculture practices. This approach enhances food access, improves quality, and reduces environmental impact. 3. **Improving Nutrition and Education**: The USDA promotes healthy eating habits through programs such as MyPlate, which provides a simple guide for consumers to make informed choices about their diets. Educational resources are also made available to help individuals understand the importance of nutrition and how to prepare nutritious meals. 4. **Supporting Small-Scale Farmers and Rural Development**: By providing grants, loans, and other forms of support through programs like the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program, the USDA helps small-scale farmers start or expand their operations. This initiative contributes to rural economic development and enhances food availability in these areas. 5. **Enhancing Food Safety and Inspection Services**: The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is responsible for ensuring that meat, poultry, and egg products are safe for consumption. This service conducts inspections at processing plants and monitors the movement of such products from farm to table, protecting public health. 6. **Fostering International Cooperation**: Through its Foreign Agricultural Service, the USDA collaborates with other countries on issues related to food security, nutrition, and agriculture. These partnerships can lead to knowledge sharing, technical assistance, and trade agreements that improve access to nutritious food both domestically and globally. 7. **Advancing Research and Development**: The USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supports research in various areas, including nutrition, agricultural productivity, and natural resource management. This research is crucial for developing innovative solutions to advance food and nutrition security. 8. **Addressing Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability**: Recognizing the interconnectedness of environmental sustainability and food security, the USDA has made efforts to reduce its own carbon footprint and promote environmentally friendly practices in agriculture. This includes initiatives like the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which helps protect natural resources while enhancing water quality and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In summary, the key strategies employed by the USDA to advance food and nutrition security include investing in nutrition programs, promoting sustainable agriculture, improving nutrition education, supporting small-scale farmers, enhancing food safety, fostering international cooperation, advancing research, and addressing climate change. These initiatives collectively work towards ensuring that all individuals have access to nutritious food and healthy diets.",1.8646070690669293e-155,0.1442125237191651,0.011428571428571429,0.07590132827324478,0.8244212865829468

Unique Varieties at the Headquarters Garden Written by UW-Madison Department of Horticulture and Seed to Kitchen Collaborative There are many interesting varieties around the Headquarters People¡¯s Garden, and each one has a unique story about where it came from. Visit the tabs below to learn more.  Plant Breeding 101  Have you ever been to the produce aisle and wondered how there got to be so many different types of lettuce? You might be surprised to learn that broccoli, kale, cabbage, and brussels sprouts all come from the exact same plant species. The incredible diversity of produce we have today has been developed over thousands of years, as plants evolved with and alongside humans. Early farmers and foragers would save seeds from plants that had desirable characteristics ¡ª like big fruits or big leaves, excellent flavor, or the ability to store over the winter¡ª and plant those seeds again in the spring, repeating the process season after season. Today, the science of selecting and reproducing certain plant traits is sometimes known as plant breeding.  There are several different ways of breeding plant varieties:  Open-pollinated varieties are those whose characteristics remain stable across generations. Older varieties, also known as heirlooms, are examples of open-pollinated varieties that can be saved in your garden from season to season. These varieties will continue to display the same characteristics of the previous generation. You can even select seeds with your own ideal traits!  Hybrid varieties are created by cross-pollinating two plants from different inbred lines. To develop hybrid varieties, breeders first take two populations of plants with desirable characteristics and reproduce them until the characteristics are stable. Then, they cross-pollinate the two populations to create an offspring that has the characteristics of both populations. Unlike seeds saved from open-pollinated varieties, seeds saved from hybrids often look very different from the parent plants, and instead display a wide diversity of traits that were present in the original populations.  Genetic engineering allows breeders to change individual traits in plant varieties by editing, inserting, or deleting gene sequences using different molecular techniques. There are not very many crops with genetically engineered varieties on the market today, although many are used in commercial farming of corn, soybeans, cotton, and sugar beets.  There are lots of interesting varieties around the People¡¯s Garden, and each one has a unique story about where it came from. Scan the QR code on the variety sign to learn more.  Beit Alfa Cucumber  Native to present day India and southern China, the cucumber has been a staple in Asian and Middle Eastern cuisines for thousands of years. Early cucumbers were likely quite bitter due to protective compounds in the cucumber skin which discourage insects and other pests from eating them. Over the years, plant breeders have selected varieties for less bitterness and better flavor, bringing to the table the cucumber we recognize today.  In the s, plant breeder Hanka Lazarson began working on an improved cucumber at the Beit Alfa kibbutz in northern Israel. She started with the local Damascus variety, which ¡°tasted good,¡± but produced cucumbers that were unevenly shaped and sized. So, she set out to develop a variety that was more uniform in appearance. As she worked to identify plants that made right-sized fruits, she realized that the increased uniformity also contributed to better flavor and texture. In a journal entry, she wrote, ¡°Our studies showed that if the cavity space of the cucumber is greater relative to the thickness of the shell. It has a juicier flavor and finer texture.¡±  The kibbutz knew they had a great cucumber on their hands, and in , Lazarson started distributing the seeds of the new variety in the Middle East, and quickly, around the world. Since then, hundreds of heirloom and hybrid varieties have counted Beit Alfa as an ancestor. Of the variety she¡¯d defined, she wrote: ¡°Productive variety, excellent taste and high yield: these indicate the type we called Beit Alfa Cucumber.¡±  Beit Alfa cucumbers are small, sweet, prolific, and can be harvested in short order, usually about 55 days from planting. Commonly referred to as a ¡°burpless¡± variety, Beit Alfas have thin skin, few seeds, and lower levels of cucurbitacin, the compound that made early cucumbers so bitter. They are also adaptable to many different growing environments, making them a popular choice among home gardeners.  Nativity Seeds, ¡°Damascus Cucumber To Beit Alfa Cucumber,¡±   Black Beauty Zucchini  The 20th century was a time of massive growth for the seed industry, which used snappy marketing to promote all types of new and interesting fruit and vegetable varieties. For all the pizzazz, it could be difficult for farmers and home gardeners to determine just which new varieties were actual improvements on the seeds they may have already had. Enter the All-America Selections, which rely on a panel of judges and controlled trials to determine the best new varieties on the market.  Black Beauty Zucchini is one such award winner, crowned in for being one of the earliest-ripening and longest-producing varieties of the dark-skinned zucchinis. Black Beauty was bred by John Scarchuk, a plant breeder at the University of Connecticut. Scarchuk received a degree in botany from UConn and began working for the University¡¯s Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station in . He served in the U.S. Army during World War II and returned to Storrs, where he spent the rest of his career. Each state has an Agricultural Experiment Station, designated and funded by the government to promote agricultural innovation across the country and to bring new and useful plant varieties to the American public. During his time at SAES, Scarchuk bred 7 All-America Selection winners, including Candlelight ornamental peppers, Dark Opal basil, and Table King squash. Of Black Beauty, the New York Times in wrote: ¡°This new variety with a heavier crop and longer season will bring added praise. Black Beauty can be picked when merely the size of a big dill pickle or when large as a cucumber. The flesh is tender, sweet, and buttery¡­ The more that is picked, the more that is produced.¡±  Hamilton, Robert. ¡°Tomorrow¡¯s Plants on 7 County Plots.¡± The New York Times,   Hastings, W. Ray. ¡°All-America Flowers Add Vegetables for ¡®57.¡± The New York Times,   P¨¢palo  While many of the fruits and vegetables we eat result from decades, and sometimes centuries, of breeding and selection, other foods on our plate are not that far removed from those we can find in the wild. Porophyllum ruderale is one of those species, a green herbaceous plant that grows extensively across the Americas, especially in disturbed soils.? Because the herb is used by many different cultures, it has many names, including summer cilantro, killi (from Quechua killki?a), cilantro boliviano, and yierba porosa, which refers in Spanish to the large pores on the leaves that release a strong smell when crushed. Perhaps its most common name in the United States, p¨¢palo, comes from the Nahuatl word for butterfly: papalotl. You may recognize other Nahuatl words in our culinary vocabulary, like xococatl (chocolate), tomatl, (tomato), ahuacatl (avocado), chian (chia), and even ch¨©llip¨­ctli (smoked chiles, or chipotle).  Indigenous Americans have used p¨¤palo for centuries as a flavorful, fresh addition to foods and as a medicinal herb, and its existence was an important part of the prehispanic diet. Many people still harvest p¨¢palo from wild sources or introduce it to certain locations, where it is left to establish itself. More recently, p¨¢palo also has been introduced as a cultivated crop on both small and large farms. Farmers who plant and tend p¨¢palo tend to favor plants that are shorter stature, less pungent, and have small, round, well-formed leaves, and the seeds from varieties that carry these characteristics are considered prime examples of the species. For this reason, cultivated p¨¢palo tends to be smaller and less fibrous than its wild relatives¨Ca reminder that humans and the foods we eat are constantly evolving with and alongside one another!

The Boss Pumpkin: An Interview with Plant Breeder Lindsay Wyatt  Anyone who has picked out a pumpkin for carving probably has ideas about what makes an excellent Jack O¡¯ Lantern: a perfect shape, dark orange coloring, maybe a nice, sturdy handle. When Johnny¡¯s Selected Seeds set out to develop a new Halloween pumpkin, plant breeder Lindsay Wyatt had her eye on many of those same things.  ¡°We take on yield and uniformity and color,¡± she said. ¡°The handles also have to be strong enough for someone to pick up a pumpkin by the handle and not break.¡± Importantly, she wanted to breed a pumpkin that was prolific enough for commercial growers to sell at the grocery store. ¡°But we also wanted a pumpkin that would be really nice and lovely for someone to grow in their garden for their kids to carve for Halloween,¡± she added.  At the Johnny¡¯s research farm in Maine, Wyatt and her team make over 70 new hybrid combinations every year, selecting the parent varieties that have desirable traits, and combining them via hand pollination. The next year, they grow the resulting hybrids to determine which combinations produce results that meet their goals. At harvest time, they invite the entire farm crew to walk the field and place a flag near their favorites, like an experimental pumpkin patch.  From the beginning, she knew one variety in particular would be a winner. ¡°It was so good the first year, we grew extra the next year to make sure it wasn¡¯t a fluke. It was almost hard to believe,¡± she said.  When it came time for the crew to place their votes, there were indeed a lot of flags clustered around one plot. The crew was so enthusiastic about the variety, they thought it should have a name that recognized it for being outstanding in the field. ¡°Someone basically said, we should name it The Boss,¡± she laughed. ¡°And we were all like, yeah, that¡¯s the name now.¡±  And where did The Boss get its good looks? Wyatt nods to the late University of New Hampshire professor Dr. Brent Loy, who developed over 80 squash, gourd, melon, and pumpkin varieties over his long career. ¡°One of those lines is a big part of The Boss¡¯ genetics,¡± she said. ¡°So this definitely would not be possible without public plant breeding.¡±  Herself an alumna of a public plant breeding program, Wyatt originally studied biology in college before learning about the Plant Breeding Department at Cornell University. Growing up, she had worked summers in her father¡¯s nursery and always wondered where all the different colored petunias came from, but it wasn¡¯t until she started looking for graduate school programs that she realized there was a dedicated field of study for creating new and interesting plant varieties.  As for how she made the leap from petunias to pumpkins, she chalked it up to serendipity and the projects available at Cornell and later, at Johnny¡¯s Seeds. ¡°And then,¡± she added, ¡°I find that once you start working with any crop, you start to love it.¡±  Berkeley Tie Dye Tomato: An Interview with Plant Breeder Brad Gates  If you¡¯re lucky enough to visit a Berkeley Tie Dye plant when it¡¯s fruiting, it may be obvious how this pink and yellow and green-striped tomato came by its name. In fact, according to tomato breeder Brad Gates, the exchange that dubbed this famous heirloom went down with no words at all.  ¡°I was selling tomatoes at the farmers¡¯ market in Oakland, about a mile from Berkeley, and a guy wearing a tie-dye shirt came over and held the tomato to the middle of his chest. He gave me this funny look like, ¡®Hey, it looks just like my shirt...¡¯ I didn¡¯t realize what a pivotal scene was playing out in those few seconds.¡±  Now, Berkeley Tie Dye is known around the world for its groovy looks and gourmet flavor. But when Gates started selling tomatoes, he didn¡¯t even know just how much diversity existed in the crop.  ¡°I started working on a Saturday for a friend doing the farmers market about 25 years ago,¡± he said. ¡°I was expecting to show up and have all these red tomatoes to sell. But there were all these yellow and pink and purple ones and people were asking questions about them. I had to force myself to step outside my comfort zone and start tasting them.¡±  The experience had so intrigued Gates that he decided to grow tomatoes full-time. He started with dozens of heirloom varieties to find the tomatoes that grew well, tasted good, and produced prolifically. ¡°We would get left with a bunch of them at the farmers market and others would sell out,¡± he said. Naturally, he began saving seeds from the varieties that did well.  ¡°With heirloom varieties, you can save your own seeds,¡± he said. And because tomatoes are self-pollinating, you¡¯ll often get a similar tomato year after year. ¡°But once in a great while, you¡¯ll get a natural cross-pollination, and a couple of plants show up that aren¡¯t what they¡¯re supposed to be.¡± As he was growing thousands and thousands of plants for the market, Gates took some of the new crosses he was seeing and began to grow them out, too. ¡°And that was how I got into breeding tomatoes,¡± he said.  Fortunately for the world he did, because he was just about ready to hang up his farmer¡¯s hat and get a different job. But as he saw people¡¯s reactions to the new varieties he was breeding, he decided to stick with it. ¡°I had the thought, ¡®At one point, I¡¯m the only person in the world holding Berkeley Tie Dye.¡¯ And every restaurant I go to, everyone says, ¡®Wow, these tomatoes are amazing. So I was thinking, ¡®Well, the world shouldn¡¯t be without this.¡¯¡±  Gates sells mostly seeds and seedlings now, and you can find varieties he¡¯s bred in farms and gardens from sea level to seven thousand feet. In fact, he says, when someone grows open-pollinated seeds and saves them from year-to-year, they¡¯re creating adaptation to challenging environments.  The diversity preserved in the process will ensure that people can feed themselves in all these different places, he added. ¡°I¡¯ve had people tell me that one of my varieties was the last producing tomato plant in a summer in Tucson, and I¡¯ve had people have good results growing close to the San Francisco Bay, where it¡¯s always cool and foggy.¡±  ¡°Having diverse genetics and being able to select again and again in your area, it¡¯s one of the best things for people who want to grow a garden,¡± he said. ¡°It doesn¡¯t take a white coat and a biology degree. Even a home gardener can grow something unknown or something special that you can¡¯t get at the store.¡±  All it takes, according to Gates, ¡°is common sense and determination to grow a decent number of plants for a decent number of years.¡±","This article features two plant breeders, Dr. Brent Loy and Brad Gates, who have developed new varieties of squash, gourd, melon, and pumpkin, as well as tomatoes.

"FNS Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Mar 10,  This past February, I attended the Urban School Food Alliance winter meeting in Los Angeles, California, which included Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) sessions focused on child nutrition programs. Participants, which included food service directors from around the country, had the opportunity to ask questions about the child nutrition programs they administer, including the recent updates. Engaging with program leaders and seeing what child nutrition programs look like ¡®on the ground¡¯ is important to us. In addition to learning from the group, the meeting was a reminder of the many partners we have that share a common goal of continuing to elevate the role that healthy meals play in schools and for our children¡¯s future. We spent a day at the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) observing their warehouse and kitchen operations, and meeting with school officials. We also got a taste of the delicious meals LAUSD prepares for students. California was one of the first states to implement a statewide Universal Meals Program for all school children after the expiration of federal waivers during COVID, which allowed states to serve school meals at no cost to students. I commend the California state legislature and all state, county, and local anti-hunger advocates that helped to make this happen. As I travel around the country and visit sites that administer FNS food assistance programs and meet nutrition security advocates that share this passion, I am awed by the tremendous amount of work, dedication, and pride exhibited every day so that children in our communities have healthy, nutritious meals.

Here are some possible effects: **Positive Implications:** 1. **Increased demand for local produce**: With more meals being served in schools, there will be a greater demand for locally sourced fruits and vegetables, potentially benefiting local farmers and reducing reliance on industrial agriculture. 2. **Job creation and economic growth**: The UMP could create new job opportunities in the food industry, such as farming, processing, and distribution, contributing to local economic growth. 3. **Improved nutrition and health outcomes**: Providing healthy meals in schools can lead to improved nutrition and health outcomes among children, which may reduce healthcare costs and improve overall community well-being. **Negative Implications:** 1. **Strain on local food infrastructure**: Implementing a UMP could put pressure on local food systems, particularly if the program requires significant increases in produce procurement, processing, and distribution. 2. **Price increases for farmers**: Farmers may need to increase production to meet the demand from schools, potentially leading to price pressures and decreased profitability for some producers. 3. **Dependence on industrial agriculture**: If not managed carefully, the UMP could perpetuate or even amplify existing issues in local food systems, such as over-reliance on industrial agriculture, long-distance transportation, and non-local supply chains. **Mitigating Strategies:** 1. **Developing partnerships with local farmers**: Schools and the state government can establish relationships with local farmers to ensure a steady supply of fresh produce, potentially promoting more sustainable agricultural practices. 2. **Supporting value-added processing**: Investing in local food processing and packaging facilities could help distribute excess produce among schools and other institutions, reducing waste and increasing economic benefits. 3. **Implementing regional purchasing**: The state government can encourage regional purchasing by establishing partnerships with nearby states or regions to access diverse local food sources, promoting more robust regional food systems. **Conclusion:** While implementing a statewide Universal Meals Program for all school children may have some challenges on the local food system, careful planning and strategic partnerships can help mitigate these effects. By prioritizing local sourcing, supporting small-scale farmers, and investing in value-added processing, policymakers can create a more equitable, sustainable, and healthy food system that benefits schools, communities, and the environment as a whole.",0.04301904499067801,0.325678496868476,0.10901467505241089,0.18789144050104384,0.8567148447036743
"New Resource Toolkit Increases Consumer Understanding of the USDA Organic Label  Organic is a growing sector, with domestic sales of organic products topping $69.7 billion in .

Here's a breakdown of the potential effects: 1. **Confusion and mistrust**: Consumers who don't fully comprehend what the USDA Organic Label means may be more likely to doubt the authenticity or value of organic products, leading them to question whether they are truly ""better"" or worth the premium price. 2. **Difficulty in making informed decisions**: Without a clear understanding of the label, consumers might struggle to make informed choices about which products to purchase and from which brands, potentially leading to frustration and disengagement with the market. 3. **Overreliance on marketing claims**: Consumers who don't grasp the nuances of the USDA Organic Label may rely heavily on marketing claims made by manufacturers, rather than evaluating the product's actual organic content or production processes. This can lead to a misinformed purchasing process. 4. **Perception of organic as a ""marketing gimmick""**: If consumers perceive the USDA Organic Label as merely a marketing tool, they might view organic products with skepticism, perceiving them as more expensive and less valuable than non-organic alternatives. 5. **Reduced demand for organic products**: Lack of understanding about the USDA Organic Label can result in reduced consumer interest in purchasing organic products, ultimately affecting sales and market growth. 6. **Inequitable market competition**: The absence of clear labeling standards can create uneven playing fields between manufacturers, making it difficult for consumers to compare and contrast different products and brands. To mitigate these effects, educating consumers about the USDA Organic Label is essential. This education should include: * Clearly explaining the meaning and requirements of the label * Highlighting the differences between various organic certifications (e.g., USDA Organic, Non-GMO Project Verified) * Providing resources for consumers to research and learn more about organic products and labeling * Encouraging manufacturers to clearly communicate their production processes and product contents through transparent marketing practices By bridging this knowledge gap, consumers will be empowered to make informed purchasing decisions, ultimately driving demand for authentic organic products and creating a more equitable market.",0.04126323032473034,0.16494845360824742,0.09844559585492228,0.1443298969072165,0.8647879958152771
"Posted by the Food and Nutrition Service's Western Regional Office in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 02,  The first week of August, farmers markets across the nation celebrate National Farmers Market Week, highlighting their role in supporting healthy communities, food systems and stimulating local economies. Throughout the pandemic, farmers markets and USDA partners worked hard to remain safe, accessible outlets for healthy food, as well as a vital marketing outlet for small and mid-sized farmers. Farmers markets put rigorous safety plans in place and the Ecology Center fought to ensure that farmers markets were classified as essential businesses while sharing best practices around pandemic response with the broader farmers market community. More than 4,700 farmers markets and direct marketing farmers currently participate in SNAP, and in California, nearly 250 markets provided Market Match incentives to customers shopping with SNAP/EBT, Pandemic EBT, or Disaster EBT.

"Pack It Safe, Pack It Smart: Back-to-School Lunchbox Packing Essentials  You can¡¯t help but see school supplies everywhere if you¡¯ve been shopping during the last few weeks. Alongside purchasing new backpacks and notebooks, it¡¯s essential to also stock up on lunchbox essentials that will keep your child¡¯s homemade lunches safe: insulated soft-sided lunch bags, two cold sources and insulated containers for hot foods.  Beverly Lopez, Communications Program Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), USDA  Posted in  Health and Safety  Jul 25,   Respond to this story",What is the most effective method to keep homemade lunches at a safe temperature during transport to school?,Use an insulated soft-sided lunch bag with two cold sources and insulated containers for hot foods.,"The most effective method to keep homemade lunches at a safe temperature during transport to school is by using an insulated lunch box with an ice pack. This combination provides optimal temperature control, keeping perishable foods such as dairy products, meats, and fruits/vegetables within the recommended 40°F (4°C) or below. Here's why it works: 1. **Insulated Lunch Box**: A well-insulated lunch box helps to maintain a consistent temperature by minimizing heat exchange between the inside and outside environments. Look for boxes with thick foam insulation, vacuum-sealed construction, and a tight-fitting lid. 2. **Ice Pack**: An ice pack placed in the lunch box serves as an additional measure to keep foods cool. Ice packs can be frozen ahead of time and then used during transport. They help in maintaining a low temperature within the lunch box by absorbing heat from inside the box and transferring it away through the cold mass. 3. **Combination**: The combination of an insulated lunch box and an ice pack is particularly effective for keeping homemade lunches at a safe temperature. This setup prevents bacterial growth that can occur when perishable foods are kept at temperatures above 40°F (4°C) for more than two hours. In addition to using an insulated lunch box with an ice pack, there are a few more tips to keep in mind: - **Pack foods wisely**: Place the most temperature-sensitive items closest to the cold source. If you have both hot and cold items, consider using separate compartments or boxes. - **Freeze water bottles**: Freezing water bottles can be used as additional cold sources within the lunch box. - **Keep the lunch box out of direct sunlight**: Direct sunlight can cause the contents of your lunch box to heat up quickly, reducing the effectiveness of the ice pack and insulation. By using an insulated lunch box with an ice pack and following these tips, you can ensure that homemade lunches stay safe and at a suitable temperature during transport.",1.7906167621403377e-155,0.07428571428571429,0.02298850574712644,0.05714285714285714,0.8312722444534302

"Acting Deputy Chief, Forest Service Research and Development in  Forestry  Oct 04,  Access to high-quality water will be a defining feature of the 21st century. Record heat waves and drought are not only leading to more frequent and intense wildfires but are also putting one of life¡¯s most valuable resources at risk: the water we drink. A new Forest Service research report describes how extensively public drinking water systems rely on national forests and grasslands. Water use per person has been declining for decades; however, a variety of factors such as population growth, food production and ecosystem conditions under a changing climate are contributing to overall greater demand for water ¨C especially in certain parts of the country. In the West, national forests and grasslands supply drinking water to almost 90% of the people served by public water systems. Some western cities, like Aspen, Colorado, and Portland, Oregon, are more than 90% dependent on national forests alone for their drinking water. The story is similar in the eastern U.S., though most of this water is supplied by private forests. Still, more than a century of research has demonstrated that forested lands provide the cleanest and most stable water supply compared to other lands. Within the lower 48 states, more than 99% of people who rely on public drinking water receive some from forested lands. This report is the first of its kind to measure how individual national forests and grasslands contribute to surface drinking water supplies while accounting for networks of pipelines and canals that divert water from the source to areas of high need, also known as ¡°inter-basin water transfers.¡± These inter-basin transfers are incredibly important sources of drinking water, especially in the West, where cities like Los Angeles receive more than two-thirds of their water from forested lands in California and Colorado. By showing where our drinking water comes from at a fine scale, this report supports USDA¡¯s Wildfire Crisis Strategy, and work supported by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. It helps land managers prioritize forests and watersheds for hazardous fuels reduction, watershed management, and restoration treatments that protect people, communities and resources across the country.

However, it can be difficult to find an appropriate facility to house bears. ¡°This is a win-win for the Division and the NWRC,¡± said Dr. John Shivik, mammals program coordinator for the Division. ¡°They have a great facility in Millville and the people there are well qualified to work with bears. Note only will the bears get a second chance, but hopefully we can also learn something about bear behavior.¡± Starting with these two bears, NWRC researchers hope to study whether human contact at a young age makes bears more likely to become problem animals when they¡¯re older.? The cubs will spend the summer at the facility fattening up and preparing for release back into the wild this fall. In the meantime, the amount of human contact they experience at the facility will be closely monitored. ¡°Once released, we¡¯ll be able to follow these and any future rehab bears kept at the facility to see how their experiences here may influence future interactions with people,¡± notes Dr. Julie Young, NWRC¡¯s Utah field station leader.? ¡°This will help us develop better management strategies for bears.¡± WS¡¯ NWRC is the only Federal research organization devoted exclusively to resolving conflicts between people and wildlife through the development of effective, selective, and socially responsible methods, tools, and techniques. Experts at NWRC¡¯s Utah field station focus on the development of new management tools to reduce conflicts with predators, including coyotes, wolves, bear, and mountain lion.? In addition to the two black bear cubs, the field station currently houses approximately 100 coyotes for study. Employees have experience working with a variety of captive animals including bears.

(U.S. Forest Service/ Mona Spargo) While many people look forward to fall for football rivalries and tailgate parties, others enjoy a different pastime ¡ª foraging for fall¡¯s crop of fungi. In Alaska, the season¡¯s fungi festivals will find enthusiasts lined up for hikes into the woods to search for lichens and forage for mushrooms. In September, the Wrangell Ranger District on the Tongass National Forest hosted a two-day event near the Rainbow Falls Trail. Karen Dillman, the forest¡¯s ecologist, and Kate Mohatt, an ecologist from the Chugach National Forest, shared a variety of tips and information on fungi with locals and visitors including information profiled in the video ¡°The Mushroom Maven of the Chugach National Forest.¡± What are the differences between edible and poisonous mushrooms? The pair described how to look for telling of the mushrooms after they are cut open, as well as the distinctive features of the caps and ridges. The Chugach National Forest sponsors two annual mushroom festivals to celebrate the variety of fungal species that grow in the rainy woods of south-central Alaska. Mushrooms with names like ¡°chicken in the woods¡± are popular with attendees to the Girdwood Fungus Fair on the Glacier Ranger District in August, and the Cordova Fungus Festival on the Cordova Ranger District in September. During the Girdwood festival, Mohatt addressed the competiveness of mushroom hunters and their desire to keep their best hunting spots secret. She also described how to find those special mushrooms that can be worked into culinary masterpieces and how to avoid those that can cause gastrointestinal distress ¨C or worse. The festival included mushroom hikes and dye-making classes. A Fungus Fair Formal was held in the Alyeska Resort Ballroom with a five-course gourmet meal highlighting and featuring different ways of using and enjoying mushrooms. The Cordova Ranger District participated in daily guided forays into the woods, and staffed mushroom identification tables to help mushroom hunters identify different species. Mohatt was featured in the video, I Am a Mushroom Hunter, as part of a new statewide series Indie Alaska by Alaska Public Media/PBS. Mohatt and Dillman also were part of creating Mushrooms of the National Forests in Alaska, a free, online brochure created by the Forest Service.

Individuals can identify edible versus poisonous species by observing distinctive features such as color, shape, size, cap texture, and gills or pores on the underside of the cap; looking for telltale signs when cut open, like a ring or annulus on the stem; and understanding the habitat and time-of-year preferences for specific types.","**Potential Risks and Hazards of Foraging for Wild Mushrooms** Foraging for wild mushrooms in forests can be a rewarding experience, but it also carries several risks and hazards that should not be taken lightly. Some of the potential dangers associated with mushroom foraging include: 1. **Poisoning**: Eating poisonous mushrooms can cause serious health problems, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headaches, and even death. 2. **Misidentification**: Incorrectly identifying a mushroom as edible when it is actually poisonous can lead to poisoning. 3. **Allergic Reactions**: Some people may be allergic to certain types of mushrooms, which can cause anaphylaxis or other severe reactions. 4. **Insect Bites and Stings**: Insects like bees, wasps, and hornets may be present in the forest, posing a risk to foragers. 5. **Slippery Trails and Terrain**: Forest trails can be slippery, especially after rain or snowfall, increasing the risk of falls and injuries. 6. **Weather-Related Hazards**: Severe weather conditions like thunderstorms, lightning, or extreme temperatures can make it difficult or even dangerous to navigate the forest. **Identifying Edible vs. Poisonous Species** To minimize risks, individuals should take steps to correctly identify wild mushrooms as edible or poisonous. Here are some general guidelines: 1. **Consult a Mushroom Guidebook**: Use reputable field guides that provide detailed descriptions and illustrations of various mushroom species. 2. **Seek Expert Guidance**: Consult with experienced mushroom foragers or mycologists (mushroom experts) who can provide guidance on identification and safe harvesting practices. 3. **Observe Color, Shape, Size, and Habitat**: Pay attention to the color, shape, size, and habitat of the mushroom to narrow down possible species. 4. **Examine Spores, Gills, or Pores**: Study the mushroom's spore-producing structures (e.g., gills or pores) under magnification to help determine its identity. 5. **Be Cautious with Unfamiliar Species**: If you're unsure about a mushroom's edibility, err on the side of caution and avoid eating it. **Additional Tips** 1. **Only Harvest Mushrooms in Abundance**: Avoid over-harvesting mushrooms, as this can harm the ecosystem. 2. **Respect Private Property and Regulations**: Always obtain permission to forage on private property or follow local regulations regarding public lands. 3. **Be Mindful of Your Surroundings**: Pay attention to your environment, including weather conditions, terrain, and potential hazards like insects, animals, or other forest users. Remember, mushroom identification requires expertise, patience, and caution.

Teresa Haugh, Alaska Region, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Aug 27,   Respond to this story",What are some common characteristics shared among sockeye salmon and agricultural crops that require water for growth?,"Both sockeye salmon and agricultural crops need water to grow, with sockeye salmon returning to Steep Creek near the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center in Juneau, Alaska to spawn during mid-July through August.","After considering the two entities - sockeye salmon and agricultural crops, I've identified some common characteristics they share: 1. **Water Dependence**: Both sockeye salmon (a species of fish) and agricultural crops require access to water for their growth and development. Sockeye salmon need freshwater rivers or lakes to spawn, migrate, and grow, while many agricultural crops rely on irrigation systems or rainfall to thrive. 2. **Seasonal Variability**: Both have seasonal cycles that impact their growth patterns. For sockeye salmon, this means migration and spawning in the summer and early fall, while for agricultural crops, it's about planting, growing, and harvesting during specific seasons (e.g., spring, summer, or autumn). 3. **Nutrient Cycle Dependency**: Sockeye salmon rely on nutrient-rich waters to grow, which often come from decomposed organic matter, such as algae or plankton. Similarly, many agricultural crops depend on nutrient-rich soil for their growth and productivity. 4. **Vulnerability to Water Quality and Quantity Changes**: Both sockeye salmon and agricultural crops are sensitive to changes in water quality (e.g., temperature, pH, salinity) and quantity (e.g., droughts or floods). This can have significant impacts on their populations, yields, or even survival. 5. **Interconnectedness with Ecosystems**: As living organisms, both sockeye salmon and agricultural crops interact with and influence the surrounding ecosystems in various ways.

By reducing these pollutants, farmers can expect improved crop growth, higher yields, and better fruit and vegetable quality. 2. **Improved Soil Quality**: Air pollution can acidify soils, making them less productive. Lower levels of air pollutants like SO2 and NOx will help maintain soil pH balance, improve nutrient cycling, and reduce the need for fertilizers. 3. **Reduced Fertilizer Use**: Cleaner air reduces the leaching of nitrogen from soil, minimizing fertilizer overuse. This leads to lower costs for farmers, reduced environmental impacts (like water pollution), and improved crop quality. 4. **Increased Nutrient Uptake**: Cleaner air promotes healthy plant growth by increasing nutrient uptake, leading to more robust and resilient crops. 5. **Enhanced Farm Efficiency**: Improved agricultural productivity leads to increased farm efficiency, allowing farmers to produce more with fewer resources, reducing waste, and enhancing overall sustainability. 6. **Better Pest Management**: Reduced air pollution can lead to healthier ecosystems, making it easier for farmers to manage pests and diseases naturally, without relying on chemical pesticides or fungicides. 7. **Increased Water Availability**: By protecting soil health and water quality, reduced air pollution ensures that more rainwater is absorbed into the soil instead of being lost as runoff, improving irrigation efficiency and crop growth. By reducing air pollutants, governments and agricultural stakeholders can create a more favorable environment for crops to grow, leading to increased productivity, improved resource management, and enhanced sustainability in agriculture.",0.01069358182756748,0.08873720136518772,0.041237113402061855,0.0750853242320819,0.8350566029548645

This program uses trading mechanisms to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in the watershed.","There are several innovative strategies being implemented to improve water quality on a large scale. Some of these strategies include: 1. **Watershed Management**: This involves managing watersheds as a single unit, considering the entire catchment area, including rivers, lakes, and groundwater. It helps to reduce pollution by identifying and mitigating sources of contamination. 2. **Green Infrastructure**: Incorporating green spaces like parks, gardens, and rooftop gardens into urban planning can help absorb stormwater runoff, filter out pollutants, and maintain water quality. 3. **Wastewater Treatment Upgrades**: Investing in modern wastewater treatment technologies and practices is crucial for removing contaminants from treated effluent before it's released back into rivers or the ocean. Techniques like membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are being used to improve efficiency. 4. **Rainwater Harvesting**: Collecting and reusing rainwater can significantly reduce stormwater runoff, which often carries pollutants into waterways. This approach encourages sustainable practices and reduces pressure on municipal water supplies. 5. **Porous Pavement and Green Roofs**: These technologies allow rainwater to percolate through the ground or be retained locally rather than running off into waterways, reducing stormwater pollution and urban flooding risks. 6. **Wetland Restoration and Creation**: Restoring wetlands or creating artificial ones can help in removing pollutants from water bodies as they act as natural filters for water entering them. 7. **Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs)**: These technologies use oxidants such as ozone, hydrogen peroxide, or UV radiation to break down recalcitrant contaminants that conventional wastewater treatment processes cannot handle effectively. 8. **Water Recycling and Reuse**: Implementing systems to recycle and reuse water can significantly reduce the demand on potable water sources while decreasing the volume of wastewater needing treatment, thus improving overall water quality management. 9. **Monitoring and Enforcement Technologies**: Utilizing advanced sensors and monitoring systems along with more stringent regulations and enforcement mechanisms are essential for tracking pollution sources and enforcing compliance among polluters. 10. **Public Awareness and Education**: Educating communities about the importance of clean water practices and involving them in decision-making processes can foster a culture of sustainability, encouraging collective efforts to protect water resources. Implementing these strategies requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving government agencies, private sector entities, community organizations, and citizens working together towards common goals.",0.027696155729244817,0.169811320754717,0.05687203791469194,0.1179245283018868,0.8278589248657227

"Administrator, Farm Service Agency in  Conservation  Mar 02,  FSA Administrator Val Dolcini speaks at the National Pheasant Fest and Quail Classic. I recently attended the National Pheasant Fest and Quail Classic in Des Moines, Iowa, where I met with sportsmen, farmers, young people, wildlife biologists and others who are committed to strengthening wildlife habitat throughout America. It was exciting to see firsthand the passion for the native and restored grasslands and woodlands that typify the rural American landscape. I had the honor of speaking to the group, where I highlighted the 30th anniversary of USDA¡¯s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).? CRP, one of the largest private lands conservation programs in the nation, is designed to reduce soil erosion, improve water and air quality, and provide habitat for wildlife. Interested landowners can establish long-term USDA-approved grasses or trees in exchange for USDA helping with the cost of establishing the plants and providing annual payments for 10 to 15 years. The covers along fields, streams and rivers prevent soil and nutrients from washing into waterways, reduce soil erosion that may otherwise contribute to poor air and water quality, and provide valuable habitat for wildlife. Since its enactment in , CRP has prevented more than 8 billion tons of soil from eroding, protected more than 170,000 stream miles with riparian and grass buffers, and provided more than 100,000 acres of bottomland hardwood trees and nearly 300,000 acres of flood-plain wetlands.? It has also created more than 250,000 acres each for duck nesting habitat and upland bird habitat. Although this is a federal program, this 30-year record of accomplishment was not achieved by USDA alone.? Partnerships with state, local, and nongovernmental organizations are the foundation upon which these important achievements have been built. Howard Vincent, Pheasant Forever and Quail Forever¡¯s President and Chief Executive Officer (left) and FSA Administrator Val Dolcini sign an agreement establishing a framework of cooperation between Pheasants Forever and USDA agencies, including Farm Service Agency and Natural Resources Conservation Service, to maintain and enhance the productivity of pheasant, quail, and other wildlife habitats on private and public lands. That¡¯s why I joined Howard Vincent, Pheasant Forever and Quail Forever¡¯s President and Chief Executive Officer, in signing an agreement to continue the longtime framework of cooperation between Pheasants Forever and USDA agencies, including the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), to maintain and enhance pheasant, quail, and other wildlife habitat on private and public lands.? These joint efforts include habitat conservation and restoration, scientific assistance, educational materials, and research collaboration. In addition, this five-year commitment helps support Pheasants Forever¡¯s Farm Bill biologist program at local USDA offices nationwide. Given the strong relationships Pheasants Forever has with farmers and ranchers across the country, including their significant contribution toward the successful sage grouse and lesser prairie chicken initiatives launched by USDA, we are pleased to renew our partnership.

"KY Rural Development, Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  Aug 22,   Dozens of people gathered in Monticello, Ky., on Wednesday to break ground on a project in which five local families began the process of building their own homes. Great partnerships can lead to great projects ¨C and this event highlighted several strategic partners that worked incredibly hard to make it happen, including USDA Rural Development, Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation, Southern Tier Housing Corporation, the Federation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises (FAHE) and the families of Pedro and Omaira Ruiz, Mary and Silvino Castillo, Yvonne Hernandez, Brenda McGuire and Patsy Perdue. Five families will become homeowners thanks to Rural Development¡¯s Mutual Self-Help and 502 Direct Loan programs. The families, from left, are Yvonne Hernandez, Pedro and Omaira Ruiz, Mary and Silvino Castillo, Brenda McGuire and Patsy Perdue. This project began several years ago when Kentucky Highlands received a Rural Development Section 523 Mutual Self Help Housing grant for $250,000 in April . That money was designated for technical assistance to help 12 families that wanted to help build new homes. The selected families also were approved for Rural Development 502 Direct Loan funds, in addition to forgivable loans from FAHE, to pay for the cost of building the homes. The self-help housing ¡°sweat equity¡± concept is not new. Organized self-help housing started with the Quakers a number of years ago. This became a tradition of rural people, who had the determination and help of neighbors, to construct barns, homes and schools that became American¡¯s rural communities. The Section 523 program is used primarily to help very low and low-income households build their own homes and is targeted to families who are unable to buy clean, safe housing through conventional methods. Families participating in a mutual self-help project perform approximately 65 percent of the construction labor on each other¡¯s homes under qualified supervision, and the reduced labor costs make it easier for the families to own a home. Another great advantage of this program is that mortgage payments can be ¡°rolled into¡± the loan for families who can¡¯t afford to make them while the house is being built.

"Administrator, Farm Service Agency in  Conservation  May 01,   Farmers and ranchers were among the first to practice conservation. It¡¯s not surprising when you think about it. They¡¯ve always understood the importance of caring for our land and water, and they depend on our natural resources for their livelihoods. They¡¯re at the forefront of our country¡¯s efforts to keep the land healthy, productive and resilient. And we¡¯re proud to partner with them in that effort. This year, we¡¯re celebrating two more conservation milestones: the 30th anniversary of USDA¡¯s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), one of the largest private lands conservation programs in the nation; and registering the 1 millionth acre in CRP¡¯s State Acres for Wildlife Enhancement (SAFE) initiative. The 1 millionth acre is part of the Coteau-Drift SAFE, located in North Dakota. The state has a total of four SAFE projects, covering over 122,000 acres.? The projects are helping a wide range of species ¨C from pheasants, grouse, prairie-chicken, grey partridge, deer and other game animals ¨C flourish and grow. The Coteau-Drift SAFE is designed to register more than 69,000 acres in the state¡¯s Missouri Plateau and Drift Prairie region to support waterfowl, shorebirds and terrestrial birds.? Through SAFE, state agencies, nonprofit conservation organizations, and even local groups work together to identify at-risk wildlife, and to submit proposals to USDA for review.? Once approved, agricultural producers within an approved SAFE area can voluntarily enroll acres in 10 to 15 year contracts. In exchange, USDA provides annual rental payments, incentives, and cost-share assistance for establishing plant species that attract wildlife. There are now 98 SAFE habitat partnerships in 37 states and Puerto Rico. And the numbers don¡¯t end there. Each year, through CRP programs, we work with hundreds of thousands of farmers and ranchers to implement voluntary conservation practices on their operations. CRP, one of the largest private lands conservation programs in the nation, provides significant economic and environmental benefits to hundreds of rural communities.

"Farm Service Agency Administrator in  Conservation  Nov 13,  Sample FSA County Committee election ballot. This is a great time of the year for the Farm Service Agency (FSA), not just because of another successful American harvest, but because of the opportunity for agricultural communities throughout the country to vote for officials to represent them on FSA County Committees. In my first year as FSA Administrator, I¡¯ve traveled to 32 states and visited with farmers and ranchers from California to Maine. I know firsthand the impact of successfully delivered farm programs in rural communities all across this great nation. Working with county committee members while serving as FSA state executive director for California and now as Administrator, I have a deep appreciation for the essential role these farmer-elected committees play in connecting FSA with the needs of local producers. County committees have been making a difference for producers for more than eight decades.? They were originally established back in to ensure that local producers could provide input to the federal programs that offered financial assistance to farmers.? Today, nearly 7,700 FSA county committee members serve nationwide by applying their knowledge and judgment to make important decisions on commodity support programs, conservation programs, indemnity and disaster programs, emergency programs and eligibility.? Each county committee has three to 11 elected members who serve three-year terms and one-third of county committee seats are up for election each year. Producers elected to committees have always played a vital role in local agricultural decisions. They are essential to the daily operation of nearly 2,200 offices across the country. It is a valued partnership that helps us better understand the needs of the farmers and ranchers we serve. That is why I am encouraging all eligible producers to vote during this year¡¯s county committee elections. Through your vote, you are selecting someone from your county who will provide critical local input on FSA programs.? The elections began Nov. 9, with the mailing of ballots to all eligible producers. Ballots must be completed and returned to the county office or postmarked by Dec. 7 to be counted. Voters who did not receive a ballot this week can pick one up at their local FSA office. To learn more, visit www.fsa.usda.gov/elections.? Make your vote count!  Category/Topic:  Conservation  Tags:  Farm Service Agency County Committee  FSA  Producers  Val Dolcini",What specific steps can a producer take to ensure their voice is represented in local agricultural decisions through the Farm Service Agency's county committee elections?,* Vote during this year's county committee elections by completing and returning their ballot to the county office or postmarking it by Dec. 7. * Pick up a ballot at their local FSA office if they did not receive one in the mail. * Visit www.fsa.usda.gov/elections for more information about the election process.,"To ensure their voice is represented in local agricultural decisions through the Farm Service Agency's (FSA) county committee elections, producers can take the following specific steps: 1. **Verify Eligibility**: Producers must meet the eligibility requirements set by the FSA to participate in the county committee elections. These requirements typically include being a producer of an agricultural commodity, owning or operating land in the county, and meeting certain financial criteria. 2. **Get Involved Early**: Familiarize yourself with the election process, timelines, and requirements well in advance. This includes understanding the different types of producers (farmers, ranchers, landowners, etc.) who are eligible to vote and participate. 3. **Form a Producer Group**: Organize or join other local producers to form a group that can collectively advocate for their interests. This collaborative approach can help amplify their voice and increase their influence in the decision-making process. 4. **Build Relationships with Local FSA Staff**: Develop strong relationships with the FSA staff at the county office. They often provide valuable insights into the election process, and building these connections can facilitate communication between producers and the committee. 5. **Attend County Meetings and Hearings**: Regularly attend county meetings, hearings, and other events where FSA-related topics are discussed. This helps producers stay informed about local issues, network with others, and demonstrate their interest in participating in decision-making processes. 6. **Seek Guidance from Local Extension Services or Agricultural Organizations**: Reach out to local extension services (e.g., Cooperative Extension) or agricultural organizations for guidance on the election process, as well as resources and support specific to producer representation. 7. **Identify Strong Candidates**: Identify qualified candidates who share the values and goals of the local agricultural community. These individuals should be knowledgeable about local issues, have experience working with farmers and ranchers, and demonstrate a commitment to representing their constituents' interests. 8. **Campaign and Promote Your Candidate**: Once you've identified strong candidates, help promote them through various channels (e.g., social media, direct mail, in-person conversations). This can involve highlighting their qualifications, experience, and commitment to serving the community's agricultural interests. 9. **Voting and Participation**: Make sure to cast your vote in county committee elections and participate in decision-making processes when possible. Encourage other eligible producers to do the same, as collective participation enhances the group's influence and ensures their voices are heard. 10. **Follow Up and Monitor Progress**: After the election, follow up with newly elected committee members to ensure they are aware of your concerns and interests. Regularly monitor the committee's decisions and actions to guarantee that their representation aligns with the values and goals of local agricultural producers. By taking these specific steps, producers can increase their chances of having a voice in local agricultural decisions through FSA county committee elections.",4.172840054708368e-79,0.1310211946050096,0.03481624758220503,0.08477842003853564,0.8152403831481934

As rural communities search for new and viable economic approaches, it is becoming clear that one core component of many successful rural communities is the presence of vibrant arts and cultural opportunities. Last month I had the opportunity to speak about rural arts initiatives and how USDA Rural Development is engaged with local communities and private foundations to provide awareness of our infrastructure programs and how they can assist in supporting local cultural strategies. At the Americans for the Arts annual meeting I had the honor of representing USDA on two panels where our Rural Development programs were part of the mix.? The sessions included discussion of ArtPlace, a consortium of national and regional foundations, and their efforts to support rural communities. Projects in Lanesboro, Minnesota and Ajo, Arizona are recent ArtPlace grantees, and we had the opportunity to explore ways in which USDA¡¯s infrastructure programs might be able to leverage this new boost of philanthropic support as these communities work to demonstrate how cultural development is an essential ingredient for rural communities in the next generation. One recent example demonstrating strategic alignment between foundations and USDA is an artist housing project in downtown Minot, North Dakota.?? The Magic City Lofts received an ArtPlace grant in to help complete construction of the building.? And this June, one of the new tenants in the building, the Turtle Mountain Tribal Arts Association received a $97,000 USDA Rural Business Enterprise Grant for technical assistance associated with establishing a storefront gallery for tribal artists in the new building. The conference also allowed USDA to discuss our various programs and those of other federal agencies.? Our ongoing collaboration with the Partnership for Sustainable Communities is one way the Obama Administration is supporting rural areas. Last year¡¯s Rural Jobs Accelerator grants were a call to promote regional approaches to economic development, and one of the successful grantees involved a regional cultural strategy in SW Virginia centered on the Crooked Road Heritage Trail.? The project involved funding from USDA, the Economic Development Administration, and the Appalachian Regional Commission. Construction continues at the Sonoran Desert Retreat Center in Ajo, Arizona which was a recent recipient of an ArtPlace grant from national foundations. USDA has also provided funding to the Center over the years, including a community facility grant for the courtyard garden in foreground. Photo courtesy of Tracy Taft. A similar set of conversations was had at the Rural Arts and Culture Summit in Morris, Minnesota where the Center for Small Towns at the University of Minnesota-Morris, played a gracious host.?? Organized by Springboard for the Arts¡¯ field office in Fergus Falls, this remarkable gathering involved over 200 arts leaders focused on ensuring that rural arts and culture remain a viable component of the state¡¯s rural communities.? The Summit was another example of how philanthropies, such as the McKnight and Mardag foundations, are key partners in supporting the rural cultural economy. One project that caught my eye was the Franconia Sculpture Park in Taylors Falls, Minnesota.? ?Visiting Franconia is a remarkable experience.?? Artists-in-Residents use their time onsite to build large sculptures that are then placed on display for free public viewing on a 20 acre site amidst the farmland.? Franconia, and its employees and artist residents, though more importantly its thousands of visitors, provide a noteworthy boost to the rural communities of Taylors Falls, MN and St Croix Falls, WI, the latter of which is home to a vibrant local performance theater, the St Croix Festival Theater. ??These engaging destinations struck me a wonderful places to help urban visitors gain a greater appreciation of how cultural enterprises help sustain rural communities. ¡°Franconia Sculpture Park in Taylors Falls, MN is a jewel amidst the farms and provides extra economic boost to the surrounding rural communities as well as cultural enrichment to both local residents and visitors from the Twin Cities.¡± Photo courtesy of Franconia Sculpture Park.

"In Charles City Iowa, USDA Officials Listen to Advice from Business Leaders at White House Roundtable Event  Access to capital, cutting edge technology and more responsive government programs will help drive rural innovation, according to participants at a White House Business Council roundtable in Charles City, Iowa yesterday. Facilitated by USDA Rural Utilities Service (RUS) Administrator Jonathan Adelstein, the forum drew a group of rural business leaders from around the region. They raised issues ranging from the length of time it takes to process passport and visa applications to new regulations on banks and financial institutions. Adelstein, who is one of the Obama Administration¡¯s leading advocates for rural broadband, heard an extensive discussion of the shortcomings of rural broadband in Charles City. At the same time, rural telephone cooperatives described their success working with RUS to improve their systems. Charles City Mayor Jim Erb told Adelstein there exists a ¡°rural-rural¡± divide in which some communities receive exceptional broadband service while others do not. Adelstein said the Obama Administration is working to extend high speed broadband throughout rural America and that USDA programs may be able to help. The probability that economic development and job creation in rural areas will be driven by access to high speed broadband was stressed.

Yuma and the rest of the state lead national lettuce crop production. His research currently focuses on the role of host plants in the transfer of insect-transmitted diseases in lettuce and melons. He also teaches a series of courses at University of Yuma on Agricultural Systems Management and Crop Production. Discua first learned about the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) E. Kika De La Garza (EKDLG) Science Fellowship through Roberto Gonzalez, his local USDA Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement (OPPE) liaison, who encouraged him to apply. Discua was looking for ways to connect and collaborate with USDA scientists, as well as opportunities to support his students by learning more about USDA grants and programs. EKDLG Fellowships are designed specifically to introduce faculty and staff from Hispanic-serving institutions (HSI) and Hispanic-serving school districts to the USDA resources available to them.

Insects, like aphids, whiteflies, and beetles, feed on plant sap from these host plants. At the same time, they can transmit plant viruses or other pathogens while feeding. Here's how it works: 1. **Insect vectors**: Aphids, whiteflies, and beetles become infected with plant viruses when they feed on an infected plant. The virus is transmitted through their saliva as they feed. 2. **Vector plant-to-plant transmission**: When these infected insects visit a healthy host plant, such as lettuce or melons, the virus can be transferred to the new plant via the insect's saliva. This process is called vector-mediated transmission. 3. **Infection spread**: As the infected insects move between plants, they can spread the disease-causing pathogens within the agricultural area. Some common diseases transmitted through this mechanism include: * Lettuce mosaic virus (LMV) in lettuce * Melon aphid-borne yellows virus (MABYV) in melons Therefore, controlling insect populations and using integrated pest management techniques are essential for reducing the spread of these plant viruses.",0.037965282485626584,0.24324324324324326,0.1272727272727273,0.17117117117117117,0.8549427390098572

"The Program The Farm Bill created the Program to help underserved farmers, ranchers and foresters who have historically experienced limited access to USDA programs and services. The Farm Bill expanded the Program to include veterans. The objective of the Program is to show USDA¡¯s commitment to ensuring that underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters can equitably participate in USDA programs. Grants are awarded to community-based and non-profit organizations, higher education institutions and eligible tribal entities with at least 3 years of experience in working with socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers or veteran farmers and ranchers. Individual farmers and ranchers are not eligible to apply for Program grants. Because of differences in demographics, culture, economics, language and other factors, there is no one single approach to identifying solutions that can benefit underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters. Program partners are based in local communities and rural areas where they serve a critical role in maximizing USDA¡¯s outreach efforts by identifying systemic barriers that need to be removed and working to increase equitable participation in USDA¡¯s programs and services. Projects funded under the Program include, but are not limited to, conferences, workshops and demonstrations on various farming techniques and other efforts to connect underserved farmers and ranchers to USDA local officials to help communities increase their awareness of USDA¡¯s programs and services.

"Improving Health & Nutrition for Black Americans  As I reflect on Black History Month, I think about the tremendous accomplishments and contributions made by Black Americans. I think of the past, present and future to acknowledge how far we¡¯ve come, where we are now, and the challenges ahead.  Dr. Chavonda Jacobs-Young, Under Secretary, Research, Education, and Economics & USDA Chief Scientist  Posted in  Research and Science  Feb 28,   Respond to this story",What impact does soil conservation have on crop yields in African American communities?,"There is no direct answer to the question according to the provided content. However, a related concept mentioned is ""Improving Health & Nutrition"" which might be indirectly linked to crop yields and soil conservation, but it's not explicitly stated.","Soil conservation has a positive impact on crop yields in African American communities in several ways: 1. **Increased Crop Yields**: By implementing soil conservation practices such as contour farming, terracing, and cover cropping, African American farmers can reduce soil erosion and improve soil fertility, leading to increased crop yields. 2. **Improved Soil Health**: Soil conservation helps maintain the health of the soil, which is essential for plant growth. Well-managed soils tend to have better water-holding capacity, improved aeration, and higher nutrient levels, all of which contribute to healthier plants and higher yields. 3. **Reduced Crop Losses**: By minimizing soil erosion, African American farmers can reduce crop losses due to runoff and sedimentation. This means that more crops are harvested, and fewer resources are wasted. 4. **Increased Food Security**: With increased crop yields, African American communities can achieve greater food security, as more people have access to fresh, locally grown produce. 5. **Supports Sustainable Agriculture**: Soil conservation aligns with the principles of sustainable agriculture, which emphasizes long-term productivity, environmental stewardship, and social equity. By adopting soil conservation practices, African American farmers can contribute to a more sustainable food system that benefits both their communities and the environment. However, it is essential to acknowledge that historical agricultural injustices, such as land dispossession, discriminatory policies, and limited access to resources, have hindered the development of African American agriculture in many areas. These systemic barriers have made it challenging for African American farmers to adopt soil conservation practices and reap their benefits. To address these disparities, initiatives promoting equitable access to resources, education, and technical support are crucial. Community-led projects, policy reforms, and collaborations between government agencies, non-profit organizations, and farming communities can help overcome historical injustices and promote the adoption of soil conservation practices among African American farmers. By doing so, we can improve crop yields, increase food security, and support sustainable agriculture in these communities.",1.6322229941196497e-155,0.10084033613445378,0.011267605633802818,0.07282913165266106,0.824253261089325

"ARS Office of Communications in  Research and Science  Jan 17,  It may be winter, but it is still possible to access fresh, locally-grown produce. How? With aquaponics. Americans and people living around the world can grow crops year-round in a soilless hydroponic environment regardless of their regions¡¯ climate or season. It also has the added benefit of supplying fresh fish to the local food system. ¡°Aquaponics is a blend of aquaculture and hydroponics, and is the most rapidly growing segment of global agriculture,¡± said Carl Webster, research biologist at the Agricultural Research Service¡¯s (ARS) Harry K. Dupree Stuttgart National Aquaculture Research Center in Arkansas. The aquaponics system begins with tanks where fish are grown ¨C usually tilapia, channel catfish, and hybrid striped bass. In these tanks, bacteria breaks down fish waste (feces and ammonia) into natural fertilizer. Farmers then irrigate their plants with this fertilizer in a hydroponic growing chamber. Plants raised using aquaponics typically include crops like lettuce, spinach, herbs, tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, and peppers. The result of aquaponics is a steady supply of fresh fish and vegetables that are available in local communities throughout the year and are grown in just about any environment ¨C from an abandoned inner-city warehouse to a climate-controlled facility in the middle of a desert. Additionally, aquaponics does not just benefit local communities; it also serves as an innovative and invaluable tool in addressing some of the world¡¯s most pressing challenges like hunger and climate change. ¡°According to the United Nations, there will be more than 9 billion people living on our planet by . We need to be smarter about how we grow food,¡± said Benjamin Beck, research leader at the ARS Aquatic Animal Health Research unit in Auburn, Alabama. ¡°Minimizing the space used to grow food and/or growing more than one crop at the same time could help relieve pressure on land production of crops while still providing a locally-grown source of food.¡±  Category/Topic:  Research and Science  Tags:  Agricultural Research Service  ARS  USDA Science  fish  aquaculture  hydroponics  aquaponics  sustainable farming  You May Also Like  USDA Nutrition Research Fuels Olympians¡¯ Engines  Meet Mari Gomez¡ªPublic Servant at USDA & Leader in Her Community  Shining a Spotlight on USDA Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area Employees",What are some innovative ways to grow crops year-round in various environments using aquaponics systems?,"* Growing crops like lettuce, spinach, herbs, tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, and peppers * Minimizing space used to grow food by growing multiple crops at the same time * Growing crops in a soilless hydroponic environment regardless of climate or season * Using abandoned inner-city warehouses or climate-controlled facilities in deserts as aquaponics systems","Aquaponics is a soilless cultivation system that combines traditional aquaculture (raising fish and other aquatic animals) with hydroponics (growing plants in water) to create a sustainable and efficient way of growing crops year-round. Here are some innovative ways to grow crops year-round using aquaponics systems: 1. **Floating Row Systems**: This method uses floating rafts or platforms to support the roots of plants, allowing for maximum water circulation and oxygenation. This design is ideal for growing crops like lettuce, herbs, and strawberries in a controlled environment. 2. **Media-Based Biofilter (MBB)**: This system uses a bioactive media to filter waste from fish tanks and provide nutrients to plants. MBB is an excellent option for growing crops like tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers in warm climates. 3. **NFT (Nutrient Film Technique) Channels**: NFT channels use a network of narrow tubes or pipes to deliver a continuous flow of nutrient-rich water to the roots of plants. This design is suitable for growing crops like lettuce, basil, and spinach in cooler climates. 4. **Aquaponic Domes**: These structures use geodesic domes or other curved shapes to create an optimal environment for plant growth. Aquaponic domes can be used to grow a wide variety of crops year-round, regardless of the external climate. 5. **Vertical Aquaponics**: This design uses vertical stacking of plants and fish tanks to maximize space and efficiency. Vertical aquaponics is ideal for growing crops like herbs, leafy greens, and microgreens in urban areas with limited space. 6. **Fish-Friendly Crop Selection**: Some crops, like tilapia-friendly lettuce or aquaculture-compatible basil, have evolved to complement the waste produced by fish. By selecting these crops, you can optimize the efficiency of your aquaponics system and create a mutually beneficial relationship between plants and animals. 7. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**: Aquaponics systems can be designed with IPM in mind, using natural predators or other biological controls to manage pests and maintain a healthy ecosystem. 8. **Bio-Mimicry**: This approach involves mimicking the principles of nature to create an aquaponics system that is self-sustaining and efficient. Bio-mimicry can help reduce energy consumption, water usage, and waste production in aquaponics systems. 9. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and IoT Integration**: By integrating AI and IoT technologies into aquaponics systems, you can optimize plant growth, monitor water quality, and automate system control for maximum efficiency and yield. 10. **Hybrid Aquaponics**: This approach combines traditional aquaculture with other hydroponic or soil-based cultivation methods to create a hybrid system that leverages the strengths of each method. These innovative approaches can help you achieve year-round crop growth in various environments using aquaponics systems, while also promoting sustainability and minimizing waste.",6.182341331827202e-79,0.1494949494949495,0.0486815415821501,0.10505050505050506,0.8388480544090271
"Posted by Agricultural Research Service Office of Communications in  Research and Science  Nov 23,  For many families, a Thanksgiving meal would not be the same without the sweet, tart goodness of cranberry dishes. A project funded by USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) at Oregon State University (OSU) is working to ensure that staple stays on the table. ¡°Weeds ¨C moss in particular ¨C are a big challenge to cranberry production, but the number of herbicides labeled for use on cranberry is relatively low,¡± said Cassie Bouska, associate professor of practice with OSU Extension Service. ¡°We lack effective controls for weeds that can, and ultimately will, take over a cranberry bed and drastically reduce production.¡± Research from Washington state found that increasing moss pressure reduced yield by at least half. With decreased cranberry yields and lower prices, some growers have struggled to break even in recent years.  ¡°That impacts the economic stability of farm families and rural communities,¡± Bouska said. ¡°An economically sustainable farm can move forward and find ways to improve its environmental sustainability.¡± A cranberry bed is a complete mat of cranberry vines ¨C 100% ground cover. Established weeds are difficult to control and hand weeding is time-consuming and expensive. As a result, the research team is studying various weed control tools and techniques to tackle troublesome weeds and may be closing in on a breakthrough. ¡°We¡¯ve tested some products that are very effective at controlling moss, while causing minimal or no damage to the cranberries,¡± Bouska said. ¡°Next year¡¯s field work will provide indications of whether there are additive effects of year-on-year applications.

"School Breakfast: A Jump Start to a Great Day  How you start your day sets the tone for the rest of your day! School breakfast programs are critical in building a healthier future for America¡¯s children.  Tony Craddock, Jr., Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Nutrition Security  Apr 25,   Respond to this story",What is the impact of school breakfast programs on agricultural production and food security in the United States?,"The content does not provide information on the impact of school breakfast programs on agricultural production and food security in the United States. However, according to the US Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service website, school breakfast programs can have a positive impact on farm-to-school initiatives, which can support local farmers and improve access to fresh produce for schools.","The impact of school breakfast programs on agricultural production and food security in the United States is multifaceted. Here's a clear breakdown: **Positive impacts:** 1. **Increased demand for certain crops**: School breakfast programs often purchase whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, which creates a stable market for farmers who grow these commodities. 2. **Supports local agricultural production**: By purchasing locally grown produce, school breakfast programs can stimulate the growth of nearby farms and promote local food systems. 3. **Improves access to nutritious foods**: School breakfast programs help ensure that students have access to healthy, nutrient-rich foods, contributing to improved overall health and well-being. **Negative impacts:** 1. **Subsidized commodity purchases**: The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reimburses schools for a portion of their food costs through the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), which can lead to over-reliance on government-subsidized commodities, such as cheese and whole milk. This can result in: * Reduced demand for specialty or locally grown produce. * Increased reliance on industrial-scale agriculture. 2. **Unbalanced food systems**: The emphasis on purchasing low-cost commodities can perpetuate a food system that prioritizes cheap, processed foods over fresh, locally produced options. **Overall impact:** While school breakfast programs contribute to increased agricultural production and improved access to nutritious foods for students, they also perpetuate some of the same issues that plague the broader U.S. food system: 1. **Over-reliance on industrial agriculture**: The emphasis on cheap commodities can lead to a lack of investment in local, sustainable agricultural practices. 2. **Food insecurity**: While school breakfast programs help ensure students have access to meals, they do not directly address broader issues of food insecurity or malnutrition. To maximize the positive impact of school breakfast programs on agricultural production and food security, consider implementing: 1. **Innovative procurement strategies**: Explore new purchasing models that prioritize locally grown produce, support small-scale farmers, or promote farm-to-school initiatives. 2. **Education and community engagement**: Incorporate nutrition education and experiential learning opportunities into the program to promote healthy eating habits and foster a deeper appreciation for local food systems. By acknowledging both the positive and negative impacts of school breakfast programs on agricultural production and food security, we can work towards creating more sustainable, equitable, and nutritious food systems that benefit all members of society.",0.05231315427144171,0.242152466367713,0.13513513513513514,0.17488789237668162,0.8531907796859741

"Release & Contact Info  Fact Sheet  Release No. .21  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@usda.gov  On November 2, at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), the United States and United Arab Emirates officially launched the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) alongside 31 countries and over 48 non-government partners. In remarks at the World Leaders Summit, President Biden announced that the United States intends to mobilize $1 billion in investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation over five years . Previewed at President Biden¡¯s Leaders Summit on Climate in April, AIM for Climate is a pioneering initiative uniquely focused on increasing investment and enabling greater public-private and cross-sectoral partnerships, intended to both raise global climate ambition, and underpin transformative climate action in the agriculture sector in all countries. AIM for Climate has already begun to bear fruit, garnering an ¡°early harvest¡± of $4 billion in increased investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation over five years. AIM for Climate partners are mobilizing this investment to close the global investment gap in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. Climate-smart agriculture is an approach that helps to guide actions needed to transform and reorient agricultural systems to tackle three main objectives: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes, while adapting and building resilience to climate change and/or reducing/removing greenhouse gas emissions. AIM for Climate seeks to create incentives for, and mechanisms for maximizing the impact of, new investments toward an agriculture sector that is ready to face a changing climate. Government partners are providing the crucial foundation of AIM for Climate, through a wave of public investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. Other sectors, including business, philanthropy, and other non-government partners are invited to build upon that foundation with ¡°innovation sprints¡± ¨C investments in specific, impactful, measurable, expedited efforts ¨C or by providing critical knowledge for identifying investment gaps, challenges, and opportunities. AIM for Climate has three primary objectives:  Demonstrate collective commitment to significantly increase investment in agricultural innovation for climate-smart agriculture and food systems over five years ;  Support frameworks and structures to enable technical discussions and the promotion of expertise, knowledge, and priorities across international and national levels of innovation to amplify the impact of participants¡¯ investments; and  Establish appropriate structures for exchanges between Ministers, chief scientists, and other stakeholders as key focal points and champions for cooperation on climate-related agricultural innovation, to engender greater co-creation and cooperation on shared research priorities. AIM for Climate focuses on increasing and accelerating investment in, and other support for, climate-smart agricultural innovation in the areas of:  Scientific breakthroughs via basic agricultural research through national-level government and academic research institutions;  Public and private applied research, including through support to international research centers, institutions, and laboratory networks; and  Development, demonstration, and deployment of practical, actionable, and innovative products, services, and knowledge to producers and other market participants, including through national agricultural research extension systems.

"USDA, FNS and written by Hannah Benson, Project Bread Program Manager in  Food and Nutrition  Mar 08,  Several studies consistently link poor access to food to poor health outcomes, including heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Project Bread, a Massachusetts¡¯ nonprofit focused on permanently solving food insecurity, teamed up with MassHealth to pilot the Flexible Services Program, or FSP, to bolster food security and meet nutritional needs from birth throughout childhood and beyond, improving health outcomes at every stage of life. Since April , over 7,000 MassHealth members (ranging in age from 0 months to 64 years) with complex health issues were given an array of food resources, including gift cards for groceries, cooking supplies, refrigerators, cooking classes, transportation assistance, and nutrition education. A recent evaluation of 491 clients, who engaged in the program between November ¨C October , significantly improved their diet and health as follows:  25% became food secure  Fruit and vegetable consumption increased by 3.5 servings per week  SNAP enrollment increased by 12.4%  99% reported that participation in FSP improved their health Project Bread employs 11 nutrition services coordinators to serve MassHealth clients across several languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, Cape Verdean Creole, Haitian Creole, Arabic, and Vietnamese. These coordinators help address racial inequity in underserved communities, as these communities are disproportionately affected by social and economic barriers to good health. The program has made life-changing improvements for many participants. When John A. in Gardner, MA lost his job as a cook at age 52, his diet and his health deteriorated, impacting his ability to regain employment. FSP resources gave John the opportunity to take back his diet and his future. ¡°Not only has this program helped me financially in terms of paying for groceries, but the cooking shows [hosted by Project Bread chefs and nutritionists] have reignited my passion for cooking.

"USDA Equity Commission Communications Lead in  Equity  Initiatives  Mar 14,  As a Latina woman, raised in a black community by a single white mother, Poppy Sias-Hernandez understands how access to equitable support and resources can have a life changing impact. In , Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer appointed Sias-Hernandez as the first-ever Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer (EIO) in the Executive Office of the Governor. In addition to her role as the Chief EIO, she also serves as the Executive Director of the Office of Global Michigan. In February , Sias-Hernandez became one of 15 members appointed to the U.S. Department of Agriculture¡¯s Equity Commission. Appointees serve two-year terms and bring a unique understanding of their individual fields and professional niches. The commission and its two subcommittees ¨C the Agriculture Subcommittee and Rural Community Economic Development Subcommittee - are tasked with evaluating USDA programs and services and recommending ways USDA can reduce barriers to access by implementing transformative changes. Sias-Hernandez credits gaining access to an affordable community college education with changing her life¡¯s trajectory. After high school, Sias-Hernandez moved to California to live with her father. There, she was able to take community college classes for $15 per credit hour, a complete departure from Michigan where community college was not financially accessible or feasible. This opportunity allowed her to become the first in her family to receive a college education, which included a bachelor¡¯s degree from University of California at Berkley and a master¡¯s degree in Organizational Change Leadership from Western Michigan University, where she received a Thurgood Marshall Fellowship. Her first class at Berkely was titled ¡°Women of Color in the U.S.¡±. According to Sias-Hernandez, that¡¯s where she did a lot of early thinking regarding issues concerning equity and inclusion. The experiences and knowledge gained from that course have been formative over the course of her personal and professional life. Sias-Hernandez credits the young female professor teaching the course with recognizing that the material had ¡°lit a fire within her¡±. Sias-Hernandez explains, ¡°She said to me, ¡®This is going to be a challenge in life. Are you ready? You are going to have to find a way to drive the change you want to see while understanding that you will likely never see it.¡¯¡± These words became the foundation to Sias-Hernandez¡¯s life. ¡°That was so formative and has been throughout my life because it is the truth,¡± said Sias-Hernandez. ¡°I still have that mindset. How do you keep showing up with love, integrity, and generosity knowing you¡¯re not always going to see the change you are working for?¡± As a professional, Sias-Hernandez has devoted much of her 20-plus year career to building and creating equity. During the pandemic, Sias-Hernandez partnered with other Michigan state government departments to build a migrant community response model to provide access to healthcare, financial assistance, and other resources to impacted farmworkers. One of her partners in this project, the Michigan Secretary of Agriculture, encouraged Sias-Hernandez to apply for the USDA Equity Commission. Initially, Sias-Hernandez was apprehensive about a potential role on the Commission, but says she quickly discovered how much good work was possible. More than six months into the work, she says she¡¯s impressed by the collective expertise of the Commission, and the group¡¯s willingness to collaborate and share their individual gifts, talents, and lived experiences. ¡°I am loving this Commission. I am loving the learning; I am loving the high level of commitment,¡± she said. ¡°It¡¯s the right formula to create terrific momentum and you have these Commissioners who are just super committed to doing good work.¡± From Sias-Hernandez's viewpoint, the work of the Equity Commission creates systems that are accessible to all population groups. ¡°Sometimes you hear equity talked about through an individual lens, referenced as meeting people where they are,¡± said Sias-Hernandez. ¡°But I really think about equity through a systems level lens and through a population level lens.¡± Sias-Hernandez describes governmental systems and programs like a current in a stream. ¡°These systems should be designed to keep people in the current. But what actually happens is that some people have to swim upstream to access the current, because it really wasn¡¯t made for them,¡± she said. ¡°My vision for equity is that we are creating a current that captures all people; that anyone can step into the stream and swim with the current rather than having to struggle against it.¡±  Category/Topic:  Equity  Initiatives  Tags:  equity  USDA  You May Also Like  Reflections from the Road in Pennsylvania: Charting the Path Forward with Urban Agriculture and the Next Generation  Dr. Jennie L.

"-Young, Under Secretary, Research, Education, and Economics & USDA Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Feb 28,  As I reflect on Black History Month, I think about the tremendous accomplishments and contributions made by Black Americans. I think of the past, present and future to acknowledge how far we¡¯ve come, where we are now, and the challenges ahead. For me, one the most concerning challenges still facing Black Americans is the disproportional high rates of cancer and chronic diseases. With the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting half of all African American adults have some form of cardiovascular disease, and that Black men and women have the highest rates of dying from cancer ¨C something must change. This issue hits very close to home for me. Growing up in Georgia, food was a part of my communities¡¯ culture and heritage. Food brought people together, the dishes were delicious, however they weren¡¯t always good for our health. This led to many of our staple dishes being loaded with excess sodium and calories. Unfortunately, it was this approach to eating that left many of my family members ultimately fighting heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, hypertension, and cancer. As jarring as this may seem, this is just one of many similar stories shared by Black Americans. Recently in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, I heard similar experiences echoed by Black community members at a listening session at Southern University. This listening session was the first in a series hosted by USDA¡¯s Agricultural Science Center of Excellence for Nutrition and Diet for Better Health (ASCEND for Better Health) to discuss how food access, nutrition security, and diet affect health outcomes in underserved communities. ASCEND for Better Health is a new USDA initiative that aims to reduce the burden of diet-related chronic diseases, like cancer, by enhancing precision nutrition research and sharing that research with the communities it impacts. ASCEND for Better Health also supports President Biden¡¯s Cancer Moonshot to end cancer as we know it and is tied to the goals laid out in the White House National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. As we step into National Nutrition Month tomorrow, I am hopeful for the future health and wellbeing of Black Americans thanks to initiatives like USDA¡¯s ASCEND for Better Health. A brighter future is ahead in which healthy, nutritious foods are accessible to all and specific nutrition advice is available so everyone can live long, high-quality and prosperous lives.

"USDA-NRCS Public Affairs Specialist in  Conservation  Dec 18,   Each day U.S. farmers and ranchers make thousands of management decisions, ranging from when and what to plant to weighing options for conserving their operation¡¯s natural resources. They depend on an array of experts, research and to inform these decisions. One of their sources is the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), USDA¡¯s primary private lands conservation agency. NRCS generates, manages, and shares the , technology, and standards that inform conservation decisions by farmers and ranchers, policy makers and others. Many of these are generated through co-produced science, delivered by the NRCS-led Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP). CEAP assessments are carried out at national, regional, and watershed scales for conservation efforts related to cropland, grazing land, wetlands, and wildlife. First funded through the Farm Bill, CEAP quantifies and on trends in voluntary conservation practices, and associated outcomes, over time. CEAP findings help guide conservation program policies and support conservationists, farmers, and partners in making informed management decisions backed by and science.

The project brings together an elite group of ARS, university and food industry scientists from different specialties to fight Salmonella, a foodborne pathogen that sickens over a million Americans each year, sometimes fatally. The challenge complements the work being done by the Food Safety and Inspection Service to develop a more effective strategy to reduce human Salmonella illness linked to poultry. ARS¡¯ goal is to integrate its research to learn more about how and where Salmonella causes the highest risk of contamination to meat and poultry products. That information will help researchers develop better monitoring tools for meat and poultry producers to detect Salmonella contamination. Salmonella, the bacterium that causes the illness called salmonellosis, lurks just about everywhere ¨C on animals (including pets), in food, water, soil and even air. People infected by Salmonella suffer symptoms that can include diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, chills, headache, nausea and vomiting. Serious infections can lead to life-long health problems and even death. The ARS team will integrate its ongoing research by combining, standardizing and coordinating efforts to create harmonized datasets. This will help them identify larger trends, emerging threats and novel Salmonella mitigation strategies. That¡¯s a large task because there are over 2,500 types of Salmonella bacteria and their risks are different across all production systems. The research team will use machine-learning tools to manage and bring together this huge amount of . The collaboration will help researchers learn from each other and will hopefully lead to break-through discoveries. The Salmonella Grand Challenge will enable researchers to better understand Salmonella risk, develop accurate models, and develop tools for meat and poultry producers to monitor their operations. Ultimately, the team hopes their efforts will contribute to the Healthy People objective of reducing salmonellosis by 25%. This work helps drive USDA¡¯s commitment to ensuring a safe U.S. food supply.

"National Agricultural Statistics Service Public Affairs Specialist in  Research and Science  Mar 17,  The states that produce some of the most nutritious and most consumed commodities within each of the five food groups. Many people want to cultivate healthier eating habits and March, National Nutrition Month, may be a great time to start. USDA¡¯s Food and Nutrition Service¡¯s MyPlate website is a resource available to help get on (or back on) the nutrition track. MyPlate itself is divided into five major food groups ¨C vegetables, fruits, grains, protein foods, and dairy and fortified soy alternatives. But do you ever wonder where your food comes from, and how much our hardworking farmers and ranchers produce in a year? Here are facts about some of America¡¯s favorite, nutritious foods: According to USDA¡¯s Economic Research Service (ERS), the tomato is one of the most commonly eaten vegetables in the country. In , U.S. farmers produced 24.1 billion pounds of tomatoes with California producing more than 97%. Apples are also a big hit in the U.S.. In , our growers produced nearly 11 billion pounds, nearly 69% of which came from Washington state. The average yield from each of Washington¡¯s 172,000 total apple bearing acres was 44,200 pounds! For , check out the Non-Citrus Fruits & Nuts Annual Report. Wheat, a health-promoting grain found in many foods, is one of our largest field crops. In , U.S. farmers produced 1.8 billion bushels of it, with North Dakota producing more than 17% of the total. For animal protein, according to ERS, chicken still tops the list in American diets. In , 58.3 billion pounds of chicken were produced in the U.S., more than 14% or 8.3 billion pounds in the top producing state of Georgia. New will be available on April 29 in the Poultry Production and Value Report. Finally, there is dairy. Versatile and packed with important nutrients, fluid beverage milk is one of the most consumed dairy products in the country. Americans consumed more than 46.4 billion pounds, or 5.4 billion gallons, of it last year alone.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .23  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@usda.gov  WASHINGTON, Sept. 26, ¨C The U.S. Department of Agriculture today announced that it is giving an estimated 3,000 more school districts in high-need areas the option to serve breakfast and lunch to all students at no cost, by expanding the availability of the Community Eligibility Provision, commonly known as CEP. ¡°Today¡¯s announcement comes as we approach the one-year anniversary of the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, where the Biden-Harris Administration promised to advance a pathway to healthy school meals for all students,¡± said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ¡°USDA has taken an important step toward fulfilling that promise by expanding access to CEP. Increasing access to free, healthy school breakfast and lunch will decrease childhood hunger, improve child health and student readiness, and put our nation on the path to better nutrition and wellness.¡± CEP is a simplified meal service option that allows schools to provide meals at no cost to all students without requiring families to apply for free and reduced-price meals. Instead, school districts receive federal funding based on a formula using existing from SNAP and other programs, and local or state funds must fill any gap between program costs and federal support. Before this final rule, at least 40% of students had to live in households participating in certain income-based federal assistance programs, in order for a school, group of schools, or school district to be eligible for CEP. This final rule lowers that threshold from 40% to 25%. While this change in CEP applies across the country, it will be particularly impactful in states and school districts which commit to supporting healthy school meals for all students with their own funds. Eight states have taken additional permanent actions to make sure hunger is not a barrier to children¡¯s success, in addition to allowing eligible schools to participate in CEP. California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Vermont passed state laws allowing their schools to serve healthy school meals to all their students at no cost. In these states, schools that previously were not eligible for CEP can now take advantage of this final rule to experience more efficient, streamlined school meal operations as well as predictable federal funding levels. CEP ¨C and all models for providing healthy school meals for all at no cost ¨C is a win-win for schools, kids, families and communities and provides many benefits, including:  Lowering food costs for families;  Increasing food and nutrition security, especially for students from households that barely miss the cutoff to be eligible for free and reduced-price school meals;  Eliminating school meal debt;  Reducing social stigma for students who eat free or reduced-price meals, while other students pay full price;  Increasing student participation in school breakfast and lunch programs, which increases revenues and helps schools offer healthier meals; and  Saving time by simplifying program operations for hardworking school nutrition staff. ¡°Healthy school meals are an essential part of the school environment ¡ª just like teachers, classrooms and books ¨C and set kids up for success and better health,¡± said Stacy Dean, USDA deputy under secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services. ¡°More children are fueled for learning and development when they can count on tasty, nutritious meals at school. While there is still more work ahead to ensure every K-12 student in the nation can access healthy school meals at no cost, this is a significant step on the pathway towards that goal.¡± USDA is also supporting expanded access to healthy school meals by offering extensive financial support for schools, including providing:  50 cents more per lunch and 18 cents more per breakfast for school year -24, compared to last school year¡¯s base reimbursement rates, through annual inflation adjustments and Supply Chain Assistance;  $30 million in Healthy Meals Incentives grants to 264 small and rural school districts nationwide;  $30 million in Equipment Grants for states and school districts operating school lunch programs; and  Nearly $11 million in Farm to School Grants, serving 1.2 million children. USDA also continues to expand its Direct Certification for Medicaid Demonstration Projects, which ensure that eligible children in households receiving Medicaid benefits automatically receive free or reduced price school meals without their families filling out an application. The demonstration projects have been implemented in 38 states, and USDA continues to invite more states to participate. In school year -, 1.4 million students received free and reduced-price school meals thanks to direct certification through Medicaid.

"State Director, Southern New England, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 26,  As USDA Rural Development (RD) highlights National Cooperative Month, one worker owned co-op in Massachusetts stands out as a model for sustainability, collaboration, and local food system resiliency. The saying goes ¡°it¡¯s not easy being green.¡± But for Real Pickles in Greenfield, Massachusetts, the co-op wouldn¡¯t have it any other way; they went green in with the addition of solar panels on its roof. Real Pickles Cooperative of Massachusetts RD assisted with the effort, providing $20,000 through the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). The 18.06kWH PV Solar System on the roof of the business was installed by neighboring worker owned solar co-op, PV Squared, and replaced 100 percent of the pickle co-op¡¯s energy needs at that time. So how did this green, innovative co-op come about? Two decades ago, Dan Rosenberg saw a need. Most pickles in the area were being produced with vinegar and preservatives. The old-fashioned pickle that Grandma used to make- naturally fermented with naturally occurring live cultures- was missing from local grocery store shelves. Determined to bring them back, Dan brought some veggies home from an organic vegetable farm where he worked and began making pickles the old-fashioned way. He was soon joined by wife and business partner, Addie Rose Holland, and Real Pickles launched in . They processed their pickles at a business incubator kitchen created by Franklin County Community Development Corporation, which provided a venue for making value-added foods with local farm ingredients. In , Real Pickles moved into their own building and expanded their operations. Today, the co-op sources its produce from eight locally owned farms and the future looks bright. Addie said, ¡°Real Pickles is rooted in this community and it has been supported by this community for the last 21 years.

"Public Affairs Specialist with guest author Somali Bantu Community Association (SBCA) of Maine Executive Director Muhidin Libah and SBCA Intern Holden Turner in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Sep 22,  It¡¯s eight in the morning, and farmers with hand hoes and buckets have been here for two hours already, weeding and watering their plots before the heat of the day. Over 200 members of the Somali Bantu community of Lewiston, Maine, make the short drive out to Liberation Farms a few times each week to tend their crops. Visitors to our farm often comment on how few weeds they spot between stalks of corn. It¡¯s not magic, we tell them: our farmers are constantly in friendly competition to see who can have the best-looking plot. Like a large-scale community garden, Liberation Farms allows families to grow food for themselves. We want to feed our kids the foods that we grew up with in Somalia, like corn, greens, and goat meat. Working together, we can make this happen in a way we never could have individually. In , support from community partners helped us move our farm operations onto a single property where we have room for everyone ¨C and a herd of goats, too! Many people in our community are supporting large families through hourly-wage jobs. Since high-quality produce is otherwise unaffordable for us, growing for ourselves at Liberation Farms is a path to financial savings and food independence. We also use the SNAP and WIC programs to give our community and others much-needed nourishment, boosting the health and cultural connections of younger generations. Liberation Farms is also growing our Iskaashito program, through which farmers work together to sell vegetables at our farmers markets and farm stand. People beyond the Somali Bantu community are buying everything from cornmeal to tomatoes from us, and we encourage them to use food stamps to turn just a few dollars into a fresh basket of veggies. We are so excited to see what the future brings now that we have found a home here in Maine.

"AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Dec 20,  Years ago, I spent my days watching pecan roots change the color of solutions from clear to red as they reduced iron for uptake. It may not sound exciting, but that was the topic of my undergraduate research internship at USDA¡¯s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Children¡¯s Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) in Houston, TX, under the direction of my mentor, ARS scientist Dr. Michael Grusak. Dr. Grusak taught me to consider the link between the laboratory and society. His lab focused on improving crop mineral uptake, which could benefit society by increasing the nutritional value of crops for humans. The emphasis on this connection between plant biology and society stimulated my interest in plant biology and, eventually, led me to pursue my own Ph.D. in plant physiology and genetics. Now, that summer job has led me back to USDA as a Science and Technology Policy Fellow through the American Association of the Advancement of Science in the USDA Office of the Chief Scientist, where I work directly to connect science to society. In my new role, I¡¯m able to use science to inform agricultural policy making decisions by collaborating with others in USDA to develop science-based solutions to emerging issues, especially those related to improving agricultural resilience in response to climate change. As an undergraduate intern, I was excited to contribute to ARS research, but never imagined that the roots I put down at CNRC would lead me back to USDA, supporting priorities that help advance American agriculture and aid in an all-of-government approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change. ARS internship opportunities support future generations of the agricultural workforce. My internship introduced me to the importance of agricultural research and attracted me to a career where I could use science to inform agricultural policy.

"APHIS Legislative and Public Affairs in  Animals  Dec 04,  Bats are crucial to the wellbeing of our natural ecosystems, but also have the potential to spread disease. APHIS Wildlife Services and the One Health Commission recently sponsored a student infographic contest to help change the narrative on bats. Lately, when we hear about bats in the news it's often in the context of emerging infectious diseases. Yet, despite potential public health threats, bats are extremely important to the health of our natural ecosystems. Zoonotic diseases, or zoonoses, are those diseases that can be transmitted between animals and humans. To help educate young adults about the importance of bats to our environment, as well as the potential for some bats to transmit zoonoses, such as rabies, USDA Wildlife Services (WS) and the One Health Commission (OHC) recently sponsored an infographic competition among college students. An infographic is a creative collection of images, charts, and minimal text to present or other information. ¡°To ensure participating college students had a good understanding of the issues surrounding bats and disease before they started designing their infographics, we developed a 5-minute video explaining the One Health approach and why it is key to addressing wildlife diseases like rabies.¡± states Alison Barbee, a biological science technician with the rabies research project at the WS National Wildlife Research Center. The One Health approach emphasizes the interconnectedness of people, animals, and the environment. It also encourages experts from multiple disciplines to work together locally, nationally and globally to achieve the best health for all three. The control of human rabies deaths and exposures through the vaccination of animal reservoirs, such as domestic dogs and terrestrial wildlife, is considered an example of a successful One Health approach. WS, OHC, and other agencies are building upon that success to address concerns about bats and the spread of rabies, as well as other diseases. ¡°If we are going to successfully manage bat rabies and other novel viruses for the benefit of bats, people and the environment, we need to better understand how these pathogens are maintained and spread in bat populations,¡± states Barbee. ¡°We also need to effectively communicate that information with others.¡± Winning infographic on bats and rabies created by Colorado State University graduate student Brooke MacNeill. The winner of the infographic contest was Brooke MacNeill, a graduate student in the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Colorado State University. MacNeill¡¯s infographic focused on the role of bats in the environment, and what is being done to prevent the spread of rabies from wildlife to people. Her design targeted students in grades 6 through 12 and was created in both English and Spanish. She received a $500 cash award and her design was shared with natural resources, public health, and One Health practitioners around the globe. The runner up was Stephen Nachtsheim a graduate student in Biomedical Communications at the University of Toronto. His design focused on the benefits of bats and their population declines due to various diseases. He received a $100 cash prize.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Jan 27,  The Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program helps vets repay qualified student loans for service as food animal veterinarians in selected areas of the country. (iStock image) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA¡¯s rich science and research portfolio. A solid education is crucial to those seeking careers in animal science. However, many student loans can be burdensome. But a student loan payment the size of a mortgage couldn¡¯t stop someone who has wanted to be a veterinarian since they learned to talk. Dr. Annie Bowes is one of those people. After acquiring the knowledge to begin her dream career, Dr. Bowes was left with overwhelming debt.? Luckily for this Idaho-based veterinarian, she wasn¡¯t left alone to repay it. In , she received assistance through the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program (VMLRP) a program funded by USDA¡¯s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). Through VMLRP, NIFA may repay up to $25,000 each year of student loan debt to eligible veterinarians. ?In return, qualified veterinarians must agree to provide food animal medical care for three years in certain high-priority veterinary shortage situations.? VMLRP has helped 245 veterinarians since the program¡¯s inception in . ¡°I am thankful for this assistance,¡± Bowes said. ¡°It allowed me to establish myself in a rural area where it¡¯s difficult to be successful. I am now able to treat animals at six to eight different farms per day and have more than 600 repeat clients.¡± Veterinarians are critical to America¡¯s food safety, food security, and to the health and well-being of both animals and humans. Studies indicate there are significant shortages of food animal veterinarians in certain areas of the country. A leading cause for the scarcity in this profession is the heavy price tag that four years of professional veterinary medical training carries, which leaves current graduates of veterinary colleges with an average debt of $162,000. Bowes owns Aspen Veterinary Service, a mobile service treating large animals, as well as an Emergency Clinic with a staff of 15 and more than 10,000 repeat customers. Dr. Tim VanDerPloeg is another veterinarian using USDA¡¯s assistance to expand rural veterinary services. VanDerPloeg will open Veterinary Center of Somerset, in Kentucky, soon. Pulaski County, where the clinic will be located, is the third largest cattle county in the state of Kentucky.? The clinic will have a 2,300-square-foot large animal facility in addition to the 3,400-square-foot small animal facility. ¡°Although recipients of the loan repayment assistance are only to commit to three years of veterinary service in a designated shortage area, veterinarians like Bowes and VanDerPloeg suggest that the impacts from this funding and connections to their service areas go well beyond three years,¡± said Gary Sherman, VMLRP national program leader with NIFA.

HACCP is a food production, storage, and distribution monitoring system for identification and control of associated health hazards using definitive scientific tests. Its purpose is to prevent contamination of food products during processing. USDA photo. Today kicked off ¡°Get Smart about Antibiotics¡± week in the United States and the World Health Organization¡¯s World Antibiotic Awareness Week in . During this week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and its other federal partners want to remind families and communities about the importance of responsible antibiotic use in both humans and animals, to help reduce the development of resistant bacteria. This week, we also celebrate the 20th anniversary of the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS).? Through NARMS, USDA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collaborate on everything relating to antimicrobial resistant bacteria.? ?Since , USDA¡¯s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) have been active participants in this combined federal surveillance program. So, what is antimicrobial resistance?? As you might recall, in , Dr. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, a drug that revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections. In the years following, penicillin and the discovery and therapeutic use of other antibiotics, we have relied on antibiotics to treat and cure a variety of illnesses - in both humans and animals, across the globe. The use of these drugs has aided in the development of resistant strains of bacteria. Unfortunately, this development means that some previously treatable forms of bacterial infections are now resistant to the antibiotics that were designed to treat them. It is estimated that the decrease in effectiveness of antibiotics, results in more than two million U.S. cases of antibiotic resistant infections, annually. Some of these types of infections might require longer hospital stays and are more costly to treat successfully.? As scientists, we call this problem antimicrobial resistance (AMR). ?Dr. Fleming even raised this concern in after receiving the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of penicillin.? The AMR threat in humans and animals is becoming an increasing problem and requires the adoption of a One Health approach. ?This approach is founded on principles that recognize that the health of people and populations are linked to the health of animals and environments. For example, antibiotics are used in food-producing animals to prevent illness, limit the spread of infections in a herd or flock, and treat diseases. ?Because antibiotics are administered to animals, food products derived from them can serve as a vehicle for the movement of resistant bacteria to humans, just as antibiotics administered to people can affect the environment, including the environment of animals. The One Health approach brings together the expertise of physicians, veterinarians, environmental scientists, and other public health professionals so that problems can be identified and actionable solutions are developed that can minimize the emergence and spread of AMR. World Antibiotics Awareness Week USDA is uniquely positioned to contribute to the body of knowledge about resistant bacteria through the collaboration and ongoing work of experts both within and outside of the Department. For the last 20 years, ARS and FSIS have partnered alongside FDA and CDC to collect and define AMR bacteria in meat and poultry products. Through the NARMS program, ARS and FSIS continually monitor changes in AMR bacteria from animal meat through the FSIS regulatory testing program and from animals through the new cecal sampling surveillance program. ?The sampling results from these two programs help to identify new or changing resistant bacterial patterns and show comparisons between bacteria found in animals used for food and bacteria important in human medicine. This information is critically essential for scientists to understand how resistant bacteria emerge and spread. In , USDA in collaboration with its public health partners began using whole genome sequencing (WGS) to further characterize AMR bacteria in real-time. WGS is a process that can determine the DNA sequence of bacteria collected from food animal samples. This method allows scientists to understand similarities and differences between bacteria with greater detail than ever before. The information gained from WGS helps USDA and NARMS monitor AMR bacteria with more accuracy and to identify more specifically the types of bacteria that cause foodborne illness. Despite USDA¡¯s long history of significant activities and investments in AMR, including its strong twenty years of NARMS collaboration as well as USDAs¡¯ own AMR Action Plan (, 322 ); a considerable amount of work remains to be done to address knowledge gaps in AMR and for further strengthen the current programs. To achieve the greatest public health impact, USDA must continue to coordinate and leverage expertise across many areas. And to ensure that effectiveness of antibiotics is preserved for treating both people and animals and that it is extended to future generations, USDA, other federal agencies, industry, and academic partners are working together to better understand the role of animal production environments in the development and spread of AMR bacteria.?

The agency is using whole genome sequencing (WGS) to further characterize AMR bacteria in real-time and monitor changes in AMR bacteria from animal meat and animals through surveillance programs.","Animal production environments, such as farms and livestock facilities, can play a significant role in the development and spread of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria. Here are some key factors: 1. **Overuse and misuse of antibiotics**: Animal agriculture often employs antimicrobials to promote growth, prevent disease, and treat infections in animals. This widespread use contributes to the selection and proliferation of resistant bacteria. 2. **Intensive production systems**: High-density animal production systems can facilitate the spread of AMR bacteria among animals, as well as to humans through direct contact or contaminated food products. 3. **Cross-contamination and horizontal gene transfer**: The movement of people, equipment, and feed between different animal holdings and production stages can lead to cross-contamination of resistant bacteria. 4. **Environmental persistence**: Animal waste and antimicrobial residues in soil and water can persist for extended periods, allowing AMR bacteria to colonize and spread within the environment. 5. **Selection pressure**: The continued use of antimicrobials maintains selection pressure on bacterial populations, driving the emergence and dissemination of resistant strains. These factors contribute to the development and spread of AMR bacteria in animal production environments, which can have significant implications for human health, including: * Increased risk of antibiotic-resistant infections * Compromised public health and food safety * Economic burdens due to prolonged treatment and reduced productivity Efforts are being made to address these concerns through strategies such as reducing antimicrobial use in agriculture, implementing more targeted disease control measures, promoting good hygiene practices, and developing diagnostic tools for AMR detection.",0.04222231940149829,0.2848297213622291,0.11838006230529595,0.19195046439628485,0.8564186692237854

Based on publicly available information, here are some of the most effective methods NIFA is using to achieve this goal: 1. **Grant Programs**: NIFA provides funding for research projects that focus on reducing post-harvest losses through innovative technologies, better handling practices, and improved infrastructure. These grants support researchers in developing solutions to address specific challenges in different agricultural production systems. 2. **Pre-and Post-Harvest Technologies**: NIFA supports the development and dissemination of pre- and post-harvest technologies that can help reduce food loss. This includes innovations like efficient drying systems for fruits and vegetables, better storage facilities, and more effective packaging methods to preserve freshness during transportation. 3. **Farm-to-Table Initiatives**: By focusing on farm-to-table initiatives, NIFA encourages farmers and producers to adopt best practices in handling and storing produce, minimizing losses from the time of harvest to consumption by consumers. This includes educating farmers about proper storage conditions, using appropriate packaging materials for transport and sale, and implementing inventory management systems. 4. **Data Collection and Analysis**: One of the key strategies NIFA employs is data collection and analysis. By understanding where and why food loss occurs, researchers can identify areas that need improvement. This information can then guide targeted interventions such as improving infrastructure, enhancing technology development, or providing education on better practices to producers and consumers. 5. **Community Engagement and Education**: Recognizing the importance of community involvement in reducing food waste, NIFA supports educational programs and initiatives aimed at changing consumer behavior towards food consumption and disposal practices. This includes educating consumers about the value and safety of ""ugly"" produce (produce that doesn't meet cosmetic standards but is still nutritious), strategies for minimizing food waste in kitchens, and promoting the use of food recovery and redistribution systems. 6. **Food Recovery and Redistribution**: NIFA supports projects focused on recovering surplus food from farms, manufacturers, retailers, and households, and redistributing it to those who need it most, especially through hunger relief organizations. This not only reduces food loss but also provides a tangible benefit to communities by addressing food insecurity. 7. **Climate Resilience and Sustainable Agriculture**: NIFA's efforts to improve climate resilience and promote sustainable agriculture practices often overlap with strategies that reduce post-harvest losses. By supporting research on climate-resilient crops, improving irrigation efficiency, enhancing soil health, and promoting regenerative agricultural practices, NIFA contributes indirectly to minimizing food waste.

The project included adding vegetation to eroding stream banks. (U.S. Forest Service) I am proud to announce that we exceeded our ecological restoration goals for Fiscal Year . This was no small feat. A lot of great people across the U.S. Forest Service worked hard to make it a reality. We did substantial homework and planning, and then based on that we made strategic investments across all agency programs to help us create resilient forests, grasslands and watersheds while sustaining communities. This work reduced the wildland fire threats to communities and firefighters and minimized the risk of forest pests and climate change, while supporting American jobs and rural economies. That is a fantastic combination. The results of this hard work are nothing short of amazing.? The projects we carried out lessened the threats to communities by reducing hazardous fuels on 1.7 million acres in the wildland urban interface, sustained or restored watershed conditions on 2.9 million acres and resulted in 2.8 billion board feet of timber volume sold. Impressively, we did all this despite simultaneously facing a government shutdown, as well as rising costs of fire-fighting that drain resources from our work across all program areas. On a personal level, these accomplishments reflect how much members of our Forest Service community are committed to improving the forests and grasslands that have been entrusted to us by the American people. For these reasons, I could not be more proud of everyone who has come together to make restoration such a success in the past year.

"DVM, Chief Veterinary Officer of the United States, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and Dr. Kis Robertson-Hale, Chief Public Health Veterinarian of the United States, Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Animals  Apr 27,  April 30 is World Veterinary Day: a day to celebrate veterinarians, their work and their impact. Although the importance of veterinarians is hardly a secret, people often forget that veterinarians¡¯ work goes beyond clinical care of animals. USDA employs more veterinarians than any other department in the federal government, with positions located across the nation and associated territories. The breadth of roles that veterinarians fill at USDA illustrates their versatility. Veterinary epidemiologist, emergency responder, laboratory diagnostician, and public health veterinarian are just some of the roles that USDA veterinarians fill every day. Resilience is the theme of this year¡¯s World Veterinary Day. From USDA¡¯s perspective, there could not be a more appropriate theme. From responding to the COVID-19 pandemic to inspecting livestock and poultry slaughter facilities to combating animal health threats like the recent detections of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, USDA veterinarians are on the frontlines protecting public health and animal health every day. Their contributions in both areas preserve an essential resource: a food supply that is both dependable and safe. As a nation, we can¡¯t be resilient¡ªin all senses of the word¡ªwithout that. Beyond ensuring a safe and dependable food supply, preparedness is key to staying resilient in the face of animal or human health threats. USDA works with state and tribal partners and other federal agencies in a collaborative effort known as One Health to protect animals, people, and the environment, which are all connected. The interplay of humans, animals, and the natural world affects diseases in animals and humans, and what we learn could help prevent or limit the next outbreak of diseases transmitted from animals to people, or even the next global pandemic. USDA veterinarians play a key role in the One Health approach. USDA veterinarians protect Americans and their animals every day. They make sure our country has a safe and dependable food supply and is prepared for whatever animal or human diseases may come. If you love agriculture and public health and are dedicated to helping your nation, we encourage you to explore opportunities at USDA.

Here are some key ways they contribute: 1. **Animal Health Surveillance**: Veterinarians monitor animal health on farms, ranches, and in livestock operations to detect and control diseases that can affect human consumers. This includes monitoring for infectious agents like bacteria, viruses, and parasites. 2. **Food Safety Inspection**: Veterinary professionals inspect meat, dairy, and other food products at various stages of production to ensure they meet safety standards. They look for signs of disease or contamination in animals, which can help prevent the spread of illness-causing pathogens to humans. 3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Veterinarians work with government agencies, such as the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to enforce regulations related to animal health, food safety, and public health. They help develop policies and guidelines to protect human consumers from foodborne illnesses. 4. **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**: Veterinarians conduct risk assessments to identify potential sources of contamination in the food chain. They also work with farmers, producers, and policymakers to implement mitigation strategies to prevent or minimize outbreaks of foodborne illness. 5. **Education and Training**: Veterinary professionals educate farmers, producers, and consumers about best practices for maintaining animal health, preventing disease transmission, and ensuring safe food handling procedures. 6. **Research and Development**: Veterinarians contribute to scientific research on animal health, nutrition, and food safety. They investigate the causes of foodborne illnesses, develop new diagnostic techniques, and explore innovative ways to improve food safety. 7. **Collaboration with Other Stakeholders**: Veterinarians work closely with human medicine professionals (e.g., epidemiologists, infectious disease specialists), policymakers, farmers, producers, and industry representatives to ensure a comprehensive approach to food safety. In summary, veterinarians play a vital role in safeguarding the food supply by monitoring animal health, inspecting food products, enforcing regulations, assessing risks, educating stakeholders, conducting research, and collaborating with other experts.

However, if you'd like general information on rooftop beekeeping, I can provide that for you. Rooftop beekeeping is a practice of keeping honey bees (Apis mellifera) in urban environments, typically on rooftops or high-rise balconies. While it's not a common agricultural practice, it does involve some specific considerations to maintain the health and productivity of the beehive. Some common practices involved in maintaining a rooftop beehive might include: 1. **Regular inspections**: Regularly inspecting the hive for signs of disease, pests, or other issues that could affect the bees' health. 2. **Honey harvesting**: Harvesting honey from the hive to maintain a healthy balance and prevent the bees from consuming too much honey during winter months. 3. **Pest management**: Monitoring the hive for signs of pests like mites, small hive beetles, or other insects that could harm the bees. 4. **Nutrition and water management**: Ensuring the bees have access to a consistent source of clean water and nectar-rich flowers nearby (if in an urban setting). 5. **Swarm control**: Managing swarms by either re-homing excess bees or preventing them from leaving the hive. 6. **Record keeping**: Keeping records of honey production, pest management activities, and other important metrics to track the health and productivity of the beehive. Again, I couldn't find any information on a specific rooftop beehive at the USDA headquarters building, but these general practices could apply in other urban settings where beekeeping is practiced.",4.209120851930864e-79,0.06792452830188679,0.03041825095057034,0.06792452830188679,0.8304339647293091

"Food Safety Education Staff, Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA in  Health and Safety  Mar 14,  Plan for spring cleaning, a checklist for a food safe pantry and fridge. The refrigerator and pantry are where most people store their food. But these storage areas may also be one of the less frequently cleaned places in your home, which could be hazardous to your health. The refrigerator is one of the most important pieces of equipment in the kitchen. Without it, our food would spoil and could make us sick. Refrigerators should be set to maintain a temperature between 34¡ã and 40¡ãF to preserve our foods. Setting the refrigerator temperature too low will cause your refrigerator to work overtime and could also freeze some of your foods. Many of today¡¯s advanced refrigerators have built-in thermostats that measure their internal temperature. If your fridge does not have a built-in thermostat, you should keep an appliance thermometer inside in a visible place to monitor the temperature. Here are some tips to make your fridge (and your home) more healthy and safe:  Clean spills immediately ¨C Clean surfaces thoroughly with warm, soapy water; then rinse. Do not use solvent cleaning agents or abrasives, as these may allow chemical fumes/tastes into your food and ice cubes and make them unsafe to eat.  Store leftovers safely ¨C Throw out perishable foods that have spoiled and no longer can be eaten. Leftovers like meatloaf, pizza or casseroles shouldn¡¯t be left in the refrigerator more than four days. Refrigerate raw poultry and ground meats for no more than one to two days.  Clean the exterior ¨C Keep your refrigerator free of dust and lint. Clean the condenser coil several times a year with a brush or vacuum cleaner to remove dirt, lint or other accumulations to ensure efficiency and maintain proper temperature. Cleaning your pantry will save you money by keeping you aware of what you have and help you avoid a pantry insect infestation. It will also ensure your foods are safe to consume. Here are some tips for a clean, bug-free pantry:  Check your cans ¨C Discard cans that are leaking, rusted, bulging or badly dented. Never use food from cracked jars, jars with loose or bulging lids, or any container that spurts liquid when you open it.  Throw out any food you suspect is spoiled ¨C Never taste food to determine its safety. Wipe off sticky containers, along with crumbs and spills on your pantry shelves with all-purpose cleaner, vinegar, or warm soap and water.  Check the dates on your foods ¨C ¡°USE by¡± date indicates that perishable products should be consumed by the date listed on the package or discarded once the date has passed. ¡°BEST if Used By¡± date informs shoppers that after the specified date, the shelf-stable product is safe to use or consume, but has exceeded the window of its optimal taste or performance. High-acid canned food such as tomatoes, grapefruit and pineapple have a shelf life of 12 to 18 months beyond their listed dates. Low-acid canned food such as meat, poultry, fish and most vegetables can be kept for two to five years beyond their listed dates ¡ª if the can remains in good condition and has been stored in a cool, clean and dry place. If you have questions about storage times for food or beverages, we recommend downloading our smartphone and tablet application, the FoodKeeper. With more than 150,000 downloads for Android and iOS smartphones, the FoodKeeper is quickly establishing itself as the quick reference go-to guide for safe food storage and preparation.

"White House Fellow in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 02,  A local WIC staff member holds her sleeping baby as she listens to the peer counseling instructor. March is Women¡¯s History month, a time when we highlight everything woman.? In the midst of farming and biofuels, research and forestry would you believe that the USDA also finds time to promote breastfeeding?? The answer is absolutely!? You already know that the agency supports a myriad of nutrition programs to help make America¡¯s children healthy and hunger-free.? Research has shown that there is no better food than breast milk for a baby¡¯s first year of life. Breastfeeding provides many health, nutritional, economical and emotional benefits to mother and baby. Since a major goal of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) Program is to improve the nutritional status of infants, WIC mothers are encouraged to breastfeed their infants. WIC promotes breastfeeding to all pregnant women as the optimal infant feeding choice, unless medically contraindicated.? So what exactly is WIC doing to support breastfeeding?? The answer is a lot! WIC moms and babies who exclusively breastfeed receive an enhanced food package for a longer duration than non-breastfeeding mothers. Exclusively breastfed babies do not receive formula in their package. Breastfeeding moms can receive breast pumps, breast shells, and other nursing supplies to encourage increased initiation and duration of breastfeeding. WIC mom¡¯s who breastfeed receive support through counseling, educational materials, and peer support from fellow WIC moms that have breastfed their babies. We recognize that the food package alone is not enough to change behaviors.? Mother¡¯s need support education, and encouragement to breastfeed.? WIC clinics provide peer counselors, women who can personally relate to other WIC moms, to help support breastfeeding.? Some WIC clinics also provide education to fathers and grandmothers as we recognize that they play a crucial role in a mother¡¯s decision to breastfeed. USDA doesn¡¯t just promote breastfeeding for the clients it serves; we are helping to support women who choose to breastfeed when they return to work at USDA as well.? The Nursing Mother¡¯s Working Group is committed to investigating whether USDA is currently meeting the needs and requirements of its new and expectant mothers who wish to continue lactation after they return to the office.? A Department-wide effort is underway to assess the current state of the USDA Nursing Mother¡¯s Program and identify where improvements need to be made.? The USDA hopes to be a leader in the Federal Government in changing the culture of the workplace to support employees who are devoted to their families.

"USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in  Initiatives  Jun 20,  Josepha preparing amaranth greens for a recent dinner put together by some of our gardeners from Burundi. Every month, USDA shares the story of a woman in agriculture who is leading the industry and helping other women succeed along the way. In honor of World Refugee Day, this month we hear from Josepha Ntakirutimana, a refugee from Rwanda who settled in Tucson, Arizona in . Josepha is now an invaluable part of the Tucson New Roots Program which brings together refugees and their community around production and nutrition education activities. Josepha¡¯s journey to Tucson is a long one ¨C as for any refugee, the memories are sometimes painful. When she was a girl, at the age of 12, Josepha started helping her mom at a local farm before school. Later, she worked on a farm during school holidays and, when she was married, her family had a small plot in town where they could grow vegetables and grains to help reduce food costs. After the war, when she left Rwanda and entered into a refugee camp in Malawi, agriculture continued to help her and her family survive. There wasn¡¯t enough food but she was able to start a garden and grew amaranth, squash, and carrots. Being able to carry out this activity in the refugee camp was a welcome change of pace to the camp life, which was hard and full of uncertainty. Gardening also allows for refugees to have access to fresh food, which is welcomed in refugee camps, where food is very limited in amounts and variety.  Now, Josepha considers it a ¡®great joy of living¡¯ to be able to garden and grow her own vegetables in her new home of Tucson. Agriculture is a thread that connects Josepha¡¯s past, present, and future ¨C and is a veritable lifeline. Her refugee story is a real inspiration. Like all the refugees the IRC works to help resettle in the U.S,. she is a survivor, and we are honored to be working with her to help refugees to start a new life in her community. The IRC has 29 offices and helps? 6,000 - 10,000 new arrivals each year in acclimating to their new communities. Over the past 10 years, the IRC has reshaped expectations for nutritional well-being among its refugee clients, and has developed a multifaceted food security and agriculture program called ¡°New Roots"" to increase the supply of and demand for fresh, culturally appropriate foods within immigrant and refugee communities To learn more about their work please visit www.rescue.org/ and follow on twitter at @theIRC. 1. Josepha, can you share your story with us? As a refugee, what was your journey to the United States like? I was a nurse for 21 years in Rwanda. In , there was a genocide in Rwanda. My husband, four children and I were displaced from southern Rwanda to western Rwanda. There I worked as a nurse at a Hospital with a humanitarian aid organization and my husband worked as an interpreter. Because the organizations trusted us, our coworkers became jealous and falsely accused my husband of participating in the genocide. My husband was summoned to the police station and put in jail. He was jailed in prison in southern Rwanda, where he spent nine years. I consider agriculture to be a very important aid during this tough time in my life. Alongside my career, I was practicing agriculture to be able to feed my children and be able to bring biweekly food to my husband in prison. My husband was freed from jail in , but we fled our country so he would not be detained again. We traveled to Malawi and ended up in a refugee camp. It was my first time outside of my country and it felt like going to hell. I was depressed and could not see my future. Much of the food was spoiled, but I fed my family beans, which were still safe to eat. To feed my family, I would ration the beans to the last month. Eventually, I started a garden of amaranth and squash and would mix the beans with the squash to make them last. After a few years, we moved to another refugee camp in Malawi where I could see people I knew from Rwanda. My mind was renewed. I started to go to school to learn English, tailoring, computer skills and counseling. To support my family, I worked in a tailoring shop. After getting a counseling certificate, I became a school counselor and started a group for unaccompanied minors. I created projects to help them make money while encouraging them to stay in school. After nine years in refugee camps, my family resettled in Tucson, Arizona. Fortunately, after 5 months my husband and I found caregiver jobs and I began interpreting for the IRC. Eventually, I became a Community Well-being Promoter and was able to combine my interpretation skills and my passion for food and agriculture. 2. How has your connection to agriculture changed depending on the country in which you live? The biggest difference is in climate ¨C the desert here is dry and hot ¨C Rwanda is dry and humid. Here there¡¯s use of irrigation systems, but in my native country, we depend only on rain.? I was able to raise animals for compost, but I am not allowed to do that here.? There are many plants that are new to me and each has its own season with new tastes, new textures. 3. What is the New Roots Program? The New Roots program helps refugees to become involved in agriculture and to grow their own food. We connect interested refugees to community garden space and provide them with seeds and other resources. We host trainings to help gardeners transfer their agricultural knowledge to the particular climate of the Sonoran Desert. We also enroll clients in public benefits (such as SNAP and WIC) upon arrival, and we implement a 3-module nutrition education with families in need. 4. Have you experienced culture shock? The trip to the United States was difficult; it was my first time flying. We were served new food in flight.? English was a problem because of the difference in pronunciation. My family thought the United States was cold but when we arrived in Tucson at night it was still 100¡ã F when we got off the plane. I had hoped to continue my nursing and counseling education in the U.S., but the cost of living is too high, making it unaffordable to also pay for my education.? Finding work is difficult in a new country and bringing in an income was my first priority.? 5. From which communities do you receive the most support and what have you learned from them that is the most valuable to you? Most of my support has come from International Rescue Committee and from an elderly Caucasian woman whom I met soon after arriving in Tucson.? We have become as close as mother and daughter and from her I can always receive help and advice. 6. Who are your role models? My mother, who just died in Rwanda, was a hard-worker and a confident lady who introduced me to agriculture.? I have her to thank for my love of agriculture. 7. Where do you see yourself in 5, 10, 20 years; how to get there? In five years, I hope to have developed my back yard into a large garden to raise enough food to feed my family with more that I can sell.? In ten years, I hope to have the mortgage on my home paid off.? In twenty years, I hope to be retired and able to enjoy my garden and my grandchildren. 8. What advice for young women interested in agriculture? Share experiences with others, listen to others and share knowledge, never give up their dreams, no matter what they aspire to be in this world. 9. What¡¯s best advice you receive from someone? To trust in myself. Learning doesn¡¯t stop: continue to learn in different ways as long as you are alive. To learn more and connect with other women leaders in agriculture across the country, we encourage you to visit?

"Celebrate 50 Years of Protecting Animals with APHIS  Many people know that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is the agency tasked with administering the Animal Welfare Act (AWA).? But did you know that this is the 50th anniversary of that Act? In , a Dalmatian named Pepper was stolen from her backyard by a dealer, who then sold her to a hospital.? Pepper was used in research and subsequently died.? The public outcry was, understandably, enormous, including coverage in several major magazines.? As a result, Congress passed the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act ¨C the precursor to the AWA ¨C in , and tasked the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ensure the health and wellness of animals used in research.  Tanya Espinosa, APHIS Public Affairs Specialist  Posted in  Animals  Plants  Aug 24,   1 Response",What are some common practices or regulations related to animal welfare in agricultural settings?,"The Animal Welfare Act (AWA), administered by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), is a key regulation related to animal welfare in agricultural settings.","There are several common practices and regulations related to animal welfare in agricultural settings. Some of these include: 1. **Provision of adequate food, water, and shelter**: Animals must be provided with enough food, water, and a clean living environment that meets their physical needs. 2. **Humane handling and transport**: Animals must be handled and transported in a way that minimizes stress, injury, and discomfort. 3. **Access to veterinary care**: Farmers are required to provide animals with access to veterinary care when needed, including vaccinations and treatments for diseases. 4. **Protection from extreme temperatures**: Animals must be protected from extreme heat or cold, and provided with adequate ventilation and cooling systems. 5. **Regulations on animal confinement**: Some regulations limit the use of certain types of confinement systems, such as battery cages or gestation crates, which are considered to be inhumane. 6. **Minimum space requirements**: There are guidelines for minimum space requirements for animals raised in confinement settings, such as sow stalls and broiler chicken houses. 7. **Record keeping and reporting**: Farmers are often required to keep records of animal health, nutrition, and welfare, and report any instances of animal abuse or neglect. 8. **Third-party audits and inspections**: Many farms are subject to regular audits and inspections by third-party organizations, such as Animal Welfare Approved (AWA) or the Global Animal Partnership (GAP). 9. **Compliance with animal welfare standards**: Farms must comply with national or international animal welfare standards, such as those set by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) or the National Institute of Animal Agriculture. 10. **Training and education**: Farmers are often required to participate in training programs and educational workshops on animal welfare best practices. Some specific regulations related to animal welfare include: * The US Farm Bill's requirement that farmers who receive federal subsidies must implement certain animal welfare standards, such as providing adequate food, water, and shelter. * The European Union's (EU) Animal Welfare Directive, which sets minimum standards for animal care and treatment across the EU. * The Canadian Horse Protection Act, which prohibits certain types of horse abuse and neglect.

"Will Chestnuts Roast on an Open Fire Again Someday?  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA¡¯s rich science and research portfolio. Today we learn more about how the National Institute of Food and Agriculture invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges. Seventy years ago, when Nat ¡°King¡± Cole first regaled us about roasted chestnuts in The Christmas Song, not many Americans could actually enjoy the treat because American chestnut trees were in dire straits. The predominant tree in Eastern American forests was nearing the tail end of a 50-year blight that killed an astonishing three to five billion trees, making the species functionally extinct. Now, however, researchers supported by USDA¡¯s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) are working to restore the American chestnut and may be only a few years away from bringing back the iconic tree.  Alexandra Wilson, National Institute of Food and Agriculture  Posted in  Research and Science  May 10,   5 Responses",What are some ways that agricultural research can help restore and bring back functionally extinct species?,"1. Developing disease-resistant varieties through breeding programs, such as the American chestnut's blight-resistant trees. 2. Using biotechnology to introduce beneficial traits or genes from related species into the functionally extinct one. 3. Creating controlled-environment nurseries for propagating plants that can be reintroduced into the wild. 4. Conducting ecological studies to understand how the restored species will interact with other organisms and ecosystems. 5. Developing management strategies, such as habitat restoration and population monitoring, to ensure long-term survival of the restored species. Example from the content: The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is working on restoring the American chestnut tree through research and breeding programs.","Agricultural research can contribute to restoring and bringing back functionally extinct species in several ways: 1. **Crop breeding for genetic diversity**: By developing crops with traits from wild relatives, researchers can increase the genetic diversity of crop species, which can also benefit related wild species. This approach can help restore populations of functionally extinct species by reintroducing beneficial traits. 2. **Development of orphan crops**: Orphan crops are traditional crops that have been abandoned due to lack of interest or support. Reviving these crops through research and development can help bring back species that were once functionally extinct, such as the ancient grain Kamut (Triticum turanicum). 3. **Wild relatives of domesticated plants**: Research on wild relatives of domesticated plants can provide insights into how to restore populations of related wild species. For example, studying the genetic diversity of wheat's wild relatives (e.g., Triticum aestivum spp.) can inform efforts to restore functionally extinct species like Einkorn wheat. 4. **Seed banking and conservation**: Seed banks can preserve seeds from threatened or functionally extinct plant species, allowing researchers to study and potentially reintroduce these plants into their natural habitats. 5. **Ecological restoration**: Agricultural research on soil health, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem services can inform efforts to restore degraded ecosystems where functionally extinct species once thrived. 6. **Development of genetic resources for endangered species**: Researchers can develop genetic resources (e.g., improved cultivars or genetically modified organisms) that help conserve and restore populations of endangered or functionally extinct plant species. Examples of success stories include: * The revival of the ancient grain Kamut, which is now grown commercially in several countries. * The development of crops like Triticum aestivum spp. (einkorn wheat), which has been bred to improve its genetic diversity and suitability for small-scale farming. * Conservation efforts for wild relatives of domesticated plants, such as the reintroduction of quinoa's wild relative (Chenopodium pallidicaule) in Chile. These examples demonstrate how agricultural research can contribute to restoring functionally extinct species by developing new crop varieties, improving conservation practices, and promoting ecological restoration.",8.022837209058135e-79,0.2984409799554566,0.04921700223713648,0.1514476614699332,0.8377685546875
"Pacific Southwest Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Research and Science  Mar 08,  Barbara C. Weber in as director of the U.S. Forest Service¡¯s Pacific Southwest Research Station. (Photo courtesy Barbara C. Weber) As the oldest of 11 children, Barbara C. Weber is accustomed to being the ¡°first.¡± With top family ranking comes responsibility, and Weber had plenty of it. Growing up on her family¡¯s 160-acre dairy farm in Bloomington, Wis., Weber, along with her siblings, helped clean the barn, pick up eggs and tend to the animals.? Her innate curiosity and connection to nature led to her love of science. She was the first in her family to go to college, graduating from Viterbo College, a women¡¯s school in LaCrosse, Wis., with a degree in biology. She would go on to earn a master¡¯s degree in entomology at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul and a doctorate in zoology from Southern Illinois University. Few women ranked among the agency¡¯s scientific community when Weber joined in . She became the first woman scientist at the North Central Research Station¡ªwhich later became the Northern Research Station. But being first had its challenges. In , Jackie Robertson, a research entomologist at the Pacific Southwest Research Station became the first to head a research project. Five years later, Weber followed suit. But even as she gathered more experience and prestige in her career as a scientist, Weber was often reminded in both subtle and not-so-subtle ways that she was a woman in a man¡¯s world. She recalls one incident where she arrived with colleagues to a meeting to discuss a project she was spearheading. She was the only woman in the group. While the men mixed and mingled, no one paid any attention to Weber. ¡°They assumed that I was along for the ride, or that I was someone¡¯s wife,¡± Weber said. An embarrassed hush fell over the group when she announced that she was the project leader. ¡°It was fun for me to see their reaction,¡± Weber said. And while Weber managed to keep a lighthearted attitude most of the time, she did admit that at times, the unequal treatment¡ªa snub here, an inappropriate comment there¡ªoccasionally wore on her. But Weber never gave up and through her professionalism proved to be a promising leader. She would go on to work at Forest Service headquarters in Washington, D.C. as a legislative resources specialist, and later staff assistant for planning in the Office of the Deputy Chief for Research. Given all of her ¡°firsts,¡± it was only fitting that Weber become the Forest Service¡¯s first female director of a research station. She headed west to California to lead the Pacific Southwest Research Station in . ?While there, Weber was well-liked by station staff and highly respected for her ability to build consensus. Beyond the science, Weber was instrumental in improving workplace diversity. A consent decree, which specified hiring goals and affirmative action requirements helped pave the way for more women to join the Forest Service in California.? Under Weber¡¯s leadership, the research station received the Chief¡¯s Multicultural Award in . Today, about a third of the Forest Service¡¯s 498 research scientists are women. In , Weber returned to Forest Service headquarters in Washington D.C. to become the associate deputy chief of Research, a position she held until her retirement in . ¡°Barbara broke new ground in everything she did,¡± said Northern Research Station Assistant Director Hao Tran, who worked with Weber from -. ¡°Someone had to pave the way¡ªand she did, in a very elegant and understated way.¡±  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Research and Science  Tags:  Forestry  FS  International Women's Day  Pacific Research Station  Science  Women's History Month",What are some ways to improve workplace diversity in agricultural research stations?,"* Implementing consent decrees that specify hiring goals and affirmative action requirements * Setting aside time to discuss and address unequal treatment and biases, as Barbara C.

For these reasons and more, America¡¯s Harvest Heroes deserve our thanks. Texas Producer Changes his Mind about Leaving the Farm Jonathan Cobb had made up his mind. He was leaving the farm. ¡°I was disillusioned with farming in general because we were just pushing long days and chasing acres and it didn¡¯t seem like there was very much reward,¡± Cobb said. ¡°That quality of life was not very good. My wife was having to work a lot of hours full time and really support the family. Twenty-five hundred acres really didn¡¯t support two families, and we weren¡¯t living extravagant lifestyles by any means.¡± Then came the drought of . ¡°I thought, maybe this is a sign from God ¨C maybe we shouldn¡¯t be farming. Maybe we should move on to something else,¡¯¡± Cobb said. ¡°I was looking into moving down to Austin, Texas and being involved in some urban farming setups.¡± In time, he and his wife Kaylyn put their house on the market and prepared to move, abandoning a century-old tradition of Cobb family farming. Using diverse cover crops and diverse animal grazing, the Cobbs are building soil health on their farm. Photo: Ron Nichols. Shortly after making that painful decision, Cobb¡¯s father asked him to stop by and review some soil test results that had just arrived at USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service¡¯s office in Temple, Texas. But before he could complete the chore, Cobb found himself ""trapped"" in a soil health workshop featuring NRCS¡¯ Ray Archuleta and Willie Durham. Too polite to leave, he took a seat on the front row. Within minutes, Cobb was entranced by what he was hearing from the presenters and the presentation he was seeing with his own eyes. What he heard that morning from the soil health presenters rekindled a passion and love that conventional agriculture had nearly extinguished. ¡°By the end of the day I knew I was going to stay and be a part of the paradigm shift.¡± Cobb said. Since that fateful day, the Cobb¡¯s have downsized their farm from 2,500 acres to 450 and transitioned from row crops to cover crops with multi-species livestock grazing systems. ¡°We planted over a thousand acres of cover crops the very next year, got rid of all of the tillage equipment, and just dove in,¡± he says.? Cobb admits his farming operation is still evolving, but improving soil health remains the central goal. ¡°One very high priority is to help with the soil and building up the soil and the carbon in the soil,¡± he says. ¡°We will probably make thousands of mistakes but we¡¯ll learn along the way.¡± Whatever happens, he says, ¡°The goal is to build the soil.¡± While Cobb¡¯s new business model hasn¡¯t fully evolved, he and his family are already reaping some of the intrinsic rewards he fondly remembered as a child growing up on the farm ¨C like enjoying the smell of blooming clover in the evening and watching the sun rise on a warm summer day. ¡°If we can make a living and stay here then we couldn¡¯t ask for anything more,¡± he says.

This blog focuses on two heroes of a different kind of harvest ¨C clean, renewable energy that is . I spent some time in Montana earlier this month to attend the Harvesting Clean Energy conference in Billings. We talked about options for continuing to support clean energy development, whether it's bio-based, geothermal, solar, or wind ¨C and how rural America fits in to the picture of clean energy development. Our Rural Energy for America Program was, unsurprisingly, a key focus by the participants. Having been reauthorized by the recent Farm Bill, Congress put REAP in a position to have very real impact on clean energy development in our rural communities. If properly leveraged with other programs, both private and public, and investment from the private sector ¨C the funding made available by Congress could conceivably have a billion-dollar impact on clean energy development in our nation. Red Lodge Ales owner Sam Hoffmann (middle) explains his brewery¡¯s thermal solar heating system to Montana State Director Janelle Gustafson (l) and Deputy Under Secretary Lillian Salerno (r). Hoffmann used the Rural Energy for America Program to purchase and install the thermal system. What strikes me the most is, how many of the projects to this point have been implemented. Rather than just the large complexes ¨C which certainly have their place in the overall picture ¨C rural America has responded by implementing small-scale projects, often at an individual business level, that have had noteworthy impact on the energy structure in their communities. While in Montana, I was able to see first-hand how these small scale projects have made a positive change on not just the carbon footprint and energy consumption of rural small businesses, but on their operational bottom line. I visited Red Lodge, Montana, a small community southwest of Billings that acts as a gateway in to Yellowstone National Park via the Beartooth Highway. Two particular businesses stood out for me, the Yodeler Motel, and Red Lodge Ales. Both companies had made investments in their businesses through the Rural Energy for America Program, and done so on a relatively small scale ¨C yet had seen a direct and positive impact on their operations due to the cost savings from the renewable energy sources. Harnessing the sun's radiant thermal energy to heat water, both the Yodeler and Red Lodge Ales have utilized the water in different ways to benefit their businesses. The Yodeler uses the heated water in their boiler to heat the rooms and common areas of the historic motel on the south end of Red Lodge. Mac Dean of the Yodeler Motel in Red Lodge, Mont. explains the thermal transfer system that supplies the motel's boiler with heated water, providing warmth to the Yodeler's rooms and common areas. Red Lodge Ales takes the pre-heated water, and superheats it to clean their brewing tanks, as well as maintain the necessary heat to brew their beer. It's a prime example of two different businesses using similar technology to harvest the abundant, clean, and free energy around us to benefit not only the businesses themselves ¨C and their bottom line ¨C but to benefit their community and the environment as a whole. I'm proud that USDA Rural Development could play a role in that.

"Deputy Secretary in  USDA Results  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Initiatives  Mar 08,  Rossie Fisher, co-owner of Brookview Farm in Manakin-Sabot, VA. March 8 is International Women's Day. Today, March 8th, is International Women¡¯s Day. What better day to recognize the incredible achievements of women in agriculture? Women have always played a key role on the farm or ranch. Traditionally, women often kept the books and ensured the solvency of the business while men ran the day-to-day production operation. That is still the case in many households, but these days, we are seeing more and more women take a lead role in farm operations as well. In ¨C the year of USDA¡¯s most recent agricultural census ¨C some 30 percent of farm operators in the U.S. were women. That¡¯s a 19 percent increase over the census. Fourteen percent of U.S. farms listed women as the principal operator in , meaning that women made the day-to-day decisions on the farm. (Women listed as farm operators, rather than principal operators, likely run the farm along with a partner or spouse). That¡¯s a 24 percent increase over . Individual states are showing even more involvement of women in farming. Arizona and New Hampshire have the greatest number of farms whose principal operator is a woman; one out of three New Hampshire farms is run by a woman, more than twice the national average. We know that American agriculture is constantly innovating to meet new demands. Women are part of a new wave of innovation in the industry. Women-operated farms tend to be very diverse, producing more vegetables, fruit and nuts, horticultural crops, poultry and sheep or goats than male-operated farms. They are also smaller on average, suggesting that they may engage in more direct-to-consumer sales or sell to local grocers, restaurants, or institutions. These strategies require new, creative business models and innovative production methods. And women are leading the way. As a historically disadvantaged group, women face unique challenges entering agriculture. I¡¯m proud of USDA¡¯s efforts to meet the needs of women farmers through training and business planning programs, mentorship opportunities, support for value-added product development, and our efforts to build strong local food systems through USDA¡¯s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative. You can learn more about USDA¡¯s support for women in agriculture by searching for projects on the KYF Compass Map using the search term ¡°women.¡± Today, let¡¯s all take some time to thank women for their hard work on farms, ranches and in rural communities.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Massachusetts in  Conservation  Oct 29,  Al Rose discusses his fourth-generation Red Apple ¡°green¡± Farm with NRCS¡¯ Soil Conservationist Dave Bacon. NOTE: This week on the USDA Blog, we'll feature the stories of America's Harvest Heroes who, like farmers across the nation, are working this harvest season to secure the bounty of healthy food American agriculture is renowned for. From laying the foundation for the next generation of farmers putting down roots in rural America, supporting the fruit and vegetable growers who are helping to build healthier communities, bolstering new markets for the products of agricultural innovation, to harvesting renewable energy that is made in Rural America, with USDA's support our farmers are yielding strong results for every American. For these reasons and more, America¡¯s Harvest Heroes deserve our thanks. A towering, craggy McIntosh apple tree in the center of the orchard at Red Apple Farm in Phillipston, Massachusetts, has weathered 113 winters, borne many tons of crisp, tart apples and fed generations of customers. Planted in , it¡¯s the oldest commercially planted McIntosh tree in New England and possibly the country. Thanks to care by generations of the Rose family, that ancient apple tree still produces fruit today. Al Rose and his wife Nancy, who operate the fourth-generation farm, have introduced an innovative, modern growing system just a stone¡¯s throw from the century McIntosh. To ensure success in an area that sees its share of dry summers, the Roses sought the help of USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). ¡°It may be challenging, but I think we¡¯ve got a natural environment that¡¯s conducive to growing great apples,¡± said Al Rose. ¡°We have cold nights for a good part of the growing season, which are great for the color of the apples. Fall without apples in New England just wouldn¡¯t be the same.¡± A micro-irrigation system was installed to deliver water from the pond directly to the young trees. This type of watering system conserves more water than a conventional overhead sprinkler system. ¡°We¡¯re at one of the highest elevations for orchards in New England ¨C 1,250 feet,¡± said Rose, standing in the orchard on a windy day. ¡°We have a wind turbine that¡¯s been cranking today. Between that and our solar panels, we¡¯re a red farm and a ¡®green¡¯ farm.¡± Red Apple Farm is protected under the state Agricultural Preservation Restriction (APR) program. ?Through a state grant program to help the viability of APR farms, Rose developed a business plan that called for planting an acre of trees in a new trellis system. ¡°We¡¯re not creating more land here; we have to be more productive on the land that we do have,¡± explained Rose. The ¡°fruit wall¡± is small trees, shallow-rooted and spaced as close as a foot apart. ¡°It¡¯s the most productive way and, from a cost standpoint, it¡¯s easier to maintain,¡± said Rose. ¡°But, to do that, you have to have a pond in place.¡± So, Rose reached out to NRCS for help with irrigation. ¡°I know they have the technical expertise to do it right and give us advice,¡± said Rose, who also got financial help through the federal Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) program. Dave Bacon, NRCS Soil Conservationist, has been assisting Red Apple Farm for more than a decade. He explained that, in Massachusetts, the AMA program is used for drought mitigation. ¡°We didn¡¯t want to have an acre¡¯s worth of apple trees fail because there was no irrigation water available,¡± said Bacon. Al Rose stands near the McIntosh tree, planted in . Bacon explained that soil indicated that there was adequate ground water to create a pond, a more reliable water source than drilling a well. With well drilling, there is a risk that there won¡¯t be enough water to meet the plants¡¯ needs.? A micro-irrigation system was installed to deliver water from the pond directly to the young trees. This type of watering system conserves more water than a conventional overhead sprinkler system. ¡°As we slowly change to the newer high production, higher density plantings, it¡¯s going to make us a lot more successful for the current generation and future generations,¡± said Rose. ¡°If you want to do something right, get the experts involved,¡± said Rose.? ¡°NRCS has experts; they know how to do it and they know how to do it right. You¡¯re going to get great advice and great people are there to support you.¡±  Category/Topic:  Conservation  Tags:  apple orchard  Conservation  harvest heroes  NRCS","What innovative water conservation method did the Red Apple Farm in Massachusetts use to support their apple tree growth, and how did it improve their productivity?","The Red Apple Farm in Massachusetts used a micro-irrigation system, which delivers water from a pond directly to the young trees.

It's possible that this is a fictional farm or not a well-known establishment. However, I can provide some general information on water conservation methods used by apple farms and their potential impact on productivity. Some apple farms have implemented innovative water conservation methods such as drip irrigation, which delivers water directly to the roots of the trees, reducing evaporation and runoff. This method has been shown to improve fruit quality, increase yields, and reduce water consumption. Another method is using precision irrigation systems that use sensors and computer algorithms to monitor soil moisture levels and adjust watering schedules accordingly. This approach can help prevent overwatering and ensure optimal tree growth while minimizing water waste. It's worth noting that these methods are not exclusive to the Red Apple Farm (if it exists) or Massachusetts, but rather general practices used by many farms worldwide to conserve water and improve productivity.

Experts have projected that reducing food waste by just 15 percent would provide the equivalent of enough food for more than 25 million Americans every year. That¡¯s why my agency, USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), decided to help tackle the problem by sponsoring the Terminal Market Food Waste Challenge.?

Bruce Summers, Agricultural Marketing Service Associate Administrator  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 06,   Respond to this story",What percentage reduction in food waste would provide enough food for approximately 25 million Americans every year?,15 percent.,"According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), reducing food waste by 50% globally could produce enough food to feed an additional 870 million people. This is based on the FAO's estimate that one-third of all food produced worldwide, approximately 1.3 billion tonnes, gets lost or wasted. To determine the percentage reduction in food waste needed to provide enough food for approximately 25 million Americans every year, we can make a few assumptions and calculations: * The average American consumes about 2,500 calories per day. * This translates to approximately 915 pounds (415 kg) of food per person per year, based on an estimate from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). * For simplicity, let's assume we are talking about a reduction in household waste. Using these assumptions, if we want to provide enough food for 25 million Americans every year, this would require approximately 22.875 billion pounds (10.37 billion kg) of food per year. Now, using the FAO estimate that one-third of all food produced worldwide gets lost or wasted, and considering that in the United States alone, about 30-40% of the food supply is lost or wasted, we can make a rough calculation for household waste. Let's assume an average reduction rate that could provide enough food. For simplicity and to ensure a safe amount of food, we will aim for an equivalent to half of the current loss in terms of percentage reduction per year. Using this estimate and considering we are discussing reducing losses at the consumption level (households), let's calculate: A 50% reduction would be too aggressive and might not accurately represent achievable targets. However, a rough estimate could consider halving household waste: 50% / (30-40%) = 1.25 to 1.67 times less waste from households Converting this into percentage terms: A reduction of food waste by approximately 62.5% to 80% at the consumption level would need to occur. Given these rough estimates and focusing on household waste, we're assuming conservatively that the entire calculation is based on achievable targets for a broad average.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8080857396125793
"Associate Deputy Administrator for APHIS Animal Care in  Animals  Plants  Jul 14,  Dr. Morgan, pictured here with her horse, Belle, knew at a young age that she wanted to be a veterinarian when, on a road trip with her parents, she saw the horses in Louisville and Lexington. Hello, I¡¯m Dr. Andrea (Andy) Morgan, Associate Deputy Administrator of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)¡¯s Animal Care (AC) program. In , when I hadn¡¯t been out of vet school long and was working at a small animal practice, I got ahold of a brochure about APHIS¡¯ Public Veterinary Practice Career Program. I was interested in working not just with small animals but with other animals, too¡ªexotic animals and horses, to name a few. So I joined APHIS that year, and here I am, still working for the agency 26 years and many important experiences later. My current position involves a lot of strategic planning and working within the program to find ways USDA can be more effective with Animal Welfare Act and Horse Protection Act inspections. Before I joined the AC program, I held a number of positions in APHIS¡¯ Veterinary Services. I served as National Incident Commander for the U.S. response to an Exotic Newcastle Disease outbreak and National Coordinator for the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) surveillance program. The most memorable experience I¡¯ve had at APHIS was ensuring the U.S. Equestrian Team horses could travel to the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. An unidentified equine illness hit New England that year before all of the ates. The European Union (EU) Commission wanted to ban the entry of all U.S. horses into EU Member States. I was a staff vet with APHIS¡¯ National Center for Import/Export, and I had to assure the EU that none of the Equestrian Team horses had been affected by the outbreak. Dr. Morgan shares her insights and perspectives with APHIS employees. For several hours, my EU counterpart Dr. Bernard Van Goethem and I were on the phone and faxing proposals back and forth. Keep in mind this was before e-mail was widely used. We were just two vets, hashing it out across the ocean. Dr. Van Goethem would share the proposals with EU Member States¡¯ Chief Veterinary Officers and get back to me. Eventually, we all agreed on a proposal. I was especially glad to learn that Irish, one of the horses that wouldn¡¯t have made it to Spain without those efforts, won the Olympic bronze medal in show jumping. It¡¯s the coolest thing to negotiate on behalf of the United States, or to make things happen in any number of ways when there¡¯s a problem to solve. Are there challenges when working as a public veterinarian? Always. But it¡¯s like swimming¡ªthere are no standard operating procedures¡ªyou have to just dive in. I¡¯ve learned a lot about myself and my core values in my time at APHIS. This is my legacy.

Whether potatoes or pork, mangos or cotton, soybeans or almonds, ag promotion groups help consumers make informed choices and learn about new products. Although all ag promotion groups do have a similar goal and purpose ¨C to pool their resources to increase demand and long-term economic growth for their? industries ¨C they all accomplish this in different ways, tailoring their efforts to apply strategies that work best for each commodity. The United States Potato Board (USPB) is one of several national ag promotion groups operating under the oversight of USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS).? They are the central organizing force in implementing programs that increase demand for potatoes at home and abroad. This group provides the ideas, information, tools and inspiration for the industry to unite in achieving common goals. Anchored by a strong foundation of market and consumer research and analysis, the USPB domestic and international potato marketing programs include:?advertising, nutrition science, public relations, retail and foodservice marketing, and issues management.?Whether the potato is grown for fresh, frozen, chip, dehydrated or seed use, the USPB is dedicated to positioning potatoes as a nutrition powerhouse¡ªtruly, goodness unearthed.? And all of these efforts mean more economic growth and market viability for American potato farmers. For Fiscal Year (July ¨C June ), U.S. potato exports were a record $1.6 billion, an increase of 4% over FY12 The volume of exports increased 4% to 1,561,896 metric tons, or 66 million hundredweight at the fresh weight equivalent The volume of U.S. exports has increased 26% over the past five marketing years, led by a 62% increase in fresh, a 36% increase in dehydrated and a 17% increase in frozen For the first six months of FY14, the volume of exports of frozen products is up 2%, dehydrated is up 10% and fresh is up 2% The National Mango Board¡¯s (NMB) mission is to increase the demand for fresh mangos in the U.S. by conducting promotion, market and production research. The NMB accomplishes this through three core programs: marketing, research and industry relations. Understanding consumer purchasing behaviors is key to increasing mango consumption in the U.S. The NMB conducts ongoing consumer research to explore consumer awareness, knowledge about mangos, buying habits, barriers to purchase and many other facets of consumer attitudes relative to mangos. ?Results from their consumer research help create, support and guide marketing efforts and messages to increase mango demand. Demand is the most direct and practical way to monitor consumer purchasing behavior since it reflects all of the conditions impacting buying decisions. Most of the changes in the demand for mangos come from attracting new households to buy (market penetration) and far less in changing the number of mangos purchased (market intensity) per buyer. With NMB programs, market penetration increased from under 3% in to over 13% in . Mango availability per capita has increased 53% since to an estimated 2.87 pounds per year in . This means that increased mango sales are related to more consumers perceiving mangos as an option, and much of this is due to NMB¡¯s work.? Through market penetration more consumers are likely to make mangos a routine part of their diets.? By providing promotional information to increase consumer awareness of the fruit, NMB¡¯s efforts convince more potential customers to give them a try. Whether engaging in consumer research, nutrition education or advertising, ag promotion groups help America¡¯s farmers and agribusinesses navigate through marketing challenges, opening doors to new markets and broadening our food options. Results from consumer research conducted by the National Mango Board helps create, support and guide marketing efforts and messages to increase mango demand. Increased consumer demand means economic viability for mango producers, importers and businesses.

In the municipality of Lares, Puerto Rico, lies Alturas de Casta?er, a small, mountainous community that is home to 24 agricultores and their families. The agricultores - or farm workers - work hard year-round to produce coffee, bananas, root vegetables and citrus fruits that are then sold in local markets and to area restaurants. Before coming to the community of Alturas de Casta?er, many families lived in cramped conditions, sometimes with two or three other families.? Conditions were unsanitary and children were constantly sick.? Some homes did not even have roofs, and residents suffered dangerous exposure to the natural elements, including torrential rains during hurricane season. Alturas de Casta?er resident Maria Rodriguez and her husband recall renting a house that they could barely afford. The home was in disrepair, they had to use a ladder as a makeshift set of front steps to their home, and finding snakes and rats in their living space was commonplace. With the help of USDA Rural Development's Farm Labor Housing Program, the Municipality of Lares was able to build an affordable 24-home rental community, Alturas de Casta?er, dedicated solely to farm workers and their families. After moving into this community, living conditions improved dramatically for many residents. Residents like Jomar, an agricultor who uses a wheelchair for mobility; the closets and kitchen in his Alturas de Casta?er home were built for wheelchair accessibility. The community is quiet and clean, the children of the farm workers have a safe place to play, and the homes are well maintained by an experienced management company. It's affordable, too; farm workers living in this community are only to pay 30 percent of their income towards rent. Built in , Alturas de Casta?er was a product of a partnership between USDA Rural Development, Rural Opportunities Puerto Rico, Inc. (ROPRI), an affiliate of PathStone, the Puerto Rico Department of Housing, and the Federal Home Loan Bank. USDA and ROPRI have realized the success of the investment despite the significant challenges in planning and building a community in rural Puerto Rico. USDA and its partners are now looking forward to the development of self-sustaining community gardens which will also support a summer food program for children. An investment like Alturas de Casta?er, the only one of its kind in Puerto Rico, helps us realize that a better future is possible for rural Puerto Ricans.?

USDA Rural Development was the agency NAHFH felt was best met that need. NAHFH utilized a community revitalization grant administered by the Northeast Nebraska Economic Development District (NENEDD), managed by Northeast Economic Development, Inc. (NED, Inc.) to demolish the dilapidated property that previously existed on the lot site.? The new construction was completed through donations of supplies and expertise, sweat equity and primarily through the building trades program at Northeast Community College. USDA Rural Development worked with Donald Parkos, the potential homebuyer, throughout the application process.? USDA Rural Development provided the first mortgage for him to purchase the home.? In addition to this, Parkos received down payment assistance.? Through the hard work of a number of partners, Donald was able to afford a newly built home for less than $100,000.? Today he resides in his 1,100 square foot, two bedroom, one bath home. The partnership had an impact far beyond that of just homeownership. The process helped revitalize a neighborhood by placing a nice, newly built home where a dilapidated structure once stood.

"Deputy Administrator of the National Organic Program in  Food and Nutrition  May 16,  Organic is one label that most consumers are familiar with, but understanding what ¡°organic¡± really means can help consumers make informed choices. If a product meets these requirements, its label may include a statement like, ¡°Made with organic oats and cranberries.¡± A more generic statement like, ¡°Made with organic ingredients,¡± is not allowed. This is the sixteenth installment of the Organic 101 series that explores different aspects of the USDA organic regulations. Deciphering food labels and marketing claims can be a challenge for the average consumer.? Companies use production and handling claims as a way to differentiate their products in the marketplace. Organic is one label that most consumers are familiar with, but understanding what ¡°organic¡± really means can help consumers make informed choices. USDA certified organic products have strict production and labeling requirements. ?The U.S. organic industry is regulated by the National Organic Program (NOP), part of USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service.? Certified organic products are produced without excluded methods such as genetic engineering or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). ?The organic standards are designed to allow natural substances in organic farming while prohibiting synthetic substances. There are four distinct labeling categories for certified organic food products ¨C 100% Organic, Organic, Made with organic ***, and specific organic ingredients.? There are also labeling requirements for organic livestock feed. Today, I wanted to talk more about the ¡°Made with organic***¡± category. Multi-ingredient agricultural products in the ¡°Made with organic ***¡± category must contain at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients (not including salt or water).? These products may contain up to 30 percent of allowed non-organic ingredients. ?All ingredients ¨C including the 30 percent non-organic ingredients ¨C must be produced without GMOs. If a product meets these requirements, its label may include a statement like, ¡°Made with organic oats and cranberries.¡±? A more generic statement like, ¡°Made with organic ingredients,¡± is not allowed. If an ingredient is identified in the ¡°Made with organic ***¡± statement, it must be a truthful claim. This means the product can only contain organic forms of that specific ingredient.?? For example, if the label states ¡°Made with organic corn¡± all raw and processed corn-based ingredients¡ªsuch as blue corn, corn oil, and corn starch¡ªmust be certified organic. The USDA organic regulations provide a set list of ¡°food groups.¡± All raw and processed forms of ingredients in that food group must be certified organic. For example, if a product states, ¡°Made with organic grains,¡± all ingredients derived from grains¡ªsuch as enriched wheat flour, corn oil, or oats¡ªmust be certified organic.? If a product contains both organic and non-organic forms of the same ingredient, they must be identified separately in the ingredient statement. ¡°Made with organic***¡± products can¡¯t use the USDA organic seal, but must identify the USDA-accredited certifying agent. You can look for the identity of the certifier on a packaged product for verification that the product meets USDA¡¯s organic standards.? Certifying agents are accredited by the USDA, and are responsible for ensuring that the USDA organic products meet or exceed all organic standards. The NOP recently put out final guidance on this labeling category to ensure consistency in labeling practices throughout the organic industry.? Consumers purchase organic products expecting that they maintain their organic integrity from farm to market, and USDA is committed to meeting these expectations.?

However, it provides estimates for total expenditures on children by families and breaks down these costs into categories such as housing, childcare, education, and other expenses. If you're looking for information on how to calculate or find this specific percentage, I can help with a general search-based answer.","According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the average cost of raising a child from birth to age 18 is approximately $233,610. This estimate includes expenses such as: 1. Food: $31,970 2. Housing: $93,510 3. Healthcare: $14,370 4. Childcare and education: $13,610 5. Transportation: $7,380 6. Clothing: $8,650 7. Entertainment, miscellaneous expenses: $10,440 Breaking down the food category specifically, the USDA estimates that a family spends around 16% to 20% of their net income on food for a child from birth to age 18. To give you a better idea, here's a rough breakdown of the estimated costs based on the average annual income levels: * Assuming a middle-income family with an annual income between $50,000 and $75,000 (according to the USDA's definition), their net income would be around $35,000 to $50,000. * Based on this, the estimated cost of food for a child from birth to age 18 would be approximately 10% to 15% of the family's total expenses. So, while it's difficult to provide an exact percentage without knowing more about the specific family, the general estimate is that around 10% to 15% of a middle-income family's expenses go towards food for a child from birth to age 18.",7.41531743977068e-79,0.2916666666666667,0.04895104895104895,0.13194444444444445,0.8392918109893799

The Experimental Forests and Rangelands network offers lesson plans, videos and other educational material for kids of all ages to learn about things like bird migration, water temperature, or what influences survival of sugar maple seedlings. ¡°Experimental Forests and Rangelands are world-renowned for the depth and breadth of their science and contributions to forest and range management,¡± said Lindsey Rustad, current chair of the Forest Service national Experimental Forests and Rangelands working group. ¡°We are equally proud of our contributions to education and outreach in our efforts to introduce students of all ages ¨C K through gray ¨C to Experimental Forests and Rangelands through lessons and classroom activities.¡± Ellie¡¯s Log, set in H.J. Andrews EFR, is an award winning book and teachers¡¯ guide about phenology in a forest. (USDA Forest Service graphic) Experimental Forests and Rangelands are a vital resource for the Forest Service. Unlike scientific experiments carried out in laboratories, dynamic forest and range ecosystems are complex and not easily controlled. Studying them can be tricky. Fortunately, Experimental Forests and Rangelands offer access to natural testing grounds for exploring puzzling forest and range management issues, such as how to contend with invasive species, wildfire and climate change. The educational materials from Experimental Forests and Rangelands provide a window into some of the research that these sites make possible. Spanning ates, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, they offer an unparalleled opportunity to view local, regional and national environmental change at the continental scale. Besides their comprehensive scope and stunning diversity, another distinguishing feature of Experimental Forests and Rangelands, is the long-term nature of their mission. Some collection efforts stretch back more than 100 years and others are projected to continue for another two centuries. The value of this information is immense, as there are very few comparable opportunities to capture long-term changes on forests and rangelands. Until a few decades ago, scientists and managers could not have predicted they would need to understand the effects of a changing climate on our natural resources. Fortunately, we have the long-term records from Experimental Forests and Rangelands. By giving us the and tools we need to understand large-scale and long-term changes, they continue to help us solve global natural resource challenges.

"Economist at the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 13,  Families Projected to Spend an Average of $233,610 Raising a Child Born in . USDA recently issued Expenditures on Children by Families, . This report is also known as ¡°The Cost of Raising a Child.¡± USDA has been tracking the cost of raising a child since and this analysis examines expenses by age of child, household income, budgetary component, and region of the country. Based on the most recent from the Consumer Expenditures Survey, in , a family will spend approximately $12,980 annually per child in a middle-income ($59,200-$107,400), two-child, married-couple family. Middle-income, married-couple parents of a child born in may expect to spend $233,610 ($284,570 if projected inflation costs are factored in*) for food, shelter, and other necessities to raise a child through age 17. This does not include the cost of a college education. Where does the money go? For a middle-income family, housing accounts for the largest share at 29% of total child-rearing costs.? Food is second at 18%, and child care/education (for those with the expense) is third at 16%. Expenses vary depending on the age of the child. As families often need more room to accommodate children, housing is the largest expense. We did the analysis by household income level, age of the child, and region of residence. Not surprising, the higher a family¡¯s income the more was spent on a child, particularly for child care/education and miscellaneous expenses. Expenses also increase as a child ages.? Overall annual expenses averaged about $300 less for children from birth to 2 years old, and averaged $900 more for teenagers between 15-17 years of age. Teenagers have higher food costs as well as higher transportation costs as these are the years they start to drive so insurance is included or a maybe a second car is purchased for them. Regional variation was also observed. Families in the urban Northeast spent the most on a child, followed by families in the urban West, urban South, and urban Midwest.? Families in rural areas throughout the country spent the least on a child¡ªchild-rearing expenses were 27% lower in rural areas than the urban Northeast, primarily due to lower housing and child care/education expenses. Child-rearing expenses are subject to economies of scale. That is, with each additional child, expenses on each declines. For married-couple families with one child, expenses averaged 27% more per child than expenses in a two-child family.? For families with three or more children, per child expenses averaged 24% less on each child than on a child in a two-child family.? This is sometimes referred to as the ¡°cheaper by the dozen¡± effect. Each additional child costs less because children can share a bedroom; a family can buy food in larger, more economical quantities; clothing and toys can be handed down; and older children can often babysit younger ones. Food costs have decreased over the years thanks to increased efficiency in American agriculture. This report is one of many ways that USDA works to support American families through our programs and work. It outlines typical spending by families from across the country, and is used in a number of ways to help support and education American families.? Courts and state governments use this to inform their decisions about child support and foster care payments.? Financial planners use the information to provide advice to their clients, and families can access our Cost of Raising a Child calculator, which we update with every report on our website, to look at spending patterns for families similar to theirs. This Calculator is one of many tools available on MyMoney.gov, a government research and clearinghouse related to financial education. This year we released the report at a time when families are thinking about their plans for the New Year.? We¡¯ve been focusing on nutrition-related New Year¡¯s resolutions ¨C or what we are referring to as Real Solutions - on our MyPlate website, ChooseMyPlate.gov.? This report and the updated calculator can help families as they focus on financial health resolutions.? This report will provide families with a greater awareness of the expenses they are likely to face while raising children. In addition to the report and the calculator, we also have a dedicated section on ChooseMyPlate.gov that provides tips and tools to aid families and individuals in making healthy choices while staying on a budget.

Several factors have contributed to this trend: 1. **Improved crop yields**: Increased use of technology, such as precision agriculture, genetically modified seeds, and irrigation systems, has led to higher crop yields per acre. This means that farmers can produce more food with less land, reducing the cost of production. 2. **Lower input costs**: Efficiency gains have allowed farmers to reduce their inputs, including labor, fuel, and equipment expenses. These savings are then passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices. 3. **Increased economies of scale**: Larger farms and agricultural companies can take advantage of economies of scale, purchasing inputs at lower prices and achieving greater efficiency in production. This competitiveness is often reflected in lower market prices. 4. **Reduced waste and spoilage**: Advanced technology and better logistics have helped to minimize food waste and spoilage, reducing the financial burden on farmers and ultimately benefiting consumers. The cumulative effect of these factors has been a significant decrease in food costs for American families over the past few decades. According to data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the average cost of a food basket (the total cost of all food items) per month decreased by approximately 25% between 1980 and 2022, adjusted for inflation. Specifically: * The average monthly expenditure on food in the United States dropped from $432.50 in 1980 to around $344.40 in 2022, according to the USDA's Economic Research Service. * The Food Price Index (FPI), which tracks changes in consumer prices for a basket of foods, has shown a steady decline since its peak in 2008. * The overall cost of food as a share of disposable personal income (DPI) has decreased significantly over the past few decades, from about 17.6% in 1980 to around 9.7% in 2022, according to data from the USDA's Economic Research Service. These statistics illustrate that increased efficiency in American agriculture has indeed led to lower food costs for American families, making nutritious and affordable food more accessible to a wider population.",0.00871359831378094,0.06486486486486487,0.03260869565217391,0.06486486486486487,0.84629887342453
"Director, National Grain Center, GIPSA in  Research and Science  Oct 29,  Sec. Tom Vilsack visited the grain grading laboratory of GIPSA's Board of Appeals and Review (BAR) and the Grading Service Laboratory (GSL) on October 23, . BAR staff explain their grading review process while BAR Chairman Jim Whalen looks on. The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration¡¯s (GIPSA) National Grain Center (NGC) was proud to host Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on Wednesday, October 23.? The NGC, located in Kansas City, MO, is home to the Federal Grain Inspection Service¡¯s (FGIS) Technology and Science Division along with staff from FGIS¡¯ Quality Assurance and Compliance Division and Field Management Division. The grain inspectors, scientists and engineers at the NGC provide a broad spectrum of grain inspection services and support within recently renovated state of the art laboratories.?? During the visit, NGC staff demonstrated how they oversee, develop and approve methods and instruments used for grain inspection that ensure the consistent standard of measuring quality essential to grain marketing. Members of the Board of Appeals and Review (BAR) and the Grading Services Laboratory (GSL) described their critical role within the grain inspection process.? When a grain quality factor is measured through sensory evaluation ¨C how the grain looks or smells ¨C all grain inspectors looking at and smelling the grain sample must be looking for exactly the same thing. Tom Weber, Leader of GIPSA's Trace Analysis Laboratory, explains the process of preparing and testing grain samples for the presence of pesticide residues as Dr. Tim Norden, Chief of GIPSA's Analytical Chemistry Branch, and Mary Alonzo, Director of GIPSA's Technology and Science Division, watch. The BAR¡¯s experienced eyes and noses establish the point where a quality factor impacts a grain sample¡¯s overall grade.? The GSL monitors the accuracy of individual grain inspection results while the BAR monitors the overall grain inspection results against the BAR¡¯s standard of performance.? Both resolve appeals of grain inspection results determined at the initial point of inspection.? The BAR¡¯s interpretation is USDA¡¯s final and binding determination. Equating the process to finding a needle in a haystack, Dr. Tim Norden described how specialized instruments allow his team to analyze grain samples for trace amounts of pesticides and mycotoxins. The results are often used to confirm that U.S. grain meets international limits for these harmful chemicals.? Dr. Norden also emphasized that evolving technology requires that his staff and laboratory constantly maintain their skills. The NGC¡¯s Biotechnology Laboratory develops and validates methods to identify genetic events in grain.? Dr. Tandace Bell, Chief, Biotechnology and Analytical Services Branch, discussed the multi-step process used by her team.? Dr. Bell also emphasized the collaborative nature of biotechnology methods development.? GIPSA¡¯s Biotechnology Proficiency Program, now in its tenth year, collaborates with over 200 laboratories around the world to ensure their ability to accurately detect genetic events.? GIPSA also works closely with other USDA agencies with biotechnology programs. Dr. Tandace Bell, Chief of GIPSA's Biotechnology and Analytical Services Branch, discusses with Secretary Vilsack GIPSA's role in supporting agricultural biotechnology.  Test weight and moisture are the most commonly measured quality factors in all types of grain.???FGIS has developed a prototype for a training tool to improve inspector skills. Secretary Vilsack was able to see that technique does indeed make a difference while trying out a test weight trainer being developed by FGIS.? The test weight trainer measures a grain inspector¡¯s strike off technique against the approved standard.? New and experienced grain inspectors can use it to perfect their technique on this critical measurement. FGIS approved two instruments to measure moisture in all officially graded commodities over the past year.? The Unified Grain Moisture Algorithm (UGMA)-Compatible moisture meters offer improved performance under a wider range of conditions.? Dr. Dave Funk, GIPSA¡¯s Chief Scientist, developed the UGMA algorithm that is the basis of the measurement process of the new meters.? Dr. Funk recounted the development process, and demonstrated how the two machines offer equivalent results. The renovated NGC enhances GIPSA¡¯s ability to certify the accuracy and stability of instruments that measure various quality factors in grain. We all thank Secretary Vilsack for allowing us to show him how the NGC and FGIS support U.S. agriculture. TSD engineer Jason Jordon demonstrated to Secretary Vilsack the proper method for leveling off grain in the kettle used to measure test weight.

"Deputy Administrator of the National Organic Program in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  May 14,  Organic certification cost share programs puts organic certification within reach for farms of all sizes. It is of great value to organic farmers and supports the integrity of the organic label. Consumers are increasingly looking for organic products when they visit the supermarket.? Last year, organic products reached a record number of sales, accounting for over $39 billion in U.S. retail sales.? To meet consumer demand, the industry needs more organic operations to produce everything from organic milk to organic granola bars.? Thanks to support from the Farm Bill, USDA has two cost share programs that assist organic farms and businesses with about $11 million per year in certification assistance¨C making it possible for producers and handlers of all sizes to consider organic certification.? Cost share programs support certified operations across the organic supply chain by making certification more affordable. The USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) administers these programs through grants to participating states. In , USDA funding allowed states to issue nearly 10,000 reimbursements worth more than $6 million, helping the organic community thrive and grow.? ""The U.S. is currently experiencing an explosion of demand for certified organic products and our goal is to see that demand is met by U.S. farmers,¡± said Abby Youngblood, Executive Director of the National Organic Coalition.? ¡°We expect that the organic cost share programs will encourage more U.S. farms to certify and/or add another certification scope to meet this demand."" Cost share programs cover a wide range of certification-related expenses, and cover 75 percent of the cost of each certification, up to a maximum of $750 annually.

"Kentucky State Director in  Rural  Jun 09,  Tex Peyton's new home is shown under construction next to the old one. USDA celebrates National Homeownership Month each year in June, and we continue to shine the spotlight on projects across the nation. I wanted to illustrate the work we do to provide ladders of opportunity for rural residents who might not have such an opportunity without the support of USDA Rural Development. I had the pleasure of meeting one such person this week. His name is Tex Peyton and for the past 18 years he lived in a basic two-room house in Eastern Kentucky that lacked indoor plumbing. Thanks to a team of partners that includes USDA Rural Development, Habitat for Humanity, Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and Columbia Pipeline, Peyton now has an affordable energy-efficient house that he is proud to call home ¨C in the community where he grew up in West Liberty. Habitat for Humanity provided the labor to build the home while USDA, along with our partners at Columbia Pipeline and Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, provided the financing for Peyton to purchase it. The house is incredibly energy-efficient and features a Lennox mini-split HVAC system, low e-argon windows and above-standard insulation in the walls, ceiling and floors ¨C building components that will significantly reduce the monthly cost of heating and cooling the home. Persistent poverty counties in Kentucky, like Morgan County where Peyton lives, face challenges that are unique to rural communities. They are often geographically isolated, lack educational opportunities, have high rates of unemployment and are usually underserved ¨C qualities that impede economic opportunity and reduce quality of life. USDA places special emphasis on persistent poverty counties and utilizes a strategy of partnering public resources with local expertise to grow rural economies and create jobs in these poverty-stricken areas. It is because of this emphasis, and the hard work of all our partners, that we had the ability to help Tex Peyton ¨C and the privilege of celebrating with him as he opened his home to us this week.

In light of that, the USDA organic cost share programs help to ensure that these costs don¡¯t discourage those wanting to pursue organic certification. The programs make certification more affordable by reimbursing producers and handlers for as much as 75%¡ªup to a maximum of $750 a year¡ªfor their certification costs. Eligible costs include application fees, inspection fees, travel for certification inspectors, and even postage. ¡°After I figured out how to apply, I found it to be easy,¡± said Gary Philbrick of Philbrick Farms, a Paso Robles, Calif., organization that is certified to produce walnuts. ¡°I just save my receipts and fill out the necessary form and send it in [to the state].¡± State governments administer the organic cost-share funds, appropriated by Congress under the Farm Bill. State governments, usually Departments of Agriculture, work with USDA to administer the program and distribute funds to growers, ranchers, and handlers that are currently certified to the USDA organic regulations. Applicants submit a short form along with proof of certification and an itemized invoice to their state agencies. The state verifies these applications before disbursing funds to eligible organic operations. The program is not competitive, so anyone who is eligible may apply for a reimbursement. ¡°I¡¯m a small farmer, and this program helps me a lot,¡± said Nancy Abramson of Rooster Ridge Farm, a 20-acre operation that devotes one-fifth of its acreage to growing everything from organic citrus to flowers to herbs. ¡°In the beginning, I had a huge fee [getting certified], but the cost share gave me two-thirds of it back. The paperwork is nothing. I think the program is fantastic, and it makes organic farming very affordable for small farmers.¡± Philbrick Farms, based in Paso Robles, Calif., harvests its certified organic walnuts in the fall. With the help of a shaker truck, walnuts fall to the ground and are collected to be sent to the processor for further handling. In particular, smaller operations like Philbrick Farms benefit from USDA¡¯s organic cost share programs, which reimburse producers for as much as 75% of their certification fees. Photo courtesy of Philbrick Farms. When it comes to organic certification, there are many things small growers or handlers have to consider. Affordability is important and often at the top of the list. Organic certification not only fulfills a desired method of farming, but also meets the increased consumer demand for foods farmed and handled organically. ¡°It¡¯s a huge benefit for me that I can advertise that I¡¯m certified organic,¡± said Abramson. ¡°There¡¯s such a marketing plus, and it gets [my product] into grocery stores that require me to be organic.¡± In addition to stocking grocery stores, Abramson takes pride in being able to market her products as organic when selling to consumers at the local farmers market and to the restaurants near her Santa Cruz operation. They all appreciate her organic spinach. The organic cost share program is one of many programs that USDA offers to support emerging, transitioning, or current organic growers and handlers.

"NRCS Oregon in  Conservation  Jan 18,  Sarahlee Lawrence inspects a row of organically grown flowers on her organic farm in the high desert of Central Oregon. Business is blooming for Sarahlee Lawrence and her organic food-and-flower-growing operation, Rainshadow Organics, in the Central Oregon high desert. The 28-year old organic pioneer is proud of her venture and credits USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) as a key component to her success. Lawrence approached NRCS several years ago to start the process of making her farm organic. NRCS helped her plan and implement a nutrient management program and address irrigation issues on both a two-acre vegetable-and-flower plot and a 25-acre field where she grows a mix of cover crops like wheat and clover. NRCS provided assistance to Lawrence through two Farm Bill programs. The Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) Organic Initiative is a nationwide special effort to provide financial assistance to National Organic Program (NOP) certified organic producers, as well as producers in the process of transitioning to organic production. And the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP) is a cooperative program to improve irrigation efficiency and reduce energy consumption. Drip irrigation system made possible by the NRCS Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP). Lawrence is especially pleased with the newly installed drip irrigation system that supplies water to more than 100 varieties of produce and a colorful assortment of flowers on her two-acre parcel. ¡°I could not have afforded or done that by myself,¡± she explains. To be certified organic, a U.S. agricultural operation has to be approved by a USDA Accredited Certifying Agent. Applicants must comply with USDA Organic regulations and submit documentation on their property and farming practices. Transitioning to organic is often a lengthy process, as Lawrence knows. Fields may require preparation to support organic production, including the planting of cover crops, incorporating compost and other soil-enhancing practices. While it takes a while to transition an operation to a Certified Organic one, Lawrence is pleased with her progress. The market for fresh, locally grown food continues to expand in Central Oregon, and her customers include a local hospital, schools and restaurants. Over 100 different types produce are grown on this two-acre organic operation, ranging from beets and beans to cabbage and strawberries. She has also generated a new, dedicated client base through community supported agriculture (CSA). CSA is a way for consumers to directly invest in local farms and receive a regular delivery of fresh fruits, vegetables and other local products. Lawrence looks forward to a bright, rewarding and sustainable future. Find out more about the EQIP Organic Initiative. Check out more conservation stories on the USDA blog. Follow NRCS on Twitter.

"Writer, Analytics Center of Excellence, Office of the Chief Information Officer in  Technology  Jun 17,  Hackathon participants use sensors and robotics to create solutions with USDA . Photo credit: BeMyApp The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently took another step forward on its path to accelerate information technology (IT) modernization and improve how it designs agricultural services and interacts with agricultural producers. This spring, USDA joined technical experts, IT professionals, and application developers for the first hackathon at the Internet of Things (IoT) World Conference in Santa Clara, California. Working collaboratively, the hackathon teams developed new solutions to challenging issues affecting agriculture. What are Hackathons? Hackathons are typically multi-day events where programmers and designers engage in collaborative computer programming. ¡°The goal is not gaining unauthorized access to computer systems, or to necessarily produce a completely polished product,¡± said Andrew Brown, Soil Scientist at the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and mentor at the hackathon. ¡°Rather, hackathons focus on innovation, collaboration, and rapid application development.¡± The hackathon was a fitting channel to address key challenges the USDA is working to solve. ¡°Hackathons are a great way to spur innovation and have the potential to solve real issues,¡± said Ted Kaouk, Chief Officer (CDO) for USDA¡¯s Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). ¡°Farmers and ranchers are using from satellites, weather forecasts, sensors, and other technology for more precise agriculture, which is helping to improve agricultural processes on their operation while increasing profits and providing even better protection to the environment.¡± USDA employees supported the hackathon by serving as judges and mentors for the competition. Inside the Hackathon Hackathon participants were challenged to use USDA¡¯s soil, geospatial, and water forecasting to develop IT products that addressed access to water resources and wise water use to support the sustainability, growth, and viability of agriculture. They were to consider the following in their solutions: limited use of broadband in the rural U.S., cybersecurity, and applying machine learning models to make -driven decisions. The hackathon event was preceded by a discovery interlude where participants explored water challenges in agriculture and brainstormed ideas on possible solutions given their shared knowledge of the domain, technology, , and other areas. A webinar one week prior to the event provided an overview of the hackathon and discussion of the datasets, and messaging application, Slack, was used where USDA mentors could answer questions regarding USDA , tools, and resources. The hackathon was a two-day event that included participation from eight teams ranging from two to seven people. During the event, each team gathered around a table to devise a solution while mentors walked around the room to check in, ask questions, and provide guidance. ¡°Mentors worked one-on-one with hackathon participants to help them conceptualize the challenge and apply the datasets,¡± said Brown. ¡°Most participants had an approach in mind and a general goal and needed help with conceptual aspects of interpreting the . Agricultural production systems have fundamental limits and unique considerations that make subject matter expert input very valuable. The mentor cadre¡¯s practical experience in agriculture and environmental problems was critical to helping teams keep their solutions in the realm of possibility.¡± By 1:00 p.m. on the second day, all code needed to be completed. In the afternoon, each team had three minutes to ¡°pitch¡± their solution. Of the eight groups that were formed, three finalists were selected to present their solutions on stage at the ¡°EcoCenter System Stage¡± located on the Expo Center floor. After the judges reviewed the presentations, Carlos Suarez, NRCS State Conservationist for California, announced ¡°Team Smart Ag¡± as the winner and presented them with the hackathon trophy. Team Smart Ag¡¯s Winning Solution Team Smart Ag developed a low-cost, low-power smart-farming solution that would enable farmers to use devices to monitor a variety of conditions, such as water needs for crops and livestock health. The open-source, conversational artificial intelligence (AI) platform includes a phone application that allows farmers to ask questions, such as ¡°Where do I need to water today?¡±. Team Smart Ag also created a 3D visualization of a hypothetical farm to provide a first-person view of the land, so farmers can locate runoff and areas that need water. In addition to winning the hackathon trophy, Team Smart Ag received prizes valued at $15K total, which included an interview with ITPro Today and opportunities to present their winning solution at highly-visible events at the conference. Hackathons as Part of IT Modernization Model The hackathon follows the White House¡¯s push toward IT modernization through the new Center of Excellence (CoE) model. The model has five focus areas: cloud adoption, IT infrastructure optimization, customer experience, service delivery analytics, and contact centers. USDA, which has been designated a CoE, is using this new model to support the improved use of IT resources throughout the department. The CoE is planning to support additional competitions this year.

"NRCS Mississippi in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Jul 13,  The Stoltzfuses use high tunnels to lengthen the growing season for fresh fruits and vegetables. They built the first high tunnel on their own, and they liked it so much, they decided to build a second one with the help of NRCS.  For many farmers, the lessons of agriculture begin at a young age. This is true for Florence, Miss., farmer Kathy Stoltzfus, who says that her dad taught her what she knows when she was a child. She has fond memories of running barefoot through rice fields and the taste of freshly grown food. Now Stoltzfus and her husband, Bob, run a small farm in central Mississippi, where they raise fruits, vegetables and eggs. Her farming experience, coupled with his grocer experience, makes them a powerhouse at the Mississippi Farmers Market in Jackson, where they sell many different vegetables, including a variety of greens, broccoli, onions, radishes, peas, tomatoes, squash and zucchini. Their eggs are a hit, selling out every Saturday at the market. The Stoltzfuses started selling at the farmer¡¯s market as part-time farmers in , but two years later, the couple decided that they would leave their day jobs to farm full-time. While operating a small farm is hard work, they are happy with their successes and grateful for help from USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), an agency that helps private landowners implement conservation to protect the environment and improve productivity. They learned about NRCS from a fellow producer at the market who told them about the technical assistance and cost-share assistance offered by the agency. Through NRCS¡¯ Environmental Quality Incentives Program, their farm is on pace to be certified as organic as early as the end of this year. NRCS also worked with the couple to build a seasonal high tunnel to keep their fruits and vegetables safe from the cold weather and construct a wildlife fence to protect their crops from hungry deer and rabbits. Bob and Kathy Stoltzfus (center) are working with NRCS conservationists Malcolm Lowe (left) and Mark Scott (right) to make their Florence, Miss. farm more productive. High tunnels have a metal frame wrapped in plastic and are easy and fairly cheap to build. They are designed to extend the growing season into the cold months, helping to increase productivity, keep plants at a steady temperature and even conserve water and energy. NRCS funds high tunnels as part of USDA¡¯s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative, launched in to help local food systems thrive. The Stoltzfuses plan to continue enlarging their operation. With 32 acres at their disposal, they hope to start a small beef cattle operation. Both say that they¡¯re doing what they¡¯re meant to do. Bob enjoys the quiet of the countryside, and Kathy is happy to have returned to her heritage. Learn more about the Environmental Quality Incentives Program Follow NRCS on Twitter.

It's estimated that about 20-25% of the Earth's atmospheric oxygen is produced by phytoplankton (microscopic plant-like organisms) in the oceans, rather than plants on land. However, this still leaves approximately 75-80% of atmospheric oxygen to be attributed to non-biological sources, such as geological processes and chemical reactions. So, to summarize: plants do not produce a significant percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere; instead, they consume CO2 and release O2 as a byproduct of photosynthesis.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8107468485832214
"Legislative and Public Affairs, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in  Animals  Jun 01,  If you are moving this year from a location within the gypsy moth quarantine area to a location outside the quarantine area, please inspect outdoor household items for pests. This is a federal requirement for homeowners moving from gypsy moth quarantine areas. By complying with the law, you may also save a forest. Gypsy moths are destructive, invasive pests! European gypsy moth larvae feed on over 300 plant species including oak, aspen and elm. Gypsy moths have defoliated more than ates since . About 70% of susceptible forests have never been infested and are at risk. Male gypsy moths are brown and smaller than female gypsy moths, which are primarily white. Females lay fuzzy yellowish-brown egg masses from which caterpillars emerge bearing distinctive red and blue dots. Like many invasive insects, gypsy moths can spread long distances with human assistance. They are notorious hitchhikers and lay their eggs on patio furniture, grills, lawn mowers, children¡¯s toys, and other outdoor items. Larvae can hide on untreated firewood or other wooden items such as pallets and crates. The good news is you can help stop them. If you are moving, use the self-inspection checklist (, 3.6 ) and remove any insects or egg masses you find. To learn more about protecting your neighborhood and how you can help, visit USDA¡¯s Your Move Gypsy Moth Free website. To self-certify that your outdoor household items are free of gypsy moth, complete and sign the self-inspection checklist (, 3.6 ) or this online form.

"Coordinator, USDA Caribbean Climate Hub in  Climate  Nov 09,  Four years after Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the Caribbean, there is still an urgency to understand how to best prepare farmers and working lands for future hurricanes. Agricultural advisors are first responders and witnesses of hurricane impacts and strategies used in hurricane preparedness and recovery. A new study by the USDA Caribbean Climate Hub analyzes the experiences of agricultural advisors involved in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to identify gaps in hurricane preparedness and recovery measures. ¡±Climate projections indicate the Caribbean will experience more intense hurricanes, which will increase the challenges to agriculture and food security. There is an urgent need to improve hurricane preparedness to minimize hurricane effects on the agricultural sector in the Caribbean,¡± said Dr. Nora ¨¢lvarez-Berr¨ªos, the study¡¯s lead author. The research team surveyed over 200 advisors from eight institutions who reported on the difficulties farmers face in the recovery process, including lack of supplies such as seeds, fertilizers and animal feed, lack of equipment and machinery for clean-up, impaired access to farms, and the need to expedite government assistance to meet farmers¡¯ needs. Importantly, advisors indicated that while farmers and ranchers do apply recovery practices, the application of short-term preparedness practices is limited, and long-term preparedness practices are generally uncommon. The advisors also reported on the challenges they face in assisting farmers, such as the inability to access farms, transportation issues, and lengthy times to reach farmers. They highlighted the need for more training and educational resources to improve hurricane recovery response, and more tools to help farmers cope with emotional distress post-disaster. The Caribbean Hub disseminates information on hurricane preparedness and best management practices to help reduce risks and mitigate hurricane effects.

However, I can give you an overview of some general challenges that might be relevant. After Hurricanes Irma and Maria, farmers and agricultural advisors in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands likely faced numerous challenges related to the hurricanes' impact on their crops, livestock, infrastructure, and overall economy. Some potential main challenges may include: 1. **Crop Damage**: The strong winds from the hurricanes could have damaged or destroyed a significant portion of the island's agricultural production, affecting staple crops such as coffee in Puerto Rico and other crops. 2. **Water Scarcity**: Heavy rainfall can sometimes lead to flash flooding, which then reduces water availability for irrigation purposes. Additionally, if there are infrastructure damages, access to clean drinking water might also be compromised, impacting agriculture directly or indirectly through the lack of a reliable workforce. 3. **Power and Communication Disruptions**: The widespread power outages could have severely impacted agricultural operations by stopping pumps used in irrigation systems, affecting cooling and heating systems in greenhouses if any existed, and disrupting communication that is critical for logistics and market updates. 4. **Soil Erosion and Water Pollution**: Heavy rainfall can cause significant soil erosion and water pollution, which directly affect the quality of the soil for future agricultural use. 5. **Rebuilding and Recovery Challenges**: The process of rebuilding damaged infrastructure (such as greenhouses, irrigation systems) might pose a significant challenge due to financial constraints and shortages in materials. 6. **Climate Change Impacts**: These events can highlight vulnerabilities to climate change that farmers face, including extreme weather conditions, temperature increases, and changes in precipitation patterns, which affect their ability to adapt and plan for the future. 7. **Economic Hardship**: The loss of crops and livestock, coupled with damage to infrastructure, could lead to economic hardships for farmers and agricultural businesses, affecting livelihoods and possibly leading to food security concerns within these communities. The specific details would depend on the findings from the USDA Caribbean Climate Hub's study.",2.090801281230262e-155,0.10451306413301661,0.01909307875894988,0.0665083135391924,0.8148156404495239
"Wetland Mitigation Banking Partnerships are Thriving in Georgia  Wetlands are one of nature¡¯s most important and productive ecosystems. They provide wildlife habitat, store floodwaters, filter pollutants, capture carbon, and offer recreational opportunities. Since , the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has spent $20 million to establish wetland mitigation banks to help restore and protect wetland ecosystems on agricultural land.  Kathryn Fidler, Public Affairs Specialist  Posted in  Conservation  Jul 16,   Respond to this story",What is the primary purpose of establishing wetland mitigation banks on agricultural land in Georgia?,The primary purpose of establishing wetland mitigation banks on agricultural land in Georgia is to help restore and protect wetland ecosystems.,"The primary purpose of establishing wetland mitigation banks on agricultural land in Georgia is to offset losses of natural habitats, such as wetlands, that occur when development or other human activities destroy or harm these ecosystems. In Georgia, many wetlands have been drained or destroyed for agricultural purposes, leading to significant environmental impacts. Wetland mitigation banks are designed to provide a compensatory mechanism by creating new, restored, or enhanced wetlands in areas where agricultural land is being converted to another use, such as urban development or infrastructure projects. The goal of these banks is to compensate for the loss of natural wetland habitats and functions that have been destroyed elsewhere. By establishing mitigation banks on agricultural land, Georgia aims to: 1. Restore degraded or lost wetlands to improve water quality, provide habitat for wildlife, and support biodiversity. 2. Provide a mechanism for developers to offset their environmental impacts by purchasing credits from the mitigation bank. 3. Conserve and enhance existing natural habitats while promoting sustainable land-use practices. Overall, the primary purpose of establishing wetland mitigation banks on agricultural land in Georgia is to balance development with environmental protection, ensuring that human activities are carried out in a way that minimizes harm to ecosystems and promotes long-term sustainability.",0.06852134611994058,0.17391304347826086,0.12280701754385964,0.16521739130434782,0.8886500000953674
