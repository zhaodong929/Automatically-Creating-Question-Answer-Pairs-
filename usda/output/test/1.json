[{"theme": "Animals", "content": "All Americans benefit from investments that provide consistent access to safe, healthy, affordable food, and COVID-19 revealed vulnerabilities in our food system. As we build back better, we must create new and better markets for all producers and consumers. The food system of the future needs to be fair, competitive, distributed, and resilient.\nThe first step USDA took was to help producers get back on their feet through Pandemic Assistance. Now USDA is working to transform our Nation’s food system to create more options for producers and consumers and improve the resiliency of our food supply chain. The success of American agriculture hinges on research, innovation, and the development of new markets, both at home and abroad.\nBuilding a Resilient Food System\nUSDA is helping build a food system that works better for everyone. The resource below provides a snapshot of more than 50 grant, loan, and technical assistance programs available to producers, rural development professionals, food businesses, grocers, schools, institutional purchasers, elected officials, anti-hunger organizations, and engaged citizens who are working together to build a more resilient food system for us all.\nDownload English Handout (, 460 )\nDescargar Folleto en Español (, 687 )\nTransforming America’s Food System to Withstand Crises\nA strong and prosperous agricultural sector is essential to the well-being of the U.S. economy. America’s farmers and ranchers ensure a reliable food supply, support job growth, and promote economic development. By transforming the food system’s infrastructure and strengthening critical supply chains, USDA will ensure resilience against threats and disturbances and provide local and regional food systems with economic opportunities and security.\n Learn more\n USDA will build a more resilient food system by focusing on:\n more resilient local and regional food production\n fairer markets and options up and down the food system, from inputs through retail\n ensuring access to safe, healthy, and nutritious food in all communities\n building new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate-smart food and forestry practices\n making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America, and\n committing to equity across the Department by removing systemic barriers and building a workforce more representative of America.\nCreating More Markets at Home\nIn response to the increased demand for local and regional foods caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, USDA will prioritize investments that expand the middle of the supply chain and strengthen local and regional food systems and ensure food supply chain resilience for the future.\n Learn more\n Build Resilient Food Systems, Infrastructure, and Supply Chain\n USDA works tirelessly to ensure that the food system is fair, resilient, competitive, and distributed. By transforming the food system’s infrastructure and strengthening critical supply chains, USDA will ensure resilience against threats and disturbances and provide local and regional food systems with economic opportunities and security.\n Expanding the Middle of the Supply Chain\n Concentration in the middle of the food supply chain has left both farmers and ranchers with limited options to process, aggregate, and distribute their products, and has left consumers with limited options to purchase food to support their local economy. USDA is investing in expanding the middle of the supply chain to provide more options for both producers and consumers, and to make the food system more resilient and less reliant on limited options.\n Strengthening Local and Regional Food Systems\n In response to the increased demand for local and regional foods caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, USDA will prioritize investments that strengthen these markets and ensure food supply chain resilience for the future. Investing in local and regional food systems will further enhance the share of profits for those who grow, harvest, process, and prepare our food.\n Learn more\n Foster Agricultural Innovation and Sustainable Products that Enhance and Create Markets\n The future of U.S. agriculture, which includes plant and animal agriculture, forestry, and aquaculture, depends on continued science, innovation, and process improvements supporting technological progress, production efficiencies, and environmental stewardship. Advancing areas with a focus on climate-smart agriculture will enable the creation of innovations to minimize the environmental footprint of agriculture and ensure sustainability while improving crop yields. New technologies and system designs are needed to produce higher value end products from agricultural products, emerging crops, livestock, and forest feedstocks. This will enable new markets, establish new domestic supply chains, and create more jobs and economic opportunities. Increasing productivity has significant social and economic benefits for society.\n Biobased Fuels and Products\n Biobased fuels and products create new opportunities for creating sustainable options for existing markets and for new markets with products with enhanced attributes of performance and sustainability. USDA is supporting this commitment through the increased development, purchase, and use of biobased products through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, BioPreferred Program, and Wood Innovations Program.\n Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities\n USDA is committed to supporting a diverse set of farmers, ranchers, and forest owners through climate solutions that increase resilience, expand market opportunities, and strengthen rural America.

In the meantime, USDA is committed to the enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act to the maximum extent possible under a new enforcement policy announced in August 2021.\n Product of USA/Consumer Transparency\n USDA is already hard at work clarifying the “Product of USA” label for beef. American consumers depend upon accurate, transparent labels to obtain important information about the food they consume. American farmers and ranchers depend upon those same labels to convey information about their products that consumers value and demand. USDA is working to conduct consumer testing and economic analysis to support a rulemaking on the voluntary “Product of USA” label.\n Price Transparency and Fairness in Livestock Trading\n USDA remains committed to enhancing the transparency, price discovery function, and the fairness of the livestock markets using traditional Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) tools. In August of 2021, AMS through its Market News service announced two new reports that enhanced transparency in cattle markets for cattle traded today through contractual arrangements outside of the cash negotiated spot markets.\nEnhancing Markets Abroad\nWith 20 percent of U.S. agricultural production exported to the rest of the world, trade is a critical engine powering the rural economy. USDA is pursuing a worker-oriented, market-focused, rules-based trade agenda that removes unfair barriers to U.S. exports, restores America’s reputation for reliability, and leads to new and better market opportunities for producers and agribusinesses of all types and sizes.\n Learn more\n Expanding international marketing opportunities for U.S. farmers and exporters is critical to fostering business and income growth across rural America. It is essential for USDA to continue its efforts to promote American agricultural products and exports through promotion activities, development of international standards, removal of trade barriers by monitoring and enforcing existing trade agreements, and negotiation of trade agreements that benefit the U.S. agricultural economy. USDA will also work with developing countries to grow their economies and facilitate trade, developing markets of the future for all our producers.\n American agriculture posted its highest-ever annual export totals in 2021, with $177 billion in global sales of food and farm products. Those exports boost producers’ bottom lines, stimulate local economic activity, and support more than one million American jobs—both on the farm and in related industries such as food processing and transportation.\n Expand All Producers’ Access to Global Markets Through Negotiation and Enforcement of Trade Agreements\n USDA partners with the U.S. agricultural industry to boost global demand for the high-quality, cost-competitive American food and farm products that customers around the world need and want. Our export market development programs continue to yield results, generating an estimated $24.50 in exports for every $1 invested by government and industry.\n Learn more\n In the trade policy arena, we work with other Federal agencies, foreign governments, international organizations, and U.S. stakeholders to create a global environment that’s conducive to agricultural trade by knocking down trade barriers, negotiating and enforcing trade agreements, and establishing transparent and predictable rules and standards.\n Learn more\n Expand International Marketing Opportunities and Build Demand in Developing Countries Through Delivery of Technical Assistance and Capacity Building\n We’re setting our sights on diversifying global markets for U.S. agriculture. In places like Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, we’re seeing rapid GDP growth, expanding middle classes, urbanizing populations, and increasingly modern food retail systems. That all adds up to exciting new export prospects, which USDA is helping to unlock.\n Learn more\n Protect Agricultural Health by Minimizing Major Diseases, Pests, and Wildlife Conflicts\n The impacts of pests, diseases, and wildlife conflicts on agricultural production, commerce, and trade can be immense. USDA must balance keeping American agriculture safe while expanding access to new agricultural markets all across the globe. Domestically, USDA conducts emergency response activities that minimize threats and their impacts on agricultural industries, adapting to changes in agricultural risk by adjusting available resources to address these threats. Concurrently, the Department embarks on collaborative research to develop pest-resistant strains of crops and new animal-disease vaccines, expedites the approval of new treatments, and develops strategies to prevent and mitigate damage related to conflicts with wildlife.\n Learn more", "author": "Unknown"},

{"theme": "Animals", "content": "What is nutrition security?\nBuilding on and complementing our long-standing efforts to address food security, we are expanding our efforts to advance food and nutrition security. Nutrition security means all Americans have consistent and equitable access to healthy, safe, affordable foods essential to optimal health and well-being. Our approach to tackling food and nutrition insecurity aims to:\n Recognize that structural inequities make it hard for many people to eat healthy and be physically active; and\n Emphasize taking an equity lens to our efforts.\n Learn more\n A household is food secure if all members, at all times, can access enough food for an active, healthy life. At a minimum, food security includes:\n Readily available nutritionally adequate and safe foods, and\n The ability to acquire those foods in socially acceptable ways (without resorting to emergency food supplies, scavenging, stealing, or other coping strategies).\n Nutrition security means consistent access, availability, and affordability of foods and beverages that promote well-being, prevent disease, and, if needed, treat disease, particularly among racial/ethnic minority, lower income, and rural and remote populations including Tribal communities and Insular areas. Nutrition security is an emerging concept that complements efforts to increase food security while also:\n Recognizing that Americans, in general, fall short of an active, healthy lifestyle aligned with Federal dietary and physical activity guidelines, and\n Emphasizing equity to ensure our efforts serve all populations to promote access, availability, and affordability to foods and beverages, and address the connection between food insecurity and diet-related chronic diseases.\nView the Infographic (, 420 )\nWhat is the problem?\nPoor nutrition is a leading cause of illness in the United States, associated with more than half a million deaths per year. It is linked with increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease as well as broader impacts including higher health care costs and decreased productivity.\n Learn more\n Poor nutrition is widespread\n Though poor nutrition affects every demographic, diet-related diseases hit harder among historically underserved communities.\n The overall diet quality score for Americans is 59 out of 100, indicating that the average American diet does not align with Federal dietary recommendations. However, the resulting health burden is not equally shared. Certain populations are at greater risk for diet-related disease. For example, Black and Indigenous children are more likely to have obesity than their white peers. Those who face food insecurity are also at greater risk.\n Beyond the effect on health, poor nutrition and diet-related diseases have far-reaching impacts including decreased academic achievement and increased financial stress. That translates to societal impacts as well—lower productivity, weakened military readiness, widening health disparities, and skyrocketing health care costs. For example, approximately 85 percent of current health care spending is related to management of diet-related chronic disease.\n To make progress on these problems, Americans need equitable access to healthy foods that promote well-being.\nWhat is USDA doing?\nUSDA wants input from all Americans on ways we can improve nutrition security. The department is particularly focused on strengthening and building new partnerships with all levels of government, the private sector, community-based organizations, and families. Together, we can make progress that will change lives and ensure a healthier, more prosperous future for all Americans.\n Learn more\n USDA’s work to advance nutrition security focuses on four pillars:\n Meaningful Support\n Healthy Food\n Collaborative Action\n Equitable Systems\n Research and evaluation\n USDA’s work on nutrition security is driven by research and grounded in science. In addition to the extensive research performed by the Food and Nutrition Service, the Agricultural Research Service has six human nutrition research centers, the Economic Research Service studies numerous topics central to food and nutrition security, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture advances food and nutrition security through research, education, extension, and innovation.

The only thing that made bees tolerable was … the honey.\nYouthfully ignorant, I didn’t know that there are thousands of bee species (and some bee species are stingless) or that those bees on the playgrounds were more life saving than threatening.\nThe USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bees to educate the public and encourage people to help protect these essential insects.\nThe 40-page booklet primarily focuses on bees native to North America, of which there are 4,000 species, found in forests, farms, cities, wildlands and deserts.  Although honey bees may be most noted for producing honey, the booklet explains that native bees are valued for pollinating plants.\nThe USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bee. From the booklet, two female Morrison's bumble bees (Bombus morrisoni) sonicate the pollen from pored-anthers of a garden tomato. \n“Much of the produce we eat is pollinated by bees,” said Larry Stritch, a USDA Forest Service National Botanist. “They pollinate about 75 percent of the fruits and vegetables grown in the (United States) and 80 percent of flowering plants. Take away bees and you greatly decrease our food source and food for animals.”\nAccording to “Bee Basics,” ground nesting bees provide food to wildlife and aerate and enrich soil.   \nThe North American bumble bee, characterized by their relatively large, black, furry bodies and bright stripes, may be most familiar to Americans. There are about 50 species of bumble bees, which are important pollinators of tomatoes and clovers, a forage crop for cattle.\nBumble bees are among the Apidae family of bees, which also include native carpenter, squash and cuckoo bees, and nonnative stingless, orchid and honey bees.\nHoney bees are the only natural source of honey that’s healthy for humans. Brought to America from Europe, honey bees don’t pollinate native plants as effectively as native bees.\nAlong with information about a variety of bees, “Bee Basics” also contains pages of glossy, color illustrations of bees and plants. The booklet’s key message warns of the threat to native-bee survival that is posed by pesticides, competition for nectar from honey bees, and environmental destruction.\nTo learn more about native bees, read “Bee Basics” on the Forest Service website.  \nThe USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bee.

These funds were used to build a songbird garden, purchase fencing, materials for an irrigation system, and a greenhouse structure. The students and instructors constructed the fence, irrigation system and the greenhouse.\nThe Songbird Garden Portion of the Yreka Community was funded by Partners in Flight Program.\nThen in the spring of 2009, the Siskiyou Gardens, Parks and Greenway Association (SGPGA) partnered with Yreka High School to develop a community garden and greenhouse. The Yreka Garden Club also agreed to help maintain the greenhouse in exchange for growing space. These organizations along with a number of community volunteers pulled their enthusiasm and resources together to make this project a reality. In a few short months they leveled the site, built the raised beds, fixed the fence and irrigation system, and started thousands of seedlings inside the greenhouse. Much of the heavy work was donated by members of the California Conservation Corps and some materials were donated by local businesses.\nThe success of this community garden is the result of many enthusiastic volunteers. Approximately 25 beds were constructed as well as a flower beds to attract pollinators.\nThe grand opening of this People’s Garden was May 3, 2009.  Festivities included a ribbon-cutting ceremony, old-time music, a plant sale, and gardening workshops. The garden was teeming with enthusiasm through the summer, and by September many hundreds of pounds of fruit and vegetables were ready to be harvested and donations were made to Yreka Senior Center, Yreka Hospice, Grange Hall Community Hot Meals Program, and Yreka Community Food Bank.  Through these organizations produce was made available to an estimated 300-350 people. Six workshops were held here on topics related to gardening, greenhouses, starting seed, and food preservation.\nThis spring and summer the Yreka Community Garden will be hold free classes on permiculture, greenhouse plantings, composting and mulching, and canning.\nSpecial thanks goes to their partners!\nMembers of the California Conservation Corps (CCC) volunteered their services for a variety of work including clean up, construction of the raised beds and setting fresh gravel in the greenhouse.\nThe Ford Family Foundation Leadership Training Group is sponsoring the construction of an outdoor classroom/gazebo. This structure is a special project led by a local leadership training class which has been fund-raising for this project for 7 months.  This project has received much support from local contributors including Rotary Club and in kind contributions from local contractors.\nThe Yreka Community Garden will also be developing a Children's Garden that will feature educational planting beds, small water fountain/bird bath, butterfly garden, willow tunnel, native American cedar plank house, and benches and paths. This is being developed by an active community group including U.S. Forest Service biologists, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists, local teachers, child development specialists, and local gardeners.

USDA photo.\nNo matter what part of the country you grew up in, most of us have fond childhood memories of the wildflowers that sprung up each year around our homes, parks and roadsides.\nFor many, this fondness has carried into our adult years. This week, we celebrate National Wildflower Week as a way to share our interest and to increase public awareness for wildflowers in the landscape.\nThe beauty of wildflowers can indeed stir up memories of a certain place or time. But the wildflowers that are native to a particular place also serve an important function in the ecology of that place.\nNative wildflowers are those species that were already growing in an area before settlers came and planted their favorite flowers from their homelands. Plants that are native to an area are better adapted to the local growing conditions than non-native ones. They are generally easier to establish, require less water and fertilizer and are more tolerant of the pests and diseases found in that area.\nMany populations of native wildflowers have been lost because of urban development, competition from invasive plant species and some modern farming practices.\nWe’ve learned that agriculture can benefit from native wildflowers. Patches of wildflowers located adjacent to crop fields can attract insects and other types of wildlife that in turn pollinate the crop and increase yields. In fact, more than a third of the world’s food crops are dependent on pollinators to produce fruit.\nUSDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is working to combat this decline of wildflowers by promoting planting of them on farms and ranches. Several of the Farm Bill programs that NRCS administers have specific financial incentives tied to planting wildflowers.\nNRCS also maintains a national network of Plant Materials Centers that can provide information on which native wildflowers to plant to improve pollinator habitat and guidance on recommended methods for establishing and maintaining wildflower plantings.\nAt the Plant Materials Center where I work, we recently partnered with the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation to track flowering periods of several native wildflowers. This information is being used to help develop seeding mixes for attracting pollinators to crops grown in Florida.\nFlowering periods of the crop and the wildflowers that we plan to use to attract pollinators must be in sync for successful pollination to occur. The information we gather can help determine the best wildflower species for farmers to plant in field borders, contour buffer strips and other conservation practices to ensure pollination of their crops.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Animals\n Plants\n Tags:\n Conservation\n Farm Bill\n Florida\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n NRCS\n wildflowers\n Xerces Society", "author": "Janet Grabowski"},

{"theme": "Animals", "content": "People’s Garden Intern in\n Conservation\n Initiatives\n May 28, 2010 \n Today, the People’s Garden hosted a workshop about composting. Pat Millner, who has done a lot of research on composting and utilizing compost at the USDA-Agricultural Research Service’s Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Maryland, taught it. It was fantastically fun and informative, and Pat brought in several examples of composters for us to see.\nShe informed us that composting isn’t as complicated as it might seem. Composts work because microorganisms break down the material, and these microorganisms need three things to be healthy, happy and produce lots of compost: food, air, and water. If compost contains these three principles, it will be fruitful.\nIf you are looking to start a composter, the best season to start it is the fall. First, you need a bin. Layer about 4” of sticks (from any type of tree or shrub) in the bottom of the bin, this will provide good air flow and ventilation for the microorganisms and the compost. In your lawn, let your grass grow a little bit taller, and let the leaves fall too. Take your lawnmower and go over the area, catching the leaf/grass mix in a bag. You can put this mix in the bin, and let it take care of itself!\nWhat about those of us who live in a condo or apartment and don’t have a lawn, or just want a smaller compost? Try a vermicomposter. A vermicomposter uses worms to break down material into compost. You can “feed” the worms in the composter veggie and fruit scraps, coffee grounds and filters, crushed eggshells, shredded office paper, and even dryer lint. However, the worms aren’t fond of citrus fruits. Meat and dairy products should always stay out of composts too, the smell may attract some unwanted critters. The worms will consume what you feed them, and there’s no need to worry about them escaping. Their castings (a fancy way to say worm poop) make for very healthy compost!\nBefore, when I heard about compost, the only use I knew was to enrich soil. Compost is used for much more! Runoff can create erosion and sweep away the healthy topsoil in many areas. A compost sock is a material that is filled with compost, and can be put on the side of a sloping hill, for example, to provide a filter for runoff rainwater. This can filter out any unwanted silt and even oil. Compost has also been added to places where chemicals or lead have contaminated the soil, causing plant life to die off; there, compost enriches the soil again and also blocks the harmful chemicals from being absorbed by the plants.\nIf you’re looking for more information on composting, take a look at The People’s Garden Healthy Workshop handout on composting. It’s a great resource.\nStart a worm composter with newspaper or shredded office paper as bedding and about one pound of redworms.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n ARS\n Compost\n Pat Millner\n People's Garden", "author": "Kayla Harless"},

Since 2012, I have directed USDA’s Farm to School Program, guiding the work of a small but enthusiastic team at the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). Each October, we have more to celebrate: more USDA funds awarded to schools, agencies, and organizations to advance these programs; more money ending up in the pockets of local producers; more school gardens in which students can learn and grow; and more healthful school meals that feature local foods.\nA new report, announced by Agriculture Secretary Vilsack earlier this month, helps quantify our celebration.

{"theme": "Animals", "content": "Undersecretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in\n Food and Nutrition\n May 17, 2016 \nSchool lunch staff and students enjoy the new school lunch menu created to meet the new standards at the Yorkshire Elementary School in Manassas, VA.\nIt may seem like common sense for child nutrition programs to benefit children, but some see it differently today.\nNationwide, schools have made the lunchroom a healthy environment. In fact, in only the second school year of full implementation of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA), over 98 percent of schools participating are already meeting the healthier meal standards.  Students are eating more fruits and vegetables during the school day and more low-income children are eating nutritious breakfasts and lunches at school. And data show obesity rates for some children are leveling off. With all the success of HHFKA, now is not the time to intentionally go backwards on nutrition standards in healthier school meals and to block access to these meals for millions of children.\nIn January, the Senate Agriculture Committee unanimously took a bipartisan step toward reauthorizing critical child nutrition programs like school lunch and breakfast. Rather than diminish the progress we’ve already made, the Senate's bill ensures these improvements to our children's diets will continue.  The bipartisan Senate bill represents a compromise that allows us to stop rehashing old debates and secures a healthier future for our kids. It represents a win for children, parents, schools, and our country's future.\nIn contrast, the House Education and Workforce Committee’s bill aims to weaken one of the most successful aspects of HHFKA. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), which allows high-poverty schools or districts to serve all students free meals without any burdensome paperwork, has been lauded for increasing student participation, reducing administrative burdens and costs on schools, cutting down on paperwork for busy parents, and improving program integrity. But the House bill would place new limitations on the number of schools in high-poverty areas that qualify for CEP, forcing many high-poverty schools to lose eligibility. This would cause school meal participation to fall dramatically, and schools would be forced to spend more time on paperwork and less time focusing on feeding kids. And some children who need free meals may slip through the cracks.\nThe House bill would also roll back the school meal nutrition standards and gut the Smart Snacks in School rule, which ensures that all snack foods and beverages for sale to students during the school day are nutritious. Under the House bill, school vending machines could go back to selling soda and junk food.  Schools have already invested time and effort into making the switch to healthier options.  The snack food industry has innovated and developed hundreds of new products that meet the requirements and are popular with students.  Now is not the time to regress.\nWe are proud of the way the school meals program provides flexibility for schools to tailor the programs to their local needs. For example, schools design their own menus and have the ability to serve items they know their students prefer.  They can also choose options like CEP and serve afterschool snacks and suppers if they are the right fit for their local community. However, in the name of local flexibility, some are considering a proposal to convert the school nutrition programs into a block grant. That is a very dangerous idea. Not only would it put further strain on state and local school districts’ budgets, but it would jeopardize children’s access to quality, healthy school meals no matter where they live.\nInstead, we are working with schools and districts to ensure their programs meet their needs. One example is the Team Up For School Nutrition Success training. Along with the Institute of Child Nutrition, we offer all state agencies the opportunity to host local events to provide tailored technical assistance, support, and best practices for schools in administering successful meals programs. During the training, schools cover topics like menu planning, financial management, procurement, meal presentation and appeal, as well as youth engagement tactics and strategies to reduce plate waste. Schools have the opportunity to learn from each other in order to make positive strides toward providing healthy school environments with financial stability and strong student participation. With all these strides being made, now is not the time to eliminate the successful partnership between the federal government and state agencies, putting further strain on state and local school districts’ budgets.\nIt would be unwise to roll back the school meal standards and I urge Congress to stay the course for sake of our children. USDA looks forward to working with Congress, schools, parents and communities to continue to improve the health and wellbeing of the next generation.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Child Nutrition\n children\n Community Eligibility Provision\n FNCS\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act\n HHFKA\n Kevin Concannon\n Nutrition\n school meals\n Team Up for School Nutrition Success", "author": "Kevin Concannon"},

Schools, recreation centers, places of worship, libraries and other community sites have generously opened their doors to ensure kids receive healthy, balanced meals during the summer months – a time when many low-income families struggle to provide their children nutritious meals and snacks each and every day.\nAt USDA we’ve long recognized summer as a vulnerable time for kids and have been focused on closing the food security gap that occurs during the months when school is out of session.  Since 2009, more than 1.2 billion meals have been served through the Summer Meal Programs, fueling kids and teens throughout the summer and helping to ensure they are healthy and ready to learn when the school year begins.\nIn support of these same goals, the White House announced earlier this year the Summer Opportunity Project, a multi-agency initiative to expand opportunities for young people through the summer.  The initiative aims to increase the participation of youth in evidence-based summer opportunity programs and make sure young Americans have the support they need to get their first job.\nUSDA’s Summer Meal Programs play an important role in achieving this mission. By ensuring the most basic need of good nutrition is met, kids and teens in eligible communities can more easily pursue and leverage summer opportunities.  Many sites offer not only healthy meals and snacks, but also host physical and enrichment activities to keep kids engaged and coming back day after day.  By including free and low-cost activities into Summer Meal Programs, sites boost attendance and make the meal service more fun for children, their families, and volunteers.  To support these efforts, this spring USDA published Summer Food, Summer Moves to help sites and sponsors offer ideas on engaging kids, teens, and their families.\nIncreasing the number of meals served through the Summer Meal Programs has been a rewarding achievement during my time at FNS, as each meal served elevates the life of a child or teen in our country.   With the help of our creative and hardworking volunteers, sponsors and partners, we were able to serve more than 190 million meals last summer.  Groups like Fuel Up to Play 60, Feeding America, Catholic Charities, United Way, and First Book have all played a key part in providing access to summer meals for children living in areas with high food insecurity.  Engaging the community in summer meals is also integral to the success of the program.  These programs allow communities to take a lead role in preventing hunger and focus their efforts where there is increased need.\nTo locate a summer meal site near you, visit http://www.fns.usda.gov/summerfoodrocks\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n food insecurity\n Kevin Concannon\n Nutrition\n Physical Activity\n Rural\n Summer Meals\n White House", "author": "Kevin Concannon"},

But for many persons with disabilities and the elderly participating in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the store might as well be on the other side of the world.\nIt’s a difficult problem that USDA’s new homebound food delivery pilot aims to alleviate, not just for the more than 4 million nonelderly adults with disabilities participating in SNAP, but also for the nearly 5 million seniors, who often face similar challenges and who may face disabilities, as well.\nUSDA recently announced the food purchasing and delivery firms selected to take part in the one-year pilot, which will be conducted in locations nationwide, perhaps at a location near you. Firms selected include Denver Food Rescue (Denver, Colo.), Lutheran Social Services of Nevada (Las Vegas, N.V.), Many Infinities, Inc. (Alabaster, Ala.), Senior Services of Alexandria (Alexandria, Va.), and Store to Door (Roseville, Minn.).\nThe pilots break new ground for USDA. For the first time, governmental and non-profit food purchasing and delivery services will be allowed to accept SNAP benefits as payment. This is expected to increase the opportunities for home delivery to those unable to shop for food.\nI think it’s important to note that during the trial period participating firms will only be permitted to accept SNAP benefits from households where the qualifying person with disabilities or elderly person is the head of household. This is intended to ensure that the pilot focuses on households that have the most limited access to foods.\nGiven that nearly one in five SNAP participants is either elderly or a person with disabilities, it’s clear that we must address the special challenges faced by these groups. Lessons we learn during the pilot will help USDA shape final rules now in development, which is an important step forward, as I see it.

But we continue to work to increase those numbers.  This summer, Let’s Move!

All of these efforts move us closer to our goal to end childhood hunger in this country – a goal I know we all can share and work towards together.  Summer months are critical; make no mistake, because hunger leaves children susceptible to illness and other health issues that make it harder for them to learn when school begins again.\nSo we have to act now to ensure that our most vulnerable children are fed during summer so they too can grow up nutritionally healthy, academically strong, and best able to fulfill their dreams.   Healthy Students, Healthy Schools, Cultivating Communities of Wellness was the theme of the event at Maryland City Elementary. The county’s supervisor for Food and Nutrition Services, Jodi Risse, was instrumental in getting Maryland City Elementary and Hilltop Elementary in Glen Burnie to offer community feeding this summer.  Her hope this summer is to double the number of children served and she said it best, “to keep our kids fed, nourished and ready to learn when they come back to school next year.”\nPlease follow USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service on Twitter for the latest on ending hunger and nutrition assistance programs.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n FNS\n Kevin Concannon\n Let's Move\n National School Lunch Program\n Summer Food Service Program", "author": "Kevin Concannon"},

{"theme": "Animals", "content": "Under Secretary, Food Nutrition and Consumer Services in\n Food and Nutrition\n Apr 16, 2013 \n Making sure children have nutritious meals and keep their bodies moving all year long is one of USDA’s most important missions. Our Summer Food Service Program plays an important role in ensuring that all children get healthy meals during the summertime.    We’re proud to say that in 2012, our partners helped to serve 144 million summer meals at 38,800 sites across the country. That translates to 2.3 million children served on a typical summer day.\nBut there is still a lot of work to be done. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of kids who rely on free and reduced price meals during the school year participate in the summer program. So this year we’ve set out to serve 5 million more summer meals. We need your help to meet that goal.\nOn Friday, Secretary Vilsack held a roundtable with anti-hunger advocates from Share Our Strength, Hunger Free Colorado, and the state of Arkansas to encourage more organizations to work with us as sponsor sites. During the discussion, he reiterated how important it is for advocates and leaders in communities across the country to redouble their efforts to address the summer meals gap.  Click here to listen to the roundtable.\nAfter the discussion, we hosted a twitter chat through our account, @USDANutrition, to spread the word about summer meals and what we’re trying to accomplish. One of things I mentioned during the chat is that we want to increase participation by eligible kids in summer meals in every community that needs it, but we’re paying particular attention to states with great need like Arkansas, California, Colorado, Rhode Island and Virginia. As the Secretary said, poor nutrition during summer months can set up a cycle of poor performance once school starts up again in the fall.\nSo what can you personally do to help?  There are many ways to be a part of preventing summer hunger. One of the best things you can do is help us increase the number of sponsors who provide free meals and activities to eligible low-income children. Churches, schools, government agencies, camps and other local organizations can act as sponsor sites.  Those sites also often need volunteers to lead fun activities or provide transportation.

She remarked on the resilience of the Vermont farmers and of course, farmers as a group, and also spoke of the challenges ahead for USDA and its programs.\nOur next stop was the Harlow Farm in Westminster, an 80 acre organic vegetable farm with a successful farm store and wholesale business. We were welcomed by owner-operator Paul Harlow who is well respected and widely known for his extensive crop knowledge. \nAbout 30 vegetable and dairy producers came to speak with the Deputy, along with Vermont Agriculture Secretary Chuck Ross who had been assessing crop damage and meeting with farmers in another county.  Paul Harlow explained how over 30 acres of his vegetables were flooded by the Connecticut River. They remained under water for several days and Paul was forced to harrow under all damaged crops.  Deputy Secretary Merrigan emphasized the special place Vermont agriculture has in the national eye:  Local food, strong markets and strong community bonds are evident and to be commended, she said. The Deputy welcomed all conversation topics from the group, offered encouragement to work through USDA paperwork and talked of the approaching Farm Bill.\nOur final stop of the day in Windham County was the six-generation Robb Family Farm on Ames Hill Road just west of Brattleboro.  The family welcomed the group and once again we gathered around the porch of a historic Vermont farmhouse. The Robb Family Farm has been a dairy farm and maple sugaring operation for 100 years. They now produce corn and hay for their animals on approximately 180 acres.  They recently sold the dairy cows and transitioned to beef.  They added to their 2,000 maple taps to support their successful online store and mail order business, which sells maple syrup made on the farm.\nCharlie Robb, Jr., who currently serves as Chair of the Windham County FSA Committee, explained how a hay field and a corn field were flooded by the Whetstone Brook from Tropical Storm Irene. This same brook also caused severe damage to Route 9, the main highway between Brattleboro and the west side of the county.  Deputy Secretary Merrigan remarked on the farmers’ resilience and disaster clean-up progress. She also noted and complimented Vermont’s agricultural leadership. Area farmers encouraged the Deputy to support a strong conservation budget, especially mentioning the impacts of invasive species in southern Vermont. \nOur visit ended with many handshakes and Deputy Secretary Merrigan posing for photos with our hosts and their neighbors.  Area farmers told us how much they appreciated her concern for them and the efforts of the local USDA “boots on the ground.”\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Farms\n FSA\n Hurricane Irene\n Kathleen Merrigan\n Vermont", "author": "Julie Jacque"},

Meet Mark Twery, a supervisory research forester on the Northern Research Station in Burlington, Vt., who is not only all of the above, but loves his unique job that incorporates forestry with dance.\nTwery had a natural inclination toward the arts. His father was a painter while his mother continues to paint, and both of his siblings are artists in different respects. As a child, Twery toyed with the idea of becoming an artist himself.\nEntering college thinking he would embark in mathematics, Twery quickly realized he preferred theater arts. During his junior year, he spent a semester working at a theater in New York City.\nIt was during a trip home to Virginia when Twery realized that he had been away from nature for too long.\n“I went outside and I heard a strange noise above my head,” he said. “I looked up and saw a cardinal singing. I am a birder but did not recognize that bird song. That’s when I decided that I had lived in the big city for too long.”\nThis “wake-up call” led to Twery’s departure from theater in New York City to a brief career in woodworking in Boston.\n“It was good work, but I didn’t earn enough and again I began getting tired of living in a city,” he said.\nTwery returned to school intending to study wood technology, but instead entered the forestry master’s program at the University of Massachusetts. A Ph.D. soon followed as did a career with the Forest Service.\nSeveral years ago, Twery and his wife attended a dance performance in Burlington that weaved art and science. Fascinated by this connection, Twery, as a Forest Service liaison at the Northern Research Station, began working with the dance company to create the Moving Fields Project that incorporates dance to teach elementary school students, primarily city youth, about nature and ecology.\nDuring a typical Moving Fields Project session, Twery and dancers lead the young students to a nature area where they create movements based on what the children see or hear, such as “seeds floating off into the wind, or bark sliding off a dead tree or stepping into a pond and pulling your foot back.” Once Twery accompanied a group of inner city children from Baltimore on a Moving Fields session in a natural area, and at the end of the day, the elementary school students performed an ecological dance for their teachers and parents.\nBeing able to combine his love for dance and forestry is one big reason Twery loves his job.\n“It really is true that artists and scientists follow the same steps of observation, analysis, interpretation, and communication,” he said. “It feels like I’m going full circle in my career by connecting visual and performing arts with forestry, ecology and the environment.”\nSee what else Twery has to say in the Forest Service special feature Faces of the Forest, a bi-weekly feature of the Office of Communication to showcase the people, places and professions within the agency.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Burlington\n Faces of the Forest\n Forestry\n FS\n Northern Research Station\n Vermont", "author": "Renee Lee"},

As we reflect on yet another year, agricultural scientists at USDA continue to keep a wary eye on the future. At the end of what may be the hottest year on record, a period of drought has threatened the heart of one of the most important agricultural production zones in the United States. Water demands are increasing, and disease and pest pressures are continually evolving. This challenges our farmers’ ability to raise livestock and crops.  How are science and technology going to address the problems facing our food supply? \nTo find answers, agricultural scientists turn to data—big data.  Genomics, the field of science responsible for cataloging billions of DNA base pairs that encode thousands of genes in an organism, is fundamentally changing our understanding of plants and animals.  USDA has already helped to fund and collect genomes for 25 crop plant species, important livestock and fish species, and numerous bacteria, fungi, and insect species related to agricultural production.

Nearly all food starts out on a farm, but did you ever wonder how the value added from processing, packaging, transporting, and marketing agricultural food products factors into the costs?\nUSDA’s Economic Research Service has a tool that can show you this breakdown. ERS recently updated its Food Dollar Series product. This most recent annual update added to the historical going back to . Aside from detailing what U.S. total food spending pays for, the Food Dollar Series tells us what consumers pay for at grocery stores (food-at-home dollars) and restaurants (food-away-from-home dollars).\nOf the $1.2 trillion in food spending, the largest cost share of the food dollar went to foodservices (restaurants) at 36.7 percent – this pays for others to host, prepare, and serve our meals, then clean-up afterwards. The next largest share, at 15 percent, went to food processors, such as bakeries, meat and dairy processors, and frozen food manufacturers. Rounding out the top five industry groups are food retailers, like grocery store chains and independent grocers , wholesalers of both food products and production inputs , and farm producers . The farm producer’s share is what they receive after they pay for production inputs like seed, fertilizer, and electricity.\nThe value of farm commodities sold to fulfill food purchases represented 14.6 percent of the food’s purchase price, down from 14.8 cents in . Although was the lowest level since the beginning of this series in and the 6th consecutive year the farm share dropped, the decline in was smaller than in and .\nFor the fourth year in a row, saw no increase in the farm production cost share of the food dollar. But unlike in -16 when the cost of farm production in the food dollar dropped sharply, average prices received by U.S. farmers actually went up in . This period also coincided with six consecutive years of increases in the foodservice industry share of the food dollar, driven by a continuing trend of consumers spending more of their food dollars eating out. So, increases in eating-out spending by consumers actually offset the likely increase in the farm production cost share, as more money went to food services.\nFor more information, please see the Food Dollar Series product page and more at www.ers.usda.gov.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Economic Research Service\n Consumers\n Farmers\n commodities", "author": "Patrick Canning"},

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. \nThe Census of Agriculture is still two years away but, at the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), we work hard to continually improve the we collect. The agriculture census conducted every five years is the one time we collect demographic information on today’s farmers and ranchers.\nThe Census found that 14 percent of the nation’s 2.1 million farms are run by a woman, and women make up 30 percent of all farmers when up to three operators per farm are included. Similarly, 25 percent of farmers were beginning farmers (ten years or less on their current farm) in . But, as we get ready for the next census, we want to make sure that our fully capture the role of women farmers and beginning farmers in agriculture today.\nAfter releasing the Census results and based on feedback from stakeholders, we began to explore better ways to quantify the participation of women and beginning farmers in the operation of U.S. farms, given the limited space available on the questionnaire. NASS has asked farmers to identify the principal operators and other operators on the farm. Often the senior male family member is listed as the principal operator, even if he is no longer working. If a husband and a wife are partners on the farm and share equally in the operations, the husband is generally listed as the principal operator. How should the questions be asked so that the participation of beginning farmers and women are more fully identified?\nLast spring, USDA Deputy Secretary Krysta Harden and I hosted the first ever USDA Google+ Hangout to examine in images and stories the experiences of today’s women farmers. It was an inspiring exchange that underscored how important it is for agriculture statistics to reflect women farmers’ roles as well.\nTo address the challenges in collecting additional and to make sure we are asking the best questions, we commissioned the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS) to convene an independent panel of experts. The panel reviewed the demographic questions on the Census of Agriculture as well as numerous other surveys. Input from stakeholders and the general public was solicited. The panel made recommendations on how NASS can best capture the changing face of U.S. agriculture in the next census. One of the panel’s recommendations was to ask about the characteristics of up to four decision makers (not operators) per farm and the specific decisions they make for the operation.\nWe are currently testing this proposed change, along with others. We mailed a draft census questionnaire to 30,000 farmers and ranchers around the country, asking them to help. By completing the form, they will help us determine whether the content, wording, and design enable respondents to provide the information that policymakers, businesses, farmers, and other stakeholders need. Further revisions to the questionnaire will be made based on these results. By participating in the test, farmers and ranchers help improve the Census of Agriculture questionnaire and help us provide a more precise count of America’s farmers and their contributions.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Beginning Farmers\n Census of Agriculture\n Farmers\n Krysta Harden\n NASS\n Ranchers\n Science Tuesday\n women\n Women Farmers", "author": "Linda J.

Photo credit: University of Puerto Rico\nWe are living in historic moments in the world’s response to climate change. Last December in Paris, delegates from 196 countries signed an agreement to work towards curtailing greenhouse gas emissions and to keep global warming to “well below” 2 °C degrees. This is a big step, but there is still much work to be done and the agricultural sector has an important role to play. Agriculture, forestry, and land degradation contribute just under a quarter of anthropogenic GHG emissions, mainly from deforestation and agricultural emissions from livestock, soil and nutrient management.  Climate change also poses a great challenge for food security and nutrition. It can reduce yields and affect where and how food is produced. As the risks of natural disasters increase, farmers need to modify how they produce food in order to become more resilient to prolonged droughts, excessive rains, floods, and more intense storms.\nFarmers in the Caribbean are among the most strongly affected by climate change, as Caribbean countries are in general highly vulnerable to climate change due to their geography and socioeconomic status. So what farming practices can tropical producers use to adapt and minimize the impacts of climate change? The USDA Caribbean Climate Hub, located at the US Forest Service International Institute of Tropical Forestry in Puerto Rico, is partnering with Universities and farmers in the U.S. Caribbean to release ADAPTA, a series of demonstration projects that communicate the best adaptive practices available to tropical producers.\nADAPTA logo\nAs part of the series, we are developing videos and factsheets that highlight adaptation practices in dairy, plantain, fruit and vegetable, and forest production. ADAPTA is part of an integrated communications plan to deliver climate adaptation practices to a diverse set of producers that builds on the assessment of risk and vulnerabilities that we completed last year to better understand the potential effect of climate change on agriculture and forestry in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n“Cattle & Dairy Farming in the Tropics” is the first video released and highlights adaptation practices for tropical dairy producers. Dairy is an important farming practice in Puerto Rico and St. Croix, involving more than 50,000 acres and generating over 25,000 jobs. Drought and heat have been hitting producers hard and have had detrimental effects on the livestock and dairy industries by making cattle more susceptible to worms, ticks, and dairy cattle becomes stressed and produce less milk. As grasses died due to lack of rain, producers in the U.S. Virgin Islands were forced to take measures ranging from collecting tree limbs and branches for fodder, to relying on imported feed and even culling herds. Pastures were so over taxed, that many will have to be re-sown completely at great cost to farmers. In Puerto Rico, producers saw their costs rise as they relied ever more heavily on imported feed. Many also saw their production go down as heat stress and lack of nutrients took their tolls on local herds.\nUnfortunately, climate models in the region are predicting dramatic changes in rainfall cycles, in which prolonged periods of drought are interrupted by intense rainfall events. However, there are measures that farmers can take to reduce the impacts of drought and increased temperatures, as showcased in the first video of the ADAPTA series. We believe Caribbean producers are some of the most innovative in the world. Through this project we hope to highlight and share how local farmers are adapting to remain successful in the face of climate change and other challenges.\nThe Caribbean Hub is promoting cooperation by providing open venues and forums to address climate vulnerability as part of the USDA Regional Climate Hub comprehensive strategy to help farmers mitigate and adapt to climate change. The Climate Hubs are integrating efforts of the USDA Agricultural Research Service, National Resource Conservation Service, the US Forest Service, and other USDA agencies with state governments, local universities, and non-profits to help coordinate and streamline efforts to ensure the vitality of US working lands in the face of climate change.\nWatch as Dr. Guillermo Ortiz of the University of Puerto Rico and rancher Neftali Lluch of the Lajas Valley in Puerto Rico discuss various practical steps to combat rising temperatures and prolonged drought.

{"theme": "Biotechnology", "content": "Agricultural Marketing Service Deputy Associate Administrator in\n Research and Science\n Feb 12, \nCurrently a proposal for an Organic R&P is getting closer to Step 1 in the creation process. While a proposal has not been formally submitted to USDA, a proponent group is working with stakeholders to develop a draft. USDA photo courtesy of Sam Jones-Ellard.\nWe often talk about the many ways research and promotion (R&P) programs benefit both ag industries and the consumer. Our nation’s farmers and ranchers leverage these programs and the pooled resources they collect to help overcome marketing barriers and connect with consumers. R&P programs are self-help initiatives that are national in scope and funded by the industry to help these businesses continue to strengthen their rural economies and the communities they support.\nTo form a new R&P, there are specific steps that the industry and USDA follow: \nSTEP 1: A proponent submits a proposal to USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), which oversees all national R&P programs. The proposal typically includes an analysis of the industry, the program’s objective, and its potential impact on small businesses. While there are specific requirements needed for a proposal, the proponent can tailor the proposed program to best meet a specific industry’s needs. For example, some proposals include different eligibility requirements to vote in their referendums or an exemption for small producers, handlers and importers.\nSTEP 2: USDA publishes the proposal in the Federal Register, soliciting public comments so that prevailing industry thoughts are incorporated into the final program. This is important because these programs will use pooled resources from across the industry to invest in creative marketing campaigns and innovative research projects that will support all of the industry’s growers, handlers, processors, manufacturers and importers.\nSTEP 3: After the comment period ends, USDA reviews and analyzes the comments to determine whether the program has merit to move forward.\nSTEP 3a: If a review of comments shows general consensus or agreement among the industry stakeholders, USDA moves forward with the proposal and a second proposed rule is published in the Federal Register to announce a referendum so the industry can vote on the rule.\nSTEP 3b: If a review of the public comments suggests that a proposal needs to be re-evaluated, there are two options:  1) if the comments suggest a need to adjust parts of the proposal, a supplemental proposed rule can be published to modify parts of the proposal and request that the industry provides further comments; 2) the proposal is terminated.\nSTEP 4: USDA conducts a referendum, allowing eligible parties to vote on whether or not the measure is approved.\nSTEP 5: If the referendum is approved by the eligible voters within the industry, USDA issues a final rule implementing the program. For proposals that request a delayed referendum, the program will be announced as a final rule with a referendum to be held at a later date.\nSTEP 6: Nominations from the industry are collected and a board is appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture to represent the interests of the entire industry. USDA seeks nominations from the industry for board members and alternates.\nThese steps are intended to help the farmers and businesses establish a framework that will work across an entire industry and make the broadest positive impact for everyone involved.  Industry research and promotion programs have played an important role in shaping the agricultural landscape and yielding positive results for farmers and businesses throughout the country.\nFor example, when research supports adding lean pork to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension – or DASH – eating plan, it helps consumers create healthy menus to meet their nutritional needs and it helps pork producers connect with a larger consumer base. And an August economic analysis found a return on investment (ROI) of $8.87 for every dollar the peanut industry invested into the National Peanut Board activities over the last 5 years. These are just a couple of ways that research and promotion programs are making a positive contribution for our nation’s agricultural businesses.\nUSDA is committed to supporting these industry-driven programs, and ensuring that they address the needs and help meet the challenges faced by today’s farmers and agricultural businesses.\nCurrently a proposal for a Hardwood Lumber R&P has reached Step 3 in the process. Public and industry comments are being evaluated by USDA.

{"theme": "Biotechnology", "content": "Secretary Perdue Proclaims April as ‘Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month’\n Release & Contact Info\n Press Release\n Release No. .19\n Contact: USDA Press\nEmail: press@oc.usda.gov\n (Washington, D.C., April 1, ) – Spring is a popular time to move, but unfortunately, people aren’t the only ones on the move. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue today signed a national proclamation (, 579 ) to declare April “Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month,” during a critical time when damaging invasive species known as Hungry Pests emerge and can be easily spread in the things people pack and move, such as outdoor items like grills, gardening equipment, wading pools and bicycles or patio furniture.\nHungry Pests are a real problem. They attack trees, plants and agriculture, costing the United States about $40 billion each year in damages and expensive eradication and control efforts. Household moves increase the risk for the spread of these invasive species, since people can potentially transport them to new areas.\nAbout 35 million Americans move every year, making the possibility of transporting invasive pests high. For instance, federal and state inspectors often find gypsy moth egg masses on outdoor household items and recreational vehicles in non-infested areas. The United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS) is offering a free checklist for household moves that includes suggestions and tips for reducing this risk. The agency is also working with the United States Postal Service’s My Move program to help educate the moving public about the things they can do to help prevent the spread of Hungry Pests.\n“Hungry Pests can hide inside plants, fruits, vegetables and firewood, and spread in a number of ways, like on outdoor items you move to a new home or on an RV that has been parked outside and driven cross-country,” said Kevin Shea, APHIS Administrator. “It only takes one person to start a new infestation, which is why we all need to be careful and understand how to stop invasive pests.”\nHere are key ways the public can help:\n Moving to a new home. Help protect your new city and neighborhood from invasive pests by removing eggs masses and insects from your patio furniture, grills, bikes and other outdoor items – before they are loaded onto the moving van or storage pod.\n Traveling within the United States. Before doing an out-of-state trip, make sure your car, RV or other outdoor vehicle is cleaned first. Check the wheel wells, bumpers and other hard-to-see areas to make sure they are free of soil, egg masses, and insects.\nIn addition to moves, pests can also be spread by:\n Mailing homegrown plants, fruits and vegetables. Commercially bought goods are regulated to meet government standards, including those for invasive pests, but items grown in a home garden are not. If you live in an area quarantined for a specific pest, don’t mail produce or plants from your garden to others. Contact your local APHIS office for more information.\n Moving untreated firewood. Invasive pests like the emerald ash borer and Asian longhorned beetle burrow inside wood to lay their eggs. Don’t take untreated firewood with you, for example, on camping trips. Instead, buy certified, heat-treated firewood or responsibly gather wood at your destination.\n Traveling internationally. It’s tempting to want to return with an unusual plant, a souvenir made from plants or wood, or even a piece of fruit as a snack for the plane trip home. However, U.S. laws prohibit many of these items from entering the country because they could harbor an invasive pest. Contact your local APHIS office to find out what’s allowed. And always declare these items to U.S. Customs and Border officials when you land. Failure to do so could result in unexpected delays and fines.\n Buying plants for your garden. When buying garden items in person, be sure to ask the retailer if they comply with federal and state quarantine restrictions to ensure their plants are free of invasive pests. Before you buy plants online, check if the seller is in the United States. If they are in another country, you might need an import permit or other documents to legally bring the items into the United States. Contact your local APHIS office for more information.\nFinally, learn more by going to www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests or join the conversation on Facebook and Twitter. The website includes photos and descriptions of each Hungry Pest, and a Pest Tracker to find those in your state.

Addressing how to nurture heathy soils, improve crop yields, or prevent livestock diseases, they carefully plan experiments and analyze that can lead to better on-farm decisions and more productive practices. But even scientists can’t always predict how far their work will eventually go. Recently, USDA researchers in Florida have seen their work take on unexpected relevance in Africa with the outbreak of an invasive crop pest.\nFall Armyworm (FAW, Spdoptera frugiperda) is a destructive pest that can feed on 80 different crop species, including corn. Native to the Americas, USDA has studied FAW since the s. U.S. farmers currently manage it through integrated pest management approaches, combining the use of pesticides, genetically engineered crops, and other technologies and techniques. FAW was first reported in Africa in , and has now been documented in more than 30 African countries. Although we have decades of experience managing FAW in the United States, it is relatively new to African farmers, where corn is a staple crop for more than 300 million subsistence farmers and small-scale producers.\nThe international community has mobilized to address this growing crisis, with U.S. Government agencies contributing their own expertise. USDA’s significant experience with the pest in the U.S. has positioned it as a trusted source of technical information on FAW biology and control measures.\nStudies by USDA scientists Robert Meagher and Rodney Nagoshi (Insect Behavior and Biocontrol Research, Gainesville, FL) provided valuable technical insights in the recently released Fall Armyworm in Africa: A Guide for Integrated Pest Management. With tips on pest identification, available technologies, and best practices for managing FAW, this guide was jointly produced under the U.S. Government’s Feed the Future initiative by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and the CGIAR Research Program on Maize (CRP MAIZE).\nResearch that started out with the objective of helping U.S. corn farmers increase their yields is serving double duty now, playing a role in African food security. Although you can’t predict what agricultural issues the future may hold, you can count on USDA research having a global impact.\nUSDA scientists provided expertise and training for the new guidebook countering the Fall Armyworm’s destruction of African crops.

Not always.\nOftentimes, what may appear to be a vibrant field of pastoral charm or gently blowing golden waves of grain are actually battlefields where small invading armies threaten the nation’s economic, social, and environmental well-being.\n“Nearly every terrestrial, wetland, and aquatic ecosystem in the United States has been invaded by non-native species, with economic losses estimated at $137 billion per year,” said Robert Nowierski, national program leader for biobased pest management at USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).\nNIFA is in the vanguard of the fight to control, mitigate, and eradicate invasive pests, through funding and national program leadership. NIFA’s invasive pest portfolio includes sponsorship of four Regional Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Centers; establishment of the National Plant and Animal Diagnostic Laboratory Networks; and funding State Agricultural Experiment Station projects, the regional research and extension efforts of multi-state committees, and plant production and protection research conducted through the Small Business Innovation Research program.\nIPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques, such as biological control, habitat manipulation, modification of cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, and minimizing the use of pesticides. Benefits of IPM include greater survival of a pest’s natural enemies, slower development of pesticide resistance, less pest resurgence, fewer outbreaks of secondary pests, less negative impact on the environment, and greater worker safety. In addition, many farmers report greater profits because they’ve reduced their expenses on pesticide.\nNIFA’s programs support projects from research discovery, through research and development, to extension education and implementation of plans. Some of the higher profile invasive pest projects include the brown marmorated stink bug, spotted wing drosophila, West Nile virus, and the spotted lanternfly.\nAccording to Nowierski, the spotted lanternfly is probably the showiest of the invasive species pests. “I was on an invasive species field tour last year and visited a farmer’s grape vineyard severely impacted by the spotted lanternfly. He lost half-a-million dollars from spotted lanternfly damage to his 40-acre vineyard in !”\nNIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n National Institute of Food and Agriculture\n NIFA\n integrated pest management\n invasive species\n invasive pests", "author": "Scott Elliott"},

The webinar focused on the cute little baby birds known as chicks. Now, I am not a poultry person, but I love eggs, so I thought this would be something interesting to learn.  I found out that raising backyard poultry is a growing trend.  People like to raise chicks into adults for their eggs, and for the entertainment value of having birds in their backyard.\nI didn’t know there were so many rules when it comes to starting a flock. You need to think about why you want to raise backyard birds and what you intend to do with them.  You also need to find out if it is legal where you live - check city and local ordinances and find out if you need a permit.  If you have one, you should also check with your Homeowners Association.   Look to see if inspections or other steps are to start a flock, and be sure to buy chicks from a National Poultry Improvement Plan- approved source to ensure they start out healthy.\nI was surprised to find out that young chicks must be separated from older birds, for them to be secure and safe from disease.  Let chicks grow into birds in a separate, clean environment before introducing them into your flock that contains older birds.\nThere are two major diseases that can threaten backyard birds - Avian Influenza and Exotic Newcastle Disease. The webinar discussed six simple steps to help protect your birds from disease.  We also learned what potential signs of illness might include and what to do if you think your birds might be sick.\nAre you considering raising birds or want some tips for adding to your current flock?  The full webinar is available online, including nutrition tips and other information to help you grow a healthy and happy flock in your own backyard!\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Tags:\n APHIS\n avian influenza\n backyard poultry\n Martin Smeltzer\n webinar", "author": "Scott Kravetz"},

Photo courtesy of Ray Hammerschmidt\nWith support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), the National Plant Diagnostic Network has grown into an internationally respected consortium of plant diagnostic laboratories dedicated to enhancing agricultural security by protecting health and productivity of plants in agricultural and natural ecosystems. \nDr. Ray Hammerschmidt, President of the National Plant Diagnostic Network, discusses this partnership and the benefits all Americans receive in the following guest post:\nSuperheroes really do work among us. But, instead of capes and cowls and ice palaces and caves, they are often found in a lab at a public university or state agriculture department, wearing lab coats and working over a microscope.\nThese men and women work daily to protect our communities and crops from dangerous pests and pathogens.  They are plant pathologists, entomologists, nematologists, weed scientists, and other plant scientists who work diligently to mitigate the impact of endemic, emerging, and exotic pathogens and pests that attack agricultural, forest, and landscape plants in the United States.\nWe live in a global society where people, food, and materials travel in and out of our country 24 hours a day.  In addition to natural introduction of pathogens and pests – such as the hurricane that brought soybean rust to the United States – our ports, highways, and airports are also entryways for new insects and diseases that hop a ride on cargo containers, suitcases, and even travelers’ clothing. Whether it is citrus greening disease (which is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid and threatens citrus production), emerald ash borer (an exotic beetle that has killed millions of ash trees in North America), or purple loosestrife (which invades our wetlands and displaces native vegetation), plants, pests, and pathogens threaten our food and water supply and, potentially, our economic security.\nThe scientists, engaged with the National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN), are on the front lines and protect us from these threats by providing timely and accurate diagnostics. Established in , NPDN represents individuals from land-grant universities, federal agencies, state departments of agriculture, and other stakeholders and is an internationally respected consortium of plant diagnostic laboratories. NPDN provides a cohesive, distributed system to quickly detect and identify pests and pathogens of concern. NPDN laboratories immediately report their findings to appropriate responders and decision makers.\nTo accomplish its mission, NPDN has invested in diagnostic laboratory infrastructure and training, developed an extensive network of first detectors through education and outreach, and created an enhanced communication network among public agencies and stakeholders responsible for responding to and mitigating new outbreaks. Their work is supported in part by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).\nNPDN labs routinely support national, state, and local response to disease and pest outbreaks. They have trained and registered 11,480 first detectors nationwide. In addition, NPDN labs have been involved in more than 1 million diagnoses, and this number climbs daily. The network serves as a model for efficiency, communication, and integration across jurisdictions, especially in rapid response situations.\nFederal funding for the NPDN network is essential to continue to protect our agriculture jobs and global trade. More importantly, NPDN scientists protect our economic security by fighting against pests and pathogens, sometimes long before they are even detected in the field and have started to do damage. Superheroes do walk among us – protecting us from harm and ensuring that we all have a better tomorrow.\nJason Smith works at University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Science labs with the National Plant Diagnostic Network.

{"theme": "Biotechnology", "content": "Natural Resources Conservation Service in\n Conservation\n Jan 09, \nRoadside sign promotes Texas recovery attitude.\nNo one knew when Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas on August ates. Texans along the Gulf Coast saw cities demolished, peak wind gusts as high as 130 mph, unprecedented rainfall of more than 50 inches that caused catastrophic flooding in areas, the death of 88 Texans, displacement of thousands of residents and more than $200 million dollars in agricultural losses.\nTraveling through Refugio to Victoria after Hurricane Harvey I saw the devastation to homes, businesses and the lives of so many – it brought tears to my eyes. Then I saw a sign that summed up Texans’ resilience – “Harvey was strong, Texas is stronger.” I immediately turned around and took a picture.\nDiebel (left) discuss NRCS assistance options with NRCS District Conservationist Kevin Isom.\nAnd strong is what farmers and ranchers have to be in their daily lives faced with the challenges of working in agriculture, especially when dealing with Mother Nature. Rancher Stephen Diebel of Diebel Cattle Company, rode out Hurricane Harvey at his family’s century old ranch in Victoria. He was unsure what devastation the daylight hours would reveal after listening to howling winds and pounding rain throughout the night. He knew it was one of the worst hurricanes he had been through during his time on the ranch.\nWhen dawn finally broke, Diebel’s first sight was the twisted metal of outbuildings and barns, sheets of metal like crumpled pieces of paper laying scattered across his pastures. The pastures and roads were covered in water as far as he could see. A sense of relief washed over him after seeing the calves alive and well. He had feared they had been killed when the hay barn collapsed. The calves often sought shade and shelter there.\n“I was in disbelief that the weather could cause such a mess. It’s hard to comprehend the workload ahead of you,” said Diebel.\nA busy cow-calf operation with many items on the daily “to-do” list like calf weaning were put on the back burner as the more immediate needs were undertaken by Diebel, his family and ranch crew.\nDiebel said the hurricane put the operation behind 30 to 45 days on cattle weaning since they had to get power lines fixed and water wells going again. He was able to scout the ranch looking at other damages and found the windmills had taken their last spin during the storm. The bent blades made the systems inoperable.\nDiebel, whose family has worked with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) on conservation efforts for several generations, realized one of his first calls needed to be to Kevin Isom, district conservationist with NRCS in Victoria. He knew NRCS would likely have assistance available to help replace the windmills with solar water pumps and panels to get the water flowing again.\n“With the cost of repairing windmills going up each year, it only made sense to take this opportunity to look at improving the efficiency and dependability of our watering systems with solar,” said Diebel. “The NRCS technical assistance through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) have helped make improvements to maximize the land and natural resources, such as brush management, range planting, cross fencing, and conservation enhancements.”\nHe filed an early exemption with NRCS so he was able to obtain bids and start the process of installing the solar pumps and solar panels. The early exemption does not guarantee funding for USDA programs, but it does allow the producer to install the practice before funding is awarded.\nThankfully, flooding concerns were less severe on the Diebel ranch. He contributes this to the family’s conservation practices, particularly rotational grazing that keeps pastures covered in forage and builds healthy soil. The healthy soil was able to soak in the rain instead of ponding for days in the fields.\nAs I watched the cattle enjoy the green grass that was abundant after the rain and listened to Diebel talk about how thankful he was that his family and friends were safe, I knew that even when faced with Mother’s Nature’s wrath, he like other Texans would rally together to rebuild and be stronger as a result of Hurricane Harvey.\nLearn more about disaster recovery assistance available through NRCS for agricultural producers and communities.

Nonetheless, the one ambulance and fire truck that would fit into the aging metal shed still faired better than the other five vehicles parked outside. Those vehicles were not only pelted by rain and hail, but Arizona’s scorching sun baked them during much of the year—rotting the tires, fading the paint, and drying out the parts and equipment. Parking the vehicles outside also meant that the theft risk was greater, which increased insurance rates.\nA dilapidated trailer from the 70s was parked next to the shed. Three bunk beds were crammed into the small bedroom for use by fire crews. “It’s hard to recruit firefighters when they have to be housed in those conditions,” said Fire Chief Tom Birch.\nOn January 21, a large crowd gathered to officially cut the ribbon for a new fire station for Black Canyon City. The new building has plenty of room—which means that all of the Department’s vehicles can be parked inside. It also has office space, a reception area, kitchen and three bunk rooms. The total project cost was $1.5 million. USDA Rural Development funded over half of that total. The Fire Department and their long list of building fund contributors made up the difference. That list of community supporters took two full pages of small type to list in the grand opening program.\nChief Birch was joined at the ceremony by Fire District Board Members past and present, and the contractor and architect for the new facility. Also on hand were Arizona State Director of USDA Rural Development Alan Stephens, Bureau of Land Management District Manager Angelita Bulletts, Yavapai County Supervisor Tom Thurman and USDA Community Programs Director Leonard Gradillas.\n“Because of the distances involved in this rural area, our volunteers are to be here at the station during their shifts,” said Birch. “Morale has soared since we got the new station.”\nThe Spacious interior of Black Canyon City Fire Department Building-Residents line up for a potluck meal. \nThere are lots of other pluses with the new fire station.  The station is built on land close to the interstate for rapid deployment, and because the vehicles can be parked inside, BCCVFD was upgraded to a Class 5 insurance rating—significant because that means lower rates which get passed along to their customers.\nThree days after Chief Birch and his crew moved into the new fire station, they were called upon to help with a fire in the brush land to the north. “We had a call from the State Forester asking if we could help by providing a pre-stage location for their rapid-response team,” said Birch. “There would have been no way we could have provided that kind of support and assistance before,” he added. “We had the space to be able to accommodate the equipment and the personnel.

This report will help the Forest Service better manage forests and grasslands impacted by climate change.\"Our forests and rangelands are national treasures, and because they are threatened, we are threatened,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. \"This report confirms what we are seeing, that every region of the country is impacted by the direct and indirect effects of drought conditions and volatile weather patterns. Sixty million Americans rely on drinking water that originates on our 193 million acres of national forest and grasslands. They support 200,000 jobs and contribute over $13 billion to local economies every year.\"The report establishes a comprehensive baseline of available that land managers can use to test how well their efforts to improve drought resilience and adaptation practices are working nationwide. Major findings from the report include: Drought projections suggest that some regions of the U.S. will become drier and that most will have more extreme variations in precipitation. Even if current drought patterns remained unchanged, warmer temperatures will amplify drought effects. Drought and warmer temperatures may increase risks of large-scale insect outbreaks and larger wildfires, especially in the western U.S. Drought and warmer temperature may accelerate tree and shrub death, changing habitats and ecosystems in favor of drought-tolerant species. Forest-based products and values – such as timber, water, habitat and recreation opportunities – may be negatively impacted. Forest and rangeland managers can mitigate some of these impacts and build resiliency in forests through appropriate management actions.\"Since , fire seasons have grown longer and the frequency, size and severity of wildland fires have increased,\" said Vilsack. \"Among the many benefits of having this solid baseline is the improved ability to identify where restoration work can help forests adapt and prosper while minimizing the threat and impact of future wildfires.\"The assessment, a broad review of existing drought research, provides input to the reauthorized National Integrated Drought Information System ( NIDIS), established by Congress in , and the National Climate Assessment ( NCA), produced every four years to project major trends and evaluate the effects of global climate change on forests, agriculture, rangelands, land and water resources, human health and welfare, and biological diversity. Together these serve as key, science-based, resources for anyone working to maintain or improve public and private lands in the face of a changing environment.Edited by Forest Service scientists in partnership with Duke University, the document provides a valuable new tool to inform discussion, planning and implementation of adaptation strategies for land managers and policy makers. The collaborative effort, authored by 77 scientists from the Forest Service, other Federal agencies, research institutions and universities across the United States, examines ways to understand and mitigate the effects of drought on forests and rangeland including the 193 million acres of National Forest System lands.The implications of the findings of this report are likely to have far-reaching effects on the environment for the foreseeable future. As climate change drives temperatures increases and precipitation patterns change, drought–and associated disturbances such as insect outbreaks and wildfires-will only get worse across many areas of the United States.The mission of the U.S. Forest Service, an agency of the Department of Agriculture, is to sustain the health, diversity and productivity of the nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations. The agency manages 193 million acres of public land, provides assistance to state and private landowners and maintains the largest forestry research organization in the world. Public lands managed by the Forest Service contribute more than $13 billion to the national economy each year through visitor spending alone. Those same lands provide 20 percent of the nation's clean water supply, a value estimated at $7.2 billion per year.

The purpose of the visit was to learn how outreach workers from the North Texas Food Bank come to this office to assist clients submit applications for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\nCamilla Zimbal, social services director, gave me a tour of the agency, and showed me some of the other services available to clients. One of the highlights of this one-stop shop is a food pantry at which pantry clients may select groceries once a week. In addition to the canned and boxed food, they can also select fresh-from-the-garden fruit and vegetables.\nCamilla Zimbal, social services director for Metrocrest Social Services, explains how they get fresh produce for their clients to Audrey Rowe, administrator for Food and Nutrition Service.\nCommunity gardeners, farmers and individuals donate locally grown produce weekly to Metrocrest.  Produce is harvested early each Saturday morning from three nearby community gardens and a local high school garden and brought to Metrocrest for volunteers to wash, sort and display in time for a 9 a.m. opening.\nWhile clients are limited to once-a-week groceries, they may come in at any time for fresh produce. On a recent Saturday morning, over 40 people came in just for the produce. During peak growing season, when tomatoes and cantaloupes are ripening, even more clients show up for the delicious fresh produce, which is then delivered twice a week. Volunteers at Metrocrest provide recipes and cooking instructions for folks that may not have much experience cooking fresh foods. Recently, frozen chicken was available at the pantry. Volunteers made sure clients went home with some fresh herbs and cooking instructions for the chicken.\nThose who choose to donate fresh food also enjoy a benefit—providing fresh produce is a great way to give back to the community by helping fight hunger and promote healthy eating. Zimbal gave an example of a local couple in their seventies who picked bushels of ripe peaches from trees in their backyard and brought them to the pantry.  This was a delicious and special treat for clients and a sweet way for the couple to help others. Another example of thoughtfulness was the recent donation of tomato plants so clients could grow their own tomatoes.

{"theme": "Broadband", "content": "Posted by the Equity Team in\n Equity\n Aug 01, \nGrowing up in a diverse community in Manhattan, USDA Equity Commission’s Elizabeth Lower-Basch understood the importance of civil rights, unions, and equity at a young age. Inspired by her upbringing, Lower-Basch went on to earn a master’s degree in public policy and began her career with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\nAt HHS, Lower-Basch worked on cash assistance and learned more about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the impact it has on millions of people. Lower-Basch’s desire to expand equitable access to food assistance for all who needed it grew from her experience working on SNAP and assisting children, seniors, and working people struggling to put food on the table.\nFollowing her time at HHS, Lower-Basch went to the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) where she currently serves as the Deputy Executive Director for Policy. CLASP works to develop and implement federal, state, and local policies that improve the lives of those in need. In her role, Lower-Basch provides leadership, strategic guidance, and support for the organization’s policy and advocacy agenda.\nHer work at HHS and CLASP has directly informed her contributions on the Equity Commission where she brought forward recommendations on how USDA can improve its efforts to reduce poverty and promote food and nutrition security.\n“I’m happy to represent those who cannot afford – or have the capacity to – take on volunteer opportunities such as this [Equity Commission], and to tell their story and advocate for their wellbeing and food security,” she said.\nThe four nutrition-focused recommendations Lower-Basch introduced were shaped by her experience with the community partnership group at CLASP where she heard firsthand how limited or lack of access to programs and services can impact families.\nIn the recommendations, the Equity Commissions asks USDA to continue to encourage state SNAP agencies to administer SNAP in a way that treats applicants and participants with dignity and respect and to consult with those with lived experience of poverty as they administer the programs and provide technical assistance on how to do so. In addition, the Equity Commission recommends the review and update of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP), which forms the basis of SNAP benefits, to reflect the needs of today’s consumers and supporting legislative action to remove eligibility restrictions on SNAP that disproportionately limit access to nutrition supports by Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC).\n“It was important for us to ensure the recommendations were informed by real people with lived experience, not just academia, so that they are actionable and impactful,” Lower-Basch explained.\nNutrition programs are especially important during the summer when school is out, and childhood food insecurity is highest. USDA is taking action to address this through its Summer Nutrition Programs, or SUN programs. New for summer , SUN Bucks, also known as Summer EBT, is providing $120 in grocery benefits for eligible kids for the summer. SUN Meals and SUN Meals To-Go are also providing expanded options for kids to get meals at schools, parks and other locations. The expansion of summer benefits and nutrition support is proven to reduce child hunger in the summer by 33% while improving children’s diets.\nIn addition, USDA has made updates to the WIC food program, increased SNAP benefits, improved the nutrition of school meals, expanded access to school meals at no cost to families, and more. All of these actions further the goal of equitable nutrition assistance for those in need, a pillar focus in the Commission’s Final Report.\nSince the release of the Equity Commission’s Final Report with 66 recommendations, USDA has been partnering with the Commission Members to host Regional Convenings across the country to engage stakeholders in meaningful conversations on agriculture and equity issues as well as opportunities that exist in their region and how USDA can be of service.\n“These convenings showcase how interconnected we all are and how much USDA does – and can do – for our communities,” Lower-Basch said. “Equity means everyone has a chance. We have an obligation to be pro-active rather than neutral in extending opportunities and supports.”\n“It’s not just the big policy or recommendation that’s important, it’s the details that matter too,” Lower-Basch concluded. “The equity journey includes making sure steps are being taken to implement the recommendations and policies so that all customers of USDA receive a fair shot at a prosperous, successful life.”\nThe Equity Commission Final Report is available in both English (, 2.0 ) and Spanish (, 1.7 ).\n Category/Topic:\n Equity\n Tags:\n USDA\n equity\n You May Also Like\n USDA Thinks Outside the Box at Inaugural Innovation Event\n Digital Transformation Takes Root at USDA\n Reflections from the Road in Oregon: Building Trust and Partnerships so Rural Communities Thrive", "author": "Unknown"},

But I am here to tell you that school lunch is amazing and looks a lot different than what you may remember if you’re a kid of the 90s, like me.\nLast week, I volunteered at my son’s school. As lunchtime approached, the students were lined up in two lines: packed lunch and school lunch. The teacher announced, “Today, the cafeteria is serving popcorn chicken!” Immediately, several kids jumped from the packed lunch line to the school lunch line. That’s when I knew I was in for a treat!\nAs we were walking towards the cafeteria, my son’s teacher told me to try the zesty meatloaf. I was already excited for popcorn chicken, but I decided to take her advice.\nThis is not what school lunch looked like when I was kid. The meatloaf did not disappoint and neither did the mashed potatoes and broccolini. I can say with certainty that the school lunch my son receives is far more nutritious than anything I would pack for him.\nThere was also a fantastic salad bar featuring locally grown produce. Kids were piling their plates with fruits and veggies…especially cucumbers. Did you know that FNS awards grants to support schools in purchasing equipment like salad bars, to allow them to serve nutritious meals to students? You can learn more about these equipment grants.\nI happened to be visiting during Virginia’s Farm to School Week. USDA’s Farm to School Program awards grants to help connect students to the sources of their food through education, taste tests, school gardens, field trips, and local food sourcing for school meals. Schools and other eligible organizations looking to improve access to local foods in their child nutrition programs can apply for a Farm to School Grant between now and January 6, .\nSince I communicate about school meals as a part of my job, I know that they are the healthiest meals kids receive each day. But now I know firsthand just how tasty they can be!\nOutside of the amazing food I ate, the other standout was the amazing food service staff.

She became a veterinarian and began a professional journey over the last 25+ years that led to her current position with the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) as a scientific liaison and the designated federal officer for one of its advisory groups, the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF). In this role she supports public health issues related to the safety of the U.S. food supply.\nShe started her academic journey at Tuskegee University. After applying, she learned about the USDA National Scholars Program. “I was a good student and was offered other scholarships,” she said. “But I received information about the program and was intrigued.” Southern learned about the relationship between veterinary medicine and public health and the vital role USDA plays in both.\n“The USDA Scholars Program directed my future career,” she said. “It is one of the best things that ever happened to me.”\nSouthern participated in several internships with USDA during her time as an National Scholar. One summer, she worked with the FSIS Eastern laboratory in Atlanta, Georgia. “I worked with microbiologists and veterinary pathologists to conduct testing to support regulatory decisions, consumer complaints, and foodborne outbreak investigations,” she said. “It was really interesting work that demonstrated the public benefit of our services.”\nThe following summer, she worked at Tuskegee on a USDA grant-funded project conducting outreach with farmers and producers in rural Alabama. “Our main focus was on minority farmers,” Southern said. “We visited homes, businesses, and slaughterhouses, telling them about USDA and providing information on pathogen reduction requirements.”\nThose experiences, the people she met, and the diversity of services USDA provides cemented her decision to make a career with USDA. She attributes much of her success to mentors who have provided guidance and support over the years. “These are the people who fought for me in the rooms I was not in,” she said. Dr. F. Erich Hemphill , formerly of USDA, stands out among these important influences. “He prepared me for conversations I would have in the future and recommended me when others didn’t even know my name.” She now tries to pay that service forward by mentoring other National Scholars.\nThe National Scholars Program is currently accepting applications for the -25 school year through March 1, .

In , the USDA Climate Hubs were established in to serve as regional centers of climate change information and outreach to reduce risks. The Climate Hubs enhance USDA capacity to deliver science-based knowledge and practical information to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests.\nEarly career professionals joined the Hubs to hone their science communication and engagement skills while supporting the Climate Hubs’ mission. In , Climate Hub Fellows focused on co-developing science-based information to help land managers make climate-informed decisions. Likewise, Hubs brought on interns and post-doctoral researchers. Climate Hubs were able to enhance engagements among land managers and scientists to co-develop science and technology. To mark the 10-year anniversary of Secretary Vilsack sharing his vision for the Climate Hubs, we share two highlights.\nDr. Julian Reyes was a Climate Hub Fellow with the Southwest Climate Hub. During his fellowship, he developed, AgRisk Viewer, which empowers decision makers to assess their climate risks by commodity type at the county scale using long-term crop insurance from Risk Management Agency. This tool identifies areas of agricultural production risk due to extreme events to help target locations for adaptation actions.\nHaley Case-Scott was a Resource Assistance Program intern with the Northwest Climate Hub. During Haley’s internship, she engaged with Tribal Nations supporting government-to-government consultation for the 25th update to the Northwest Forest Plan. Haley also developed communication materials to share information about USDA programs that could support climate adaptation and mitigation.\nBoth Reyes and Case-Scott have also worked with the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy (OSTP) to provide clear, useful, and useable science and knowledge to inform the Administration’s climate, environment, and nature actions and initiatives.\n“Communities and decision makers need actionable and usable climate information and services. My time with the USDA Climate Hubs has shown the power of co-production ensuring community voices are embedded in our place-based, people-centered work. These perspectives have also helped me in my work at OSTP,” Reyes said.\n“Serving as a Resource Assistant Program intern with the USDA Northwest Climate Hub was a great experience. It allowed me to take a deep dive into how the federal government works, and provided me the tools needed to build my professional career,” Case-Scott said.\nThe Climate Hubs continue to build capacity to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests.\n Category/Topic:\n Climate\n Farming\n Forestry\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Forest Service\n Agricultural Research Service\n USDA Climate Hubs\n Climate Change\n adaptation\n Office of the Chief Economist\n You May Also Like\n USDA Thinks Outside the Box at Inaugural Innovation Event\n USDA Provides Winning in Women in 's Climate Sustainability Datathon\n Veteran Finds New Mission Through DOD SkillBridge and USDA’s MVAL Assistance", "author": "Holly R.

This is one of the reasons we provide a range of training resources and support. USDA’s Military Veterans Agricultural Liaison, or MVAL, connects veterans to resources within and outside USDA to help them embark on successful careers in agriculture. These efforts also help move USDA closer to its goal of developing a workforce in which 25 percent of all employees are veterans.\nLast week, for the first time, USDA’s Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement, Farm Service Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Rural Development, Risk Management Agency, Farmer Veterans Coalition, and the National AgrAbility Project partnered with the New England Veterans Business Outreach Center to present a webinar outlining the basics on beginning a farming or ranching career, finding employment at USDA, and more. Almost 600 veterans, transitioning veterans and military spouses participated. Many, including Army Veteran Billy VanCuren, expressed enthusiasm and appreciation for the resources offered.\n“This training has been extremely informative,” he said. “I've been looking for over a year at various organizations and websites, but the resources have all been compiled into this one webinar, which has given me several solid directions to pursue.”\nMuch of the information shared is described in USDA’s “Get Started! A Guide to USDA Resources for Historically Underserved Farmers and Ranchers” book. This publication describes assistance and targeted opportunities available to minority, women, veteran, beginning and limited resource producers and is available in multiple languages.\nOther USDA resources that veterans can access directly include:\n The AgrAbility project, which offers training and financial assistance to military veterans as well as beginning farmers with disabilities.\n The Farm Service Agency, which offers loans to help farmers and ranchers get the financing they need to start, expand or maintain a family farm.\n The Natural Resources Conservation Service, which provides free technical and financial assistance for conservation work on farm and ranches of all sizes, including urban gardens.\n The Office of Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production, which offers technical and financial assistance various growing operations, including community farms and gardens.\nPlease visit USDA’s web page for veterans to learn more about employment, education, and entrepreneurship opportunities available through USDA, and to reach out to the MVAL, Monshi “Ram” Ramdass, for more information at veterans@usda.gov.\nOn behalf of USDA and as a veteran myself, I would like to thank all veterans for their service.

Another goal is to provide the local growers general knowledge of USDA services.\n“During and after World War II, local farmers suffered a loss of agricultural land,” Lupe explains. “However, through USDA funding and other resources, in Guam had 264 farms, up 154-percent from 104 farms in .”\nUSDA continually strives to expand the reach of Federal crop insurance so that farmers and ranchers across America can benefit from the best farm safety net in the world.\n“Outreach work is important because it increases the public’s awareness of USDA’s programs and services,” Lupe says. “Outreach will ensure that these programs and services are equitable and made available to all.”\nI am grateful for the hard work of employees like Lupe.

{"theme": "Broadband", "content": "Posted by Food and Nutrition Service Public Affairs in\n Food and Nutrition\n Aug 12, \nAt the direction of Congress and with the support of President Biden as part of the administration’s Build Back Better initiative, USDA is re-evaluating the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) to ensure that it reflects the cost of a practical, nutritious, budget-conscious diet. The re-evaluation is based on four factors: the cost of food, nutrients in food, nutrition guidance, and what Americans eat. USDA plans to publish its re-evaluation soon.\nWhat is the Thrifty Food Plan?\nUSDA develops four food plans that estimate the cost of a nutritious diet across various price points—the Thrifty, Low-Cost, Moderate-Cost and Liberal Food Plans. The Thrifty Food Plan is the lowest cost of the four.\nThe TFP represents the cost to purchase groceries for a family of four – an adult male and female, ages 20-50, and two children, ages 6-8 and 9-11. The plan is designed to meet the nutritional needs of an average person consuming a healthy, cost-conscious diet at home.\nWhy is the Thrifty Food Plan important?\nThe Thrifty Food Plan plays a critical role in calculating Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit amounts. By law, the cost of the TFP in June each year is equal to the maximum SNAP benefit for a household of four people for the following October through September. That amount is then adjusted to determine the maximum benefit for households of other sizes.\nWhy is USDA re-evaluating the Thrifty Food Plan?\nThe Farm Bill directed USDA to re-evaluate the TFP no later than and then every five years thereafter. Since the TFP was last updated in , there have been notable changes to dietary guidance, food prices, and what Americans purchase and eat. The current re-evaluation uses the most up-to-date available to reflect those changes.\nFor more information on the TFP, check out: www.fns.usda.gov/snap/thriftyfoodplan\nFor more on recent TFP listening sessions, read: www.usda.gov/media/blog//08/09/you-spoke-we-listened-challenges-purchasing-healthy-food-snap-benefits\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Food and Nutrition Service\n FNS\n Nutrition\n Thrifty Food Plan\n You May Also Like\n SNAP-Ed Connects Culture, Land, and Food\n Healthier Foods, Healthier Minds\n National Women’s History Month: Celebrating FNS’ Unsung Heroines", "author": "Unknown"},

{"theme": "Broadband", "content": "Posted by staff of USDA’s Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization in\n Equity\n Farming\n Initiatives\n May 18, \nRenee McDonald, a first-generation sheep producer in Lee County Georgia, spends many nights monitoring newborn ewes. In the last lambing season at Sheepy Acres Farm, eight out of ten of her pregnant ewes gave birth to twins. The lambing season holds many memories, but it also presents challenges, including twin births that require double the attention.\nUSDA has made a significant difference in the start, growth, and health of McDonald’s herds. McDonald, initially a goat producer, started her venture with USDA’s Farm Service Agency. McDonald accessed $50,000 through the Microloan Program to begin her operation, which she paid off in full in record time. She now focuses primarily on sheep production and has learned everything about small ruminant raising from the ground up.\nMcDonald implemented numerous conservation practices with incentive payments from USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service. To increase production and improve forage availability, McDonald accessed the Conservation Technical Assistance Program to develop a conservation plan that outlined numerous practices such as rotational grazing and fencing. She used the Environment Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) to support livestock management through rotational grazing. Her breeding stock and ewes' nutritional state are primarily influenced by this approach. “Grazing in just one pasture, they’re more susceptible to worms,” notes McDonald. “Rotational grazing has really helped.”\nMcDonald also keeps a small herd of cattle which she alternates pasture grazing between sheep to minimize parasites. Bovines and ruminants have different grazing habits, which impact vegetation differently.\nMcDonald also accessed EQIP to support the implementation of various upgrades to her water supply. “I felt like I hit the jackpot” she asserts. “If I hadn’t gotten NRCS help, I would have sold out; I wouldn’t have been able to keep going.”\nHer father raised cattle and managed a Tennessee walking horse operation, until his unexpected passing thrusted the farm into a new season. A challenging but rewarding transition to sheep production has now paid off as she can impart her knowledge to others. Through mentoring other sheep owners, McDonald helps a new generation of growers meet the growing demand for sheep. Americans like her play an important role in agriculture.\nMcDonald also accessed a small business loan from the Small Business Administration to aid her enterprise during COVID. “I am so grateful for all that these programs, as they have advanced my business by leaps and bounds”, stated McDonald.\nMcDonald is now seeking a solar energy opportunity through USDA’s Rural Development Rural Energy of America Program to address energy efficiency on Sheepy Acres Farm.\n Category/Topic:\n Equity\n Farming\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n Office of Small and Disadvantaged business Utilization\n Georgia\n small business\n sheep\n Producers\n Farm Service Agency\n You May Also Like\n USDA, Federal Agencies Partner to Kick off National Small Business Month in the Midwest", "author": "Unknown"},

These grants will help new markets for American specialty crop producers and solidify local and regional markets.\nWhen I go to the grocery store or visit my local farmers market, on the top of my shopping list are healthy foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, dried fruits, and nuts. I know that these items, part of a larger agricultural group classified as specialty crops, are a critical component of maintaining a healthy diet and that it is important for me to include them in my family’s meals. Making sure that all Americans have access to healthy foods like specialty crops is a priority for me and for the USDA.\nThat’s why I am thrilled to announce that the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) awarded grants to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 4 U.S. territories. These grants will be used to support 740 projects that encourage the production and consumption of specialty crops across the U.S. That means specialty crop producers will be able to expand their marketing efforts or alleviate some of their production costs. Others will increase education efforts, telling people about the importance of consuming fresh fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods. These grants will create tremendous opportunities for American specialty crop producers.\nWhen I look at the innovative proposals for some of these projects, I see newly established partnerships that will create new markets for American agriculture and help solidify local and regional markets. The local producer in Oklahoma can learn how to place their products in schools after following a business model that Copper Bear Farms will create with the help of one of the state-awarded grants. Some states will partner with local organizations to eliminate food deserts by developing community gardens or providing funding to a struggling food bank.  In other proposals organizations will partner with their local farmers market to increase the number of vendors or even add a new area where they can sell their products.\nIn addition to the improved outlook created by these grants, pending trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea may soon offer specialty crop producers additional outlets for their crops. Passage of these agreements could lead to $2.3 million gained via exports, supporting nearly 20,000 jobs in the U.S.\nUSDA is proud to support the specialty crop industry and help increase America’s access to healthy foods.

Credit: Jackson-Madison County School System\nIn today’s installment of our Cafeteria Stories series, we highlight the innovative and successful school nutrition strategies that a Tennessee school district is using to positively impact the health of our next generation.  I believe very strongly in the power of student engagement, and the Jackson-Madison County School District is expertly tapping into that resource.  By empowering students and integrating them into the program structure, they have altered food culture and made the healthy choice the desirable choice within and outside of the school walls.  We thank them for sharing their story!\nGuest Blog By: Susan Johnson, School Nutrition Director of Jackson-Madison County School System\nSometimes I hear people say that kids don’t like the healthy foods they are served at school, but what I see every day in the 27 schools that make up the Jackson-Madison County School System tells me otherwise. My staff and I see our students choosing to not only eat, but also grow fruits and vegetables, and educate others about the benefits of making healthy choices daily.\nAt our schools, we are committed to maintaining high standards for the food that we serve to students so that they can flourish in and outside of the classroom. In , our district set minimum nutrition standards for food offered to students in grades PreK-8, which put us on the right track to comply with the USDA’s school meals standards and the Smart Snacks in School nutrition standards, which went into effect this summer. Enrolling in the Alliance for a Healthier Generation’s Healthy Schools Program provided us with specific tools, such as the Smart Snacks Product Calculator, that enabled us to not only meet, but exceed, federal standards at our schools today.\nThrough nutrition education, we’ve created a culture of health where our students are so excited about serving fresh, healthy foods at school, that now Liberty Tech High School students grow much of their cafeteria’s vegetables in the school greenhouse. Last year alone, the students grew 2,664 heads of Bibb lettuce, 573 pounds of cucumbers, and 695 pounds of tomatoes that were supplied to six cafeterias in our school system!\nThe USDA Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) and the “Teens Teaching Tots” programs have also contributed to a 22 percent increase the amount of fruits and vegetables that students eat at school over the last three years. Through the “Teens Teaching Tots” program, high school students take fresh produce from the green house to elementary schools enrolled in the FFVP. The teens teach nutrition lessons while the younger students build and eat salads with their fresh-grown lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers.\nIt’s important to me, as a School Nutrition Director, but also as a member of my community, that kids learn the benefits of making healthy choices at mealtimes. There’s no better place to teach them than at school where they spend the majority of their time away from home. Parents often tell me that in the grocery store, their kids point to strawberries, peaches, and tomatoes and ask for them instead of sugary snacks because they know how healthy and tasty they are from eating them at school. That’s how I know what we’re modeling for kids here is translating into life-long habits that lead to a healthier generation.\nLiberty Tech High School greenhouse.

These microloans will be especially helpful to beginning or underserved farmers, U.S. veterans looking for a career in farming, and those who have small and mid-sized farming operations.\"Many producers, especially new and underserved farmers, tell us that access to land is one of the biggest challenges they face in establishing and growing their own farming operation,\" said Harden. \"USDA is making it easier for new farmers to hit the ground running and get access to the land that they need to establish their farms or improve their property.\"The microloan program, which celebrates its third anniversary this week, has been hugely successful, providing more than 16,800 low-interest loans, totaling over $373 million to producers across the country. Microloans have helped farmers and ranchers with operating costs, such as feed, fertilizer, tools, fencing, equipment, and living expenses since . Seventy percent of loans have gone to new farmers.Now, microloans will be available to also help with farm land and building purchases, and soil and water conservation improvements. FSA designed the expanded program to simplify the application process, expand eligibility requirements and expedite smaller real estate loans to help farmers strengthen their operations. Microloans provide up to $50,000 to qualified producers, and can be issued to the applicant directly from the USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA).This microloan announcement is another USDA resource for America's farmers and ranchers to utilize, especially as new and beginning farmers and ranchers look for the assistance they need to get started.

This is especially true in rural America, where dedicated farmers and ranchers rely on each other and the communities around them to fuel innovation and create opportunity. From nutritional research to competitions that promote sustainability and continued environmental care, ag promotion programs—with oversight from USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)—help American farmers make long-term investments that ensure a better future for everyone.\nFor more than 30 years, California almond growers have pooled their resources under the Almond Board, focusing on research and techniques to make the most of precious water resources.  Efficient water use and irrigation management are vital to the success of California’s Central Valley almond growers, ensuring that consumer demand for almonds can be met sustainably.  State-of-the-art farming and production developments over the past two decades have helped farmers reduce the amount of water they use per pound of almonds grown by 33 percent. Key strategies have included the wide adoption of micro-irrigation as well as advances in soil assessment and monitoring.\nInnovative use of wood products is beginning to change the face of construction, and USDA is doing its part to support these advancements. A new prize competition was launched earlier this month, challenging developers, institutions, organizations and design teams to demonstrate the architectural, structural and commercial viability of using sustainable wood products in tall-wood construction. USDA is investing up to $1 million in the competition and nonprofit partners—the Softwood Lumber Board and the Binational Softwood Lumber Council—have committed an additional $1 million.\n Pork Industry Environmental Stewards Bruce and Jenny Wessling from Grand Junction, Iowa.

(Photo by Tonya Bernadt, NDMC)\nEven before the Dust Bowl days of the s, agricultural producers have recognized the economic and emotional devastation that drought can cause. Recently, the focus has shifted from dealing with drought as an unexpected hazard, to more proactive planning for the inevitability of drought. One of the tools available to producers is the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM), a weekly map of drought conditions produced jointly by the USDA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\nEstablished in , many sectors use the Drought Monitor. The media uses the map to communicate drought information. The USDA uses the map to distribute drought relief funds to agricultural producers, through programs such as the Livestock Forage Program (LFP). Some fire managers use the map to identify areas of potential fire danger. Policymakers may use the map to inform decision making, drought response, and relief actions.\nU.S. Drought Monitor maps are released each Thursday morning at 8:30 E.T. The map is based on measurements of climatic, hydrologic, and soil conditions as well as reported impacts and observations from more than 350 contributors around the country. Eleven climatologists from partner organizations take turns serving as the lead author each week.\nThe Drought Monitor is considered the gold standard in identifying the location and severity of drought events. Shortly after its release, USDA began using the Drought Monitor as a trigger for several of its programs. In fact, the and versions of the Farm Bill mandate the use of the Drought Monitor to identify areas available for LFP relief and to calculate the level of support available to ranchers, leading to delivery of more than $6 billion for that program alone. In recent years, the USDA and NDMC have made the Drought Monitor and its companion products more useful to the public, including the addition of a Spanish-language version, on regional drought impacts, and improvements to tools like the Drought Impact Reporter and an eligibility calculator for the LFP.\nDr. Mark Svoboda, director of the National Drought Mitigation Center, describes the evolution of the U.S. Drought Monitor to attendees. (Photo by Tonya Bernadt, NDMC)\nSome producers who are unfamiliar with how the Drought Monitor is produced question its accuracy. To allay concerns, the NDMC has developed a series of workshops in partnership with USDA’s Climate Hubs, 10 centers around the country which link USDA research and program agencies to deliver timely and authoritative resources to agricultural producers and professionals. These workshops instruct USDA field personnel on the history of the Drought Monitor, how it is produced, and its role in providing relief to the American farmer. In this way, USDA field personnel can help the public identify when they may be eligible for drought relief programs, provide them with information on weather and climate patterns common to their region, and recommend steps to mitigate the impacts of weather and climate extremes.\nThe first one-day workshop was held on April 5 in Amarillo, Texas. Attendees included NDMC representatives, including a Drought Monitor author, local and regional officials, and USDA agency representatives from Agricultural Research Service, Risk Management Agency, Farm Services Agency, Forest Service, Office of the Chief Economist, Rural Development, and Natural Resources Conservation Service. Presentations focused on tools such as the Drought Monitor, the Drought Impact Reporter, and the FSA Livestock Forage Disaster Program Eligibility Tool.\n“When extreme and exceptional drought appear on the landscape, it’s critical that USDA field staff have the tools and information they need to rapidly respond to producer needs,” said Dr. David Brown, director of the USDA Southern Plains Climate Hub.\nFor more information on the Drought Monitor, visit the USDA Climate Hubs website.\nLivestock Forage Program Eligibility for Improved Pastures for map.\n Category/Topic:\n Climate\n Tags:\n Office of the Chief Economist\n climate hub\n drought\n Farm Service Agency\n FSA\n Livestock Forage Program\n National Drought Mitigation Center", "author": "Mark Brusberg"},

Check back every Wednesday as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s Farm Service Agency.\nKeegan Poe of Johnson County, Indiana is a busy man. Not only is Poe a regional manager for Indiana Farm Bureau, but in his “spare time,” he holds down a second full-time job raising beef cattle and running Poe’s Quality Meats where he sells family raised beef and lamb direct from farm to consumer.\n“My family has raised sheep for 70 years here in Indiana, but my passion for raising cattle started with one dairy steer when I was involved with 4-H as a youth,” said Poe. “I asked my dad if I could show cattle and he said, ‘sure’ and the rest is history.”\nToday, Poe’s herd consists of approximately 25 head of cattle that he raises for beef and sells to his customers. Although a small operation by traditional ranching standards, Poe’s herd is no less important to him as a producer or to his loyal customers who rely on him for quality products to bring home to their families.\nSo when the severe drought hit Indiana in with record high temperatures and absolutely no rain, Poe found himself without grazing acres and having to supplement feed for his cattle by purchasing and hauling hay.\n“My operation is small, which in this case was a blessing because I didn’t have to liquidate my herd,” said Poe. “Unlike many cattle raisers, this is not my primary source of income.  But as with all livestock producers, I care very much about the well-being and overall health of my herd and to find myself wondering how I was going to feed them, where the feed would come from and how much it was going to cost, was a terrible feeling.”\nPoe, who typically does not have to begin supplementing feed for his cattle until December, had to begin feeding hay to the cattle in June.  Although he had some hay stored, that supply was quickly depleted.  That forced him to purchase hay, which was in short supply and costly.\nFast forward two years and Poe, through the USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA), has received much-needed financial relief through FSA’s Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP).  The Farm Bill provides retroactive authority to cover eligible losses back to Oct. 1, .  In Poe’s case, LFP provided benefits for four months of grazing losses in .\n“Like most livestock producers, I like to stand on my own two feet,” said Poe.  “And while I made it through the rough times like the drought, I know that I will be able to care for my cattle properly and maintain the quality of product that to my customers are used to,” said Poe.\nSince disaster assistance sign-up began on April 15, USDA has received more than 81,500 applications.

Check back every Wednesday as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s Farm Service Agency. \nRichard and Susan Rausch lost nearly 70 percent of their cow-calf operation when Winter Storm Atlas dumped three feet of snow on the western part of South Dakota, killing thousands of cattle across the region. The Rausch’s 300-head of cattle dwindled down to about 90.\n“You just can't put into words what the devastation was like following the blizzard,\" said Richard. \"The roads were closed from snow drifts, but once we were able to get out with the tractor, there was dead livestock wherever you went. Our neighbor's livestock was found dead in our yard and our cattle took cover in rough country at the start of the blizzard and they ended up drifting five to six miles away.”\nThe Rauschs are one of hundreds of farmers who suffered major losses during the unseasonably early blizzard last October, but a lack of a Farm Bill left them without any recovery assistance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n“A lot of ranchers decided to try to make it through the winter with the livestock they had left and wait and see if the Farm Bill would help them,” said Richard.\nThat help wasn’t far away. Farm and Foreign Agriculture Undersecretary Michael Scuse met with the Rausch family to ensure them and other producers that the Farm Bill would soon be able to help.\nHelp came just a few months later when the Farm Bill passed. Within 60 days, sign-up for disaster assistance opened and within the first week more than 10,000 producers filed into Farm Service Agency county offices to submit applications.\nThe Rausch family visited the Pennington County FSA office on April 30, to sign up for the Livestock Indemnity Program.  The program provides compensation for livestock death losses in excess of normal mortality caused by adverse weather conditions. They also signed up for the Livestock Forage Program (LFP) that will compensate them for grazing losses caused by drought and they enrolled in the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees and Farm-Raised Fish Program that compensates producers who have suffered losses because of disease, severe weather, blizzards and wildfires. The payments will help the Rausch family gradually rebuild their cattle herd, make repairs and help with operating expenses.\n\"We already have disaster assistance sign-up appointments booked up until July,\" said Jiggs O'Connell, Pennington County executive director. \"Disaster program sign-up has been a busy time for us, but it's nothing compared to what producers went through during the Atlas blizzard.\"\n\"We plan to keep purchasing cattle through the fall,\" said Richard. \"I believe it will take us two to three years to rebuild our herd. It won't happen overnight.\"\nSince disaster assistance sign-up began on April 15, USDA has received over 13,000 applications.  As of April 24, USDA has paid more than $4.5 million to help American farmers, ranchers and their families devastated by severe losses.  Producers impacted by drought, snowstorms and other unforeseen weather events should contact their FSA county office to make an appointment and learn if they are eligible for disaster assistance.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Atlas\n cattle\n Disaster Assistance\n Emergency Assistance for Livestock Honeybees and Farm Raised Fish Program\n Farm Bill\n Farmers\n FFAS\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n FSA\n Livestock Forage Program\n Livestock Indemnity Program\n Michael Scuse\n Producers\n Ranchers\n South Dakota", "author": "Cassie Bable"},

The author used this as an opportunity to teach her daughter about forest products. (USDA Forest Service photo)\nHaving learned about recent fires in the Amazon rainforest at school, my first grader came home with a head full of ideas on how to protect what many call the lungs of the Earth—and all the animals that live there: a bake sale.\nHer eager stance to rescue the rainforest was a perfect opportunity for me to tell her about the magic of temperate forests right in our backyard of colorful Colorado. I showed her how the forests in the U.S. provide a myriad of services and products, some of which would benefit us in making a batch of cookies for her rainforest bake sale.\nConservation of our nation’s forests is rooted in our agricultural history. Devastating logging practices and deforestation during colonial settlement and through the Industrial Revolution resulted in fragmented forests and eroded soils necessary to sustain many benefits in which forests provide.\nThese benefits include wood, fiber, food, recreation, wildlife habitat, and abundant clean water. Due to these concerns, beginning in the s, forest reserves were set aside. And in the USDA Forest Service was created to sustain through conservation practices the health of our forested lands.\nSo, how do forests help moms make cookies? In many indispensable ways! For instance, the wooden cutting board, mixing spoon, and parchment paper we used to bake the cookies are sourced from forests. And while the cookies baked in the oven, my daughter and I went outside to find shade under a deciduous tree to cool off from the unseasonably warm September.\nWhen forests are healthy, productive, and managed as working forests, they produce an endless list of materials we use in our daily lives, from lumber to food to energy. In fact, per day, the average person in the United States uses 5.5 pounds of material derived from harvested forest products.\nPrivately owned forests supply 91 percent of the wood harvested in the U.S., and the more we use wood products, the more likely forests are to continue to be forests. Recent studies show that strong markets for wood products—such as biomass energy generation—make maintaining forested lands an economically attractive option to private landowners.\nBack in the kitchen the cookie clean-up also involved forests because we used cellulose from trees in the paper towels to wipe up spills and chemicals extracted from trees in the cleaning products.\nWe then bagged our cookies in cellophane to keep them fresh, and yes, a tree provided the essential chemicals to make this product. And, after my little one devoured all remnants of cookie dough, we washed the mixing bowl using water that originated from the mountains on the Pike San Isabel National Forest.\nForested land in the U.S. covers nearly one-third of our land base. These diverse forest ecosystems serve as our nation’s natural filtration systems for clean air and water. More than half of our drinking water in the United States originates from forested lands. All in all more than 5,000 products come from trees and are renewable. If we take care of our forests and use them responsibly, they will continue to provide for us for generations.\nThat day we counted even more forest products that went into making a dozen cookies, from the paper bag storing the flour, to the cardboard box encasing the butter. I then stuck a note to our plate of cookies that read, “From one forest to another.”\nLater that afternoon, after sampling our cookies, I sent my daughter up to brush her teeth with yet another indispensable tree product – toothpaste.\nThis infographic illustrates how nature provides clean air and water and healthy soil from wildlands to urban settings.

They spent more than an hour together at the refuge planting willows to reestablish a wetlands habitat while also exchanging information about their work.\nMukagasana will work on the Pike National Forest this summer as part of the 21CSC through Groundwork Denver. The forest recently experienced catastrophic fire and flood events, requiring rehabilitation work and the hands of those eager to help with restoration efforts.\n“We are excited to partner with Groundwork Denver to accomplish some much-needed restoration and rehabilitation on the forest,” said Connelly. “Just as important, however, is that we get to provide an opportunity for vocational enrichment and environmental stewardship to young people. These kinds of opportunities are a powerful way to connect youth to their public lands.”\nThe grants will support 43 new projects on public lands, resulting in paid conservation work experience for more than 620 youth. The projects will also support nearly 1,550 volunteers on public lands across the country.\n“The USDA is committed to providing youth and veterans meaningful work opportunities that connect them with public lands, and accomplish great projects at the same time,” said Arthur “Butch” Blazer, deputy undersecretary for Natural Resources and the Environment at USDA. “By cultivating a life-long connection to nature, the USDA hopes to successfully engage the next generation of conservation stewards. However, sustaining this effort cannot be accomplished alone; it must be done with a diverse group of partners and other agencies who are committed to creating that lasting connection between youth and nature.”\nMakalah Emanuel, also of Groundwork Denver, spoke at the event about her experience working on public lands. “I have used every single thing I have learned. I have had experiences like trail building and I have applied this to real-life things like dedicating time to college applications and school. The work we do today and the work we will do in the future, it has a purpose,” said Emanuel.\nSoon, Makalah, Agnes, and 18 of their peers will start local projects supported by this initiative. They will work on projects both at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge and on the Pike National Forest. They will work to improve bison and prairie dog habitat, reseed plants and trees, remove invasive plants and restore riparian and habitat.\nMakalah Emanuel of Groundwork Denver plants willows with Secretary of Interior Sally Jewell.

President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act into law with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. On signing the law, President Johnson said “an unspoiled river is a very rare thing in this Nation today,” adding that unless there were steps taken to protect them, healthy, free flowing rivers would become a thing of the past.\nSince then, the system has grown to include rivers in 41 states and Puerto Rico.

Those rivers include the Flathead, the Merced and the Deschutes.\nThese designated rivers and others like them throughout the country provide a wide range of economic, ecological and other social values.\n“Wild and Scenic Rivers are the backbones of many communities that rely on the visitors to fill hotels, visit shops and outfitters, and to hire guides,” Pacific Northwest Regional Forester Glenn Casamassa said at the release event. “We need to take responsibility for stewardship of these rivers in collaboration with partners, local communities and other stakeholders.”\nJune 1 through 9 is also National Fishing and Boating Week, a time to connect with the great outdoors by getting on the water to fish, boat and even scuba dive.

Today that seasonal demand is also bolstered by a significant rise in client numbers because of the current U.S. economy.\nOne of those food distributors seeing an uptick in demand is the Capital Area Food Bank, a food hub with more than 700 partners that distribute commodities to locations in the District of Columbia, northern Virginia and parts of Maryland.\nShamia Holloway, communications manager of the Capital Area Food Bank, said the hub has seen a 25 percent increase in demand since the start of the recession roughly three years ago, and the demographic of recipients has changed. “We’re seeing many more middle-class visitors, people who have never been to the food bank before. We’ve even had former donors return as clients.”\nShelves of food at the Capital Area Food Bank in Washington, DC. The food bank has seen a 25 percent increase in demand since the start of the recession three years ago.

In the early s, USDA established a food distribution program to shore up farm prices and help American farmers suffering from the economic mayhem of the Great Depression. Millions lost their jobs and couldn’t support themselves and their families, and the danger of malnutrition among children became a national concern.\nSeveral USDA agencies sustain the federal government’s modern-day food distribution program. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) manages The Emergency Food Assistance Program. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) purchases meat, poultry, eggs, fish, fruit and vegetable products; the Farm Service Agency (FSA) purchases dairy and peanut products, cereals, grains and vegetable oils.\nFNS then coordinates distribution of the commodities to states based on unemployment numbers and residents with incomes lower than the poverty level. The states disperse the food to local agencies, usually food banks.\nEvery day the employees of USDA work to help support those who struggle to feed themselves.

{"theme": "Climate", "content": "Undersecretary, USDA Rural Development in\n Energy\n Rural\n Jun 09, \n As a farmer in eastern South Dakota, I witnessed one of the biggest growth periods in renewable energy in our country's history.\nI saw firsthand how the investments in biofuels benefited rural Americans by creating jobs and capturing wealth locally. Leaders in the community got together, made commitments to invest in renewable energy projects, and shared in the success of the projects once they matured.\nRenewable energy projects are not only good for the rural economy, they are an important component of President Barack Obama's across-the-board approach to building an energy infrastructure. The path he laid out will secure our energy future and promote economic growth by out-innovating and out-competing global competition.\nRenewable energy production is smart for our country both strategically and economically. As gas prices have gone up, we are reminded that oil supplies are fragile and that global events and speculation can have a large effect on the price. Whether it is tumult in the Middle East or hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico, the long and complex supply chains for petroleum energy can be disrupted by a multitude of events.\n This solar module, funded in part through USDA’s Rural Energy for America Program, is oriented to the south on a ground-mounted rack near a rural business in Tippecanoe County, Indiana. \nAbundant domestic resources make the expanded use of clean, reliable and American-made renewable energy the best way to mitigate these risks in the long run and take control of gas prices. Producing renewable energy here at home not only increases economic and strategic security, but also provides job growth and captures the wealth of energy production in the communities that produce it.\nBuilding on the success of conventional biofuels, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is working with research centers and private businesses to develop new generation biofuels made from feedstocks such as switch grass, corn stover and algae. The promise of new generation biofuels is enormous and provides the greatest hope for our work to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\nAdditionally, USDA is interested in finding ways for rural Americans to use alternative energy technologies that harness the power of wind and sun. The wind that regularly whips through the Great Plains and across Texas can drive turbines that provide energy to individual farms or for sale to the electrical grid. The powerful sun in the American Southwest can heat the solar panels that provide the energy to operate a business or defray the energy costs in a home.\nOne important way we support the effort to expand renewable energy generation and use is through the Rural Energy for America Program.\nREAP gives rural Americans the opportunity to take the lead in the production of alternative energy by tapping into all of rural America's natural resource strengths. The program supports, among other things, biomass, wind and solar energy projects from applications received from rural small business owners or agricultural producers.\nUnder the REAP program, $61 million has been made available in guaranteed loans and $42 million has been made available for grants. Those funds can be used for various energy efficiency projects including anaerobic digesters on livestock farms, audits of energy improvements and, now, flex-fuel pumps. For additional information, refer to www.rurdev.usda.gov.\nWith tools like the REAP program, USDA is helping rural America lead the way to our nation's renewable energy future. And we can't afford to wait any longer for our economy, our national security, and for prices at the gas pump.\nThis blog appeared recently in the Indianapolis Star and is posted here with permission. \n Category/Topic:\n Energy\n Rural\n Tags:\n Dallas Tonsager\n Energy\n REAP\n solar power\n South Dakota", "author": "Dallas Tonsager"},

It is located in Perry County between the towns of New Straitsville and Shawnee, Ohio.\nThe drainage was heavily impacted by underground mining activities in the late 's and again in the mid 's from strip mining. The drainages were blocked by piles of old mine waste and soils. The estimated 60 million gallons of water that falls here in a typical year ends up in the old mines, producing acid mine drainage which is toxic to aquatic life and has a harmful effect on the adjacent riparian vegetation.\nOver the last fifteen years, the Wayne National Forest and our partners have worked together to restore the watershed, which encompasses 75,000 acres in three counties. In addition to interpreting the natural history of the area, the Forest Service also has the opportunity to educate the public about the importance of continued cleanup of old abandoned mine lands.\nNumerous features are incorporated in the project’s clean-up activities including: opening all blocked drainages and allowing the water to flow freely from the site, creating a prairie meadow on the upper slope of the site, building a pond stocked by Ohio Department of Natural Resources with three species of fish, and planting approximately 1,300 native species suitable for each habitat created.\nPartners in the project include: Heavy Equipment Management Program at Hocking College, Monday Creek Restoration Project, Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the Little Cities of Black Diamonds .\nCommunities living along the main stream are now enjoying a renewed sense of pride in their environment, as evidenced by attending partner meetings, participating in volunteer initiatives, and educational outreach programs.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n ARRA\n forest\n Forestry\n FS\n mines\n Ohio\n riparian\n water quality\n Wayne National Forest", "author": "Pamela Stachler"},

The larger shelter includes six bedrooms with a total of 24 beds, more bathrooms, a large new kitchen designed for convenient use by multiple residents, better laundry facilities, and is handicapped accessible. There is also a large living and dining area for residents, a children’s play room and a teen room. The lower level includes a room which can be used for groups or meetings.\nEstablished in , HAVEN, Inc. works to support the needs of the community by providing services to children, families, and adults who have been affected by abuse, violence, or sexual assault. When first started, the group used members’ homes for temporary shelters for abuse victims. It bought its first shelter building in .\nAs the need for services grew, it became evident that a new, larger shelter was needed. A convenient building, the former Lincoln County Land Services Building known as \"the Annex\" was vacant with no prospective buyer. With $65,000 in the building fund, the HAVEN Board of Directors made an offer to the County Board for the Annex building, well below the County’s asking price of $249,000. The sale was unanimously approved last February.\nThrough a capital campaign, lead by volunteers, more than a half a million dollars was raised for the rehabilitation project. Community businesses and residents also donated materials, services, time, and furnishings to the new shelter. It was announced at the grand opening event that more than 2,800 volunteer hours were put towards the completion of the new facility.\nHAVEN, Inc. was also awarded a $100,000 USDA Rural Development Community Facilities Grant for the renovation project. Grant funds were used toward the purchase of furnishings and equipment for the new shelter building including an elevator, sprinkler system, fencing, plumbing fixtures, a new security system, updated phone system, parking lot resurfacing, landscaping and cabinetry.  Additional funding came from the Merrill Housing Authority, WHEDA, the Merrill Community Foundation, private donations and in the form of a cooperative loan provided by three Merrill banks.\nOn behalf of USDA Rural Development, I presented HAVEN, Inc, board members, and staff with an award acknowledging the efforts and leadership used in obtaining the resources to see this project through to completion and for their dedication to improving the quality of life for victims of violence.\nTo find out more about USDA Rural Development programs click here. \nThe new shelter for victims of domestic violence in Merrill, Wisconsin, funded in part through a grant from USDA.\nKelly Edwards, (right) representing USDA Rural Development presents HAVEN, Inc.

However, one residential backyard, nearly 6 miles from downtown Atlanta, calls into question whether this is suburbia at all. There were swings, a tree house, and even patio furniture. Yet one feature certified this was not your mother’s suburban home: over a dozen chickens living comfortably in a custom made “Coop de Ville.”   \nThe rise of “backyard poultry” is one of many agricultural phenomena tied to a growing food consciousness and increased urbanization. And while USDA’s fundamental job doesn’t change, the Department does because the challenges do.  The recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at increasingly popular backyard chicken coops underscore this. While this concern was not clearly expressed in the Act of Congress that created the Department, the mandate was. USDA still works to “acquire and to diffuse…information” towards facilitating the protected growth of American agriculture. That service is what brought Research, Education, and Economics Undersecretary Dr. Catherine Woteki to this residence in Decatur, GA.

In remarks at the World Leaders Summit, President Biden announced that the United States intends to mobilize $1 billion in investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation over five years .\nPreviewed at President Biden’s Leaders Summit on Climate in April, AIM for Climate is a pioneering initiative uniquely focused on increasing investment and enabling greater public-private and cross-sectoral partnerships, intended to both raise global climate ambition, and underpin transformative climate action in the agriculture sector in all countries. AIM for Climate has already begun to bear fruit, garnering an “early harvest” of $4 billion in increased investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation over five years.\nAIM for Climate partners are mobilizing this investment to close the global investment gap in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. Climate-smart agriculture is an approach that helps to guide actions needed to transform and reorient agricultural systems to tackle three main objectives: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes, while adapting and building resilience to climate change and/or reducing/removing greenhouse gas emissions. AIM for Climate seeks to create incentives for, and mechanisms for maximizing the impact of, new investments toward an agriculture sector that is ready to face a changing climate.\nGovernment partners are providing the crucial foundation of AIM for Climate, through a wave of public investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. Other sectors, including business, philanthropy, and other non-government partners are invited to build upon that foundation with “innovation sprints” – investments in specific, impactful, measurable, expedited efforts – or by providing critical knowledge for identifying investment gaps, challenges, and opportunities.\nAIM for Climate has three primary objectives:\n Demonstrate collective commitment to significantly increase investment in agricultural innovation for climate-smart agriculture and food systems over five years ;\n Support frameworks and structures to enable technical discussions and the promotion of expertise, knowledge, and priorities across international and national levels of innovation to amplify the impact of participants’ investments; and\n Establish appropriate structures for exchanges between Ministers, chief scientists, and other stakeholders as key focal points and champions for cooperation on climate-related agricultural innovation, to engender greater co-creation and cooperation on shared research priorities.\nAIM for Climate focuses on increasing and accelerating investment in, and other support for, climate-smart agricultural innovation in the areas of:\n Scientific breakthroughs via basic agricultural research through national-level government and academic research institutions;\n Public and private applied research, including through support to international research centers, institutions, and laboratory networks; and\n Development, demonstration, and deployment of practical, actionable, and innovative products, services, and knowledge to producers and other market participants, including through national agricultural research extension systems.\nAIM for Climate government partners announced at COP26 include:\n Government Partners\n Azerbaijan\n Australia\n Bahamas\n Bangladesh\n Brazil\n Burkina Faso\n Canada\n Colombia\n Denmark\n Finland\n Georgia\n Ghana\n Honduras\n Hungary\n Ireland\n Japan\n Kenya\n Republic of Korea\n Israel\n Lithuania\n Mexico\n Morocco\n New Zealand\n Philippines\n Romania\n Singapore\n Sweden\n United States\n United Arab Emirates\n United Kingdom\n Uruguay\n Ukraine\n Vietnam\nA full list of partners and more information on AIM for Climate is available at www.aimforclimate.org.

This year’s theme is Owning Our Identity, a reference to the principles and values that distinguish cooperatives from other business forms.\nCooperatives are created by individuals to tackle issues they are unable to solve individually. Co-ops have additional features that make them an attractive option in today’s environment, including the ability to address social justice, create wealth in local communities, encourage self-determination, and build capacity in a community. But cooperatives do not guarantee business success and like other business models require planning and hard work. (View the top myths about cooperatives to learn more!)\nCooperatives are made up of members who collectively own, operate, and run the organization, with each member typically getting one vote on decisions. Members are also the customers and use the cooperative services from agriculture marketing, food distribution, mutual purchasing, home care, childcare, real estate, to workers joining together to continue operating businesses that otherwise would have been closed or taken over by competitors.\nCooperatives are resilient as evidenced by the fact that 23 percent of the country’s agricultural cooperatives have been in business 100 years or more, 54 percent have been operating for 75 years or more, and 77 percent have been in existence 50 years or more. To achieve such resilience and own their identity, cooperatives have shown they are ready and able to thrive in their communities through the upheavals and changes in the economy; from a pandemic to competition looking to overtake their sectors, and in members’ mindsets that evolve as new generations evolve how cooperatives are run.\nIn celebration of National Cooperative Month, learn more about the resources available at Rural Development to help communities start, sustain, or convert to a cooperative business model:\n Interagency Working Group on Cooperative Development: The Interagency Working Group for Cooperative Development, led by USDA Rural Business-Cooperative Service, met five times in to uncover how cooperatives operate and benefit local people and communities in the housing, food, child care, real estate investment sectors.
