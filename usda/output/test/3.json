In addition to feeding the world, the ag industry continues to be the strong backbone in our nation’s economy – in both rural and urban areas. To help continue this trend, we set out to groom the next generation of ag leaders. Our Fruit and Vegetable Program developed a strong relationship with high schools in a couple of the country’s largest cities, allowing students to work with the agency while still enrolled in high school.\nWe started in New York City, home of the Hunt’s Point Terminal Market – the nation’s largest wholesale produce market – so that students at John Bowne High School could get their feet wet in the agriculture industry.

{"theme": "Disaster", "content": "Animals\n Plants\n Jun 17, \n Written by Bill Wood, State Biologist, AlaskaLet’s say you’ve just awakened from a restless 6-month nap. You check on the kids and it seems like everyone is really hungry. On your way to the grocery store you pass a chicken take-out joint and the smell of those fryers is irresistible. With kids in tow, you perambulate into the unattended shop; by all appearances, it seems you may have discovered the proverbial “free lunch.” Who could say no?\nThis happens for scores of mammas and pappas all over the Kenai Peninsula every spring—mamma and pappa bears, that is. And it’s not just chicken on the menu. Equally delectable items like dog food, honey and fish, not to mention livestock feed, a wide variety of human foods and other attractive items draw hungry bears that are just following their natural instincts. Bears spend as much as 80 percent of their waking day feeding or foraging for food. So when they’re rewarded for their efforts with a fairly easy meal and experience no negative repurcussions, they can quickly become habituated to that attraction.\nBears can be destructive and these situations can potentially be dangerous for all involved. Chicken coops, beehives, smokehouses and the like can quickly become demolition sites with lost equipment, money, time and effort. Sometimes encounters between humans and bears don’t turn out so well for the people, but they never turn out well for the bear. People can be proactive in reducing the potential for these kinds of human-bear encounters in a few important and sensible ways.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program (WHIP) helps provide solutions for issues like this one. WHIP’s cost-share funding assistance is used to improve a wide variety of wildlife habitat conditions and help reduce negative impacts to wildlife species on private land.\nFor the fiscal year, NRCS has developed a new initiative available to landowners only on the Kenai Peninsula. The new project idea seeks to reduce potential up-close-and-personal interactions between people and bears at sites of human-induced bear attractants and provides matching funding to landowners to install permanent electric bear fencing. This type of fencing is an effective technique to exclude bears from areas where they should not seek food.\nAfter receiving their first shock, many bears seem to sense the electrical charge in the fence lines and avoid those fences. When the fences are properly designed, even their appearance can remind bears of their previous unpleasant encounter.\nNRCS, in cooperation with Alaska Department of Fish and Game, will also provide fence designs and site management plans and recommendations for the installation of the fences. Site inventory and assessment is part of the technical assistance landowners will receive, in addition to help with purchase and installation costs.\nTo find out more about the program contact the NRCS Kenai Field Office at 283-, the NRCS Homer Field Office at 235-, or the office of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in Kenai at 262-.\nA mamma grizzly on the hunt for food in Alaska.\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Tags:\n ADFG\n Alaska\n Animal Health\n Kenai\n NRCS\n WHIP", "author": "Unknown"},

The pilot determined that an ongoing investment of less than 15 cents per person per day may result in a 25 percent increase in fruit and vegetable consumption among adults. Adults receiving the HIP incentive consumed, on average, an ounce more fruits and vegetables per day than non-participants.\"Although healthy foods aren't necessarily more expensive, many low income people face time and resource challenges when it comes to putting healthy food on the table that can make less healthy options seem more appealing,\" said Vilsack. \"The results of the Healthy Incentives Pilot demonstrate the clear impact that promoting nutritious food choices can have on improving the healthfulness of SNAP purchases.\"Vilsack also highlighted ongoing public-private efforts that provide support and incentives to SNAP participants to purchase more healthy foods. He cited a pilot project in Minnesota that offers $5 coupons to SNAP households for the purchase of fresh fruits and vegetables and a pilot project in Michigan to make locally sourced produce available in corner grocery stores in metropolitan Detroit.\"Research to date shows that incentives can work, but we know that no single solution can solve the problems of poor diet and obesity among American children and families,\" said Vilsack. \"That is why we are supporting a broad spectrum of SNAP-focused strategies that empower low-income families to purchase more healthy foods.\"Providing science-based nutrition advice and expanding the availability of healthy food to all Americans is a major goal of USDA's nutrition assistance programs and this Administration.

USDA is fighting food waste and you can too.\nComposting is nature’s way of recycling! Here are a few reasons to get started today:\n Feed the soil without using chemical fertilizers.\n Keep food waste out of the landfills and prevent greenhouse gas emissions.\n Conserve water by building healthy soils.\nGet Started\nThere are different ways to get started composting today. You can start a backyard composting bin or use worms to do the work.\nBackyard composting in three easy steps:\n Choose a location. A good site is dry in either the sun or partial shade.\n Set-up your compost bin. Purchase a compost bin or create an inexpensive bin with wire mesh and 3-4 poles for support.\n Get composting. Include 2-3 parts “brown material” (fall leaves, twigs, shredded newspaper, straw, wood chips, and shredded wood) and 1 part “green material” (vegetable and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, crushed eggshells, garden and grass clippings, tea bags without staples) by volume then add water to keep moist. Don’t forget to turn your pile! A monthly rotation is a good rule of thumb.\nWorm Composting Setup:\n Select Container. Purchase a worm bin or make your own from a plastic or wood storage container. Worm bins require holes drilled for aeration and drainage. There are several online sources with instructions to create a worm bin.\n Locate bin. The ideal temperature for worm composting is 59-77 degrees F. The bin can be kept indoors or outdoors in the shade. During colder months, insulate the worm bin with blankets, straw, or other material to keep it warm.\n Worm Bin Setup:\n Worms need bedding such as a mixture of non-glossy paper, cardboard, or leaves. Soak the material for 10 minutes, wring out the water so it is moist but not saturated, and place it in the bin with a handful of soil.\n Now you are ready to add your worms. There are over 9,000 species of earthworms, but only 7 are suitable for vermicomposting. The most widely used species is the “red wiggler” which you can buy from a worm grower. Do not use worms from a bait shop or your garden since they will not be able to thrive in your worm bin.\n Feed your worms veggie and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, eggshells, and moistened bread.

Unfortunately, though, their numbers have been threatened in recent years throughout the state.\nManatees in Florida’s Indian River Lagoon (IRL), which stretches 156 miles along Florida’s eastern coast, have been starving to death at an alarming rate over the last two years. These deaths can be attributed to a lack of seagrass, their main source of food, which is being affected by algal blooms.\nAs the algae blooms destroy seagrass beds, it causes sediment to float to the water’s surface. The water goes from clear to murky, making it harder for light to penetrate the water and provide sustenance to the seagrass. This creates a vicious cycle where more seagrass dies, more sunlight is blocked, and the manatees are left with less food to eat.\nNRCS is part of a team working to address the challenge, along with St. Johns River Water Management District, the University of Florida, among many other national and state agencies.\nThe scientists go out on the IRL in pontoon boats and use sonar to conduct underwater soil surveys to gather information on the healthiest areas and the most degraded areas of the lagoon. The information is used to decide where to concentrate restoration efforts. This information has helped improve lagoons through actions like clams, oysters, and seagrass being deployed to aid in filtering and clearing the water.

It may not sound exciting, but that was the topic of my undergraduate research internship at USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Children’s Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) in Houston, TX, under the direction of my mentor, ARS scientist Dr. Michael Grusak.\nDr. Grusak taught me to consider the link between the laboratory and society. His lab focused on improving crop mineral uptake, which could benefit society by increasing the nutritional value of crops for humans. The emphasis on this connection between plant biology and society stimulated my interest in plant biology and, eventually, led me to pursue my own Ph.D. in plant physiology and genetics.\nNow, that summer job has led me back to USDA as a Science and Technology Policy Fellow through the American Association of the Advancement of Science in the USDA Office of the Chief Scientist, where I work directly to connect science to society. In my new role, I’m able to use science to inform agricultural policy making decisions by collaborating with others in USDA to develop science-based solutions to emerging issues, especially those related to improving agricultural resilience in response to climate change.\nAs an undergraduate intern, I was excited to contribute to ARS research, but never imagined that the roots I put down at CNRC would lead me back to USDA, supporting priorities that help advance American agriculture and aid in an all-of-government approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change.\nARS internship opportunities support future generations of the agricultural workforce.

But the growth in agricultural trade doesn’t mean that trade flows were insulated from the effects of the pandemic. Much of was in fact shaped by other factors. For instance, 95% of global agricultural trade growth came from China and was driven in part by non-pandemic related factors of increased feed demand, efforts to restock grain reserves, and policy factors.

Under this effort, a team of agricultural, transportation, public health, environmental, and regional economic experts will work directly with local communities to spur local economic growth and improve the quality of life for all residents.Local food sales topped $11.7 billion in according to industry estimates, underscoring the economic benefit that a local food system can offer a community. As part of today's announcement, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) released an updated state-by-state \"Made in Rural America\" report illustrating the impact of USDA's investments in rural communities, including local food. USDA has invested more than $800 million in more than 29,100 local and regional food businesses and infrastructure projects over the past six years.\"These state by state analyses reaffirm that local food is rapidly growing from a niche market to an integrated system recognized for its economic boost to communities across the country,\" said Secretary Vilsack. \"Local food creates new market opportunities for farmers, brings fresh meals into schools and other institutions, expands healthy food access to underserved communities, and builds infrastructure needed to support ranchers and other meat processors. By investing in projects at the local level, this Administration is encouraging growth in this sector and creating new opportunities for families who live in rural America.\"This is the second year of the Local Foods, Local Places program. In , 26 rural and urban communities participated in the program to create year-round, downtown markets featuring foods from local farmers; establish retail outlets to help revitalize small-town main streets; build centrally located community kitchens or food hubs to aggregate and market local foods; support business incubators to help entrepreneurs start food-related businesses on main streets; enhance public spaces for people to walk or bicycle to farmers markets and local restaurants; assist schoolchildren to grow their own food and make healthy local food accessible to families, including via SNAP benefits; and develop community gardens in walkable, transit-accessible places.Technical support teams through Local Foods, Local Places helped Osceola, Arkansas (pop 7,700) develop a new health foods cooking curriculum for the local school district, create a plan for a new downtown farmers market and implement infrastructure improvement efforts; guided North Little Rock, Arkansas (population 62,000) to enhance the livability of an emerging neighborhood though a new food hub; and worked with Wheeling, West Virginia (pop 28,000) to revitalize underused property into a community orchard, multi-use food facility, and a mobile market.Local Foods, Local Places is a partnership between USDA, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Transportation (DoT), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Delta Regional Authority (DRA). The effort is part of the White House Rural Council's \"Rural Impact\" effort to improve quality of life and upward mobility for kids and families in rural and tribal communities. Together, the agencies are investing $800,000 to support this round of assistance. Application and deadlines are available on line.Since , USDA has invested in 29,100 food hubs, small scale processing, farmers market and other opportunities in local food across all 50 states and the US territories. This includes USDA investments in the local food sector through over 12,000 microloans, smaller loans of up to $50,000 for small-scale producers who often sell products locally; and over 13,000 high tunnels, low-cost covered structures that extend the growing season and make locally-grown products available later into the year.Among the top ten states with federally funded local food projects are Kentucky, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Minnesota, West Virginia, Iowa, and Michigan. Five of these states (Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and West Virginia) are part USDA's StrikeForce Initiative for Rural Growth and Opportunity which coordinates USDA assistance in the Nation's most economically challenged rural areas.Many of these projects can be found on the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass.

This 5-day event is one of the largest international food and beverage trade exhibitions in the world, attracting 5,500 exhibitors and over 147,000 trade-only visitors representing 188 countries. I was very impressed by the wide variety of U.S. products on display and by the number of participating countries.\nFor nearly 20 years, the United States has participated in SIAL Paris. This year’s USA Pavilion at SIAL was the largest to date, with some 140 exhibitors occupying over 2,700 square meters. SIAL offers U.S. food exporters the opportunity to test products and meet with European as well as other international traders and industry professionals. Clearly, this is a major factor for the large U.S. presence.\nOne of my primary reasons for attending the show was to meet face to face with U.S. Cooperators, exhibitors, and importers from Europe and other regions, as well as industry leaders. I had the pleasure of talking with many small- and medium-sized companies and Cooperator groups who expressed their appreciation of our programs and services, including American Food Service, Head Country Food Products, Rogue Creamery, U.S. Meat Export Federation, USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, and representatives from the state regional trade groups (SRTG), just to name a few. Tuesday night’s SRTG-hosted trade reception, as well as an industry reception, was yet another wonderful opportunity to talk with Pavilion exhibitors and trade visitors. Reception guests included buyer groups from North Africa and the Middle East recruited by our FAS Field offices.\nThe European Union (EU) is a major trading partner for the United States. The EU is America’s fifth largest market for agricultural and food products. France alone imports nearly $1 billion of U.S. farm goods annually. However, the scope of SIAL extended beyond the EU, reaching importers from all corners of the world. Building a market presence is sometimes a long process, and participation in these types of trade shows introduces foreign buyers and consumers more quickly and effectively to the attributes and advantages of American products.\nLooking back on the response of visitors to the wide variety of U.S. food and beverage products showcased in the Pavilion, I am optimistic that the demand for U.S. agricultural products is strong, and our reputation as a reliable supplier of safe, wholesome, and innovative products is excellent.

AMS has reviewed the report and is engaged with ASI to determine the best solutions for the recommendations.  While some of the recommendations will require regulatory changes, many of the proposals can be addressed easily.  In fact, AMS has already eliminated the western regional lamb , changed the National daily lamb report to a weekly report, modified the reported weight categories, and removed unused purchase type categories.\nAMS is working with ASI on other projects, such as determining ways in which slaughter lambs are bought to ensure that the LMR purchase types are still relevant.  AMS is also working to develop strategies to more accurately define the lamb maturity window for the grade standards and will work with FSIS on a more agreeable term for “yearling mutton” such as “yearling lamb.” AMS and ASI are cooperating on the potential development of a lamb tenderness standard, and the potential development of a non-hormone treated lamb export certification protocol with the European Union.\nThe ALB and ASI recently received USDA approval to explore lamb instrument grading, through funding received from the National Sheep Industry Improvement Center.  The project will be a two phased approach to finalizing USDA’s standardization of the concept and evaluating the benefits and return on the investment to garner industry acceptance.\nThe USDA is committed to working with our partners in the industry to not only meet these challenges but to succeed in creating an industry that provides quality products to consumers and increased producer returns here at home.\n Category/Topic:\n Health and Safety\n Animals\n Plants\n Tags:\n ALB\n AMS\n European Union\n FSIS\n Producers", "author": "Edward Avalos"},

Not only do these baskets feature traditional American dishes, many of the ingredients are exported by the United States, including turkey, cranberries, broccoli, potatoes, beets, lettuce and California wine.\nFollowing the Thanksgiving episode of “King of the Happy Life” last year, Chen was so overwhelmed with orders that he had to limit the number of baskets available this year.\nThe popularity of these Thanksgiving baskets is reflective of increased demand for U.S. food and agriculture around the world.  Earlier this month, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that U.S. agricultural exports reached a record $137.4 billion in fiscal year , which exceeds the previous record by $22.5 billion. The agricultural trade surplus soared to a record $42.7 billion in FY.\nThis rise in exports is good news for all Americans, especially considering every $1 billion of U.S. agricultural exports supports 8,400 American jobs.

One way we do this is by organizing the USA Pavilion at FOODEX Japan, the largest food and beverage trade show in Asia. This year’s show, which was held March 6-9, drew 74,000-plus attendees, not just from Japan but also from other Asian markets including Korea, Taiwan, China, Thailand and Hong Kong.\nU.S. Ambassador to Japan John V.

(Photo Courtesy of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo)\nThe USA Pavilion was one of the largest at the show, featuring more than 70 U.S. companies and a wide range of “Made in America” products, including meat and seafood, fresh produce, wine and specialty snack foods. Participants had an opportunity to showcase their wares to key decision-makers from restaurants, supermarkets, wholesalers, grocery stores, foodservice and hospitality companies, fast food chains and convenience stores, as well as distributors, agents and brokers.\nJapan is the world’s third-largest economy and the United States’ fourth-largest agricultural export customer, purchasing a record $15.6 billion of U.S. agricultural, forestry and fishery goods in . For U.S. companies, entry into the lucrative Japanese market is often the first step towards expansion to the rest of Asia. That’s why our ATO strives to help U.S. companies shine at the FOODEX show, providing logistical support and briefings, offering samples of U.S. products at a “Gateway to American Food” demonstration area, and helping match U.S. exhibitors with potential business contacts.\nWhile final results from the show are not yet in, a preliminary survey indicates U.S. exhibitors made more than $13 million in projected sales.\nOver three years, more than 1,000 U.S. companies and organizations—about 70 percent of them small and medium sized businesses—participated in 87 USDA-endorsed trade shows in 20 countries. On-site sales totaled more than $350 million and 12-month projected sales reported by exhibitors were estimated more than $2.7 billion. The companies made over 42,000 business contacts and displayed nearly 20,000 new products in various markets on all continents.  Trade shows give companies even more opportunities to make business contacts and share their products with potential buyers and consumers.\nCurrently, the American brand of agriculture is surging in popularity worldwide. Farm exports in fiscal year reached a record high of $137.4 billion—exceeding past highs by $22.5 billion—and supported 1.15 million jobs here at home.

Administered by the government’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM), CFC is the world’s largest workplace giving program. Since its inception in , federal employees have contributed more than $6 billion to the non-profit community.\nThis year, USDA has set a goal of raising just under $2 million from its approximately 10,000 employees in the national capital area. The official kickoff on Tuesday morning was an exciting event in the Whitten Building patio featuring top USDA leadership and more than 20 CFC registered non-profit organizations. Secretary Tom Vilsack and Undersecretary for Research, Education, and Economics, Dr. Raj Shah, led off the event by speaking movingly about the ways that non-profit organizations touch all of our lives in critical and transformative ways.\nDr. Shah spoke about incredible array of non-profits that participate in CFC, from groups doing lifesaving work fighting malaria in Africa to charities feeding hungry people right here in Washington, D.C. Secretary Vilsack spoke about his own birth in a Catholic orphanage, saying that he probably would not be here today if not for the nuns who took care of him and his birth mother.\nBoth stressed the importance of giving generously this year more than ever, as the worldwide economic crisis has dramatically increased the needs of the non-profit community even as donations to the sector have fallen off. Secretary Vilsack emphasized that as federal workers, we have all been blessed with good jobs, and that CFC is a wonderful opportunity to share that blessing with people in need.\nAfter Secretary Vilsack’s remarks, he officially opened the campaign by handing in his own completed pledge form. Dr. Shah and much of USDA’s senior leadership followed suit, as the assembled USDA employees watched a video message from President Obama. The President encouraged all federal employees to give generously to CFC this year, as part of the same spirit of service and community that he has worked to strengthen across the country through United We Serve.\nAs the first phase of the kickoff drew to a close, Bernadine Prince of FARMFRESH Markets spoke about her organization’s work to promote locally grown food throughout the DC Metro area. When Ms. Prince finished her remarks, it was time for the attendees to sample some of the fresh, locally grown food from USDA’s very own Farmers Market, such as apple cider and banana bread.\nBefore attendees enjoyed the delicious and healthy refreshments, Dr. Susan McCarthy from the Agricultural Research Service, USDA’s CFC Campaign Manager, launched the charity fair. This fair was an excellent opportunity for USDA employees to talk to representatives of a few of the thousands of non-profits represented in the CFC catalog. Employees who attended reported having a wonderful time and learning a great deal about non-profits doing great work in a wide variety of ways.\nThe Secretary is hoping that all employees will join him in giving to the non-profit organizations of their choice.

More recently, they launched a healthy living campaign to encourage the congregation and the surrounding community to get active and eat more nutritious foods.\nLed by Rev.

Photo courtesy of Master Gardener Linda Marshall and Jacquelin Henderson\n31st Street Baptist Church provides a great example of how to partner with the U.S. Department of Agriculture on multiple fronts. The church has partnered with Virginia Cooperative Extension and local master gardeners for technical assistance in growing food and teaching about nutrition. They will be starting a 4-H youth development club with two neighboring churches and teenagers from the Mayor’s Youth Conservation Corps also help tend part of the garden. The church has plans to launch a large farmers market this summer with produce from the garden and area farmers, and they will be holding a youth summer camp focused on healthy living in August.\nAnd there’s more: this spring marked the planting of a new flower garden in one of their other lots. The plan is to sell the cut flowers to other churches in the area to raise revenue and teach youth about entrepreneurship. The third open lot will be developed as a Zen garden, providing a space for tranquility in the neighborhood. Pastor Henderson’s goal is to “rally congregants around changing their lifestyles” while “respecting the dignity of the people who come to garden.”\nTo learn more about increasing access to healthy affordable food in your community, please visit Let’s Move!

D.C., July 2, – As part of the Obama Administration's commitment to deploying every available source of American energy and reducing our reliance on imported oil, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and Secretary of Energy Steven Chu announced new funding available to pursue new innovations in biofuels technologies, increase production of U.S. biofuels, and strengthen American energy security. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Navy and Department of Energy are announcing $30 million in federal funding to match private investments in commercial-scale advanced drop-in biofuels. The Energy Department is also announcing a total of $32 million in new investments for earlier stage research that will continue to drive technological breakthroughs and additional cost reductions in the industry.Advancing Commercial-Scale Drop-In Biofuel Substitutes for Diesel and Jet FuelIn his Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future released in March , President Obama set a goal of reducing oil imports by one-third by and laid out an all-of-the-above energy plan to achieve that goal by developing domestic oil and gas energy resources, increasing energy efficiency, and speeding development of biofuels and other alternatives. Domestic oil and gas production has increased each year the President has been in office. At the same time we continue to take additional steps to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. As part of that effort, the Blueprint directed the Navy, USDA and DOE to collaborate to support commercialization of \"drop-in\" biofuel substitutes for diesel and jet fuel. Competitively-priced drop-in biofuels will help improve America's energy security, meeting the fuel needs of U.S. armed forces, as well as the commercial aviation and shipping sectors. Today's announcement of an available $30 million in funding builds on that commitment, helping to speed the development of biofuels for military and commercial transportation that will reduce the need for foreign oil and strengthen rural America. The Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is available HERE.Made possible through the Defense Production Act (DPA), this funding opportunity enhances national security by supporting the creation and commercial viability of a defense-critical domestic biofuels industry to advance alternatives to petroleum. DPA is an authority that dates back to and has been used to boost industries such as steel, aluminum, titanium, semiconductors, beryllium, and radiation-hardened electronics.\"DPA is a critical component of strengthening our national security, and energy is a national security issue,\" stated Secretary Mabus. \"Our reliance on foreign oil is a significant military vulnerability and it would be irresponsible not to address it. Pursuing a viable, domestic alternative is the best way to preserve the budget for operational necessities like training and shipbuilding, and this funding opportunity is an important step in accelerating an economically self-sufficient alternative fuels market.\"The FOA comprises a two-phased approach, with government and industry sharing in the cost. In Phase 1, applicants will submit a design package and comprehensive business plan for a commercial-scale biorefinery, identify and secure project sites and take additional steps spelled out in the announcement. Awardees selected to continue into Phase 2 will submit additional information for the construction or retrofit of a biorefinery.Agencies participating in this initiative will make additional funding requests to Congress to support the initiative, including President Obama's budget request of $110 million.\"This is an important time for the biofuels industry to step up and show the Department of the Navy how they have developed biofuels that are certified and certifiable for military use,\" stated Secretary Vilsack. \"The ability for U.S. industry to make, create and innovate has never been more important to our national and energy security. I know that through this DPA effort the nation will be able to harvest an aviation biofuels industry to satisfy the world's needs, not just our U.S. military.\"Investments in Biofuels Research, Development and Demonstration to Drive Cost Reductions, Technological BreakthroughsToday, the Energy Department is also announcing new investments in earlier stage biofuels research that complement the commercial-scale efforts announced today by the Navy and USDA. Totaling $32 million, these early-stage, pre-commercial investments are the latest steps in the Obama Administration's efforts to advance biofuels technologies to continue to bring down costs, improve performance, and identify new effective, non-food feedstocks and processing technologies.\"Advanced biofuels are an important part of President Obama's all-of-the-above strategy to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil and support American industries and American jobs,\" said Secretary Chu. \"By pursuing new processes and technologies for producing next-generation biofuels, we are working to accelerate innovation in a critical and growing sector that will help to improve U.S. energy security and protect our air and water.\"The funding announced by DOE today includes $20 million to support innovative pilot-scale and demonstration-scale biorefineries that could produce renewable biofuels that meet military specifications for jet fuel and shipboard diesel using a variety of non-food biomass feedstocks, waste-based materials and algae. These projects may support new plant construction, retrofits on existing U.S. biorefineries or operation at plants ready to begin production at the pilot- or pre-commercial scale. This investment will also help federal and local governments, private developers and industry collect accurate on the cost of producing fuels made from biomass and waste feedstocks. The full funding solicitation is available HERE.In addition, the Energy Department also announced $12 million to support up to eight projects focused on researching ways to develop biobased transportation fuels and products using synthetic biological processing. Synthetic biological processing offers an innovative technique to enable efficient, cost-saving conversion of non-food biomass to biofuels. These projects will develop novel biological systems that can enhance the breakdown of raw biomass feedstocks and assist in converting feedstocks into transportation fuels.The projects will be led by small businesses, universities, national laboratories and industry and will seek to overcome various technical and scientific barriers to cost-competitive advanced biofuels and bioproducts. The full funding opportunity announcement is available HERE.The new investments announced today build on the steps the Energy Department is already taking to push the boundaries of biofuel technologies and move towards commercial-scale production at refineries across the country.

It protects against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), ear infections, upper and lower respiratory infections, allergies, intestinal disorders, colds and viruses.  Breastfeeding also protects mothers against osteoporosis and breast and ovarian cancer.  These nutritional benefits, both for children and for women, last long after breastfeeding has ended.\nI applaud local WIC and Nutrition Service programs like the one in Shenandoah Valley for their efforts to promote and encourage this vital part of human development.  Through innovative community support groups and local community partnerships; through health provider outreach and public awareness; and through on-line USDA resources such as Loving Support and WIC Works, women, families, and whole communities are more aware of the profound benefits of breastfeeding.\nBeth Taylor, Peer Counseling Coordinator for Shenandoah Valley WIC and Nutrition Services, provides encouragement to new mothers at the community breastfeeding support group August 6 in Martinsburg, West Virginia. \nNorma Dominguez, Peer Counselor at Shenandoah Valley WIC and Nutrition Services, chats with expecting and nursing mothers at the community breastfeeding support group August 6 in Martinsburg, West Virginia. \n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Audrey Rowe\n Loving Support\n Martinsburg\n Shenandoah Valley WIC and Nutrition Services\n USDA\n West Virginia\n WIC Works\n World Breastfeeding Week", "author": "Audrey Rowe"},

{"theme": "Food and Nutrition", "content": "Administradora del Servicio de Alimentos y Nutrición del USDA in\n Food and Nutrition\n Dec 11, \nNutricionistas del WIC discuten opciones de alimentos saludables con participantes y niños \nLos programas de nutrición del USDA (por siglas en inglés) proveen acceso a una dieta saludable a millones de americanos elegibles para las ayudas cada mes. Ya sea en escuelas, centros comunitarios o en casas de todo el país, estos programas trabajan en conjunto como una red de seguridad nutritiva para asegurar que ningún americano que cualifique pase hambre.\nConsidero que la nutrición suplementar para mujeres, infantes y niños, mejor conocida como WIC (por sus siglas en inglés)  es un programa especial. Dicho programa provee alimentos suplementarios a los más vulnerables—infantes, embarazadas, mujeres lactando y luego del parto y a niños hasta la edad de 5 años que enfrentan un riesgo nutricional. WIC también provee referencias para atención médica y social, y para educación nutritiva, incluyendo la promoción y el soporte a la lactancia materna.\nUn nuevo reporte del USDA del programa y características de WIC (disponible en ingles) confirma el éxito de estos esfuerzos. Por ejemplo, al revisar la información recopilada se registró un aumento del 4 por ciento en dos años en la participación de madres del programa WIC que lactan sus niños con leche materna. De las agencias estatales que reportaron madres que lactaron a sus hijos en el , se reportó que 67 por ciento de los infantes entre los 6 y 13 meses estaban siendo amamantados o lo estuvieron durante un tiempo en comparación con un 63 por ciento registrado en un estudio anterior que se realizo en el . Es más, la lactancia materna entre participantes de WIC ha estado en continuo aumento desde , y este año por primera vez, el porcentaje de mamas lactantes fue mayor que el número de nuevas madres no lactantes. Los hallazgos son una buena noticia, ya que la lactancia materna es el método ideal de alimentación para infantes, ya que provee beneficios para la mama y el niño.\nLas ayudas del programa WIC están llegando a madres y niños de escasos recursos. Cerca de tres cuartas partes de los 9 millones de participantes en WIC que reportaron sus ingresos se encuentran por debajo de lo que se considera como pobreza, a comparación del 15 por ciento entre la población general de los Estados Unidos. La mayoría de los que reciben las ayudas de WIC tienen menos de 5 años y más de la mitad de los participantes eran menores de 3 años.\nEntre otras buenas noticias es importante señalar que la obesidad infantil ha disminuido entre los participantes de WIC(disponible en ingles). En el , el 15.3 por ciento de los niños en WIC de un año confrontaban problemas de obesidad comparado con los hallazgos registrados el 16.8 por ciento en el . De manera similar, en el se reportó que 14.7 por ciento de los niños entre las edades de 2 y 4 experimentaba obesidad mientras que en el la cantidad disminuyo a 14.0 por ciento. El centro para el control de enfermedades profundizo en el estudio usando datos del WIC de 43 estados y territorios de niños entre las edades de 2 y 4 años. Descubrieron que al revés de la tendencia anterior, en 19 de los estados/territorios hubo  reducciones significativas y que 21 de ellos no reportaron problemas de obesidad infantil, con solo 3 mostrando aumentos.\nWIC ayuda a trazar el futuro de nuestro país de una manera vital al proveer a madres e hijos la nutrición que necesitan para tener embarazos exitosos y en el caso de los niños, un crecimiento saludable. De hecho, investigaciones anteriores han demostrado que las ayudas que ofrece WIC ejercen un papel importante en embarazos ya que ayudan a evitar complicaciones como fiebre, embarazos prematuros o incluso las costosas tarifas de los cuidados de salud. Este es un programa que no solo está proporcionando nutrición a familias de bajos ingresos, pero también reduciendo la mortalidad infantil y en verdad creando una generación futura más saludable.\nA version of this blog, is available in English (La versión de este blog está disponible en ingles)\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Breastfeeding\n Childhood Obesity\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n HealthierNextGen\n Infants\n Infants and Children\n lactancia materna\n Nutrition\n USDA \n WIC", "author": "Por Audrey Rowe"},

Photo by Peggy Greb.\nAntibiotics are lifesavers. We depend on them to treat bacterial infections and diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis and strep throat, as well as ear infections and infected wounds. In response to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance, veterinarians and producers are moving toward more judicious antibiotic use in food animals, while keeping them healthy and ensuring that our food supply remains safe.\nThis is especially important because certain bacterial strains have become resistant to some of the current antibiotics used to treat infections in humans and animals, escalating the need worldwide to find and develop alternatives to antibiotics.\nThe USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is developing new technologies to address antibiotic resistance and reduce the use of antibiotics through agricultural management, which includes food, animals, crops and the environment—water, soil and climate. This research falls into USDA’s One Health approach when mitigating the problems associated with antibiotic resistance.  One Health is the concept that the health of animals, the health of people, and the viability of ecosystems are intricately linked.\nA One Health approach embraces the idea that a disease problem impacting the health of humans, animals, and the environment can only be solved through improved communication, cooperation, and collaboration across disciplines and institutions. With its partners, USDA’s objective through this multidisciplinary approach is to preserve, maintain or reduce health risks to animals, humans, the environment and society. USDA has gained in-depth knowledge about antimicrobial resistance through its work on the agricultural environment, animal health and food safety.\nOver the years, scientists have developed and patented new technologies that could help reduce the use of antibiotics. Discoveries include using natural supplements like vitamin D to treat a condition of dairy cows called “mastitis,” which affects milk quality and production of cattle. Vitamin D, as well as yeast, also has the potential to treat turkey diseases.\nIn addition, scientists have shown that non-antibiotic methods, such as essential oils in citrus, reduce foodborne pathogens found in the gut of animals; that phytochemicals—natural chemicals found in such plants as safflower, plums and peppers—enhance the immune system of chickens; and that certain natural compounds kill foodborne pathogens like Salmonella or Escherichia coli O157:H7. Other research breakthroughs include creating new, effective antimicrobials and vaccines to fight such pathogens as Salmonella and Campylobacter to lower their incidence in chickens and turkeys and help keep consumers healthy.\nFinding alternatives to antibiotics has become a global issue as the demand for animal food products increases to meet the nutritional needs of a growing population. ARS scientists continue to seek solutions by developing new methods to control and prevent animal diseases and reduce bacterial pathogens in our food supply.\nARS scientists are studying a variety of techniques to ensure our food supply remains safe.

For example, ARS research includes understanding how common production practices might impact antimicrobial resistance and understanding whether certain animal pathogens may be a public health concern. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one bacteria type that is a public health concern because of its resistance to some antibiotics which can make it difficult to treat. MRSA has been found in livestock – mainly in swine. One particular MRSA strain, called ST5, has raised additional public health concerns because it is a major cause of human infections globally.\nTo address these public health concerns, ARS conducted research to determine whether production practices like using in-feed zinc as an antidiarrheal agent contribute to the emergence and spread of MRSA in U.S. swine populations, and if ST5 bacterial isolates from swine and from humans are genetically related.\nARS demonstrated that applying zinc in feed does not play a role in the prevalence of livestock-associated MRSA ST5 in the U.S. swine population. More importantly, ARS found that ST5 isolates from agricultural sources are genetically distinct and separate from clinical MRSA ST5 isolates obtained from human clinical settings. Specifically, isolates from agricultural sources were found to be extremely similar to each other within farms and lacked genes typically carried by human isolates. Collectively, ARS indicate that livestock-associated MRSA and clinical MRSA ST5 isolates are genetically distinct and transmission and/or genetic exchange between them is not currently occurring based on the findings in this study.\nARS researchers are continuing to build on these results to further determine the distribution and impact of livestock-associated-MRSA ST5 outside of the livestock setting. As we celebrate World Antibiotic Awareness Week, we remain committed to a “One-Health” approach to prevent, not just react to, complex public and animal health issues.

One question, for example, asks, “Are specific habitat components for breeding expected to change within the associated vegetation type?”  To determine vulnerability, users of the tool must answer if the breeding habitat components are expected to increase, decrease or be unchanged.\nAssuming climate change projections are correct, users then will note whether the information available is “adequate” or “inadequate” to assign a score for each question.  If the information is sufficient, an overall score will be assigned, representing the species’ relative vulnerability to climate change.\nThe tool focuses solely on the effects of climate change on land animals. Scores can be used to rank at-risk animal species and identify vulnerability “hot spots” within large landscapes, such as national forests.\n“This tool doesn’t provide a definitive answer about the extent climate change will affect animal species,” said Deborah Finch, program manager of the Grassland, Shrubland and Desert Ecosystems Science unit of the Rocky Mountain Research Station, “but information is power, and we’re empowering land managers to start assessing vulnerabilities and making decisions about where to direct their limited resources.”\nFinch, along with Megan Friggens and Karen Bagne, both Rocky Mountain Research Station researchers, developed the questions.

(Photos by Michael Schwartz (left) and Katie Zarn, U.S. Forest Service)\nThis post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research profile.\nThe U.S. Forest Service has a long history as a leader in conservation genetics, and this recently took an exciting step forward with the launch of the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation.\nThe Forest Service’s wildlife genetics lab, which has been central to the Rocky Mountain Research Station’s conservation genetics program since , has been reorganized and renamed to better reflect the scope of its work nationwide. The Center is a leading edge facility for advanced genomics research, nationally recognized, and works extensively with states, tribes, universities and private groups to address the management issues of over 60 fish and wildlife species.\n collected by the Center will support the new Forest Service Forest Planning Rule with timely and cost-effective information on wildlife and fish species. Information developed by the Center will be made available through the network of USDA Climate Hubs to assist private forestland managers, farmers and ranchers in reaching their conservation goals.\nWith state-of-the-art technology and the development of new tools and techniques, the main objective of the Center is to provide cost-effective and reliable genomic for improved species monitoring. By having more robust information, state and federal managers are better able to evaluate the genetic health and population viability of fish and wildlife species across the landscape. The discovery of a new fish species and the detection of invasive species are among the Center’s many contributions to the advancement of science and management.\nImagine an expansive landscape, filled with different and remote terrain, and being asked to determine if the area has been impacted by a new invasive species. This is a daunting challenge that land managers face on a regular basis. One of the Center’s specialties, analyzing samples of environmental DNA, or eDNA, shows great promise in addressing this challenge. This type of DNA has been separated from organisms into the surrounding environment and can be found in soil, water and air. Forest Service scientists are developing ways to determine what species are present by simply sampling a cup of water from locations across the landscape.\n“eDNA is a highly sensitive method for detecting organisms in low abundance and is generally faster and extremely cost effective compared to traditional methods used to detect exotic or endangered species,” said Dr. Michael Schwartz, director of the center.\nThe use of eDNA is an innovative approach to inventorying and monitoring fish and wildlife species. eDNA is particularly effective for detecting rare species that can be difficult to sample using traditional methods. For example, researchers at the Rocky Mountain Research Station have been working with partners and collaborators on the threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) since . Bull trout is a culturally significant species to several Tribes in the Northwest and Columbia River Basin. It is also a prized game fish, and land management and recreational angling are significantly influenced by whether or not this species is present in a given watershed. This species is particularly sensitive to changes in habitat and is also threatened by the introduction of the nonnative brook trout (S. fontinalis). Forest Service scientists have developed sampling methods to make eDNA surveys a reliable and accessible option for managers to detect the presence of bull trout and their invasive competitor, brook trout.\nForest Service scientists continue to develop eDNA techniques for detecting priority fish and wildlife.  eDNA is just one method of non-invasive genetic sampling, which uses forensic-style DNA samples to monitor rare and sensitive species, employed by the Center.\nA Bull trout swims in a stream.

Illustration)\nU.S. Forest Service scientists at the Rocky Mountain Research Station in Missoula, Mont., have identified a new species of fish—the cedar sculpin (Cottus schitsuumsh). Although thousands of new species are described by scientists each year, only a small percentage of them are animal species, and even fewer are found in the United States, underscoring the importance of this discovery.\nFreshwater sculpins, with their characteristic large heads and fins, are bottom dwellers that can be found in cold, fast-moving streams throughout North America. Biologists have long suspected that there were undescribed species of sculpins in the Upper Columbia River Basin, but lacked the tools to recognize them. Cedar sculpin populations were previously thought to be shorthead sculpin (Cottus confusus), an understandable misidentification given that sculpins are notoriously difficult to identify based on their physical features.\n“Through our collaboration with the University of Montana, we uncovered morphological and genetic evidence demonstrating that two species have been masquerading under a single name for over 50 years,” said Michael Young, a Forest Service research fisheries biologist.\nThe new species of sculpin was discovered in the Coeur d’Alene and St. Joe River basins in Idaho and part of the Clark Fork River Basin in Montana. In naming the species, the scientists consulted with elders of the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, whose historical homeland overlaps with the current range of this fish.  The scientific name for the species, Cottus schitsuumsh, is derived from the name for the Tribe, Schitsu’umsh, which means “those who were found here.” The common name refers to the western redcedar, a tree often found along streams in this region.\nWhile not commercially valuable in and of themselves, sculpins are well-known to anglers as a food source for big trout—a famous fly pattern, the muddler minnow, is designed to resemble a sculpin—and as indicators of water quality. The cedar sculpin is abundant in tributaries that also support westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout.\nForest Service scientists and their partners believe that much hidden diversity remains among sculpin populations throughout the Western U.S., with additional species waiting to be identified. They are dedicated to helping unravel these mysteries in order to conserve and sustainably manage our natural resources.\nTop, side and bottom view of a male cedar sculpin.

That’s why it is working with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to improve wildlife habitat in its communities across the state.\nThe Choctaws have used NRCS’ Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) to improve 860 acres in Carroll County on their property Malmasion this year. Malmasion is the site of a plantation that was built among Choctaw hunting grounds. The plantation burned in the s, and the Choctaws purchased the land in .\nThe tribe, through its director of natural resources, Jason Grisham, is implementing wildlife conservation practices that enhance and restore habitat for wildlife. While habitat has improved for deer, this land also provides refuge for other native animals, including turkeys, squirrels and songbirds.\nSince the tribe started working with NRCS, oak trees are dropping ample acorns, a favorite food of deer and other wildlife. Tribal members are also taking down bigger bucks—many with traditional bows.\nA big part of wildlife management is the use of prescribed burning for habitat diversity. This practice is not only used by NRCS conservationists, but is also a method the Choctaws have used for hundreds of years and are currently using to enhance this land.\nForest management is a big part of Jason Grisham’s (right) duties. Choctaws use the firewood for heat during the winter, but the bulk of it is used during funeral services, where a perpetual fire must be maintained for three days.\nNRCS tribal liaison Tim Oakes has worked with the tribe’s forestry department on managing the forests, providing technical assistance on thinning. As the habitat matures, the Choctaws cut trees to provide firewood. It is tribal custom to use firewood during funeral services, where a fire is kept burning for three days. The Choctaws are able to meet the demand through proper forest management.\nNRCS has also teamed up with the Choctaws in an educational project called “Wetland Discovery.” This 600-foot boardwalk meanders through a wetland constructed with WHIP funds. The elevated walkway has signs in written in English and Choctaw describing the native species of plants and animals.\nGrisham said Tribal leaders have recognized the benefits of working with NRCS in recent years, and that future partnerships are on the horizon.\nThe Choctaws use this area to hold cultural education events to teach children about their traditions and history.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Conservation\n Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians\n Native American Heritage Month\n NRCS\n WHIP", "author": "Judi Craddock"},

Once onboarded this fall, our USDA Digital Service (DS) Fellows will work to accelerate the design, development, and delivery of customer-centric services.\nTo gain insight on digital service best practices, we hosted the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) team at our headquarters in Washington, D.C. last month. Digital Service staff from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and other agencies shared their experience with USDS, how they are addressing current challenges, and what the future of digital services at their agencies looks like.\n“We are so appreciative of the great collaboration and partnership with USDS as we work to shape a Digital Service team here at USDA, and we learned a lot about how we can continue to drive this great work here across the many mission areas and missions of USDA,” said Arianne Gallagher-Welcher, Executive Director of the USDA Digital Service and Co-Founder of the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program.\nUSDA has seen firsthand the difference digital service can make. As the People’s Department, one of our most important missions is ensuring access to nutritious and safe food. Many of our nation’s youngest children were affected when a manufacturer product recall and weakened supply chains caused an infant formula shortage in . This particularly impacted USDA customers, as families who use our Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC program) buy 56% of all the formula sold in America.\nWith other federal partners, USDA teamed up with the USDS to develop and analyze real-time about the amount of formula available in any given U.S. location. As a result, 388 million bottles of infant formula were imported and deployed to the places that needed it most based on new and analytics.\nThis is just one example of how digital service can deliver solutions for the federal government’s most challenging technology implementation problems. You can learn more about this and other USDS solutions in their Impact Report. Our collaborative partnership with USDS is essential as our new Digital Service team launches.

In , the USDA Climate Hubs were established in to serve as regional centers of climate change information and outreach to reduce risks. The Climate Hubs enhance USDA capacity to deliver science-based knowledge and practical information to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests.\nEarly career professionals joined the Hubs to hone their science communication and engagement skills while supporting the Climate Hubs’ mission. In , Climate Hub Fellows focused on co-developing science-based information to help land managers make climate-informed decisions. Likewise, Hubs brought on interns and post-doctoral researchers. Climate Hubs were able to enhance engagements among land managers and scientists to co-develop science and technology. To mark the 10-year anniversary of Secretary Vilsack sharing his vision for the Climate Hubs, we share two highlights.\nDr. Julian Reyes was a Climate Hub Fellow with the Southwest Climate Hub. During his fellowship, he developed, AgRisk Viewer, which empowers decision makers to assess their climate risks by commodity type at the county scale using long-term crop insurance from Risk Management Agency.

The oil obtained from crushed carinata seeds can be refined to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This could reduce up to 68 percent of carbon emissions compared to a unit of conventional aviation fuel in the U.S. based on the findings of a USDA-National Institute of Fooda and Agriculture funded study recently published in the journal Global Change Biology Bioenergy by Dr. Puneet Dwivedi, Asiful Alam and Farhad Masum.\nCarinata does not compete with traditional summer crops grown in the region and could potentially provide additional income opportunities to farmers. It improves water quality, prevents soil erosion, and supports soil health. Since it is a non-food crop, carinata-based SAF also avoids the food-versus-fuel debate. The residues after crushing carinata are high in protein and can be used as animal feed. Refining carinata oil produces other valuable bioproducts such as renewable diesel and naphtha.\nCurrently, producing carinata-based SAF costs more than conventional aviation fuel. As part of coordinated efforts to advance sustainable avial fuel, the Biden Administration proposed tax credits for SAF production meet 100 percent of aviation fuel demand by . This incentive could potentially attract investors to establish the necessary supply chain for carinata-based SAF in the southern United States, which could drive demand for the crop and inspire farmers to grow carinata in the region.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n National Institute of Food and Agriculture\n NIFA\n aviation\n plants\n You May Also Like\n Shining a Spotlight on USDA Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area Employees\n NIFA Investment Paves the Way for Veterinary Students\n USDA Women in Science Share Advice with the Next Generation", "author": "Puneet Dwivedi"},

Many attended in-person to contribute ideas and host the event alongside White House staff, and hundreds more tuned in virtually. It was a day to remember, filled with excitement and a renewed commitment to the important work our agency does to improve food and nutrition security.\nThe conference and related national strategy (, 776 ) offer an important opportunity to acknowledge FNS’ role in reducing hunger, increasing healthy eating and mitigating health disparities. Our new report, “Leveraging the White House Conference to Promote and Elevate Nutrition Security: The Role of the USDA Food and Nutrition Service,” highlights the many ways FNS will continue to make strides toward the bold goals set during the conference. As Secretary Vilsack said in his opening remarks, “Something like this hasn’t happened in more than 50 years. Let’s keep the momentum of today going in a new and meaningful, strong way so we can fully meet this important moment—for our children, for our community, and for our country.”\nHere’s what FNS staff had to say about the event and what lies ahead:\n “It was such an inspirational day—I was struck by the energy and excitement at the conference and the enthusiasm from the attendees to work together to meet the conference goals.” – Jackie Haven, deputy administrator, Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion\n “I was excited to hear medical professionals stating emphatically the connection between nutritious food and overall health. I felt such pride to be part of the great mission of FNS while listening as speakers shared their personal experiences with food insecurity, the support provided by our programs and their desire to pay it forward.” – Dr. Patty Bennett, Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator\n “Engaging with diverse, forward-thinking individuals across various sectors of government, academia, and non-profit organizations, while listening to folks willing to share their lived experiences mirrors the all-hands-on-deck approach needed to provide nutritious food for all and eliminate diet-related diseases.” – Justice Wright, senior technical advisor, Office of Policy Support\n “The conference provided such a great opportunity to reflect on what we have accomplished and look forward to what still can be done. I was inspired by the overwhelming commitment and energy from all the speakers and excited to hear throughout the conference that FNS programs are so much a part of the solutions.” – Tim English, associate administrator, Regional Operations and Support\n “It was an honor to participate and represent the FNS SNAP team at this historic event. My role as notetaker for pillar 3 and facilitator for a small group session enabled me to engage with conference participants and speakers in a positive way to support the vision to end hunger by .” – Laura Griffin, senior policy advisor, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\n “As Chef José Andrés said, school meals are the ‘Trojan horse of goodness!’ I’m looking forward to using my opportunity as a presidential management fellow to work across FNS and other agencies to devise creative and equitable ways to extend nutrition education and food access between the school lunch table and the family dining table.” – Stacey Viera, program analyst and presidential management fellow, Office of Child Nutrition Programs\n “I appreciated seeing the broad range of individuals who participated in the conference, particularly the young people. I am excited to see what substantive changes are inspired by the conference and proud to support the goals of ending hunger and improving health outcomes. This is a really exciting time to work for FNS!” – Alexei Schnakenburg, program analyst, Western Regional Office\n “It was such a powerful and motivating conference and for the sake of our generation and those to come, let’s keep the momentum going!” – David Herring, nutritionist, Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion\n “This event was a great reminder that FNS and its partners do so much more than provide food—they connect people to their communities, provide nutrition security and empower the most vulnerable to make healthy choices that not only impact themselves, but generations after them.” – Katey Yoast, lead analyst, Mid-Atlantic Regional Office\n “During the conference, I felt inspired and motivated. The potential for both intragovernmental and public-private collaboration is exciting—and I am grateful to have a role in improving the lives of our fellow Americans.” – Patrick Farrell, WIC program specialist, Mid-Atlantic Regional Office\n “It was a historic and life-changing day for all Americans, whether they realized it or not! I was particularly excited to hear this administration acknowledge the relationship between promoting healthy eating and reducing preventable diseases.” – Tiffany Reuss, WIC nutritionist, Southwest Regional Office\n “Incredibly thankful that the administration held this summit to focus on the food security issues that continue to devastate our nation.

At the Food Bank of Lincoln, we have been able to leverage Reach and Resiliency sub-grant funding awarded by our Nebraska TEFAP agency to identify underserved areas and to implement strategies to increase TEFAP access in those areas. In some cases, the strategies were as simple as increasing the frequency of deliveries to specific communities to ensure that existing TEFAP resources were being equitably distributed.\nDuring the first quarter of the grant, we implemented a 21% increase in deliveries to four identified underserved counties, which resulted in a 55% increase in TEFAP pounds of food distributed to those areas when compared to the previous year. As a result, TEFAP is now reaching more than 4,000 households in Butler, Fillmore, Otoe, and York counties. We also now have 12 food access points in those counties and three additional non-profit partners involved in TEFAP operations.\nA recent pantry partner gave their input regarding food access: “As food prices continue to rise, having the ability for increased deliveries to both of my rural food pantries is critical. The number of food pantry clients has doubled in the past few months, and I expect a steady increase. It is very difficult for clients to receive fresh produce in rural areas, and that is something that is always in need. To buy one head of lettuce now is almost $5 at our rural grocery stores, and 99% of our clients cannot afford something as simple as a head of lettuce with the price increases.”\nThe TEFAP Reach and Resiliency Grant has provided support to the Food Bank of Lincoln as they deliver USDA TEFAP products more broadly to our neighbors in need. The grant has also expanded the use of to identify convenient delivery areas as well as ensure an increased focus on consistent access to USDA TEFAP products for communities. We are well on our way to closing this inequity gap in our targeted four counties.\nStates are encouraged to apply for TEFAP Round 2 grant funding at TEFAP Reach and Resiliency | Food and Nutrition Service (usda.gov).\n Category/Topic:\n Equity\n Food and Nutrition\n Initiatives\n Nutrition Security\n Tags:\n Food and Nutrition Service\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n Nutrition\n food insecurity\n TEFAP\n Food Distribution\n Equitable Systems\n You May Also Like\n SNAP-Ed Connects Culture, Land, and Food\n Healthier Foods, Healthier Minds\n National Women’s History Month: Celebrating FNS’ Unsung Heroines", "author": "Emily C.

This iconic annual event is often celebrated by ordering takeout and delivered foods, which if left out too long, can cause foodborne illness.\nLeaving food out at room temperature is a big food safety penalty. Bacteria that can cause foodborne illness will start to grow to dangerous levels in the range of temperatures between 40 F and 140 F when left out for over two hours or one hour if above 90 F. This range of temperatures is called the Danger Zone.\nTo avoid foodborne illness during the big game, follow this game plan:\n Keep cold foods cold and hot foods hot. Cold foods should be kept under 40 F on the buffet table by nesting serving dishes of food in bowls of ice. Hot foods should be kept above 140 F. A preheated oven, chafing dishes, preheated warming trays or slow cookers can be used to keep food hot.\n Don’t serve all food at once. Use small platters and replace them often with fresh refrigerated platters of food, rather than adding fresh food to a serving dish already on the table. Hot foods should be reheated to 165 F as measured with a food thermometer. When reheating in the microwave, cover the food for even heating. Check the temperature of the food in several places with a food thermometer, as some microwaved foods can have cold spots.\nFor more information, call the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline or email MPHotline@usda.gov to reach a food safety expert or chat live at ask.usda.gov from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Health and Safety\n Tags:\n Food Safety and Inspection Service\n FSIS\n Super Bowl\n foodborne illness\n You May Also Like\n USDA Process Verified Program: Transparency from Farm to Market\n Pack It Safe, Pack It Smart: Back-to-School Lunchbox Packing Essentials\n Food Safety Sparklers: Clean, Separate, Cook and Chill", "author": "Communications Program Specialist Beverly Cazares"},

Unfortunately, though, their numbers have been threatened in recent years throughout the state.\nManatees in Florida’s Indian River Lagoon (IRL), which stretches 156 miles along Florida’s eastern coast, have been starving to death at an alarming rate over the last two years. These deaths can be attributed to a lack of seagrass, their main source of food, which is being affected by algal blooms.\nAs the algae blooms destroy seagrass beds, it causes sediment to float to the water’s surface. The water goes from clear to murky, making it harder for light to penetrate the water and provide sustenance to the seagrass. This creates a vicious cycle where more seagrass dies, more sunlight is blocked, and the manatees are left with less food to eat.\nNRCS is part of a team working to address the challenge, along with St. Johns River Water Management District, the University of Florida, among many other national and state agencies.\nThe scientists go out on the IRL in pontoon boats and use sonar to conduct underwater soil surveys to gather information on the healthiest areas and the most degraded areas of the lagoon. The information is used to decide where to concentrate restoration efforts. This information has helped improve lagoons through actions like clams, oysters, and seagrass being deployed to aid in filtering and clearing the water. Scientists hope that continued improvement will eventually lead to the full restoration of manatees in the IRL.\nDerric Cushman is a public affairs specialist with the USDA Farm Production and Conservation Business Center.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Natural Resources Conservation Service\n NRCS\n Conservation\n Florida\n manatees\n You May Also Like\n Hands-on Experience Helps USDA National Scholar Secure Permanent Position\n Informing Conservation Decisions and Policies through 20 Years of USDA's Conservation Effects Assessment Project\n USDA Offers Many Resources for Veterans", "author": "Derric Cushman"},

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nWood makes great packaging material—it’s inexpensive, abundant and versatile—but there’s one drawback: destructive forest pests stowaway in the pallets, crates and dunnage (wood used to brace cargo) used in international shipping. Over many years, international trade has resulted in the inadvertent introduction of many non-native wood-feeding pests and plant pathogens in the U.S. and throughout the world. Some of these non-native insects, including the emerald ash borer and the Asian longhorned beetle, have become highly invasive and caused serious environmental and economic impacts.\nBut an international standard for wood packaging material is slowing the inadvertent export of invasive bark- and wood-boring insects, according to a study conducted by Robert Haack, a research entomologist with the Forest Service’s Northern Research Station in Lansing, Mich., and a team of scientists. Researchers found as much as a 52 percent drop in infestation rates in the U.S., where the standard was implemented in three phases between and . The study was published May 14 in the journal PLOS ONE.\nThe International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15, or ISPM 15, is a set of standards developed by the International Plant Protection Convention stipulating how wood packaging material used in international trade should be treated before export. Treatments for eliminating live insects that may be contained in wood include heating wood, fumigating it and requiring the removal of bark from wood used for wood packaging material. As of October , more than 78 countries had implemented ISPM 15.\nHaack and co-authors of the study, including U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists Kerry Britton (now retired), Joseph F. Cavey and Lynn J. Garrett, believe that the drop in infestation rates would be even more dramatic if more had been collected prior to implementation of the standard. The best available in the U.S. only allowed researchers to compare wood packaging infestation rates from two years prior to U.S. implementation of the new international standard to infestation rates during the first four years after the standards were implemented.\n“The reduction in infestation rate would likely have been even higher if we had more years of that predated U.S. implementation of these international standards,” Haack said. “For example, based on infestation of wood packaging material entering New Zealand from the early s, when infestation rates were higher, ISPM 15 has achieved closer to a 97 percent reduction in the number of insect stowaways.”\nInternational wood packaging material is now treated to prevent stowaways like this Asian longhorned beetle larvae.

Recently, an interagency team resolved an issue with Morocco, keeping a $126 million market open for American butter, cheese and other dairy products.\nU.S. agricultural exports continue to be a bright spot for America’s economy, worth a record $152.5 billion in fiscal year .  That’s why USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and its sister agencies work so hard to keep these export markets open.  So in , when Morocco requested that USDA use a new dairy export certificate that we could not endorse, we launched into action.  Our goal was to protect an export market worth $126 million annually while preserving our close relationship with a valued trading partner.\nMorocco is the 13th largest export market for our dairy products, and U.S. dairy exports are the fastest growing export category to that country.  U.S. companies export many dairy commodities to Morocco, such as butter, cheese and skim milk powder, as well as dairy ingredients such as milk protein and whey protein products.\nHowever, in Morocco’s agricultural officials requested changes to the information provided on the dairy export certificates issued by the unit I direct, the Grading and Standards Division of within the AMS Dairy Program.  Most countries importing U.S. dairy products require these certificates, and issuing them is one of many services my Division provides to exporters to maintain and expand market access.\nAs a stopgap measure, we began using a general dairy certificate to keep that market open.  But then, in April , following numerous detainments of U.S. dairy shipments, we learned that Morocco was considering stopping all U.S. dairy trade if we did not submit a specifically negotiated export certificate.\nBeginning in , the AMS Dairy Program worked closely with an existing interagency team of technical experts from AMS, USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address the issue.  The team submitted a response to Morocco that addressed additives, animal health issues, microbiological criteria and thermal treatment processes, as well as a proposed AMS Sanitary Certificate for Exports for Milk and Milk Products for Human Consumption to Morocco that reflected all the suggested changes.\nOn November 12, , we received the good news that the government of Morocco had accepted the proposed certificate—without further revision, concluding more than three years of negotiations.  The certificate’s acceptance means this important market will remain open to U.S. exports, paving the way for an even better year for the U.S. dairy industry.\nUSDA and AMS are no strangers to keeping U.S. export markets open.  In , the same interagency team responded quickly to changes in China’s regulatory requirements for U.S. dairy exports.  Their work helped to secure a market worth $1 billion annually.\nWe’re committed to keeping dairy and all other U.S. agricultural exports flowing.  By maintaining and expanding export markets, we help to strengthen our rural communities that produce the high-quality, American-grown products consumers worldwide desire.  And that’s good for everyone.\n Category/Topic:\n Trade\n Tags:\n agricultural exports\n AMS\n APHIS\n butter\n cheese\n China\n dairy\n dairy products\n Dairy Program\n Dairy Programs\n Exports\n FAS\n FDA\n International Trade\n Morocco\n natural milk protein\n skim milk powder\n Trade\n whey products", "author": "Diane Lewis"},
{"theme": "Forestry", "content": "Senior Trade Advisor, Foreign Agricultural Service in\n Trade\n Jun 20, \nDriscoll’s berries being sold in a store (Photograph courtesy of Driscoll’s. Copyright . All rights reserved.)\nTwo years ago this month, the United States and the European Union (EU) implemented an organic equivalence arrangement, meaning products that are certified as organic in the U.S. can also be sold as organic in the EU, and vice versa. This arrangement broke down many of the barriers that organic producers, especially small and medium-sized farmers, were facing in exporting their goods to one of their largest markets. It has also proved to be a good example of how we can recognize each others' systems and work together across borders to arrive at beneficial agreements.\nThe U.S. and EU have some of the strongest regulatory protections in the world, and the organic equivalence arrangement recognizes these standards and uses them for everyone’s benefit. Before the agreement, growers and companies wanting to trade products on both sides of the Atlantic had to obtain separate certifications to two different standards, which meant a double set of fees, inspections, and paperwork. Now, if a product is certified organic by one party, it can bear both the USDA organic seal and the EU organic logo, without going through that second certification process. This is possible because the EU and the U.S. have recognized that though our regulatory systems are different, they both produce high quality organic food and agricultural products under rigorous programs. Secretary Vilsack, while addressing the EU agricultural ministers earlier this week, had the same message of cooperation in regards to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP).\n“We also need to focus on reducing the impact of the differences in our regulatory and standard-setting systems. For companies on both sides of the Atlantic, this is perhaps the most promising – and challenging – area for cooperation in T-TIP,” Vilsack said. “The U.S. and the EU have the strongest regulatory protections in the world, and nothing we do through T-TIP will undermine this. But there are steps that can be taken to better align our regulatory and standard-setting processes by improving transparency, participation and accountability. The U.S.-EU organic equivalency agreement, which took effect two years ago this month, is a good example of how we can recognize each other’s systems and facilitate trade to the benefit of both sides.”\nThe organic arrangement expands market access, reduces duplicative requirements and reduces certification costs while protecting organic integrity.  The U.S. and EU work together to promote organic production and share technical information and best practices in an effort to further enhance the integrity of organic crops and livestock production systems.\nCarmela Beck, the National Organic Program Manager for Driscoll’s, an exporter of fresh berries, said the equivalency agreement has greatly simplified the export process, reduced confusion and redundancy and provided an opportunity for organic farmers.\n“The passage of the U.S.-EU equivalency agreement is a great success story and is a testament to the rigor of both the U.S. and EU organic standards,” Beck said.” Not only has the flow of trade been increased but the National Organic Program and the European Commission continue to work diligently to protect organic integrity in a global economy. Organic farmers now have even more opportunity to grow their businesses to meet this growing, global demand for organic products.”\nAmy’s Kitchen is one American company that has seen the benefit of the organic equivalence arrangement. Amy’s has seen a tenfold increase in its UK and EU business.\n“Since the U.S.-EU equivalency agreement took effect, Amy’s Kitchen is now able to export products directly from its U.S. manufacturing facilities,” said Andy Berliner, CEO and Co-founder of Amy’s Kitchen. \"This has led to a tremendous increase in business for Amy’s across the board, including the ability to share information about Amy’s foods being organic in the UK and EU on our packaging, a rise from 15 to more than 60 products now offered in the UK and EU over the last five years.”\nThe partnership, while providing a strong foundation to globally promote organic agriculture, is also a win for the American economy. Industry estimates show that the market for U.S. organics sales to the EU could grow more than 300 percent, from $70 million to $300 million, a huge boost for a growing sector of our agricultural economy. It also means higher incomes for organic farmers and ranchers, more opportunities for small businesses, and jobs for people who package, ship, and market organic products.\nUSDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service and Foreign Agricultural Service, along with the Office of the United States Trade Representative, were instrumental in developing the organic equivalency agreement between the EU and U.S. and have also worked to develop similar agreements with Canada and Japan.

USDA Photo Courtesy of Scott Bauer.\nEvery June, USDA joins the rest of the country to celebrate Dairy Month. It is a time to thank our nation’s dairy producers and processors for their tireless work to produce quality dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt. Here at USDA, besides getting our fill of our favorite dairy products, we celebrate our nation’s dairy industry every day by finding new markets where people can enjoy their products. This often entails working with other countries’ governments to negotiate export and import requirements as well as helping businesses meet these requirements.\nOur nation’s dairy exporters reach new markets with the help of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). Export certificates are often the critical piece in the trade puzzle. On this front, AMS offers certificates for more than 80% of the countries that accept U.S. dairy exports. Our Dairy Programs can verify that businesses’ dairy products meet export requirements. The AMS Dairy Grading Branch provides export certificates for products or conditions for which they have documentation for or from plants they inspect.\nCertificates are paper or electronic documents which describe and attest to attributes of consignments of food destined for international trade. Certification of food may be based on a range of inspection activities including continuous online inspection, auditing of the quality assurance system, and examination of finished products. With the help of export certificates, importers can confidently receive products that meet requirements agreed upon by the U.S. and the importing country. As a result, people all over the world enjoy U.S. dairy products.\nIn recent years, AMS helped open up U.S produced products to several major importing nations. In March , our agency enhanced its system, enabling the availability of electronic sanitary export certificates to China. Now exporters can request their China sanitary export certificates using the Electronic Document Creation System (eDocs). China is the world’s largest importer and is currently the second largest export destination for U.S. dairy products. Working with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), AMS helped 240 U.S. dairy and infant formula firms get audited and registered to export products to China using our eDocs system.\nAnother example of AMS connecting exporters to new markets happened in when the Customs Union (CU) trade bloc -- composed of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia -- came into existence. A new U.S. – CU dairy veterinary certificate was to resume trade in those countries. Trade was halted in when the CU demanded changes to the current U.S. export health certificate. Negotiations continued until March when AMS was notified that all members of the CU accepted a U.S. proposed export certificate for pasteurized milk products.  The U.S. government interagency team is discussing additional administrative steps before issuing certificates.\nIn addition to negotiating export certificate agreements with other countries, AMS has created a number of resources that will help dairy exporters. We encourage you to check out our Dairy Exports website. We recently held 20 webinar trainings that helped exporters become familiar with our systems. Our sites are equipped with important documents, frequently asked questions, and key contacts.\nThe effort to increase the number of export destinations for U.S. dairy businesses will help continue a positive trend for the industry. In the last 10 years, dairy exports have averaged a 21% increase per year. Currently, U.S. dairy exports are valued at $6 billion and the country is the world’s leading single country exporter of skim milk powder, cheese, whey, and lactose products.\nAMS is proud to be a leader when it comes to increasing demand for U.S. dairy exports. Whether it’s June or any other time of the year, we are committed to supporting our nation’s dairy producers and processors. We want to make sure that people all over the world can enjoy their quality products.\nAMS offers a number of services to help U.S. dairy exporters reach new markets. Offering certificates for more than 80% of the countries that accept U.S. dairy exports, AMS has helped the export industry average a 21% increase per year over the last 10 years.

{"theme": "Forestry", "content": "Announces Organic Crop Insurance, Other Measure\n Release & Contact Info\n Press Release\n Release No. .13\n Contact:Office of Communications 720-\n Washington, May 14, ― Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today discussed his vision for U.S. organic agriculture and USDA efforts to ensure its continued success during remarks to the Organic Trade Association. Vilsack announced a number of changes and new initiatives to support the continued growth of organic agriculture, including that the USDA's Risk Management Agency's (RMA) federal crop insurance program will increase coverage options for organic producers this year and provide even more options in , including a contract price addendum as well as new premium price elections for organic crops. Additionally, RMA will remove the current five-percent organic rate surcharge on all future crop insurance policies beginning in .Vilsack also said USDA will be providing new guidance and direction on organic production to all USDA agencies in support of organic agriculture and markets. USDA is now asking each agency to routinely address the needs of the organic sector in their programs and services where appropriate. The National Organic Program has supported the continued growth of America's organic sector, which has been increasing market share each year and now is a more than $30 billion industry. Vilsack noted that accurate is the biggest obstacle for developing better crop insurance options for organic farmers and expressed his desire that Congress help USDA make further progress by renewing the Organic Initiative as part of a new Food, Farms and Jobs bill.\"Organic agriculture is one of the fastest growing segments of American agriculture and helps farmers receive a higher price for their product as they strive to meet growing consumer demand,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. \"These new options will extend the safety net provided by crop insurance and provide fair and flexible solutions to organic producers. Coupled with the new guidance for agencies to support this growing sector, USDA recognizes that organics are gaining market share and is helping boost this emerging segment.\"New crop-insurance pricing options will be available to organic producers who grow crops under guaranteed contracts beginning with the crop year. This contract price option allows organic producers who receive a contract price for their crop to get a crop insurance guarantee that is more reflective of the actual value of their crop. They will have the ability, where available and at their choice, to use their personal contract price as their price election or to choose existing crop insurance price elections. This contract price option will be available for between 60 and 70 crops in the crop year and this contract price feature will be available to the majority of insured organic crops. RMA is also changing organic transitional yields (t-yields) so they will be more reflective of actual organic farming experience, starting with the crop year.All crops are being evaluated for establishing organic prices for the crop year. Current pricing options only allow farmers to insure organic crops at the conventional prices, with the exception of eight crops (corn, soybeans, cotton, processing tomatoes, avocados, and several fresh stone fruit crops) that already have premium organic price elections. RMA is working to provide organic price elections for six to ten crops in . Oats and mint are two crops that have already been selected for organic price elections in , and apricots, apples, blueberries, millet, and others are still under consideration.USDA's Agriculture Marketing Service last year announced the Organic Literacy Initiative, a public outreach and employee training program to help connect current and prospective organic operations with appropriate USDA resources. To date, over 14,000 USDA employees have taken the basic training on USDA's role in organic agriculture. The new guidance will further improve USDA agencies' ability to incorporate the needs of the growing organic sector into their programs and services. These combined actions should result in staff better equipped to help organic farmers obtain technical and financial assistance, insure crops and livestock, access research findings, secure loans, develop conservation practices, find current organic price information, and access local, regional, and international markets. Through this effort, agencies will also better understand the scope and rigor of the certification process and how it complements their own programs.Organic certification allows farmers and ranchers to receive premium prices for their value-added products. Over the past 10 years, the number of certified organic farms and businesses in the United States has expanded to approximately 17,750, representing a 240 percent increase since USDA first began collecting this . Similarly, the retail value of the organic industry grew almost 9.5 percent in to $31.4 billion. Organic foods continue to gain market share in the food industry, climbing to 4.2 percent of U.S. retail food sales in .USDA has already made several changes to better serve organic customers, including offering more flexible microloans and improving Federal crop insurance programs. To help open new markets for U.S. farmers and ranchers, USDA has streamlined trade with multiple foreign governments. These trade partnerships allow U.S. organic products to be sold as organic in Canada, the European Union, Taiwan, and Japan without maintaining certification to multiple standards. Expanding the reach of U.S. organic products creates opportunities for small businesses and increases jobs for Americans who grow, package, ship and market organic products.USDA is responsible, under the Organic Foods Production Act of (OFPA), for establishing national standards for organically-produced agricultural products. The National Organic Program has been critical for the development of clear standards and enforcing a level playing-field for organic businesses, which has lead to expanded trade opportunities to create new markets for U.S. organic businesses. These standards assure consumers that products with the USDA organic seal meet consistent, uniform standards.

On that date, 29 tribal colleges, representing different histories, cultural orientations, and organizational structures, received land-grant university (LGU) status. Such LGU status gave these institutions—referred to as LGUs—access to federal resources to help improve the lives of tribal students, while respecting sovereignty and promoting self-sufficiency in American Indian communities. In the ensuing 23 years, significant progress has occurred in building capacity at the land-grant system to better serve Native American students and communities.\nThe s are part of the family of land-grants that the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supports through research, education, and extension programs. These programs recruit and retain students in the food and agricultural sciences, enhance economic opportunities and quality of life, improve nutrition and health, and protect natural resources and the environment.\nThe tribal colleges and universities, now numbering 34, are located in 13 states and provide access to higher education to over 80 percent of Indian Country. Collectively, they enroll approximately 20,000 students and provide vital services to some 50,000 tribal community members. Unlike most institutions of higher education, the s teach in a cultural context that empowers students by drawing on the strength of their people’s histories, indigenous knowledge, and traditions.\nThe s provide much-needed high school completion (GED), basic remediation, job training, college preparatory courses, and adult basic education programs. They serve as community libraries and centers, tribal archives, career and business centers, economic development centers, public meeting places, and elder and child care centers. Examples of the strength of community, education, pride, and opportunity abound in Indian Country.

Team Up offers a unique learning experience that enhances schools’ food service operations through training and peer-to-peer mentorship to school nutrition professionals looking to maintain a healthy environment and encourage strong student meal program participation.\nWhat exactly happens at a Team Up training? Ever had an “a-ha” or a “why didn’t I think of that” moment when a friend shares a really great idea? Team Up is where “a-ha” moments are shared among school nutrition professionals and turned into action back via their school meals programs. Let’s break down a Team Up workshop to see how these “a-ha” moments transpire.\nA peer mentor shares her best practices for menu planning during the Wisconsin Team Up training.\nBest Practice Panel Presentations\n Great ideas are meant for sharing. Team Up workshops kick off with panels where participants hear school nutrition peer mentors share their best practices and strategies for issues like increasing school meal program participation, menu planning and financial management.\nAt the Georgia Team Up training, participants share ideas and questions for menu planning and increasing program participation.\nBreakout Sessions \nThis is where the magic happens! After listening to best practice presentations, participants break out into small groups for a round of brainstorming and problem-solving around each specific topic, all with best practice ideas in mind. Using the Egan Skilled Helper Model, which uses an opportunity-development approach, school nutrition peer mentors guide and facilitate discussions as participants identify their program challenges and develop solutions with their peers.  During the breakout sessions, participants examine:\nWhat is going on in my school nutrition program?\nWhat does a better outcome look like?\nHow do I get to the better outcome?\nHow do I make it all happen?\n The Action Plan \nParticipants examined their challenges and solutions and excitement is building around progress and potential opportunities identified during the breakout sessions. What do participants do with all of these great ideas? Peer mentors help participants put their specific strategies and solutions into an action plan using SMART goals, which are defined as goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time‐bound. Participants take their action plan home as a guide to implement their Team Up strategies and solutions in their school nutrition programs. \nResources \nOperating a school meals program can be challenging, but school nutrition directors don’t have to do it alone. Team Up workshops invite allied organizations to share their free school nutrition resources that support school food service operations and help create a healthy school environment. Participants can use these resources as they move forward with implementing their action plan in their school nutrition programs. \nNetworking is another valuable resource Team Up workshops provide, giving school nutrition directors opportunities to develop working relationships with their peer mentors and other school nutrition directors in their state. Many directors who have attended a Team Up training have expressed that they’re not alone and can turn to their fellow director. “I can now see what areas I need to work and improve on in my program. I see that I am not alone in my journey. I have many helpful people that I can rely on for help and guidance. The Team Up training was valuable to me because I am more comfortable talking to my peers. I see I am not alone and I can ask for help.” – Rebecca Lusk, Manager/Supervisor, Towns County Schools, Hiawassee, Ga. \nAfter the Workshop \nThe Team Up workshop may be complete, but the Team Up spirit lives on. After returning home, participants roll up their sleeves, take a deep breath, and take the first steps outlined in their Team Up action plan - and then real life happens. Barriers pop up as action plans are implemented, but there’s no reason to get discouraged. Team Up peer mentors and state agencies are still available should participants have questions or get stuck with their action plan. In addition, USDA together with the Institute of Child Nutrition hosts monthly webinars for school nutrition professionals to expand their knowledge and tools on a wide variety of topics; webinars recordings are made available online for later viewing. \nAnd this is why Team Up workshops are so effective – Team Up encourages school nutrition professionals to continue to network with their peers and problem-solve school nutrition program barriers long after the workshop is completed. No one is an island, and we must team up to make school meals accessible, nutritious and delicious! \nFor more information about the Team Up for School Nutrition Success initiative, check out the Team Up Web site and these guest blogs authored by former participants in the Team Up workshops.  For more information on other training and resources available to school nutrition professionals, visit our Healthier School Day web site.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Child Nutrition\n FNS\n Nutrition\n school meals\n schools\n Team Up for School Nutrition Success\n training", "author": "Amy Mazerall"},

(Photo courtesy of Right Light Photography, LLC)\nThe school nutrition community is celebrating National School Lunch Week from October 10-14. This year’s theme “Show Your Spirit” is all about encouraging parents, students and school officials to show their spirit for school lunch. Through the Team Up for School Nutrition Success (Team Up) initiative, school nutrition professionals have teamed up to provide nutritious and appealing meals to students, offering plenty of reasons for all of us to show spirit for awesome school meals!\nThe Team Up initiative, created through a partnership between the United States Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and the Institute of Child Nutrition (ICN), provides school nutrition professionals a unique learning experience.  The initiative is designed to enhance schools’ food service operations by providing training and peer-to-peer mentorship to school nutrition professionals who want to maintain a healthy environment and strong student meal program participation. The goal of this training is to help schools find simple ways to meet the updated USDA nutrition standards from the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act (HHFKA), while increasing the number of students enjoying healthy and flavorful school meals.\nDonna Harris, the former Child Nutrition Director for Perquimans County Schools in North Carolina, attended the first Team Up pilot training in in the Southeast Region. Harris was seeking better way to engage students in school meals. During this Team Up training, she learned best practices, tips and tricks for increasing participation in school meals through panel presentations by school nutrition peer mentors. After the presentations, Harris joined other school nutrition directors to network and brainstorm on creative solutions for common topics such as menu planning and financial management.  Directors turned their ideas into achievable goals as they created action plans using SMART goals with the help of their peer mentors. SMART goals are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely.\nIn her action plan, Harris wanted to tackle increasing school meal program participation in the district’s middle and high schools, so she set SMART goals to obtain student feedback and create student-approved menus. Back at her district, she conducted two student surveys and group discussions to gauge student preference.  As a result, several new student-approved recipes were added to the menu: barbeque chicken, buffalo chicken wraps, chicken salad wraps and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\nAlthough students had not responded well to meals that align with these updated nutrition standards in the past, Harris received positive feedback on the additions once she engaged students in nutrition education, explaining the USDA nutrition standards that schools must follow. In fact, the school’s student government association assisted in explaining the nutrition standards to students.  Harris demonstrated that when students have a voice in school menus and understand the USDA nutrition standards, they are more satisfied and more likely to purchase school meals.  This was evidenced by a notable increase in student meal counts on the days that new menu items were offered. Even school staff provided positive feedback: “the lunches taste good!” and “it was delicious!”\nHarris has since retired from Perquimans County Schools, but before her departure, she shared her action plan and best practices learned from the Team Up training with the new director. Harris wanted to see the Team Up spirit live on and encouraged the child nutrition department to utilize the Team Up peer mentorship model to train school nutrition staff.\nFNS also wanted to see the Team Up initiative live on after the Team Up training pilot received rave reviews from attendees. In , FNS hosted an additional six regional trainings to school nutrition professionals nationwide. The regional trainings were equally successful, and now the Team Up initiative has been expanding to state agencies in . So far, 26 trainings have been completed in 25 states, with 11 more scheduled for the remainder of this year. To read about the success of completed State Team Up trainings, visit ICN’s website. Harris is one of many school nutrition professionals who inspire us to show spirit for school meals.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research portfolio. \nWhen George Washington Carver laid out key elements of his blueprint for education, he could never have guessed that the cutting-edge work of 21st century agricultural science would find a 7,000-acre rural home—right in the middle of the maze of highways and high-rises, homes and businesses that make up the Washington metropolitan region.\nOne hundred years after the federal government first began buying huge tracts of farmland, meadows and woods outside the District of Columbia, a group of scientists, researchers, students and other volunteers who work at the sprawling Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) are taking a page out of the renowned scientist’s book—literally, a textbook.\nThe whole idea, as laid out in Carver’s “Nature Study and Gardening For Rural Schools,” is making sure school kids get their hands dirty.\nIn that spirit, volunteers from the Beltsville Area Diversity Task Force and its technology, education and outreach group started planning about a year ago for an unassuming project for students that would echo Carver’s “learning by doing” educational philosophy. The idea of establishing an old-fashioned victory garden that would continue outreach efforts to students in local schools seemed to be a perfect match.\nThe Student Discovery Garden, as it has come to be known, has been up and growing since last spring, fueled by the energy of volunteers and students.\nThe garden, all organic with raised beds, includes seven sections, each focusing on one of the research programs at BARC, including breeding native crops to keeping non-native species from pushing their way in.  Another learning experience for an all-organic garden was an infestation of Colorado potato bugs that were laboriously smashed one at a time.  Another addition to the urban students’ knowledge base: They found out that stink bugs really live up to their name!\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n ARS\n BARC\n Beltsville\n Maryland\n Science\n Science Tuesday", "author": "Chris Guy"},

Loveless\nI have lived and worked abroad for most of my adult life, including many years in Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, so it was not too difficult adjusting to life in the Brazilian Amazon. I learned to speak Portuguese in the field; my tutors were the field assistants that I hired locally. The politics of doing research on this species are challenging and complicated. That side of my research has been almost as educational and fascinating as the actual fieldwork. \nI’ve been fortunate to live and work in remote forests where there are no villages or towns nearby, no noise or light pollution, no electricity, and no running water when the streams dry up during the dry season. Under those conditions, it’s possible to experience forest life on a very satisfying level. As a plant ecologist, I can observe the daily and seasonal rhythms of growth and dormancy at the level of the forest community — by that I mean the growth and flowering and fruiting schedules that trees and other plants keep through the year and from year to year. When you are there every day in the middle of it, these rhythms gradually come into focus, and the forest comes alive in a way that feels completely integrated.\nMany people find it surprising to learn that the Brazilian rain forest and the other tropical forests I’ve worked in are not perpetually wet and steaming. Mahogany only grows naturally in tropical forests that have a pronounced dry season for one-third to one-half of the year. When that happens, the streams dry up, the trees drop their leaves, the understory goes brown, the ticks and deerflies come out, and everything gets wilted in the heat until the rains come back.\nThe most important thing people should know about mahogany is the same thing they should know about other living species that we humans consume – if consumption exceeds supply indefinitely, supply will vanish.

This spring will see the return of the large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. (U.S. Forest Service photo/ Bob Rabaglia)\nThe buzz this spring has started, and some people may think it’s fodder for a new sci-fi movie. But this year’s spring brings a drama closer to home than you think - the pending emergence of brood II of the periodical cicada.\nCicadas are large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. As the male cicadas sing their intense mating songs, some brand it as the sound of summer.\n“Annual cicadas, known as dog-day cicadas in the U.S., are found throughout the world,” said Sandy Liebhold, a research entomologist with the U.S Forest Service’s Northern Research Station. “But the periodical cicadas emerge in massive groups known as “broods” once every 13 or 17 years and are completely unique to North America.”\nThere are 15 brood cycles, each designated by roman numerals. In the U.S., brood II is on track to crawl out of the ground very soon after a 17-year hiatus. They’ll emerge into one of the most densely populated urban/suburban forests in the world.\nThe mass emergence of brood II into the state and private forests of the tri-state area of eastern Connecticut, upstate New York, and northern New Jersey will sound a bit different than the familiar dog-day cicadas. Male cicadas use a special membrane to echo a series of clicks through its abdomen to attract females for reproduction. In chorus, the brood may sound like an insect-sized fleet of jets preparing for lift off, but the sound should be enjoyed as a wonderful spectacle of the mating ritual in the animal world.\nOnce mated, females will lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind, known in the scientific world as oviposition injury, can be quite striking and lead to “flagging” -- the dieback of small limbs.\nForest health aerial surveys conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation reported more than 8,700 acres with flagging left behind from the brood XIV emergence on Cape Cod in . The scarring is mostly superficial but can have a mild impact on the growth of individual host trees. However, the mass emergence can benefit the longer, overall health of eastern forests.\nAfter mating and laying eggs, adult cicadas die and fall to the forest floor. The nutrients released from the mass decay of the brood create a jolt of healthy nutrients available to forest organisms. Researchers have shown that this pulse of nutrition leads to an increase of beneficial microbes and nitrogen in soil, increased tree growth and more robust wildflowers.\nFinally, after three to four weeks, the eggs hatch, the larvae wander under the forest floor where they feed on roots and start the process over again.\nSo, why every 13 to 17 years? Scientists have been pondering this ecological phenomenon for centuries.\n“There is no doubt that by simultaneously emerging at those long intervals, periodical cicadas are able to saturate predators thereby maintaining high population levels,” said Liebhold.\nRecent research also hypothesizes that periodical cicadas emerge when predator birds are at a lower density, suggesting that these amazing insects have queued into a larger ecological cycle – wow!\nThis is what we know but there is still a lot of mystery surrounding these time-travelling bugs. So if you find yourself one of the lucky ones to experience their visit, just sit back and enjoy this remarkable wonder of eastern forests.\nMichael Bohne is an entomologist and forest health group leader with the U.S. Forest Service in Durham, N.H.\nAfter mating, female cicadas lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind can lead to the dieback of small limbs called flagging. Such was the case for these bur oak trees in central Iowa in after a brood emergence of the 17-year cicada.

Campbell, Northern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in\n Forestry\n Sep 11, \nG.R.A.C.E Memorial in Glen Rock, New Jersey, is in Veterans Park directly across from the town's commuter train station. The site was chosen by the Glen Rock Assistance Council and Endowment after input of family members in the community directly affected by 9/11. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry)\nLiving memorials serve as a reminder of fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, neighbors and friends—but also of the power of community to reflect, rebuild and renew. Our research suggests that living memorials demonstrate the role of nature in contemporary times not only as a symbol, but as an innate and purposeful response to loss that calls forth a common humanity and compassion for others.\nIn other words, they demonstrate how people use nature to be resilient to loss.\nFor 13 years, the U.S. Forest Service has built upon a unique partnership called the Living Memorials Project centered on one of the most significant events in recent history: Sept. 11, , also referred to as 9/11, the day four carefully coordinated terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. That day, two passenger planes hit the World Trade Center’s twin towers in New York City, another flew into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and a fourth originally targeting Washington crashed in a Shanksville, Pennsylvania, field after passengers tried to stop the hijackers.\nJacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, New York, created a memorial grove on the hospital campus. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry)\nThe living memorials project began in when Congress asked the Forest Service to create a program that draws upon the resonating power of trees to bring people together and help foster healing in communities across the nation in response to 9/11. The project includes a grant program to support community-based greening efforts and a research component that developed a National Registry of living memorials across the country.\nThis year, as communities gather to mark the 14th anniversary of 9/11, some will do so at local town memorial parks and gardens – living memorials that pay respect to those who lost their lives and thank thousands more who ran toward the chaos to help. This summer, a team from the agency’s Northern Research Station set out to revisit some of the sites listed on the Living Memorials Registry. Joined by Heather McMillen, an anthropologist and postdoctoral social scientist with the research station, the teams were curious to learn if the sites were maintained. If so, who takes care of them? Did circumstances and other events change the nature of the memorials or had they, over time, stood still? What story could the trees and the landscape itself tell us?\nFrom Connecticut's state memorial in Sherwood Island State Park on the Long Island Sound visitors have a panoramic view of lower Manhattan where the World Trade Center once stood. Victims’ families requested a memorial where they could experience the healing effects of water. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry)\nThe sites range from forests such as Sterling Forest State Park in Tuxedo, New York. To beaches, like the Hometown Memorial in the Town of Babylon, New York, as well as city parks, community gardens, traffic islands, waterfront piers, street trees and arboretums.\nMany of the living memorial sites we visited 14 years ago still remain and continue to serve an important role for their local constituents. When asked, ‘What are you most proud of here?” nearly all of the site stewards responded, “That we did it.  And it’s still here.” \nMany of the living memorials along the New York/New Jersey/Connecticut coast sustained heavy damage during Hurricane Sandy and were rebuilt and replanted. Some signs at the sites not only recognize a diverse list of supporters but also tell the story of that day from the perspective of local towns and communities, including personal sentiments regarding loved ones lost and for those who survived.\nIn each case, local residents draw upon the landscape to create a place of comfort, reflection and a sense of beauty. As these places age, some areas do struggle with care and maintenance but are not giving up. Many families have planted survivor trees on sites and are eager to find ways to protect them as long as possible.     \nUpdates from the field will be available on the Living Memorials Project website. Memorials created from - are displayed on a National Map that formed the basis of the public multi-media exhibition Land-Markings: 12 Journeys through 9/11 Living Memorials, created in collaboration with Parsons The New School for Design. The exhibit was on display in at the National Park Service’s Federal Hall National Memorial on Wall Street. The exhibit catalog and DVD are available free for public use. Videos can be viewed online.\nThe Hometown Memorial in the Town of Babylon, New York, is situated on the coastal dunes of Long Island. The barrier beaches are considered the town’s greatest natural assets. “It was felt that this area possessed scenic beauty and views yet has sufficient open space to provide a quiet environment for remembrance and reflection.” (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry)\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Connecticut\n Forestry\n FS\n Hurricane Sandy\n Long Island\n memorial\n mourning\n New Jersey\n New York\n New York City\n Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry\n Northern Research Station\n Pennsylvania\n remembrances\n Research\n September 11\n trees\n veterans\n Washington DC", "author": "Erika S.

Photo by USDA Wildlife Services\nCalifornia is the “bread basket” of American agriculture. In , California’s 80,500 farms and ranches produced a record $44.7 billion in produce, dairy, and meats. With more than ate, California produces nearly half of all U.S. grown fruits, nuts and vegetables.\nTo help ensure this basket stays full, the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) partners with APHIS Wildlife Services (WS) to address wildlife damage issues to agriculture. Some of the more recent work involves the development of repellents to protect crops from birds.\nBirds can cause substantial damage by feeding on newly planted or ripening crops.  For example, horned larks damage lettuce, spinach, carrots, beets, turnips, and peas; American crows damage almonds; great-tailed grackles eat a variety of citrus crops; and wild turkeys consume an assortment of crops from corn and wheat to strawberries, peanuts, and ginseng. In a recent study, WS economists estimated bird damage to California’s wine grape, blueberry, and cherry crops alone accounted for $64 million in losses each year.\nFrom -, WS experts at the National Wildlife Research Center and colleagues at the University of Mississippi and Arkion Life Sciences LLC conducted a series of CDFA-funded studies to test the effectiveness of an anthraquinone-based bird repellent to protect almonds, lettuce, melons, and ginseng from bird damage. Some anthraquinones, which occur naturally in plants, have been reported to cause repellency in some animals. In addition, anthraquinone absorbs near-ultraviolet (UV) light (a portion of the light spectrum not visible to humans) that is visible to birds.  This visual cue may facilitate its repellency effect in birds.\nIn studies with captive horned larks, American crows, great-tailed grackles, and wild turkeys, scientists identified the minimum amount of an anthraquinone-based repellent needed to reduce bird consumption of repellent-treated crops by at least 75 percent.  One study also discovered that wild turkeys that ate 100 milligrams of anthraquinone subsequently avoided food treated only with an UV-absorbent cue.  Researchers conclude that UV cues could be used to enhance the effectiveness of repellents and, once birds gain experience, could be used to fool them into avoiding UV-treated crops that do not include repellent applications.  These studies aid in the development and registration of economically-feasible, safe, and effective bird repellents for use on food crops.\nTo learn more about WS research related to bird damage to agriculture, please visit our Web site.\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Tags:\n APHIS\n Arkion Life Sciences LLC\n bird damage\n California\n California Department of Food and Agriculture\n National Wildlife Research Center\n repellents\n University of Mississippi\n Wildlife Services", "author": "Gail Keirn"},

{"theme": "Health and Safety", "content": "Chief, National Agricultural Statistics Service, Survey Administration Branch in\n Equity\n Research and Science\n Jun 23, \nLast month, I had the honor to serve as keynote speaker for The Mule Train’s 54th anniversary. The Mule Train left Marks, Mississippi and traveled to Washington, D.C., on May 13, , as part of Dr. Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.’s Poor People’s Campaign to demand economic justice since Marks resided in the poorest U.S. county at the time. However, Dr. King did not witness the Mule Train because he was assassinated the month before the demonstration.\nI learned the Mule Train created a legacy of community organizing, while meeting with the Quitman county’s mayors, farmers, farmworker organizations, high school scholars and others.\nFor example, even though Marks is an agriculture community, the town did not have a grocery store for a few years. The community mobilized and they now have two grocery stores in Marks.\nI spoke to the community about information as power and subsequently shared USDA’s definition of a farm, which is any place from which $1,000 of more of agricultural products were produced and sold, or normally would have been sold, during the year. Many in the community found the definition helpful and significant. This information is critical for those in attendance (and for readers of this blog) who are small farmers and think they’re too small to share their voices in USDA’s NASS surveys and censuses.\nEvery voice matters as these are used by decision makers from federal to local levels. These directly impact producers, their operations, families, communities, and industries. That’s why it’s so important for farms of all sizes, in all states and counties, urban or rural, to respond to NASS’s Census of Agriculture.

Upon meeting WIC Director Jessika Free-Bass, I visited the Tribe's WIC garden, which they use to grow produce for client nutrition education. For the Omaha Tribe, nutrition education is a community effort.\nFree-Bass says that the Omaha Nation WIC program recognizes the importance of incorporating Indigenous foods and traditional cooking practices into the WIC experience to form a holistic approach to nutrition education. Recently, they have taken extra steps to spotlight foods indigenous to their community, as well as dishes and cooking methods traditionally used by the Umóⁿhoⁿ people.\nThis year, the WIC garden grew tomatoes and WIC clients prepared tomato sauce. The garden also produced carrots, which the program used to teach ways to prepare baby food. The WIC garden is small, so the program partners closely with several community organizations to further its nutrition education efforts. For example, the nearby Umóⁿhoⁿ school garden donates squash and indigenous corn to the program for lessons.\nOmaha WIC also partners with the Nebraska Indian Community College, using their kitchen facilities to provide nutrition education sessions and cooking demonstrations.\nThe WIC program aims to safeguard the health of income eligible women, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutrition risk by providing nutritious foods and information on healthy eating. As we celebrate Native American Heritage Month, I applaud the Omaha Nation for connecting mothers, young children, and the community in celebrating healthy, traditional food. It was a pleasure to see their efforts, and I take great pride in the role the WIC program plays in bringing greater health equity to people in our country.\n Category/Topic:\n Equity\n Nutrition Security\n Tags:\n Food and Nutrition Service\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n Nutrition\n Meaningful Support\n WIC\n gardens\n Nebraska\n You May Also Like\n SNAP-Ed Connects Culture, Land, and Food\n Healthier Foods, Healthier Minds\n National Women’s History Month: Celebrating FNS’ Unsung Heroines", "author": "Cheryl Kennedy"},

Harris and First Gentleman Doug Emhoff.\n\"We are undaunted in our belief that we shall overcome—that we will rise up. This is American aspiration.\" -Kamala D. Harris\nOn the cold January night following her swearing in earlier in the day as the first woman vice president of the United States, Kamala D. Harris and First Gentleman Doug Emhoff stood before the Lincoln Memorial. The stoic face of Lincoln looked eastward, past some of the signposts of our history in the form of war memorials and monuments, all the way to the U.S. Capitol. The monuments before both Lincoln and Harris are symbols of American history; but this January, history was unfolding at Lincoln’s feet.\nIn one day, Vice President Harris broke barriers for Black and South Asian people, for women and for the children of immigrants. As a Black woman, Harris would not have been able to hold office while Lincoln was living. Not until President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act would she have even been able to vote in many parts of our country.\nIn the words of Sam Cooke’s hit song, “It’s been a long time coming, but I know a change gonna come.” Our agency is changing too. We embody our code and commitments (, 4 ) by doing the right things while building trust with each other and the people and communities we serve. When we live by our values, we show each other and the world that we mean it when we say that diversity and interdependence are at the core of who we are. And when others see the diversity of people who wear the same Forest Service uniform, they see a reflection of our respect for diversity in all things.\nOn Jan. 20th, our country witnessed the glass ceiling break. Pioneers such as Shirley Chisholm and Barbara Jordan realized that this day would come. The significance of Vice President Harris assuming the second highest office in the federal government reminds us that progress is happening all around us. If we focus on our values, purpose and relationships, our agency can become a model for others.\nHistorically, February is set aside to celebrate and focus on Black history, starting with slavery. Beyond the Capitol building and across the Atlantic sits West Africa, and prior to colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade, various scholars have noted how the ancestors of many Black Americans were African royalty and nobility from West and Central Africa. Both the African continent and the diaspora have been producing inventors, innovators and world changers throughout history and continue to do so today.\nThis year, history has played out in real time. There is a renewed focus on civil and voting rights at all levels of society, including government. Overcoming systemic injustice is at the forefront of the American conversation, spurred on by Black leaders and allies. While there is still much work to do, Jan. 20th marked a major checkpoint in the belief that “we shall overcome.”\nWe have momentum. Racial equality is one of the top four immediate priorities of the Biden-Harris Administration. As President Biden said in his Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, “Equal opportunity is the bedrock of American democracy, and our diversity is one of our country’s greatest strengths.”\nThis Black History Month, where will we as an organization focus? My aim is that Black history is not only something we recognize and celebrate each February, but also presents a living history that informs our work every day.\nMichael Watts, Director of the Office of Civil Rights at the Forest Service.\n Category/Topic:\n Equity\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n Forest Service\n Forestry\n Black History Month\n You May Also Like\n USDA Thinks Outside the Box at Inaugural Innovation Event\n USDA Provides Winning in Women in 's Climate Sustainability Datathon\n Veteran Finds New Mission Through DOD SkillBridge and USDA’s MVAL Assistance", "author": "Michael Watts"},

In , U.S. agricultural exports to Canada were valued at $15.7 billion. Geographical proximity, similar business practices and eating habits make Canada an attractive export market for new-to-export and new-to-market U.S. companies. Some of Canada’s major agricultural imports from the United States include: fresh vegetables, snack foods, fresh fruits, processed fruits and vegetables, fruit juices, red meats, forest products and fish and seafood.\nSecretary Vilsack traveled to Canada in August to meet with Canadian trade group leaders as well as Gerry Ritz, the minister of agriculture in Canada. As part of these meetings, he discussed agricultural trade issues that both of our countries face and opportunities for collaboration. The Secretary was honored to serve as the primary spokesperson for U.S. agricultural products during this visit and to highlight their benefits and uses to compliment Canadian cuisine.\nCanada is the world’s fourth largest agricultural exporter, and Canada and the United States are each other’s largest export market for agricultural products.  Food production in Canada is highly integrated with the United States across a wide array of products that include livestock, fresh produce, and processed products. Free trade agreements, structural changes in U.S. and Canadian food industries, changes in consumer demand, and advances in technology have facilitated this integration over the past few decades.\nCanadians travel to the United States more than their foreign counterparts providing them with many opportunities to have a taste of the states. On these travels, it’s no surprise that our neighbors to the north find a variety of U.S. food products and regional flavors to whet their appetite. Many U.S. companies could use these opportunities to expand their customer base and may want to consider exporting to Canada.\nTo assist U.S. companies in preparing their products and sales force to enter the market, FAS is offering a complimentary Webinar on Tuesday, November 23rd at 1 p.m.-2:00 p.m.(EST) titled The Basics of Exporting to Canada. This forum will provide U.S. companies with a basic overview of the Canadian food sector industry and initial information to make food products compliant to Canadian government standards.  If you are unavailable for the live session on November 23rd, the webinar will be archived and accessible until November .\nFree registration is available online here.\nIf you have any questions, contact FAS/Canada at AgToronto@fas.usda.gov.\n Category/Topic:\n Trade\n Tags:\n Canada\n FAS\n Tom Vilsack\n Trade\n webinar", "author": "Katie Gorscak"},

To develop a quality housing facility with “built to last” standards, a number of federal, state, local and nonprofit partners worked together to identify financing options that included funding and tax credits provided by the State of Oregon and the federal government. USDA Rural Development provided a $2.4 million low-interest loan through the Farm Labor Housing Program, which offers low-interest financing to develop housing for those working in agriculture and food processing. The program also offers a rental subsidy to ensure housing and utility costs do not exceed 30 percent of a household’s income.\nToday, Martin Paredes and his family live in a new, four-bedroom apartment with plenty of room for the children. In addition, the rent is lower, allowing the family to start saving for the future. “We hope to buy our own home someday,” Paredes said.\nAnother resident, Lisa Garcia Mendez, explains that before the new complex was built, apartments in Boardman were too expensive for farm worker families and, even then, the options were just not good.

Any live insects in the contraband go to the local USDA Plant Inspection Station for identification.\nAloha! I am a Plant Health Safeguarding Specialist based in Hawaii, where my colleagues and I help protect agricultural crops and natural resources on the U.S. mainland from plant pests like exotic fruit flies, Asian citrus psyllid and the coconut rhinoceros beetle. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s multi-faceted predeparture inspection program supports the movement of travelers, baggage, cargo and mail leaving the Hawaiian Islands, while working to stop the movement of invasive pests.\nMany do not realize that the mail is an important way invasive pests can move. To find items prohibited from reaching the mainland by this pathway, trained detector dogs spend nights targeting parcels in search of plant material in transit at Honolulu’s main post office. With their keen sense of smell the detector dogs are over 90% accurate at identifying mailed packages containing prohibited items like fruits, flowers and vegetables. In the morning, the packages that the canines identified are processed for a swift, legal inspection on the basis of the dogs’ expertise. One of the items dogs continually alert on are boxes containing prohibited flower leis.\nEveryone knows the lovely tradition expressing friendship, greetings and love with lei. They are regularly seen at weddings and graduations. To help facilitate the safe movement of the flower lei that nurseries and growers ship daily to the mainland, APHIS has a compliance program specifically for lei made of low risk flowers like orchids and ti leaf. Excluded from this program are lei made from prohibited plant material like berries (a host for invasive fruit flies).\nPlant Health Safeguarding Specialists don’t just work with detector dogs at the post office. We inspect commodities leaving Hawaii in shipments and we conduct hand inspections of passenger baggage. When inspecting baggage at the airport, any live insects found are turned over to the local USDA Plant Inspection Station for official identification.\nWe rotate into different roles every three months so we’re well-rounded and fully engaged in supporting the APHIS mission. Most of us enter our roles with a background in plant science, entomology or biology. Then we receive intensive, specialized training to prepare us to work with farmers, shippers, travelers and our state and Federal partners.\nAnd, because we want to spread the beauty and goodwill of the Hawaiian Islands, I will provide guidance for families mailing lei as mementos to remind distant relatives and friends of home. The proper way to mail an allowable lei is to take it to an APHIS Plant Inspection Station to have the item inspected and sealed in your shipping box at no cost. A USDA label will be affixed to the box and you can take it to a post office to mail knowing it will not be delayed by one of our keen-scented canines.\nAs the Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month draws to a close, one thing we can recognize is that we are all connected through agriculture.

I love that I get to see the plants growing in the field before harvest. I talk with the growers and the NPPO inspectors in person and find out how the season has been, the weather, their challenges – all in real time. If we see a problem, we can help them figure out what to do right now to ensure that their plants will meet APHIS’ standards and can enter the U.S. pest and disease free.\nLast December, the Royal Dutch Wholesalers Association for Flower Bulbs and Nursery Stock honored APHIS’ contributions to the Dutch flower bulb and plant trade at its annual conference. We created the Dutch flower bulb and perennial preclearance program 66 years ago to help post-World War II recovery efforts. It was the first program of its kind, and it serves as a model for dozens of other agriculture preclearance programs around the world. With this program, Dutch exporters avoid costly delays or rejections at U.S. ports and both countries benefit because plant health issues are dealt with promptly and transparently. Today, the United States is one of the top markets for Dutch flower bulbs and perennials with sales reaching approximately $120 million last year.\nTrade and travel are making the world smaller, but also increasing the chance of damaging insects and pathogens entering the U.S. April is Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month so this is the perfect time to share the many ways Americans can protect their gardens and landscapes against invasive Hungry Pests.\nI want to highlight a few simple things everyone can do to keep invasive pests from spreading to new locations. When you travel internationally, declare all agriculture products to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. If you purchase plants online for your garden or home, buy from reputable sources. Avoid using invasive plant species at all costs! Remove them from your garden and don’t share them with other gardeners. Talk to other gardeners about invasives and how you plan to help in the fight against them. If you are worried that your garden will lose its luster after removing invasive plants, talk to your local native plant society or exotic pest plant council. These organizations will be able to suggest suitable replacements. Report any suspected invasive species to your county extension agent or local USDA office. And be sure to check with USDA before mailing or shipping produce, plants, or plant products into the U.S. from another country to find out what’s allowed.

(USDA, Erich Glasgow)\nWhile we are raising awareness about invasive pests during Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month, I wanted to share a bit about what I do every day to protect agriculture. When you picture someone on the front lines of stopping invasive pests, you probably picture someone outside – in a field or a tree. But I fight invasive pests from a completely different location – my computer.\nA big way invasive pests can move from one location to another is through unregulated internet sales. We are seeing more and more of these sales, and it’s a real concern. Why? With normal commercial or retail sales, we can use techniques like quarantines and fumigation to make sure that purchased items are pest-free or don’t enter pest-free areas. But many times, sales on the internet do not follow these techniques, opening up the chance for invasive pests to move freely to new areas. My job is to look for these types of sale offers online and stop them.\nIt may not seem exciting, but I enjoy the challenge. Looking for person-to-person sales of prohibited agricultural items on the internet involves a lot of research and investigative work. I use many tools to help me do my job, including open source, government and subscription databases and software that lets me form a “map” of connections to provide a visual of how prohibited items are moving into the country. When I identify a sale of regulated items, I work with the internet company to identify the buyers and sellers, and work to close the pathway by stopping the sale. This can be by removing or amending the listing to include restrictions on where the product may be sent. In many cases, I coordinate with other SITC employees, who physically visit the locations to perform inspections and search for the prohibited item(s).\nOne area where we see growing promotion and sales of agricultural products is on social media. I am spending more time reviewing social media posts to look for previously unidentified pathways for items to enter the U.S.\nI enjoy my work and I’m proud of the role I play in helping stop illegal internet sales. I never know what my day will look like. Many days, I never leave my computer. Other days, I may give presentations to help others understand the work we do. I’m even the lead author on a white paper on preventing illegal sales through e-commerce. I worked with officials from the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand on that project. In , I received the Employee of the Year award from the Plant Protection and Quarantine leadership for my efforts to protect American agriculture.\nWe are increasing our outreach and education activities to help make sure people understand why buying agricultural items on the internet – especially from foreign countries or individuals instead of companies – can be dangerous. I find many people just aren’t aware that certain products are restricted or banned completely. They just want to purchase something and look for the best deal.\nHelp me raise awareness and protect our agriculture from invasive pests. Be careful when buying agricultural products on the Internet. When in doubt, you can always contact us to find out if an item is allowed, restricted or banned. Together, we can keep harmful invasive species from entering the country through illegal internet sales.\nUnited States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue has proclaimed April as Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month (, 518). The goal of IPPDAM is to: increase public awareness of invasive species; provide tips to prevent their spread; and, encourage residents to report signs of them.\nTrained detector dogs can check mailed parcels and cargo for invasive pests that can lead to costly eradication efforts if they become established.

Like most residents, we prepared our homes and workplaces for Hurricane Irma, which hit the Virgin Islands and northeastern Puerto Rico September 8th. Many of us lost power for several days but we were soon back at work assessing damages and gearing up for recovery.\nHowever, less than two weeks later, the winds from Hurricane Maria arrived and by the early morning of September 20th the full force of the storm hit St. Croix and Puerto Rico.\nAs the storm passed it left in its path near total defoliation of trees and downed power lines. Coupled with flooding, the loss of communication and electricity has had the most apparent effects. It’s difficult to predict when an extreme event will occur but we can predict and prepare for the consequences.\nNow, two months after the storms, trees have begun to leaf out, many roads are clear and disaster assessments are underway, but conditions are still difficult. Power, water, communications and other infrastructure have yet to be fully restored, adding to challenges at work and home. The full extent of the storm’s effects on farms, forests and communities are yet to be determined.\nLocal USDA employees, agencies and leadership have been playing an important role in the recovery, by clearing roads and waterways, assisting with needs for power, assessing and assisting with livestock related health issues in the hard hit poultry and dairy sectors, implementing disaster relief programs, and helping communities that surround our facilities.\nThe complexity of the response within and among islands has highlighted the need to work across USDA’s agencies boundaries to deliver services to hard hit communities. The USDA Climate Hubs are designed to share climate related knowledge among USDA agencies and help each agency expand their capacity.\nAs the recovery continues the challenge is to learn about the effects of extreme events on our farms and forests, transportation, communications and energy systems, and on the supporting industries and markets to ensure the delivery of agricultural goods and ecological services. USDA has a great deal of capacity to learn by monitoring incentive and relief programs and through research programs.\nWe can expect more extremes in heat, drought, fire, flooding, and storms. By investing in learning and working across agencies to apply what we know, we can reduce the risks and costs of extreme climatic events, increase our resistance and resilience, and keep important services flowing from our land and water.\n Category/Topic:\n Climate\n Tags:\n climate hub\n USDA Caribbean Climate Hub\n Puerto Rico\n hurricane", "author": "William Gould"},

This online tool, which measures a community’s food-choice landscape, was to play a key role in the launch of First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let's Move! campaign against childhood obesity.\nThe Food Environment Atlas dovetailed neatly with the obesity initiative: the Atlas allows users to compare the food environment among U.S. counties—the mix of factors that together influence food choices, diet quality, and general fitness among residents. The media took notice, and in that first year the Atlas website received over 100,000 visits – becoming one of the most popular of USDA’s products.\nToday we’re unveiling an update of the Atlas. It now pulls together 168 indicators of the food environment (up from the original 90), measuring factors like availability and type of restaurants and food stores, food prices, socioeconomic characteristics, and health outcomes. We’ve added items that measure change over time, and several indicators that will make the Atlas more useful in gauging residents’ food accessibility in rural communities. The updated Atlas provides on the number and percentage of a county’s households that are low income or that do not own a car, and that also live more than 10 miles from a grocery store. For rural areas, this a more realistic measure of food access than the one-mile measure in the original Atlas.\nThe snowstorm that coincided with last year’s debut of the Food Atlas, with power outages, impassable streets, and the consequent interruption of easy access to food stores and establishment, underscored the importance of the food environment to the options that can make the difference between healthy and unhealthy diets. For some households, limited options are a daily reality, not just a weather-related inconvenience.\nWith the Atlas, researchers, policymakers, media, and other users can create maps and visualize how counties are faring in providing healthful food environments. For any one county, they can obtain on any or all of the 168 indicators. We hope that the Atlas will continue to stimulate research and provide a resource for policymakers as they address the connection between the food environment and the health of communities.\nI invite you to visit and use the Atlas here.\nMap in Food Environmental Atlas web tool displaying results of user’s query on indicators of food access in counties across the United States\nHome page of online mapping tool, the Food Environment Atlas\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n ERS\n Food Atlas\n Food Environment Atlas\n Let's Move", "author": "Elise Golan"},

{"theme": "Health and Safety", "content": "USDA Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics in\n Food and Nutrition\n Jun 04, \n The White House on June 2 convened a national forum to seek action on the problem of anti-microbial resistance. The development of antibiotics was one of the most significant medical achievements of the last century, and has helped to save millions of lives. But their overuse or misuse has resulted in the rise of bacteria strains that are resistant to antibiotics.\nThe White House has unveiled a National Action Plan designed to advance the appropriate use of antibiotics in food animals as well as promote collaborations among partners in medicine, veterinary medicine, and public health. This is consistent with a “One Health” approach that embraces the idea that a disease problem impacting the health of humans, animals, and the environment can only be solved through improved communication, cooperation, and collaboration across disciplines and institutions. USDA, which helped develop the National Action Plan, was pleased to join our many Federal partners and continue our work with the agriculture industry at the forum.\nUSDA continues to research alternatives to antibiotics, including vaccines, to reduce the use of medically important antibiotics and develop new tools to prevent and treat diseases that impact the health, welfare, and production of livestock, poultry and fish.\nFor example, recent findings by USDA Agricultural Research Service scientists suggest that lysozyme, an enzyme used in many foods and beverages can serve as a natural alternative to antibiotics used to improve feed efficiency and growth in pigs.\nAnd through our shared goal, USDA will continue working with the agriculture industry to optimize stewardship of antibiotics in food animals.  \nIn addition, collaborations among partners in medicine, veterinary medicine, and public health are being promoted to support a one health approach to the issue of antimicrobial resistance.  \nThere are a number of entities in the agriculture sector that are trying to address antibiotic stewardship. Specifically,\nFood producers and retailers are taking actions such as voluntarily phasing out the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion, providing responsible use to suppliers from whom they purchase meat, and funding research for alternative management practices that reduce the need for antibiotics.  Some store owners are committing to purchase from suppliers who already have or are phasing out the use of medically important antibiotics or that can provide them with antibiotic-free meat and poultry. \nAnimal pharmaceutical companies are committed to align their medically important antibiotic products with FDA’s guidance, including removing growth promotion uses and changing marketing status to require veterinary oversight of product use.  Further, the companies investing in vaccines, best management practices, on-farm hygiene, and proper nutritional innovations that will benefit animal health while lessening the reliance on traditional antibiotics.\nAnimal feed industry organizations and livestock and poultry farmers are educating producers and ranchers about the FDA labeling changes that will bring all feed uses of medically important antibiotics under the oversight of licensed veterinarians.  These educational campaigns are helping to make farmers aware of antimicrobial stewardship programs and keeping them updated on best practices for antimicrobial use and policy.\nLivestock and poultry farmers are conducting education and outreach campaigns to make farmers aware of antibiotic stewardship programs and keeping them updated on best practices for antibiotic use and policy.\nVeterinary, animal agriculture, and meat associations are developing and updating species-specific judicious use , conducting education campaigns on judicious use, and encouraging collection efforts. The organizations are committed to magnifying education outreach efforts through their vast networks by distributing educational material, holding symposiums to bring those in public health and agriculture together, and conducting regional workshops on new antibiotic use and veterinary oversight policies.\nAnd, general agriculture, food system non-government organizations are conducting education and outreach and developing standards with an accompanying verification program for the judicious use of medically important antibiotics in food producing animals. \nThrough this multidisciplinary approach, USDA’s objective remains to preserve, maintain or reduce health risks to animals, humans, the environment and society.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n antibiotics\n antimicrobial resistance\n ARS\n Catherine Woteki\n Farmers\n FDA\n Livestock\n Poultry\n Producers\n Ranchers\n REE\n White House", "author": "Catherine Woteki"},

(L to R Senator Debbie Stabenow (MI), General Motors Global Public Policy Executive Director Greg Martin, Ducks Unlimited Paul Schmidt, The Climate Trust Executive Director Sean Penrith, and USDA Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) Under Secretary Robert Bonnie). USDA photo by Tom Witham.\nEarlier this week, USDA highlighted the creation of a market for carbon credits generated on working grasslands. Landowners benefit because they receive compensation for the carbon credits generated on their lands. They get a new source of revenue, while thriving grasslands provide nesting habitat for wildlife, are more resilient to extreme weather, and help mitigate the impact of climate change. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, recently purchased almost 40,000 carbon dioxide reduction tons generated on working ranch grasslands in the Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. It was the first purchase of its type. \nRobert Bonnie, USDA's under secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the purchase and USDA's involvement in the project at an event at USDA headquarters. He was joined by Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Greg Martin, executive director for global public policy, General Motors; Sean Penrith, executive director of The Climate Trust and Paul Schmidt, chief conservation officer of Ducks Unlimited. The under secretary thanked Senator Stabenow, Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, for her staunch support for the program, which she said is delivering “real world measurable results.” Bonnie said he hopes this purchase will set a pattern for future carbon credit sales.\nThis is how the credit system works:\nLandowners voluntarily place lands under a perpetual easement but retain rights to work the land, such as raising livestock and growing hay.\nThe carbon storage benefits of this avoided conversion of grasslands are quantified, verified, and formally registered resulting in carbon credits.\nThe carbon credits are made available to entities interested in purchasing carbon offsets.\nChevrolet's purchase was undertaken voluntarily as part of its commitment to reduce eight million tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted. This is comparable to the annual carbon reduction benefit of a mature forest the size of Yellowstone National Park.\nUSDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded $161,000 through a Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) to Ducks Unlimited in to develop the necessary methodology to quantify the carbon stored in the soil by avoiding grassland conversions, resulting in the generation of carbon credits.\nBesides the landowners, USDA, and Ducks Unlimited, other key partners that helped make this project a success include The Climate Trust, American Carbon Registry, The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund and Terra Global Capital. Public-private partnerships to enhance U.S. carbon sinks such as forests, grasslands, wetlands and coastal areas, are a key part of the Obama Administration’s recently released Climate and Natural Resources Priority Agenda.\nStoring Carbon and Preserving Working Ranch Lands\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Climate and Natural Resources Priority Agenda\n Conservation Innovation Grant\n Natural Resources and Environment\n Natural Resources Conservation Service", "author": "Patrick Holmes"},

{"theme": "Health and Safety", "content": "VegU Coordinator, USDA Farmers Market Season in\n Farming\n Mar 06, \nThe VegU featured item is always the key ingredient in the \"VegU-cation\" lesson. This special event creates opportunities for customers to ask questions. With more knowledge, customers are willing to purchase the new fruit or vegetable; ultimately resulting in more sales for market vendors. USDA Photo by Preston Keres.\nEveryday USDA works to develop tools for farmers and ranchers that support their financial success. The USDA Farmers Market on the National Mall is a “living laboratory” for farmers market operations across the country. During our market season, we tested “VegU-cation” and found that this fruit and vegetable education program was popular with our visitors and increased sales for our farmers. Visitors to our market attended a 10-minute demonstration class in the VegU tent, on how to grow, pick, and prepare that week’s featured fruit or vegetable.\nHere are five tips to help you bring “VegU-cation” to your market:\n1. Use Simple and Creative Recipes – Customers are more likely to consider making a recipe, using the featured item, if it has just a few ingredients that are easy to assemble. Keep the preparation demo to five minutes or less. Highlighting new ways to prepare an item that shoppers may have never considered, like roasted avocado instead of guacamole, works great. Add a toppings bar to a simple recipe to make it more interactive. During a demo last year, VegU featured mangos, with a toppings bar of lime hot sauce, salt and pepper, cumin, and cayenne pepper. This extra feature gave participants a chance to try some of the many ways a mango can be enjoyed.\n2. Showcase Variety to Create Interest - Offering variety increases customers’ willingness to try new foods and can make a farmers booth vibrant and inviting. We spotlighted lesser-known varieties of apples and pears, grown by our farmers, during a VegU session. The presentation included “fun facts” along with the variety names, distinguishing characteristics and suggestions on the best varieties for snacking, baking and salads. A similar display for mushrooms listing names, flavor and texture profiles, as well as preparation suggestions, worked really well.\n3. Provide Free Samples - Free food gets attention! We have found that serving samples halfway through the demo keeps folks interested. Once they taste it, they often want to buy the featured item and try the recipe. Talking about nutritional value and asking participants to share their favorite recipes also helps to engage your audience.\n4. Share How Things Grow - We found that displaying and talking about live plants, grown in the USDA greenhouse or brought in from nearby nurseries and farms, encourages customers to taste and purchase unfamiliar vegetables, like okra. VegU helps shoppers improve their knowledge about seasonal availability of fruits and vegetables and learn more how the foods they love are grown.\n5. Don’t Be Afraid of Challenges – For farmers, growing an unfamiliar product can be challenging in an unknown market. However, VegU presentations on new or unusual items can create a great deal of interest amongst shoppers. We have found that shoppers are interested in learning about these out-of-the-ordinary items like how to prepare kohlrabi or fennel. VegU often resulted in vendors selling more of the featured vegetable or fruit – sometimes selling out! Activities like our \"Guess the Mystery Vegetable\" game engage audiences and encourages them to try new things.\nVegU is just one example of a special event to build market support for farmers. We also asked farmers market managers across the country to share what helped make their markets better. Many told us that hosting special events, offering community programs, and other activities added to their success. Checkout our Farmers Market Improvement Toolkit for more ideas.\nIf you are in our Nation’s capital, please join us at the USDA Farmers Market and stop by the VegU tent.

The Science Blueprint guides USDA’s science priorities for the next 5 years, building from past success. Relative to other crops, many specialty crops are more dependent on agricultural labor for production, harvesting, and processing. This is part of a blog series that highlights research investments to advance automation and mechanization for specialty crops.\nU.S. specialty crop producers face a variety of challenges that require a diverse set of solutions. From labor shortages and rising production costs that threatened the health of Florida’s strawberry industry to water supply challenges that stymied North Dakota’s vegetable yields, the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program (SCBGP) has helped producers bring to life innovative ideas in automation.\nUSDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service provides annual SCBGP funding to State Departments of Agriculture for projects that support specialty crop growers, producers and consumers. The projects can range from outreach and education, training, marketing or research to enhance the specialty crop industry. Each State determines priorities that will be most impactful to the issues they are facing.\nThe tool is designed to mimic human hands and fingers as it picks strawberries. Photo Credit: Shinsuke Agehara\nIn the case of addressing labor shortfalls in strawberry harvesting, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services awarded funding to the University of Central Florida to develop a project that is currently engineering a mechanical arm. This gripper will mimic human hands and fingers as it picks strawberries—without damaging the fruit. The technology aims to be universal for different strawberry varieties. The project will also evaluate the economic impact of the gripper creation.\nTo date, the project team finalized their design and manufactured two prototypes. Both prototypes have gone through laboratory and field tests, and one has been integrated with a robotic arm-like platform for harvesting. The team will measure project success by the number of strawberry varieties to which the picking mechanism can be applied and the number of harvesting platforms that decide to adopt the technology.\nIn North Dakota, the State Department of Agriculture distributed SCBGP funds to North Dakota State University to tackle water management issues. The project’s goal is to improve fruit and vegetable yields by creating a drip irrigation system that can be automatically controlled by soil moisture sensors. The project involves conducting experiments to see how different mulch types and amounts impact weed control with the system. They will then educate local growers on the new drip irrigation technology.\nDrip irrigation system projected to conserve water, improve soil temperature, and extend growing seasons for North Dakota fruit and vegetable production. Photo Credit: Xinhua Jia\nTo date, the team has designed, built and implemented the drip irrigation system and conducted comparisons on tomato and watermelon yield and quality. With its projected ability to conserve water, improve soil temperature and extend growing seasons, the team sees this system as the future of North Dakota specialty crops.\nAutomated production methods have been a common thread in multiple SCBGP projects. According to the recent ERS Report, Developing Automation and Mechanization for Specialty Crops: A Review of U.S. Department of Agriculture Programs, $12.5 million in funding on automation and mechanization projects has been distributed in the SCBGP between -. As states and growers identify specific needs in the specialty crop industry, SCBGP welcomes innovative ideas to help the industries evolve and adapt.\nFor more information on the SCBGP and previously awarded projects, please visit the SCBGP program website.

Throughout the month, USDA will be highlighting results of our efforts to improve access to safe, healthy food for all Americans and supporting the health of our next generation. \nWe’ve talked quite a bit in the past about the major benefits we’re seeing in schools and districts that have established a farm to school program.  Their efforts are giving students a deep understanding and appreciation for where their food comes from and drastically shifting kids’ opinions of fruits and veggies.\nThe final results of the USDA Farm to School Census shed light on another huge benefit of farm to school – we’re talking $789 million huge.  That’s the total amount schools report investing in their communities in school year – by purchasing local food from farmers, ranchers, fisherman, food processors, and manufacturers.  This represents a 105 percent increase over school year – , when the first USDA Farm to School Census was conducted.  In addition, nearly half of districts engaged in farm to school report that they plan to purchase more local foods in the coming years.\nThese funds are a major boost to local communities, helping sustain local food systems by providing a consistent, reliable customer base.  With farm to school, “you have a customer, an able buyer willing to pay fair market price and buy in bulk,” explained Chuck McCool of McCool Farms in Arkansas.  As Chuck puts it, “Farm to school is the greatest thing that’s happened to vegetable farmers since… well since I can’t remember when!  I can’t remember what would have been better than farm to school… It’s a win-win for everybody.”\nBut the benefits aren’t just limited to vegetable farmers; farm to school programs present economic opportunities for the whole agricultural industry. Fruits, vegetables and milk top the list of foods schools are most likely to buy locally, but schools indicate that they’d like to also buy more plant-based proteins, grains, meats, poultry and eggs from local suppliers in the future.  And these types of programs aren’t only seen in states known for their agriculture like Iowa or Nebraska.  The Census results show that farm to school programs are present in every state across the country, in schools large and small, rural and urban.\nWe’ve recognized a few of these programs on our Farm to School Census page, highlighting three programs per state that are beating their state’s average spending on local foods.  But we know there are many more schools out there that are doing innovative work through their farm to school programs.  That’s why we’re inviting you to vote for the farm to school program that you think is ‘One in a Melon!’  Now through April 15 you can nominate a school that you believe has an exemplary farm to school program.  So check out the extended results of the Farm to School Census and cast your vote today!  Winners will be announced this May.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Farm to School\n Farm to School Census\n farming\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n National Nutrition Month\n NSLP\n Nutrition", "author": "Janna Raudenbush"},

Many students may be returning to school for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began and others may be distance learning. Don’t let foodborne illness – commonly called food poisoning – keep your child from learning. Take the time to plan and prepare your children’s lunch meals safely.\nWhile children rely on teachers for daily lessons, the task of making safe lunches falls squarely on caregivers. Unlike cafeteria workers who take food safety trainings on a regular basis, most parents preparing lunch for their kids at home, or to take to school, haven’t received any formal food safety instruction. Nutrition counts, too. The lunch you’re making not only satisfies hunger pangs of busy kids, it fuels their cognitive abilities. Studies have shown that proper nutrition improves students’ scores, memory capacities, motor skills, social skills, and language skills. Keep them well fed and safe with the four steps to steps to food safety – Clean, Separate, Cook and Chill.\nClean: The best way to prevent many forms of illness, including foodborne illness, is with proper hand washing. Children should always clean their hands before eating, and parents should do so before and during lunch preparation. It’s easy to get preoccupied by busy schedules and rush through the five steps of washing hands; however, handwashing is vital to remove any germs that may be present. Hand washing should always include the following:\n Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap and apply soap.\n Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Be sure to lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.\n Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice.\n Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.\n Dry your hands using a clean towel.\nSeparate: Prevent cross-contamination by keeping raw meat and poultry away from ready-to-eat foods. When preparing perishable foods that require cutting (for example, raw bacon and raw chicken you plan to cook for salad), make sure you separate these items from fruits, vegetables, cheeses and other foods to avoid cross-contamination.\n Cut up and prepare your raw ingredients ahead of time to avoid cross-contamination as you handle your ready-to-eat items for salads or other sides.\n Different colored cutting boards are a great reminder to prevent cross-contamination (you can use a green cutting board for fresh produce and another color for meat and poultry).\nCook: Have a food thermometer easily accessible to ensure you’re cooking to recommended safe internal temperatures:\n Cook whole cuts of meat, including beef and pork to 145 degrees Fahrenheit and allow them to rest for at least 3 minutes before carving.\n Cook ground meats, like burgers and sausages, to 160 degrees Fahrenheit.\n Cook all chicken and turkey to 165 degrees Fahrenheit.\nChill: When preparing lunch ahead of time, remember perishable foods should not enter the Danger Zone – temperatures between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit – where bacteria multiply quickly and can make food unsafe.\n Make sure all perishable items are refrigerated within two hours of coming out of the oven or refrigerator.\n Discard food that has been left out for more than two hours to prevent foodborne illness.\n If your child needs to carry their lunch themselves, never pack perishable foods in a brown paper bag because they will be unsafe by lunchtime. Use an insulated, soft-sided lunch bag and add a frozen gel pack and a frozen juice box or bottle of water with the lunch.\nThese four steps – Clean, Separate, Cook and Chill – give parents and caregivers steps they can use to protect their children from food poisoning. Now that we’ve covered all the basics, you’re ready for the big test – hungry students!\nConsumers can learn more about key food safety practices at Foodsafety.gov, by following @USDAFoodSafety on Twitter and by liking Facebook.com/FoodSafety.gov.

It builds on the success of USDA’s domestic climate hubs, which serve as the premier model for developing and delivering science-based, region-specific information and technologies to help land managers reduce risk, build resilience and enable climate-informed decision making.\nToday, under the banner of Sustainably Cultivating the Future, the International Climate Hub will join various USDA agencies, the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation and other partners for an Earth Day celebration on the National Mall from 11 a.m.- 3 p.m. Visitors will have the opportunity to view informational exhibits, attend discussions and participate in hands-on workshops and teaching moments in the USDA People’s Garden.\nAt the event, the International Climate Hub will shine a spotlight on the cross-border benefits of applied agroforestry best practices. Globally, agroforestry best practices integrate the cultivation and conservation of trees and shrubs into cropping or livestock systems, helping sequester carbon, combat soil erosion, provide habitat for wildlife and pollinators, improve water quality, and diversify farms and ranches.\n\"Trees have often been taken for granted in the Northeast, but now they stand out as one of the best ways to both adapt to climate impacts and mitigate greenhouse gases,\" says Suzy Hodgson, Sustainable Agriculture Outreach Specialist with the University of Vermont Extension, and the USDA Northeast Climate Hub. \"Trees offer relief from the impacts of climate change we're experiencing in the Northeast while also sequestering and storing carbon above and below ground. Agroforestry practices yield multiple benefits to farmers. We are looking at trees in a new light and intentionally blurring the boundaries between forestry and agriculture for mutual benefit.\"\nThrough a partnership with Colorado State University, the International Climate Hub is helping global farmers visualize the impact of agroforestry on carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions through the COMET Planner Global Tool. A recent update of the tool allows agricultural producers to better explore the potential benefits of agroforestry.\nIf you’re in Washington, D.C., today, pop on over to the National Mall and help us celebrate Earth Day and climate-smart agroforestry!

Honeybees also produce honey, worth about $3.2 million in according to USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS).\nHow are hives constructed?\nThe beehives are wooden box-like sections stacked on top of each other. Each box (or super) holds 8-10 wooden frames which include a thin sheet of wax foundation in each frame. The bees build their combs on these foundations.\nHow is honey extracted?\nHoney is stored in the combs in the upper parts of the hive. When the bees have filled the combs in the upper section with honey and covered them with wax caps, the beekeeper takes them away to extract the honey.\nAre honey bees native to the United States?\nHoney bees are not native to the United States. The scientific name for honey bee is Apis mellifera. Since humans first began keeping honey bees, their principal aim has been the harvest of honey. Beekeepers select the appropriate type of honey bee based on temperament, physical characteristics, disease resistance, and productivity.\nItalian honey bees were selected for the People's Garden Apiary because they are most often used in commercial beekeeping in the United States. These bees have a relatively gentle disposition and are good honey producers. They are not the most resistant to disease, but they excel in most other areas.\nThere have been some queen survivorship issues in both of the People's Garden colonies, which actually mirrors what's going on in the rest of the country.

It’s what every parent, guardian, and educator wants for our nation’s schoolchildren. They understand the power that small changes have to make a big difference in the learning environment. That’s why here at USDA, we recently announced a generational investment in our children’s futures through updated school nutrition standards.\nRight now, schools across our country are serving breakfasts and lunches to nearly 30 million children every day. Healthy school meals that represent the main source of nutrition for more than half of these students and are an essential part of the educational landscape — like teachers, books, or computers – helping to unlock kids’ full potential in and out of the classroom.\nIt is no surprise that poor nutrition and diet-related diseases are correlated with lower academic achievement, worse health outcomes, and more behavioral problems for kids. We recognize the tremendous work that educators and school nutrition professionals do every day to ensure our children are fueled to thrive. Healthy school meals are an essential element of a quality education and are a part of the solution to promote children’s health. We know that this work is not easy, which is why the Biden-Harris Administration has made historic investments to help schools provide healthy and nutritious meals to students.\nSchool breakfast offers the jump start to a great day. It sets the tone for the rest of the day, especially for children. It’s why kids who eat breakfast have increased alertness and improved moods throughout the morning, fostering a better learning experience. What’s more, studies find that students who participate in school meal programs consume more whole grains, milk, fruits, and vegetables during mealtimes and enjoy better overall diet quality.\nThese pivotal updates we are making to school nutrition standards have been shaped by a host of stakeholders, including parents, devoted teachers, school administrators, school nutrition directors, and industry leaders, and are informed by the latest Dietary for Americans.\nThese new standards allow us to take the next step in putting kids’ health at the forefront by:\n Reducing the amounts of added sugars in school meals, especially at breakfast.\n Making it easier to offer healthy proteins at breakfast.\n Scaling back sodium levels over time.\n Continuing to emphasize fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains, to give kids the right balance of nutrients for healthy, tasty meals.\nThat’s not all. We are also providing flexibilities to make it easier for schools to accommodate vegetarian diets and the cultural and religious food preferences of students. This way, every child has access to the nutritious foods they desire and deserve to nourish their bodies and minds.\nWe encourage educators to uplift these school meal enhancements as an opportunity to maximize the impact of what they do best – educate. Because it’s that commitment to inspire that enables all students to thrive.\nFor that important gift, our nation couldn’t be more grateful.\nTo learn more about the updated school nutrition standards, please visit the USDA Food and Nutrition Service website.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Health and Safety\n Nutrition Security\n Tags:\n Food and Nutrition Service\n FNS\n Food and Nutrition\n Nutrition\n Summer Meals\n Child Nutrition\n healthy kids\n school meals\n School Breakfast\n School Lunch\n You May Also Like\n SNAP-Ed Connects Culture, Land, and Food\n National Women’s History Month: Celebrating FNS’ Unsung Heroines\n Celebrating the Second Anniversary of the USDA Food and Nutrition Security Initiative", "author": "Cindy Long"},

{"theme": "Invasive Species", "content": "Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Foreign Agricultural Service in\n Trade\n Apr 10, \nFor many American farms, the apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree. The Robison and Stennes family orchards combined equal more than 200 years of growing apples in Washington.\nThe Robison family has been growing apples in Chelan, Washington since the s. Today, Jake – the fourth generation of the Robison family – lives on the early-19th century plot that was used to grow some of the earliest apples to be harvested in Washington. “It’s fascinating that the land we are farming today has been used for apples since nearly the beginning of apple farming in the state of Washington – a unique piece of history,” said Jake Robison.\nThe Stennes family has been growing apples in Pateros, Washington, for more than 130 years, and it continues to modernize its planting, crop management, and harvesting practices. “We’re using self-propelled worker platforms for more efficient work, using robotic harvesting prototypes. Plus, we just purchased our first electric and fully autonomous tractors,” Mark Stennes told FAS. Furthermore, the Stennes orchards have several hundred acres of certified organic production methods and practice Integrated Pest Management to minimize pesticide usage.\nThe Pacific Northwest microclimate has enabled growers to experiment with this specialty crop. Robison Orchards produce a wide assortment of apple varieties. “We see Granny Smith, Honey Crisp, Cosmic Crisp, and other varieties as excellent options of high-quality apples for foreign markets,” said Dave Robison. “We just got to get them there.”\nBoth family farms view the recent trade win of India reopening its market to U.S. apples as beneficial for apple farmers across Washington. The Washington Apple Commission (WAC) and FAS India worked together to regain market access for American apple growers. After retaliatory tariffs were lifted last summer, $10.8 million of U.S. apples were exported to India. This had an almost immediate impact for American apple growers; the market in India opened at the beginning of apple-picking season up in the Pacific Northwest.\n“Since the tariffs were imposed, other apple origins such as Turkey, Poland, and Iran, took control of the Indian market share, dropping the market share for Washington growers from 53 percent to less than 1 percent in 4 years,” Mark shared with FAS after traveling to India with the WAC in December. “Now that the tariff has been removed, we’ve seen Washington gain back some of the market share that was lost. India is now our fourth largest export market.”\nUSDA is committed to strengthening U.S. exports of apples and other specialty crops. In , specialty crop exports totaled $24.6 billion. FAS is part of the Specialty Crop Competitiveness Initiative (SCCI), which identifies foreign market access and improves domestic production and processing practices.\nGrowing and exporting Washington apples is a prime example of the future-facing American agriculture USDA is working with farmers to achieve. An example of this is FAS’s recently announced Assisting Specialty Crops Exports (ASCE) initiative, which will help expand specialty crop exports. ASCE investments will enable the specialty crops industry to address the many non-tariff barriers it faces when opening or expanding export markets.\n Category/Topic:\n Trade\n Tags:\n Foreign Agricultural Service\n FAS\n Washington\n Specialty Crops\n Apples\n Trade\n Exports\n You May Also Like\n Food Safety: Prepare for the Unexpected\n Celebrating World Trade Week - and U.S. Agriculture’s Trade Successes\n Earth Day : Sustainably Cultivating the Future", "author": "Zane Evans"}]
