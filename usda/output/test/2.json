This project has been more than 20 years in the making and it will improve the health and lives of people living in rural parts of the state. It will also improve the water quality and conservation efforts on the Chesapeake Bay watershed.\nThe town received $2.4 million in funding through USDA Rural Development’s Water and Environmental Program (WEP). Once completed, this project will bring safe and reliable water to more than 40 households. I was joined by town and community leaders – both past and present – as well as the engineers from Clark Patterson Lee and Nardozzi construction teams who will be building out the new waterline.\n“The residents in this area have trouble with water from the lake or their wells are prone to dry out,” Town Supervisor Peter Martini said. “Some of the wells are inadequate for residential use. Once reliable wells are getting less reliable. If everything goes as planned, residents should have water from the new line by this summer.”\nAs Earth Day approaches, projects like this one make me proud to invest in our planet and in rural America. It is an example of how USDA is partnering with rural communities to build critical infrastructure that will create jobs for people across the state and the nation.\nEvery community needs access to modern water and wastewater systems – especially rural residents and businesses throughout New York state.\nUSDA is proud to celebrate Earth Day to show how we are investing in locally driven solutions like this one in rural New York to expand access to safe water and reliable wastewater infrastructure, renewable energy and essential services that create jobs, build critical infrastructure and create sustainable futures for rural America.\nTo learn more about this program, please visit USDA’s Water and Environmental Program page.

In , the USDA Climate Hubs were established in to serve as regional centers of climate change information and outreach to reduce risks. The Climate Hubs enhance USDA capacity to deliver science-based knowledge and practical information to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests.\nEarly career professionals joined the Hubs to hone their science communication and engagement skills while supporting the Climate Hubs’ mission. In , Climate Hub Fellows focused on co-developing science-based information to help land managers make climate-informed decisions. Likewise, Hubs brought on interns and post-doctoral researchers. Climate Hubs were able to enhance engagements among land managers and scientists to co-develop science and technology. To mark the 10-year anniversary of Secretary Vilsack sharing his vision for the Climate Hubs, we share two highlights.\nDr. Julian Reyes was a Climate Hub Fellow with the Southwest Climate Hub. During his fellowship, he developed, AgRisk Viewer, which empowers decision makers to assess their climate risks by commodity type at the county scale using long-term crop insurance from Risk Management Agency. This tool identifies areas of agricultural production risk due to extreme events to help target locations for adaptation actions.\nHaley Case-Scott was a Resource Assistance Program intern with the Northwest Climate Hub. During Haley’s internship, she engaged with Tribal Nations supporting government-to-government consultation for the 25th update to the Northwest Forest Plan. Haley also developed communication materials to share information about USDA programs that could support climate adaptation and mitigation.\nBoth Reyes and Case-Scott have also worked with the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy (OSTP) to provide clear, useful, and useable science and knowledge to inform the Administration’s climate, environment, and nature actions and initiatives.\n“Communities and decision makers need actionable and usable climate information and services. My time with the USDA Climate Hubs has shown the power of co-production ensuring community voices are embedded in our place-based, people-centered work. These perspectives have also helped me in my work at OSTP,” Reyes said.\n“Serving as a Resource Assistant Program intern with the USDA Northwest Climate Hub was a great experience. It allowed me to take a deep dive into how the federal government works, and provided me the tools needed to build my professional career,” Case-Scott said.\nThe Climate Hubs continue to build capacity to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests.\n Category/Topic:\n Climate\n Farming\n Forestry\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Forest Service\n Agricultural Research Service\n USDA Climate Hubs\n Climate Change\n adaptation\n Office of the Chief Economist\n You May Also Like\n USDA Thinks Outside the Box at Inaugural Innovation Event\n USDA Provides Winning in Women in 's Climate Sustainability Datathon\n Veteran Finds New Mission Through DOD SkillBridge and USDA’s MVAL Assistance", "author": "Holly R.

This event, which brought together computer science and science students around a real USDA challenge, is a prime example of the many benefits that hackathons can offer. But what exactly is a hackathon, and why are they so beneficial?\nA hackathon is an intensive event where participants collaborate to create solutions to specific problems. The fast-paced environment of a hackathon encourages creativity, innovation, and teamwork. By bringing together people from different backgrounds and disciplines, hackathons can foster cross-pollination of ideas and lead to the development of solutions that might not have been possible otherwise.\nFrom April 4-6, representatives from USDA joined CSU at the downtown Fort Collins, CO campus, bringing together staff from USDA-OCIO, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS), CSU’s Computer Sciences and Animal Sciences programs, and the Ram Hack student organization to conduct the 24-hour hackathon. USDA Deputy Secretary Xochitl Torres Small provided pre-recorded remarks, and the USDA Chief and AI Officer Christopher Alvares kicked off the event. Our event with CSU was developed around a real-world artificial intelligence use case for AMS. AMS is pursuing ways to expand their meat grading service and want to explore the use of image processing and artificial intelligence.\nOver 60 CSU students across 18 teams were challenged to develop predictive models that could accurately estimate beef grade (e.g. Prime, Choice, Select) and fat thickness using images of beef ribeye's as they would appear to an AMS meat grader. Representatives from USDA provided technical assistance to many of the hackathon’s participants. Six teams were recognized for their accomplishments and will also receive letters of appreciation and an opportunity to meet with AMS on their project.\nPrior to the start of the hackathon, a career fair was held with representatives from OCIO’s Office of the Chief Officer, Cybersecurity and Privacy Operations Center, Client Experience Center, and Digital Infrastructure Services Center. Representatives discussed core professional skills, resume tips, and internship opportunities at USDA. Students also heard about programs such as the US Digital Corps, GSA’s two-year tech fellowship program and a partner of USDA.\nWe hope to strengthen relationships with CSU and other universities to not only help address real USDA problems, but also inspire students and learners through hackathon events to hone their skills and consider a tech career in USDA and public service.\n Category/Topic:\n Technology\n Tags:\n OCIO\n hackathon\n Colorado\n Colorado State University\n artificial intelligence\n You May Also Like\n USDA Leveraging Modern Technology and Digital Tools to Improve Customer Service", "author": "Christopher Alvares"},

USDA offices and agencies have developed key actions to comprehensively incorporate equity into the Department’s services, which touch every American’s life.\nUSDA Rural Development’s Equity Action Plan was one of the last projects I worked on as Under Secretary of that mission area. So I know firsthand how hard USDA staff have worked to make change. Now in my new role as Deputy Secretary, I am thrilled to share the release of 14 Equity Action Plans that encompass the work across all of USDA. These plans follow the lead of President Biden’s Executive Order 1, which insists that federal agencies use all the policy levers we have to make progress.\nFounded on the insight that our country is stronger when everyone participates, and more vulnerable when people are left out, the plans released today are part of our relentless focus to shape USDA to truly be what President Lincoln called us, the People’s Department. While the plans are ambitious, I know they are achievable.\nThe plans share both accomplishments and actions underway. A few examples of the accomplishments include:\n Simplified direct farm loan application processes. The Farm Service Agency drastically reduced the burden and time necessary for farmers and ranchers applying for loans. FSA has also rolled out a loan assistance tool that helps farmers and ranchers better navigate the farm loan application process.\n Regional Food Business Centers. A dozen Food Business Centers will support a more resilient, diverse, and competitive food system. These Centers—led by partners who include the Mississippi Delta Council for Farmworker Opportunities, the Georgia Minority Outreach Network, and the Intertribal Agriculture Council—will support producers by providing localized assistance to access local and regional supply chains, including linking producers to wholesalers and distributors.\n Rural Partners Network – The Rural Partners Network (RPN) is an alliance of federal agencies and commissions, led by USDA Rural Development, working directly with rural communities to expand rural prosperity through job creation, infrastructure development, and community improvement.\n Embracing Tribal Sovereignty. The Forest Service has embraced Tribal self-determination principles, releasing the USDA Forest Service Action Plan: Strengthening Tribal Consultations and Nation-to-Nation Relationships, and furthering co-stewardship agreements.\n Microfarms at RMA — The Risk Management Agency (RMA) issued a Micro Farm policy to provide additional insurance options for small-scale producers. The policy development process included obtaining feedback from small-scale producers that have grown products for their local communities.\nBut of course there’s still plenty of room for improvement. Some of our plans include:\n Increasing access to nutrition programs. FNS will support State and local partnerships to increase the reach of nutrition programs in underserved communities and will continue to expand online shopping. And it will move forward on nationwide implementation of the new Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer program, which will provide grocery-buying benefits to low-income families with school-aged children when schools are closed for the summer.\n Expanding Urban and Community Forestry Benefits. The Forest Service will increase access to urban forestry benefits.\n Improving Civil Rights processes. USDA's civil rights office will continue to improve civil rights complaint processes; it will eliminate complaint backlogs, meet ambitious timeliness goals going forward, and implement a fast-track emergency intervention program complaint process to allow timely solutions in cases that involve urgent needs.\n Enhancing capacity of minority-serving institutions. Research, Education, and Economics will increase stakeholder engagement to identify research needs, enhance research collaboration, offer new grant programs, and invest in facilities and workforce development to help build capacity.\nThe equity action plans are posted at www.usda.gov/equity/action-plan; for even more information, visit www.usda.gov/equity.\n Category/Topic:\n Equity\n Tags:\n USDA\n equity\n Rural Development\n You May Also Like\n USDA Thinks Outside the Box at Inaugural Innovation Event\n Digital Transformation Takes Root at USDA\n Elizabeth Lower-Basch: Closing the Gap to Nutrition for Families", "author": "Deputy Secretary"},

(iStock photo)\nForested areas that border wetlands help protect wildlife, but until recently their efficacy has been untested for most amphibian species.  Now, recently published results of a six-year study explore how the loss or reduction of amphibians could affect the ecosystem.\nAt the University of New Hampshire, Dr. Kimberly Babbitt and a team of graduate students conducted landscape-scale experiments that tested the impacts of forest buffer width vernal pools on population size and structure, body size and condition and population genetics of two amphibian species in the northeastern United States. A grant from USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supported the project.\nThe investigation examined the response of spotted salamanders and wood frogs in three environments: wetlands surrounded by either intact forest, a 30-meter forest buffer surrounded by a 100-meter clearcut, and a 100-meter forest buffer surrounded by a 100-meter clearcut. The study indicates that areas with smaller buffers had negative impact on size and condition of salamanders and frogs. Analysis of genetic relatedness indicated that, despite logging, populations across the broader landscape are well-connected.\nBabbitt and doctoral student Danial Hocking also examined the role of amphibians in forest floor ecosystem function and conducted a review of amphibian contribution to ecosystem services.\n“We found that amphibians contribute in a variety of ways to human societies,” Babbitt said.  “We are examining the roles in different forest types to understand under what context salamanders can influence ecosystem functions, such as decomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant growth.”\nSome of the beneficial effects of amphibians on the ecosystem are known, such as the ability of tadpoles reduce eutrophication (greening) by consuming excess algae.  In many ecosystems means that amphibians have important roles both as food sources and as predators – amphibians feed heavily on mosquitoes, making them an important line of defense against mosquito-borne diseases, including the West Nile virus.  Babbitt noted many that amphibians have a lot more to offer – if we can ensure their survival.\n“Although yet to result in approved pharmaceuticals, amphibian skin secretions have shown the ability to inhibit HIV transmission and provide stronger analgesic effects than opioids,” she said. “Learning from these chemical secretions could lead to breakthroughs in human medicine. However, amphibians are declining across the globe and species are going extinct. It’s important to protect species before potential advances are lost.”\nNIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.  Greater understanding of how forest buffers can protect the amphibians that serve the ecosystem is important knowledge that will help states, communities, and landowners make more informed decisions about land use and management, Babbitt said.\nFor an interactive look at USDA's work in conservation and forestry over the course of this Administration, visit \n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n ecosystems\n NIFA\n Research\n University of New Hampshire", "author": "Scott Elliott"},

The original plan for two stories was expanded to four thanks to an innovative partnership with the Windsor Housing Trust to develop mixed-income apartments.\n“Smart Growth” is a term we hear more and more often.  It is the idea that as communities plan for the future, they consider the highest and best use of every resource – land, infrastructure, organizations and people.    From housing to transportation to energy to food; community developers and planners are asking how Smart Growth principles can be applied to ensure a sustainable and dynamic future for their communities and their residents.\nHow is USDA involved in these efforts?\nConsider Brattleboro, Vermont.  With a population of 12,000, Brattleboro sits on the state’s southeastern border, and is a vibrant mix of industry, art and education.    Brattleboro’s downtown district was one of the first communities to take advantage of Vermont’s Downtown Program giving it access to state tax credits and shining a spotlight on its rich history. Its vibrant downtown is an inviting mix of shops, restaurants, offices and an art deco theatre and hotel.    Anchoring one end of the downtown is the Brattleboro Food Coop.\nFounded in , the Brattleboro Food Coop started as a local buying club.  It eventually grew into a popular retail destination featuring a wide range of products from nearby farms in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.  By , the Brattleboro Coop was outgrowing its space.  It considered moving to a new location outside of downtown.  The Board of the Coop, however, decided that its mission was much more compatible with a Smart Growth solution to its expansion needs.    In the meantime, the Windham and Windsor Housing Trust (WWHT) and Housing Vermont, were looking for a solution to Brattleboro’s need for more mixed income housing that was easily accessible to downtown’s services and amenities. With support from a loan guarantee from USDA’s Business & Industry Loan Guarantee Program, the Brattleboro Coop remained downtown in a new, highly energy efficient building with expanded retail space.  The new Coop space was originally envisioned as a two story building.   Through innovative partnerships, an additional two stories on the new building were sold to WWHT and Housing Vermont.   Though the Coop and the housing complex have separate ownership, they have similar commitment to the sustainable future of Brattleboro.\nThe Brattleboro Coop is featured in the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass for its dedication to local food and local communities. It recently received a National Award for Smart Growth Achievement as awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its commitment to Smart Growth principles. \nThe results are stunning.  The new Brattleboro Coop Building opened in June, . It now boasts over 14,000 square feet of retail space, supporting up to 100 jobs.  Over 60 percent of the products come from nearby farms.  The building also hosts a commissary kitchen and classrooms for cooking classes.   24 beautiful, energy efficient, mixed income apartments in the heart of downtown Brattleboro occupy two stories above the Coop.\nRecently, the Brattleboro Coop won a National Award for Smart Growth Achievement as awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These awards, which began in , recognize exceptional approaches to development that respect the environment, foster economic vitality, enhance quality of life, and provide new opportunities for disadvantaged communities. “The new Cooperative Building incorporates money-saving and innovative environmental features while fitting with the character of a traditional walkable New England town” noted the EPA. “Community members were the true champions of this project, insisting on a downtown location for their co-op that integrates both the grocery store and mixed-income housing”.\nThe Brattleboro Coop is profiled in the Know Your Farmer Know Your Food Compass as an example of how local food systems can anchor community development and planning.  You can find other examples of how the Federal Government is supporting local food’s role in communities across the country on the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass Map.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Rural\n Tags:\n Brattleboro\n Brattleboro Food Coop\n Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan\n KYF2\n Rural Development\n Vermont", "author": "Molly Lambert"},

I recently traveled to the west side of the state to see some of the inspiring work our partners are doing to make sure that no one in their community has to face hunger.\nI first visited Fulton Street Farmers Market in Grand Rapids, where State and community partners are implementing new initiatives to improve the health of low-income Americans, such as fruit and vegetable incentive programs and nutrition education. A Michigan Department of Community Health employee even demonstrated a new pilot program that uses iPods and iPhones to accept SNAP and WIC benefits—very impressive! This means low-income individuals can more easily access fresh fruits and vegetables at farmers markets, and local farmers can increase their consumer base. I also got a chance to share exciting news about USDA’s new wireless technology grants for farmers markets that currently do not accept EBT. These grants increase access to fresh, healthy food while supporting family farmers and the local economy.\nAfterwards I headed to Kalamazoo, where community partner Loaves & Fishes hosted an energizing roundtable. Faith-based and community organizations from around the state joined me in a thoughtful discussion of the successes and challenges in operating the 15 USDA Food and Nutrition Service programs. I always learn something new by listening to those who work directly with the people who use our programs.\nThe Grand Rapids school district feeds so many children that it needs semi-trucks to transport all of its meals! This year, I was happy to see they designed the outside of the trucks to show just how important school and summer meals are to so many children. \nLater that afternoon, the Grand Rapids Press held an editorial board/community forum. This unique set-up gave me an opportunity to live Web chat with MLive readers about USDA nutrition assistance programs. We talked about everything from Summer EBT programs that allow families to feed children during the summer to the healthy changes USDA is making to school meals.\nThe next day the Feeding America West Michigan Food Bank gave me a tour of their facilities. This food bank pioneered the concept of mobile food pantries. By modifying a beverage truck, the food bank was able to take fresh produce out into the community. Ken Estelle told me the food bank receives about 15% of its food from USDA Foods.\nFinally, I was fortunate enough to attend a kickoff of West Michigan’s Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). During the school year, more than 21 million children receive free and reduced-price lunch through the National School Lunch Program. And yet, when school lets out, only 3 million children receive a meal through a summer program. USDA’s SFSP is designed to address that gap, and WOOD-TV personality “Maranda” makes sure that happens every summer in western Michigan. Thousands of children came out to enjoy lunch and lots of physical activities. I’m a big supporter of the First Lady’s Let’s Move! initiative and it was great to see so many children playing outside and being active.

Photo credit: Lisa Jennings\nIt was my first prescribed burn. After weeks of training and months of anticipation, I was finally on the ground – drip torch in hand – ready to apply fire to restore the mixed pine-hardwood forests at the edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains on the Pisgah National Forest.\nJoining the U.S Forest Service only two months earlier, my knowledge of fire’s effect on plant and wildlife communities was limited. But as the coordinator for the Grandfather Restoration Project, part of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration program, I had to quickly come up to speed with the on-the-ground reality of prescribed fire use.\nAs I lit my drip torch that early March morning, igniting the thick leaf litter and dense shrubs that had accumulated during years of fire suppression, I couldn’t help but wonder – What happens to the wildlife after the fire?\nUtilizing fire is unnerving to those not familiar with fire as a restoration tool. The reality is much different; just as certain plants need fire to succeed, the animals that depend on those species benefit from fire as well.\nWith the evolving use of prescribed fire as a restoration tool, it is critical to study the effects of fire on the communities we seek to restore. Traditional fire studies often focus on vegetation. The participants in the Grandfather Restoration Project decided to take it one step further and directly study wildlife use in sites treated with prescribed fire compared with untreated sites.\nWorking collaboratively, wildlife specialists from Pisgah National Forest, the North Carolina Wildlife Resource Commission, and The Nature Conservancy designed a cutting-edge study using wildlife cameras.\nRe-entering the prescribed burn unit just four months after the fire, wildlife cameras in tow, I could see the changes in vegetation. Arising from the blackened ground a lush herbaceous layer had appeared, carpeting the forest with blueberries and grasses. Using 50 camera points over a six-week period in July and August, we studied the wildlife species that use our forests, and what habitats they prefer.\nAlmost immediately, our cameras captured images of white-tailed deer, black bear, turkey and other wildlife attracted to the abundant grasses and forbs. Not only was I encouraged from the positive wildlife response to our burn, but our indicated a higher usage of the burned unit by wildlife when compared to the unburned unit; valuable information for land managers in determining population estimates and predator-prey ratios.\nI often think back to that first prescribed burn. I now understand what wildlife have known all along; that not only are wildlife capable of surviving fire, they reap the rewards of new growth, cover, and food stemming from fire and prescribed burning. For me, seeing these benefits firsthand is one of the most rewarding parts of my job with the U.S. Forest Service.\nWild turkeys often nest in recently burned areas, taking full advantage of newly established sources of food and cover.

It wasn’t until August when the United States began exporting high-quality beef (marbled with a high fat content) to the EU under a negotiated tariff rate quota for non-hormone treated beef.\nToday, about 25 percent of U.S. beef exports to the EU are high-quality cuts such as tenderloin, strip loin and rib eye mostly used by upscale restaurants. The remaining beef exports include medium and lower quality cuts such as flank steak, chuck eye roll, briskets and shoulder clods. Finer restaurants in the EU traditionally do not integrate these cuts into their menus\nTo help introduce these secondary cuts and expand U.S. beef exports to the EU, the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) office in The Hague, Netherlands, partnered with the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) and a Belgium-based meat importer and distributor to host the first U.S. beef tasting event in Belgium Sept. 24.

Local Dutch Chef Eric Troost presented various cooking demonstrations including slowly cooked top sirloin with barbecue sauce, tartar of shoulder clod with artichoke and shallots and top blade with beets, coriander and sesame vinaigrette.\nThe chefs were excited to learn cooking techniques for the secondary beef cuts, which are nearly 40 percent cheaper than primary beef cuts, said Mary Ellen Smith, agricultural attaché at the FAS office in The Hague.\n“Typically, secondary cuts from European beef cannot be used for finer dishes, so the Belgian chefs were intrigued by the various cooking methods that take advantage of the unique marbling in U.S. beef,” she said. “Events like these help introduce new U.S. products not only to the chefs that prepare them but to the thousands of European consumers that they serve.”\nThe U.S. beef tasting event is just one example of how FAS’s market development programs have a long history of helping farmers, ranchers, and businesses of all sizes build and maintain commercial markets for U.S. food and agricultural products around the world.

Landowners benefit because they receive compensation for the carbon credits generated on their lands. They get a new source of revenue, while thriving grasslands provide nesting habitat for wildlife, are more resilient to extreme weather, and help mitigate the impact of climate change. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, recently purchased almost 40,000 carbon dioxide reduction tons generated on working ranch grasslands in the Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. It was the first purchase of its type. \nRobert Bonnie, USDA's under secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the purchase and USDA's involvement in the project at an event at USDA headquarters. He was joined by Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Greg Martin, executive director for global public policy, General Motors; Sean Penrith, executive director of The Climate Trust and Paul Schmidt, chief conservation officer of Ducks Unlimited. The under secretary thanked Senator Stabenow, Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, for her staunch support for the program, which she said is delivering “real world measurable results.” Bonnie said he hopes this purchase will set a pattern for future carbon credit sales.\nThis is how the credit system works:\nLandowners voluntarily place lands under a perpetual easement but retain rights to work the land, such as raising livestock and growing hay.\nThe carbon storage benefits of this avoided conversion of grasslands are quantified, verified, and formally registered resulting in carbon credits.\nThe carbon credits are made available to entities interested in purchasing carbon offsets.\nChevrolet's purchase was undertaken voluntarily as part of its commitment to reduce eight million tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted. This is comparable to the annual carbon reduction benefit of a mature forest the size of Yellowstone National Park.\nUSDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded $161,000 through a Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) to Ducks Unlimited in to develop the necessary methodology to quantify the carbon stored in the soil by avoiding grassland conversions, resulting in the generation of carbon credits.\nBesides the landowners, USDA, and Ducks Unlimited, other key partners that helped make this project a success include The Climate Trust, American Carbon Registry, The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund and Terra Global Capital.

Millsap received $20,000 from a $50,000 Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) awarded to the Watershed Committee of the Ozarks to build the Chinese high tunnel, pay for energy renovations in other greenhouses and to establish a grazing system.\nThis grant program helps groups demonstrate innovative approaches to improve soil quality, air quality, and water quality, conserve energy, and enhance wildlife habitat in balance with productive agricultural systems.\nThe committee wanted to demonstrate the benefits of the Chinese high tunnel, which differs from other seasonal high tunnels in that one of the long sides of the 23-by-70-foot structure and both short ends are heavily insulated with concrete and soil.\n“One of the things the CIG did was improve our efficiency in the high tunnel,” Millsap said. “It is warmer in the morning and warmer in the evening (in the Chinese high tunnel) than in the other greenhouses. But what’s interesting is that midday, it is cooler in there than in the other greenhouses. This thing never spikes. It has a smooth curve, which is better for plants.”\nMillsap said the different design is popular in China, where energy is expensive and labor is cheap.\n“I was looking into the future and thinking that energy is not going to get cheaper, so it made sense,” Millsap said. “And this is a teaching farm, so I have the workers.”\nMillsap’s workers include seven apprentices who are compensated with room, board, a farming education and a stipend.\n“These are people who seriously want to experience this and see if they want to be farmers,” Millsap said. “We’ve been doing this for seven years. I’ve had 20 apprentices, and seven are still actively involved in agriculture.”\nThe farm also serves as a site for farm tours and other community events, all intended to further the buy-local movement. High tunnels are a cornerstone of USDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative, which coordinates USDA’s work on local and regional food systems.  Since , through NRCS, USDA has provided assistance to help producers construct over 13,000 high tunnels on farms around the country.\n“We have this great promotion in ‘buy local,’ but that will go away if we can’t meet demand,” Millsap said. “We try to get as many people out to the farm as we can, show them what farming is about, maybe get their hands dirty.”\nNot raised on a farm, Millsap said he learned to farm by attending conferences, by reading and by visiting with lots of other farmers. He said it was something he found himself called to do.\n“It’s not something I was looking to do, but sometimes when you are called, you better listen,” he said.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n China\n Conservation\n Conservation Innovation Grant\n EQIP\n Farmers\n Farmers Markets\n high tunnels\n KYF2\n Missouri\n NRCS", "author": "Charlie Rahm"},

Water Quality Trading is one way the States of Washington, Oregon and Idaho are working to protect their rivers. Photo courtesy of the Idaho DEQ Twin Falls Regional Office, used with permission.\nThe Pacific Northwest is known for its picturesque lakes, cascading streams and dramatic coastlines. The many rivers of the Pacific Northwest—the Yakima, the Snake, Snohomish, Willamette, Klamath, Boise, and others—are part of the cultural, economic and environmental foundation of the region. These waters are meaningful for local Native American Tribes, agricultural production, industries who rely on water resources, and local communities and tourists from around the world that enjoy fishing and other forms of recreation along Northwestern rivers and streams.\nIt’s no surprise that the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho are interested in protecting their rivers to preserve these values, and the wildlife and ecosystems they’re a part of. More surprising, however, is the innovative way the states are collaborating to do it.\nWater quality trading allows point sources that directly discharge to water, like wastewater treatment plants, to invest in “green” infrastructure by restoring the watershed’s natural capacity to filter water. For example, instead of installing expensive technology to reduce phosphorous discharges, the treatment plant could pay farmers upstream to plant trees along their fields to reduce the same amount (or more) of phosphorous from reaching the rivers. Water quality trading may create cost savings for regulated sources, supports conservation on working agricultural lands, and generate environmental solutions that have benefits beyond just water quality—including carbon sequestration and wildlife habitat.\nIn , the Willamette Partnership was awarded a $1.5 million Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to help facilitate a conversation with Washington, Oregon, and Idaho to develop multi-state recommendations on water quality trading. The CIG allowed the Willamette Partnership and The Freshwater Trust to convene Washington, Oregon and Idaho state department of environment staff and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 10 to identify common principles and practices to shape consistent approaches to trading in the region, with a focus on how trading could help regulated sources of pollutant discharges meet their discharge limits while providing additional environmental benefits.\nThe effort resulted in a set of joint recommendations for each state to consider as they develop and further their water quality trading programs, with a goal of keeping those programs consistent with the Clean Water Act and state and local water quality laws. The recommendations address the importance of sound science, avoiding local water quality problems, providing evidence that resulting environmental benefits are real, and ensuring that these benefits are echoed in local communities.\nToday, the three states have committed to testing these principles and an associated set of recommendations through . Following this piloting phase, the states and EPA will discuss their experiences, and if necessary, refine their joint recommendations. The states, in consultation with partners, will decide how or whether to incorporate the joint recommendations into formal policy or guidance on trading.\nBobby Cochran, Executive Director for Willamette Partnership noted, “This is a really exciting time for the Northwest. Washington, Oregon, and Idaho thought deeply about how the joint recommendations can help provide some clarity on trading, promote good stewardship, and support clean water for communities and fish.”\nThe joint recommendations put forth by Washington, Oregon and Idaho can serve as an example for the rest of the country on how to establish well thought out trading programs that are built for success. Through CIG projects and other joint efforts, including the EPA – USDA Partnership Agreement to support water quality trading, we can do a better job of protecting water resources we rely on—while benefitting local communities, producers, and the environment.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Conservation\n Conservation Innovation Grant\n Environmental Protection Agency\n Idaho\n NRCS\n Oregon\n Partnerships\n Washington State\n water quality", "author": "Astor Boozer"},

Because, the Governors were celebrating the obligation of a USDA Rural Development funded study that creates the first ever Native American Food Hub in the nation.\nFor hundreds of years the residents of the Pueblos in New Mexico have farmed the land to provide the food they ate.  Today, the Native farmers continue to grow corn, squash, beans and other produce for their own consumption.  But often they have abundance of food at the end of every growing season. This successful farming can be a problem because the farmers do not have a mechanism to deliver excess produce to market or those in need.  Food hubs offer a model to provide infrastructure support to farmers usually through a central location where food can be processed and distributed.\nThe Ten Southern Pueblos Council contracted with the Acoma Business Enterprises to serve as the fiscal manager and apply for a Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG) through USDA. The RBEG financial support is funding a study to determine how best to manage the distribution of food produced by native growers through a food hub concept.  Work has begun to identify farmers and their needs to market and deliver the food to a central distribution point.  Once the is collected a plan will be implemented in to make sure the food is provided to the residents of the ten Pueblos and to others needing fresh, healthy produce for their diet.  As well, the Pueblos hope that a successful food hub offers more sustainability to native farmers who wish to make a living through farming.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Rural\n Tags:\n Farmers\n Food Hub\n KYF2\n Native American\n New Mexico\n Pueblo\n RBEG\n RD", "author": "Ernie Watson"},

(U.S. Forest Service/Fred Clark)\nOur curiosity was palpable in our expressions, we visitors to this South Dakota field, as we pondered the patterns produced by the tops of rocks pressed into grass and soil, patterns tantalizingly organized and purposeful: shapes of things that have been. What stories were held in this small corner of the Black Hills National Forest?\nAs members of the Forest Service’s sacred sites executive and core teams, our task is to develop ways to fulfill the recommendations from the Report to the Secretary of Agriculture: USDA Policy and Procedures Review and Recommendations: Indian Sacred Sites.\nVisiting this sacred place was the starting point of our learning and working together as a team. We needed to experience firsthand the feeling and meaning of this place to help us incorporate an appropriate attitude as we started three days of meetings on how to best implement the recommendations, to better protect and provide access to Indian sacred sites.\nWe were guided and educated, at least as much as can be done in just one morning’s time, by Arvol Looking Horse and Tim Mentz Sr. Many years ago, when he was only 12, Looking Horse had been given the enormous responsibility of being the 19th generation Keeper of the Sacred White Buffalo Calf Pipe. He is a spiritual leader for the Lakota Dakota Na-kota Oyate, the great Sioux Nation. Mentz is a cultural resource expert with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. He was their first Tribal historic preservation officer and continues to be an amazing source of information about cultural sites for his Tribe.\nWe learned from tribal elders and Forest Service staff that these stone formations had been misinterpreted several years ago by an archaeologist as teepee rings, or circles of rocks left after having served their purpose of holding down the edges of teepees. The archaeologist had deemed these features as “insignificant” in terms of historical value.\nThe tribal elders explained that these were no teepee rings.  Rather, the stone features were ceremonial shapes, purposefully placed and each with its own sacred reason. Having worked as an archaeologist for some 20 years myself, including having mapped and excavated teepee rings in Montana and Wyoming, I was also aware that these forms were far from the evenly rounded rings I’d seen many times before. They were shapes, but shapes of what?\nThe elders explained how the features are organized, how they relate to the surrounding landscape, the directions, other sites both near and far, and a bit about what each feature’s functions would have been. They pointed out the meaning behind the features and talked about how these places have current and ongoing power.\nMentz and his crew mapped the entire site during our visit, and related the physical shapes and functions to hundreds of other sites they had recorded. They talked about how many of these types of sites had already been destroyed by development, and how many are endangered. They showed us the life and significance in the rocks, reinforcing the great need to further protect places like this.\nWhile many of the sites being destroyed are on private land, the message was urgent and relates directly to our task of doing a better job within the agency to protect the places held sacred by American Indians and Alaska Natives on national forests and grasslands.\nMeeting and working with elders like Looking Horse and Mentz and having them share this kind of information, we are better prepared to bring to this work a good mind and a good heart, and better able to affect the shape of things to come.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Alaskan Natives\n American Indian\n Black Hills National Forest\n Education\n elders\n Forestry\n FS\n Montana\n Native American\n protection\n Sacred Sites\n South Dakota\n Standing Rock Sioux\n Tribal\n Tribal Regions\n Wyoming", "author": "Fred Clark"},

Some of these piers provide access to premier trout fishing destinations.\n“For more than 20 years, the National Forests in North Carolina and North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission have been committed to providing anglers of all abilities with the opportunity to go fishing on public lands,” said Sheryl Bryan, the forests’ fisheries and wildlife biologist.\nSome of these piers provide access to premier trout fishing destinations.\n“During this time, forest and district biologists, engineers, landscape architects and recreation proponents have worked together to create a comprehensive network of accessible fishing opportunities across a diversity or resources,” added Delce Dyer, the forests’ developed recreation program manager.\nToday, there are close to 20 barrier-free fishing piers in the four national forests. Through careful planning, design and construction -- in partnership with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission -- accessible fishing facilities have been constructed from the mountains to the sea. The facilities provide fishing opportunities in warm-water reservoirs and small ponds, as well as cold-water streams and rivers.\n“Designs of fishing piers that extend over waterways have been refined over the years and have been adopted for use by the Wildlife Resources Commission throughout the state,” said Lynn Hicks, engineer and heritage and recreation staff officer. ”Site-specific designs have provided accessible parking and routes to these water-based sites, and most of the fishing piers include areas for both seated and standing fishing.”\nRecent piers include a metal mesh water-viewing component into a portion of the pier’s flooring.\nAccessible facilities on majestic Cherokee Lake in Nantahala National Forest include picnic tables and a pavilion, all connected along an accessible route.

USDA photo by David Kosling.\nUSDA has a long history of helping farmers, ranchers and forest landowners maintain their bottom line while improving soil health and reducing runoff into streams and rivers.  For nearly 80 years, USDA has offered funding and technical assistance for farmers to implement conservation practices through the conservation title of the Farm Bill. In recent years, however, USDA has also supported new, innovative approaches to voluntary, private lands conservation.\nAn announcement today by USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, and Administrator Gina McCarthy of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in northern Virginia highlights an innovative approach called water quality trading. Farmers like John Harrison of Appomattox County are taking advantage of private investments to implement conservation practices on their land. These practices help reduce erosion and nutrient runoff into local bodies of water, generating nutrient credits that can then be sold to regulated entities looking to offset nutrient losses for compliance purposes.\nIn this case, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) purchased phosphorous credits to offset water quality impacts from road construction. The offset credits have permitted the completion of more than 40 small road construction projects that improve traffic safety and flow by adding turn lanes, clover leafs, and small connectors, and repairing approaches to aging bridges. Compared to traditional engineered practices, the offset credits provide greater water quality benefits for up to half of the costs of installation and long-term maintenance.\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack (left) participates in a press conference with Commonwealth of Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.

Photo courtesy of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\nThe distinctive “fitz-bew” of the Southwestern willow flycatchers is music to the ears of the partners of Wetland Dynamics, LLC, and USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) recently improved the ability to hear them. Wetland Dynamics received a $60,000 Conservation Innovation Grant from NRCS in to develop innovative technology for monitoring the endangered flycatcher and two other imperiled species in Colorado’s San Luis Valley.\n“What we’re doing is innovative,” said Jenny Nehring, a biologist and partner at Wetland Dynamics. “The technology we’re using has been around for quite some time. But with the partnership now forged with NRCS, we are able to expand and improve our innovative techniques that build upon existing tools, which will in turn help to better understand certain wildlife species and improve protection of them.”\nWetland Dynamics is expanding and exploring the use of a passive acoustic monitoring technology traditionally used to monitor bats and aquatic species like whales. The company is using this innovative technology to improve detection and monitoring of the Southwestern willow flycatcher, Western yellow-billed cuckoo and Northern leopard frog.\nThe flycatcher, cuckoo and leopard frog are currently being monitored, but the widely used approach takes substantial labor and stresses birds.\nBy recording the birds’ noises, Wetland Dynamics is able to study the endangered Southwestern willow flycatcher. Photo courtesy of Wetland Dynamics.\n“It requires an observer in the field broadcasting the call of the bird to illicit a response from a bird on a territory,” Nehring said. “This method is intrusive and tricks the birds into thinking its territory is being threatened or infringed upon. Birds will, of course, react, but this reaction is stressful and energetically costly to already threatened and endangered species.”\nThe new way of monitoring, funded by the grant from NRCS, eliminates the stress on the bird while expanding the information gathered. It relies on passive recording equipment.\nBecause the devices can be stationed for prolonged periods of time, the consistency and quantity of information gathered will provide increased detection of species.  These more accurate detections will allow more focused and precise research on other things such as breeding success and habitat use.\nBetween observer bias and influences like weather, which might prevent an observer from even reaching a monitoring site, the margin for error within the typical call play back monitoring method is high.\nA grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is enabling Wetland Dynamics to expand its monitoring efforts of the Southwestern willow flycatcher and other at-risk species of the riparian habitat. Photo courtesy of Wetland Dynamics.\n“Our recorders are stationary devices, can be set up for weeks and have limited disturbance. Recordings are then scanned to detect the vocalization of interest and to differentiate varying vocalizations like birds that are close or far away.”\nAlthough this technology is promising and is quite significant for future monitoring of species in areas, it cannot determine the number of species in a particular area.\n“But it can detect if the bird is present which will help researchers focus their on-the-ground field work to determine territory size, breeding effort and success as well as habitat condition,” she said. “More work is clearly needed and that’s why the CIG grant was so important.  It allows us to refine and test the technology and quantify perimeters for accuracy. We greatly value our partnership with NRCS and hope it grows so that other monitoring opportunities can be explored.”\nConservation Innovation Grants aim to stimulate the development and adoption of innovative conservation approaches and technologies. This is one of NRCS’ many investments in the Southwest to help the flycatcher and other species. NRCS announced Monday its plans to broaden the conservation opportunities available to producers.\nBy recording the birds’ noises, Wetland Dynamics is able to study the endangered Southwestern willow flycatcher.

Photo: Ashton Ebarb.\n“They’re in a happy mood today,” Jim Pratt, a local apiarist, said.\nAt a comfortable 62 degrees, honeybees buzz with a clear objective: collect nectar and pollen, for honey and pollination.\n“Pollinators, like honeybees, support food crops,” Pratt said, explaining why for 20 years he’s raised honeybees.\nPratt’s Farm annually produces about 120 pounds of honey per colony. He maintains 100 colonies, collecting honey from them each spring, summer and fall. During the winter, the bees eat stored honey until warmer weather arrives.\nHoneybees, like all pollinators, face challenges. Lack of habitat is the number one local threat Pratt sees to pollinators.\nUSDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) works with farmers, ranchers and forest landowners to implement conservation practices on the ground that have numerous environmental benefits, including ones that provide habitat and food for pollinators.\n“Much of our local land is managed pastures,” Pratt said. Pastures provide benefits in various forms of agriculture, yet there are times between seasons when nothing is grown to attract pollinators across vast measures of land.\n“As a beekeeper, I seek out managed pastures over-seeded with clover. Placing colonies of honeybees in and around the pastures benefits not only the beekeeper with the potential of premium grade honey, but also benefits the landowner by sustaining the clover population as a result of the necessary pollination by the bees.”\nWith NRCS’ Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), landowners can offset the cost of over-seeding clovers in their pastures and adjacent tracts specifically for pollinator species.\n“Pastures over-seeded with clover provide benefits in various forms of agriculture,” Pratt explained. “First, pollinators of all types are attracted to it. Second, clover replenishes nitrogen in the soil which better supports livestock forage.” \nSince clovers are a cool-season legume, and usually die-back with the onset of mid-Summer, Pratt looks for tracts of land with natural habitat, such as wildlife refuges, conservation reserves and pollinator plantings adjacent to the pastures for nectar and pollen sources after the clover has died.\nPollinators need nearby habitats which is vital to sustaining their populations. People need pollinators, too. No matter the pollinator, whether bee, bird, beetle, butterfly, bat or any other, all contribute to our food supply by pollination.\n“90 percent of fruits and vegetables are not self-pollinating,” said Janice Hutton, horticulturalist with The Sabine River Authority in Sabine Parish, Louisiana.\nFruits and vegetables almost entirely depend upon pollinators. Every living person and thing that depends on fruits and vegetables depends on pollinators too.\nThe good news: helping pollinators achieve their goal is as simple as growing certain plants.\n“I have to know what blooms, when it blooms and whether each colony has enough worker bees to collect nectar and pollen,” said Pratt.\nThis week, USDA is celebrating National Pollinator Week by highlighting the many ways in which conservation benefits pollinators.\nThrough the Farm Bill, landowners have an opportunity to receive financial assistance through conservation programs and practices, which includes planting cover crops to target these beneficial pollinators.\nHoney comb from the hive.

The application was funded by a grant from the Forest Service Southern Research Station’s Insects, Diseases and Invasive Plants unit.\nThe software provides photos and information that allow users to identify the 56 nonnative plants and plant groups currently invading 13 Southern states.\n“Ultimately we hope this app will give people a new tool to go out and identify invasive plants and map their occurrence,” said Southern Research Station Research Ecologist James Miller, who co-authored the application’s source guides. “Effective control relies on understanding of species and how they spread across the landscape. Those are important first steps in stopping and containing the invasions of harmful nonnative plants.”\nLike the publications it was developed from, the app divides nonnative invasive plants into trees, shrubs, vines, grasses, ferns and forbs, and provides identification keys, photos and management recommendations. The app also gives users simple, on-the-spot options for treating invasive plants.\nFuture versions of the application will include the ability to directly report new sightings of select species into the Georgia Center’s Early Detection and Distribution Mapping System (EDDMapS), which provides a quick way to submit photos and report new sightings of invasive plants on the spot throughout the United States.\nFor more information on the threat of invasive species, go to the Forest Service’s Invasive Species Program page at \nScreenshot of Invasive Plants in Southern Forests: Identification and Management\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Early Detection and Distribution Mapping System\n Forestry\n FS\n Science\n Southern Research Station", "author": "Reggie Woodruff"},

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nTo many of locals in western North Carolina, they’re called wild leeks.  Some call them ransoms and still others call them wood garlic because of their pungent smell. Nevertheless, ecologists simply call them ramps. This native plant has been useful to humans since inhabiting the eastern regions of the U.S. and Canada.  Still today, locals harvest ramps for food, medicinal preparations, and to sell at markets and spring festivals.\nU.S. Forest Service scientist Joan Walker has been monitoring populations of ramps in the mountain coves of western North Carolina for 11 years. The results of her research show that although abundance can vary from year to year, about a quarter of the plots had decreasing ramps cover.\n“All of the plots that showed a decrease were where harvesting disturbance was high,” said Walker who is based out of the agency’s Southern Research Station. “Also, harvested plots as a group have reduced ramps populations compared to undisturbed ones.”\nThese results suggest that it may be time to re-examine the current harvest policy and perhaps take corrective measures to ensure the species will be available for future generations of Americans.\nIn the Southern Appalachians, many prime sites for harvesting ramps are within national forest boundaries. The National Forest System is responsible for maintaining biological diversity to sustain valuable ecosystem services such as clean air and water, healthy soil, abundant wood, recreational opportunities and other forest-based commodities that include herbs and edible plants.\nRamps are among the first ephemeral greens to emerge during the spring months of March and April. With their electric green leaves, plump, white bulb and distinct odor, ramps are easy to distinguish from other early growers. After a hard winter in the mountains with food stores running low, this green “manna” would have literally been a life saver to both Native Americans and settlers living throughout the region in years past.\nConcerns about harvesting effects in the southern range (northern Georgia and Alabama and western North Carolina) prompted Walker’s monitoring study in two areas of the Nantahala National Forest in western North Carolina. The goal of the project is to track the populations over time and to determine if trends are related to local harvesting, weather, or even changing climate. The monitoring study consists of 25 plots distributed between 3,500 feet to just over 5,000 feet in elevation.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Forestry\n FS\n joan walker\n ramps\n ransoms\n Science\n Science Tuesday\n Southern Research Station\n wild leaks", "author": "Robert H.

{"theme": "Conservation", "content": "Southern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in\n Forestry\n Feb 11, \nHealthy seagrass meadows prevent erosion on coasts, store carbon, and provide marine animals with food and habitat. (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency)\nJust off Florida’s 8,000 miles of coastline and tidal areas, in shallow sunlit waters, over two million acres of seagrass meadows waft in the ocean currents.\nBesides providing food and habitat for manatees, sea turtles, shellfish, and other animals, seagrasses protect coasts from erosion and store vast quantities of carbon dioxide.\n“Seagrasses grow off the coast of many other U.S. states, including North Carolina and Virginia, as well as around the world,” said U.S. Forest Service Southern Research Station scientist Zanethia Choice. “Globally, their economic value is nearly $4 trillion.”\nAlthough more closely related to lilies than to terrestrial grasses, like most of their distant grass kin, seagrasses require plenty of sunlight. Poor water quality reduces the amount of sunlight that reaches them, and seagrasses around the world are threatened by practices that affect water quality such as wastewater disposal and fertilizer runoff.\nChoice, a natural resource specialist at the research center’s Center for Bottomland Hardwoods Research, and her colleagues from the University of Florida recently studied light requirements for four common seagrass species along the Florida Gulf Coast. The study was published in the Marine Pollution Bulletin.\n“We found a direct relationship between the amount of light reaching the ocean floor and the amount and diversity of seagrasses growing there,” said Choice.\nIn 90 percent of sites where 13 years of historic showed that adequate sunlight had been reaching the ocean floor, researchers found thriving seagrass meadows. However, areas with suitable light but no seagrass were most likely due to unsuitable substrate, temperature, and the amounts of dissolved salts and oxygen.\nSeagrasses are adapted to nutrient-poor waters. When nutrients – whether from fertilizer runoff, wastewater disposal, or other human activities – wash into the ocean, they float suspended in the ocean waters. Seagrasses cannot use these suspended nutrients very efficiently, but tiny algae called phytoplankton can. Phytoplankton thrive in nutrient-rich waters, and as they grow, they intercept light and shade the ocean floor. Seagrasses were notably absent from areas with high nutrient levels.\nSome seagrasses such as star grass could survive with as little as 8 percent of sunlight reaching the ocean floor, while other species 25 percent sunlight or more.\n“Light requirements for all the seagrasses we studied differed from previous findings at other locations,” said Choice. “The differences are probably due to morphological and physiological differences, and adaptation to light histories at specific locations.”\nUnderstanding the light requirements of different seagrass species is essential for coastal managers who want to maintain seagrass habitats, and managing for seagrass health also provides water quality targets that can benefit other marine life.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n aquatic\n Florida\n Forestry\n FS\n North Carolina\n Research\n Southern Research Station\n Virginia", "author": "Sarah Farmer"},

(Photos by Michael Schwartz (left) and Katie Zarn, U.S. Forest Service)\nThis post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research profile.\nThe U.S. Forest Service has a long history as a leader in conservation genetics, and this recently took an exciting step forward with the launch of the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation.\nThe Forest Service’s wildlife genetics lab, which has been central to the Rocky Mountain Research Station’s conservation genetics program since , has been reorganized and renamed to better reflect the scope of its work nationwide. The Center is a leading edge facility for advanced genomics research, nationally recognized, and works extensively with states, tribes, universities and private groups to address the management issues of over 60 fish and wildlife species.\n collected by the Center will support the new Forest Service Forest Planning Rule with timely and cost-effective information on wildlife and fish species. Information developed by the Center will be made available through the network of USDA Climate Hubs to assist private forestland managers, farmers and ranchers in reaching their conservation goals.\nWith state-of-the-art technology and the development of new tools and techniques, the main objective of the Center is to provide cost-effective and reliable genomic for improved species monitoring. By having more robust information, state and federal managers are better able to evaluate the genetic health and population viability of fish and wildlife species across the landscape. The discovery of a new fish species and the detection of invasive species are among the Center’s many contributions to the advancement of science and management.\nImagine an expansive landscape, filled with different and remote terrain, and being asked to determine if the area has been impacted by a new invasive species. This is a daunting challenge that land managers face on a regular basis. One of the Center’s specialties, analyzing samples of environmental DNA, or eDNA, shows great promise in addressing this challenge. This type of DNA has been separated from organisms into the surrounding environment and can be found in soil, water and air. Forest Service scientists are developing ways to determine what species are present by simply sampling a cup of water from locations across the landscape.\n“eDNA is a highly sensitive method for detecting organisms in low abundance and is generally faster and extremely cost effective compared to traditional methods used to detect exotic or endangered species,” said Dr. Michael Schwartz, director of the center.\nThe use of eDNA is an innovative approach to inventorying and monitoring fish and wildlife species. eDNA is particularly effective for detecting rare species that can be difficult to sample using traditional methods. For example, researchers at the Rocky Mountain Research Station have been working with partners and collaborators on the threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) since . Bull trout is a culturally significant species to several Tribes in the Northwest and Columbia River Basin. It is also a prized game fish, and land management and recreational angling are significantly influenced by whether or not this species is present in a given watershed. This species is particularly sensitive to changes in habitat and is also threatened by the introduction of the nonnative brook trout (S. fontinalis). Forest Service scientists have developed sampling methods to make eDNA surveys a reliable and accessible option for managers to detect the presence of bull trout and their invasive competitor, brook trout.\nForest Service scientists continue to develop eDNA techniques for detecting priority fish and wildlife.  eDNA is just one method of non-invasive genetic sampling, which uses forensic-style DNA samples to monitor rare and sensitive species, employed by the Center.\nA Bull trout swims in a stream.

{"theme": "Conservation", "content": "Manager, USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline in\n Health and Safety\n May 25, \nCook pork, roasts, and chops to 145 ºF as measured with a food thermometer, then allow the meat to rest for three minutes before carving or consuming.\nCross posted from the FoodSafety.gov blog: \nOn May 24, USDA made some important changes in their recommended cooking temperatures for meats. Here’s what you need to know:\nCooking Whole Cuts of Pork: USDA has lowered the recommended safe cooking temperature for whole cuts of pork from 160 ºF to 145 ºF with the addition of a three-minute rest time. Cook pork, roasts, and chops to 145 ºF as measured with a food thermometer before removing meat from the heat source, with a three-minute rest time before carving or consuming. This will result in a product that is both safe and at its best quality—juicy and tender.\nCooking Whole Cuts of Other Meats: For beef, veal, and lamb cuts, the safe temperature remains unchanged at 145 ºF, but the department has added a three-minute rest time as part of its cooking recommendations.\nWhat Cooking Temperatures Didn’t Change?\nGround Meats: This change does not apply to ground meats, including beef, veal, lamb, and pork, which should be cooked to 160 ºF and do not require a rest time.\nPoultry: The safe cooking temperature for all poultry products, including ground chicken and turkey, stays the same at 165 ºF.\nWhat Is Rest Time? \n“Rest time” is the amount of time the product remains at the final temperature, after it has been removed from a grill, oven or other heat source. During the three minutes after meat is removed the heat source, its temperature remains constant or continues to rise, which destroys harmful bacteria.\nWhy Did the Recommendations Change?\nIt’s just as safe to cook cuts of pork to 145 º F with a three-minute rest time as it is to cook them to 160 ºF, the previously recommended temperature, with no rest time. The new cooking recommendations reflect the same standards that the agency uses for cooked meat products produced in federally inspected meat establishments, which rely on the rest time of three minutes to achieve a safe product.\nHaving a single time and temperature combination for all meat will help consumers remember the temperature at which they can be sure the meat is safe to eat.\nHow Do You Use a Food Thermometer?\nPlace the food thermometer in the thickest part of the food. It should not touch bone, fat, or gristle. Start checking the temperature toward the end of cooking, but before you expect it to be done. Be sure to clean your food thermometer with hot soapy water before and after each use.\nTo see where to place a food thermometer in different cuts of meat, see Thermometer Placement and Temperatures.

This week, a new season is getting a nice kick-off with Passover and Easter holidays. These celebrations are filled with traditional meals that have unique food safety considerations that may or may not be included in the family recipe book. The USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline has some food safety tips and steps here that, if added to your favorite recipes, can reduce the risk of food poisoning.  As with any food preparation, always remember to Clean, Separate, Cook, and Chill.\nBefore preparing any meal, wash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds, and clean surfaces and utensils with hot soapy water before and after handling raw food. Perishable food should not be left out for more than two hours at room temperature, so check the time at your gathering and make sure either to get food back in the refrigerator or to discard it. Refrigerated leftovers for all foods in this blog should be used within four days. \nBeef Brisket: One reason that it’s an excellent choice for entertaining is that it can be prepared in advance. In fact, you must prepare it in advance and cook it slowly to make it tender. Also, because it can be cooked ahead of time and it reheats well, brisket is a great cut of meat to serve to large groups.  Follow these food safety tips for cooking and serving brisket:\nBe sure to allow plenty of time to thaw a frozen brisket. Thawing in the refrigerator can take about 24 hours for a trimmed, first-cut brisket. A whole brisket weighing about 10 pounds can take several days.\nKeep raw meat refrigerated at 40 ˚F or below until ready to cook. Place the meat on a plate or container to hold the juices that can drip on other foods to prevent cross-contamination.\nBake the brisket, fat side up in a baking dish, in an oven set no lower than 325 ˚F. The brisket is safe to eat when it reaches an internal temperature of 145 °F and is allowed to rest at that temperature for three minutes. Use a food thermometer to be sure. For personal preferences, consumers may choose to cook the brisket longer for tenderness.\nIf reheating brisket before serving, remember to reheat to 165 °F.To serve brisket cold, keep it at 40 °F or below by nesting dishes in beds of ice, or use small servings platters and replace them often.\nHam: There are many kinds of hams on the market, but your family likely is purchasing a fully cooked ham. Here are tips for storing and serving a fully cooked ham:\nWhen buying a ham, look for the USDA or State Mark of Inspection. \nRefrigerate the ham at 40 ˚F or below immediately after arriving home.\nThese hams are best served cold. However, if you want to reheat them, set the oven at 325 ˚F and heat to an internal temperature of 140 °F as measured with a food thermometer. If the ham was repackaged at your butcher shop or grocer, reheat it to 165 °F. Individual slices may also be warmed in a skillet or microwave.\nDeviled Eggs: Follow these food safety tips below for making an egg dish such as deviled eggs. Remember, eggs are perishable just like raw meat, poultry, and fish, and could contain pathogens.\nOur virtual food safety expert, Ask Karen, has helpful instructions on how to boil eggs.\nAfter cooking the eggs, it is a good idea to keep the whites refrigerated while preparing the filling.\nKeep deviled eggs chilled until you are ready to serve.

USDA photo by Bob Nichols.\nFifty years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Economic Opportunity Act.  This Act, part of the government effort to wipe out poverty, created the Job Corps program, which has had a positive effect on countless young lives, giving them a chance to break multi-generational cycles of poverty, get an education, and find jobs in the federal and private sectors, and in the military.  The U.S. Forest Service works closely with the Department of Labor to operate Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers (Job Corps CCCs) around the country.\nLast week, dignitaries including Deputy Under Secretary Butch Blazer, Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell, and Tina Terrell, Forest Service National Director of the Job Corps, along with colleagues from the Department of Labor, came together in Washington at USDA’s Whitten Building to mark the anniversary.\nAs Chief of Staff for Natural Resources and Environment here at USDA, I am a passionate advocate for this program. Not only does it change families, it allows students to practice conservation on public lands and it also creates a trained group of firefighters to battle wildfire. In the previous two fiscal years, Job Corps CCC students accomplished more than 500,000 hours of service work on public lands. This year, we connected nearly 1,500 of our Job Corps students to training opportunities as part of the 21st Century Conservation Service Corps .\nIn addition to work on public lands, Job Corps CCC students also work on projects that contribute to their local community. During the anniversary event, Deputy Under Secretary Butch Blazer, who grew up on the Mescalero Apache Reservation in New Mexico, spoke of the profound difference that was made when one of America’s first Job Corps centers came to his reservation. “We learned a lot, and it added to the diversity of our community.” He talked about how the Center and others like it produced success and gave students hope for the future.\nChief Tidwell thanked everyone, but especially the students, past and present. He acknowledged the partnership forged with the U.S. Department of Labor and commented that during the summer of passage of the Economic Opportunity Act, the Wilderness Act and the Civil Rights Act made history in America.  As important as the last 50 years have been, the Chief said, this is “a moment in history, a time to reflect and celebrate, but also a time to dream of what is next.”\nNational Director Tina Terrell, born in Philadelphia, said that the Job Corps allows students access to the path she took, going from a life where all she knew about trees was “that they were in my back yard” to a fulfilling career with the Forest Service. “The future is up to you,” she said, “Culinary arts, Rural Development, Farm Service Agency, or an avenue for you if you want to work in the Forest Service.”\nShe said it best: “After 50 years, it is all about love of nature, love of the land, and helping young folks.

Where there was green grass there are now mud pits and tire tracks. The activities that caused this damage are illegal under both state and federal law. Participants could face charges including malicious mischief and fines up to and including paying for the costs of restoration. Smoothing ruts, reseeding or planting and repairing roadbeds cost a lot of money.\nMudding, or driving through wet areas and puddles while mud sprays up onto a vehicle is considered fun by some motor sports enthusiasts. Some people enjoy the challenge of maneuvering a vehicle through a situation where they could get stuck, or they may simply get a thrill out of seeing how high they can fling mud. There are websites and groups that cater to this interest and there are places, mostly private land (with a landowners permission), where such activities are allowed.\nBut a national forest is not such a place.\nThe results of this incident on the Okanogan-Wenatchee are a familiar sight to natural resource specialists across the Forest Service. There is a difference between acceptable use of off-highway vehicles and mudding -- tearing through grass to expose underlying soil or unnecessarily driving through a soft spot in the road.\nSpinning tires on plants destroys the plants, leaving behind bare dirt. When plants are gone, there is nothing to stop soil from washing into nearby streams and lakes. Muddy streams and lakes are bad for fish, wildlife, irrigators and recreationists, and many local towns depend on clean water and tourism for survival. When native plants are gone, noxious weeds move in. A meadow of native grasses and flowers may soon become a field of thistles and knapweed.\nBelieve it or not, mudding actually compacts soil. It’s hard for plants to grow in compacted soil.\nHealthy soil should bounce a bit when you walk on it. Tire tracks create hard, dried-up soil where water runs down tire tracks and into creeks and lakes, carrying mud and pollutants with it.\nMeadows and wetlands provide important breeding, rearing and foraging habitats for many birds and other animals. Tearing-up these areas removes nesting and hiding cover, decreases forage, interferes with feeding and pushes animals out into areas where they may not survive.\nOff-highway vehicles are permitted on designated trails within the National Forest System. These trails are built specifically to minimize the impact of vehicles on fragile ecosystems such as meadows and streams. Many trails are maintained by volunteers and are prime examples of citizens acting as stewards of public land.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Forestry\n FS\n Memorial Day\n mudding\n National Forest System\n natural resources\n OHV\n Okanogan Wenatchee National Forest\n recreation\n Soil\n Washington\n wetlands\n Wildlife", "author": "Unknown"},

(U.S. Forest Service Photo/Susan Blake)\nFor many, the “great” in “the great outdoors” answers the call to hit the open road with body, soul and little else except their motorcycle. That got a little easier on the Apalachicola National Forest in Florida with the opening of a new trailhead beckoning riders with easier trail access and opportunity to ride for recreation.\nThe grand opening of the new Springhill Motorcycle Trailhead south of Tallahassee, Fla., highlights the U.S. Forest Service policy to develop a system of roads, trails and areas designated for motor vehicle use.\nThe project includes a new, single-span aluminum bridge to connect the forest’s separate motorized northern and southern trails. The prefabricated 90-foot Fisher Creek Bridge, shipped in two sections, replaces an older, antiquated bridge that stretched across the waterway.\n“Introducing a new recreation site to the area is very exciting. It’s a milestone for the forest but one we hope the public will enjoy for years,” said Chandra Roberts, recreation program manager for the forest.\nThe Apalachicola saw the opportunity to create the new recreation area with a Recreational Trails Program (RTP) grant through the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The program provides financial assistance to develop recreational trails, trailheads and trailside facilities.\n“The $933,900 grant, funded by off-road vehicle fuel tax dollars through the Federal Highway Administration, has assisted the Forest Service in developing these facilities,” said Alex Weiss, Florida Department of Environmental Protection. “The Springhill Motorcycle Trailhead and Fisher Creek Bridge project, located in Leon County, exemplify the intent of RTP, which was created by Congress in .”\nAlex Weiss, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, discussed the benefits of the recently completed Springhill Motorcycle Trailhead on the Apalachicola National Forest to a crowd gathered for its grand opening.

Mark Schmidt Off-Highway Vehicle Safety and Recreation Act, which is designed to provide the public with more opportunities to ride off-highway vehicles on public lands.\n“Some people parked on the side of the highway and entered the trail, but now at this new facility there’s plenty of room to safely offload motorcycles and equipment before heading out on a ride,” said Steve Tomicich of the Tallahassee Trail Riders.\nRoberts said the Tallahassee Trail Riders, a local motorcycle club, and the Red Hills Powersports of Tallahassee promoted and participated in the grand opening and provided tips on trail riding.\nLocal resident Jeff McKenzie was particularly grateful for the new trailhead. “I wanted to get a small motorcycle to ride with my kids, but we really didn’t have a place to ride,” McKenzie said.  “Now we have this new motorcycle trailhead and it’s really easy to get to.”\nA local motorcycle enthusiast runs one of the motorized trails on the Apalachicola National Forest near Tallahassee, Fla.

You have just finished riding one of your favorite trails on the U.S. Forest Service’s Grand Mesa National Forest and couldn’t be happier.\nBut, do you ever wonder how all these miles of off-highway vehicle, or OHV, trails traversing a vast and diverse landscape stay in good shape? The fact is forests across the nation have the annual challenge of maintaining hundreds of miles of trails with limited budgets and personnel.\nOne such example of this national trails preservation effort is happening on the Grand Valley Ranger District. The district, along with the thousands of recreational trail users who frequent the Grand Mesa, benefit greatly from outside funding sources such as the state of Colorado OHV Grant Program and numerous partnerships with local groups and associations that help maintain their system trails.\nPartnerships have been instrumental in the maintenance and improvement of the many recreational opportunities on the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests. The Grand Valley Ranger District currently has partnerships with ten different organizations that volunteer to help clear trail corridors, conduct volunteer trail patrols and organize work parties to help with specific projects.\nThese partners have been essential not only in providing thousands of hours of help each year to maintain trails but, have been able to leverage and acquire additional monies to help fund trail improvement projects on the forest.\nOne such project completed during the season was the Young’s Connector Trail , located on the Grand Mesa. The Western Slope ATV Association volunteered many hours clearing the trail corridor and the Forest Service’s trail dozer crew, funded by a state OHV grant, built the new one mile trail linking two routes, and creating a 15-mile loop opportunity.\nIn addition to funds for specific projects, the Forest Service receives annual funding under a Good Management Grant that allows the Grand Valley Ranger District to hire two OHV crews, totaling 4 people, throughout the summer and fall when motorized use is at its peak.\nSo now, armed with a little more background on what goes on with the care and upkeep of your motorized trails on the Grand Mesa National Forest, get out and enjoy another ride!\nUS Forest Service OHV crew member cuts hazard tree on an ATV trail.

NRCS photo.\nApril storms delivered a mix of rain and snow to the northern half of the West but didn’t provide much relief for the dry southern half, according to the latest USDA water supply forecast.\nWashington, most of Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and the northern parts of Colorado and Utah, are expected to have near normal or above normal water supplies, according to the forecasts from the Natural Resources Conservation Service’s National Water and Climate Center (NWCC).  Streamflows that are far below normal are forecast for the southern parts of Oregon and Utah, southwestern Idaho, California, Arizona, New Mexico and western Nevada.\nMany of these areas are in the nearly 500 counties experiencing drought across the country, 57 of them in California alone, according to USDA disaster designations.\nSnowpack generally peaks in early April, and then begins to melt. Forecasters will continue to monitor conditions in preparation for the June 1 outlook, according to NWCC hydrologist Cara McCarthy. She said the rate of snowmelt in Montana and Wyoming will be especially important, because the record snow in some basins in those areas creates flooding potential.\n\"These areas will be most vulnerable if snow melts rapidly during a hot spell, or if there's extreme rain while the streams are swollen with snowmelt,” McCarthy said. “We’re hoping for a slow, consistent melt that will reduce the risk of flooding.”\nStreamflow in the West consists largely of accumulated mountain snow that melts and flows into streams as temperatures warm into spring and summer. USDA scientists analyze the snowpack, air temperature, soil moisture and other measurements taken from remote sites to develop the water supply forecasts.\nThe NWCC water supply forecast is part of a group of USDA efforts to improve public awareness of and to help mitigate the impacts of climate change, including drought and other extreme weather events.  Through the creation of the National Drought Resilience Partnership, launched as part of the President’s Climate Action Plan, federal agencies are working closely with states, tribes and local government to develop a coordinated response to drought.\nView the May Snow Survey and Water Supply Forecast map or view information by state.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Arizona\n California\n Colorado\n drought\n Idaho\n Montana\n National Water and Climate Center\n Nevada\n New Mexico\n NRCS\n Oregon\n Snow Survey\n Utah\n Washington State\n water\n Wyoming", "author": "Spencer Miller"},

This one was no exception.\nIt started out testing a new memory card that transmits photos from a digital camera to our Flickr social media gallery (www.USDA.gov and click the Flickr link).  After making the card work in the office , a field test was in order.\nSunflowers in the People's Garden at the Department of Agriculture, in Washington, DC. USDA Photo by Lance Cheung.\nThe nearest field was the Native American Garden, one of the two People's Garden fields just outside Whitten Building. My task was simple enough, take some pretty photos of corn and see if technology does it's magic. As soon as I take the first photo of what it thought were two big fat healthy ears of corn  I hear voices behind me on the sidewalk, \"Look at that, they're past their harvest.\"\nMature corn on the stalk in the People's Garden at the Department of Agriculture, in Washington, DC. USDA Media by Lance Cheung\nSo, me being a \"city-boy\" had to turnaround and see who was making these comments about these \"perfect\" ears of corn. Turns out a mother and young teenaged son were walking from one tourist site to another, and stopped to looking up at the rows of 9-foot stalks. Their voices were confident and seemed to speak from experience as they continued, \"They waited too long.\"  The young man was still nearby, while the mom continued past the garden watching our conversation. When asked how they made such deft evaluation, he easily pointed out the brown lower portions of the stalk and the yellowing upper half.\nCorn stalks that some passersby said was past their harvest time in downtown Washington, DC at the Department of Agriculture. The yellow and brown leaves were telltale signs of a spent stalk and hot dry summer days. USDA Photo by Lance Cheung. \nA closer look at other ears of corn, revealed corncobs kernels that were picked away by birds. What kernels that remained, were simply dried out in the sun, because the husk was picked away. In the next moment, the boy was gone, before I could get names or a photo.\nWhat he didn't know and I had forgotten, was that the Three Sisters crop, in this demonstration garden, was keeping with Native American tradition. The type of corn planted is Dent Corn or field corn.  Not the kind most of us are used to seeing on a dinner plate.\nIn fact, Dent Corn must be ground or further processed to be usable. And, unlike its sister crops of beans and squash, it is not suitable for donation to local food banks. Please see photos and info from the day the plants were planted on our Flickr site.\nSo, corn stalks are not all the same. Just as, their harvest times are not all the same. With this crop, birds get a free meal, the stalks will become holiday decorations; and visiting groups to passers-by get to see living American heritage growing before them.\nAll in all, the young (hopefully) future farmer was inspiring. I was left recalling the voice of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, as he often speaks about the value the next generation of farmers, who are they; what will be their motivation; where will they get help if needed in a world whose population is increasing, and the number of farmers are decreasing.

These trained observers ski, snowshoe or snowmobile to established snow measurement courses to record snow the old fashioned way – by hand.\nIn 12 western states, NRCS employees measure the mountain snowpack each month from January to June at over 900 snow courses. NRCS uses snow and climate to forecast water supplies – did you know up to 80 percent of the West’s water supply comes from melting mountain snow? \nToday we’re going to snowshoe into the Mores Creek site, near Boise, Idaho. At four stops along this 1,000-foot-long snow course we will measure the snow. Then, doing some quick calculations, we can determine how much water the snowpack contains.\nBy the way: snow courses are usually located in remote backcountry locations where snowfall accumulates. Because the work can be dangerous, the technicians, hydrologists, engineers and volunteers that serve as snow surveyors attend training every three to five years to maintain their survival skills. At “Snow School” they learn snow sampling, avalanche recognition, outdoor survival and backcountry emergency care. They even build snow shelters and spend the night in them!\nTo measure the snow we use an official Federal Snow Sampling tube which is an eight-foot long hollow tube precisely 1.485 inches in diameter. That’s so 1 ounce of tube weight exactly equals 1 inch of snow water equivalent.\nThe tube is plunged straight down through the snow to the ground to get the sample. First we measure the snow depth using the ruler on the tube.\nAbramovich reads the snow depth using the gauge on the tube.\nThen we carefully extract the tube with a snow core and weigh it – tube, snow and all.\nSubtracting the empty tube weight from the tube and snow weight reveals how much water is in the snow. This is used to accurately forecast spring runoff and predict summer water supplies. Good job – you’ve now measured the snowpack!\nAbramovich balances the tube on the scale to get the weight of the tube and snow sample.\nBesides these manually measured snow courses, NRCS maintains 800 automated sites (called SNOTEL for SNOw TELemetry) that collect snow, precipitation and temperature available on NRCS Web pages. The are used by hydrologists, planners, engineers and others to manage water supplies for industry, cities, recreation and wildlife.\nFor over 100 years, snowpack has been collected to forecast agricultural water supplies in the West – thanks for helping carry on the tradition!\nSnow surveyor Ron Abramovich, checks the snow survey tube to make sure it’s empty before taking the next measurement.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Conservation\n Idaho\n Mores Creek\n NRCS\n SNOTEL\n Snow Survey", "author": "Alexis Collins"},

Photo: Amy Overstreet\nRwanda native Janine Ndagijimana, her husband Faustine and their children moved to Burlington, Vermont in after living in a refugee camp in Tanzania for 13 years. Now a U.S. citizen, she works closely with Ben Waterman, the New American Farmer Program coordinator at the University of Vermont Extension Service (UVM) Center for Sustainable Agriculture. He manages the Land Access and Assessment Program that helps Vermont's resettled refugee and immigrant farmers obtain access to the resources they need to pursue their goals as farmers and to link common threads between their new home in America the culture of their homelands.\nJanine was one of several farmers who recently attended a meeting of the Association of Africans Living in Vermont to learn about USDA programs and services. Farmers from Burundi, Rwanda, Somalia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo learned about land acquisition, insurance programs, loans to support farming, and technical and financial assistance for implementing conservation farming practices.\nWaterman coordinates a project from USDA’s Outreach and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers and Veteran Farmers and Ranchers Program (OASDVFR), administered through USDA’s Office of Advocacy and Outreach. The $43,000 grant is helping Vermont refugee farmers improve their understanding of programs and technical assistance available through UVM Extension and USDA agencies.\n“We want to help these individuals, like Janine, build strong working relationships within the community and link them with the many resources that are available to them from the University and USDA,” said Waterman.\nUVM Extension outreach includes two workshops with translators on-hand assisting refugee farmers as they learn more about the programs and services of USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Farmers are then matched with an appropriate USDA representative to help them meet their individual goals and needs.\nMany of the farmers are interested in the kinds of vegetables they grew up with and raised in their home countries, like “intore,” a variety of eggplant found in Africa that Janine grows. Of course, the climate in Vermont is very different from that of Africa, where eggplants could be harvested through January.\nThanks to technical and financial assistance through the NRCS Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Janine will be able to extend her growing season in Vermont using a high tunnel. High tunnels, also known as hoop houses, are structures used to extend the growing season by shielding tender, sensitive crops—including vegetables, herbs, berries and others—from weather variations in the spring and fall, allowing them to grow where they might otherwise struggle.\nWith the assistance and mentorship of local farmer Gene Button, Janine is leasing land to raise her eggplants and market them locally and across the border in Canada. NRCS Soil Conservationist Danny Peet is also helping her use cover crops to improve soil health.\n“The high tunnel allows production from mid-summer until later in the fall,” said Peet.

Staffers from the Forest Service taught students tips to make a resume shine and how to ace an interview. The session also gave the hopefuls an opportunity to develop professional relationships and networking with potential employers. During the meeting, students who have worked for the Forest Service shared their experiences working as guides, building trails or fighting fires.\nNik Vasquez, 21, of Seattle, talked about working on the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest for three summers where he began on a trail crew.\nNik Vasquez, 21, of Seattle, worked on the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest for three summers. (U. S. Forest Service photo)\nVasquez worked 10-hour days maintaining trails, removing fallen trees, fixing water drainage, repairing trail paths and brushing out shrubs and branches. His typical work week began by backpacking five to seven miles to the trail, setting up a base camp, accessing damage and clearing away downed trees or branches.\n“You quickly learn how to use a Pulaski, a shovel and a grub hoe, to fix the trails,” said Vasquez. “I love being out there. It is the simple things: fresh air, mountain lakes, fishing for dinner, exploring mountain peaks, relaxing by the fire. Working outside is better than a 9-to-5 job.”\nDuring Vasquez’s second year on the Forest Service trail crew he began training to fight wildfires. The next year he was selected for a position on an initial attack crew.\nHis stint on the trail crew gave Vasquez the training but didn’t quite prepare him for the long hours needed to fight fires. His most memorable experience was fighting the Waldo Canyon Fire in Colorado Springs last year.\n“At a fire assignment you work long days, and you can be gone for months,” he said.\nBut one of the bonuses for working on the fire crew is the pay, which he is using to pay for his college tuition.\nVasquez is now majoring in engineering and physics at Loyola University in New Orleans, La. This summer he will take a break to return home and hike the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, a trail he learned about from those summer jobs.\n“There are so many peaks I want to climb along the way,” he said.\nAnnually, the Forest Service and its conservation partners hire more than 3,000 people for summer positions that involve work such as reducing the impacts of climate change on the nation’s natural resources, empowering Native American communities, building trails, enhancing wildlife habitat, and improving and restoring cultural and historic landmarks.\nYouth Conservation Corps crew members use their muscle to clear juniper slash on the Crooked River National Grassland in Oregon.

As I meet with farmers, ranchers and USDA interns, a sense of great appreciation and anticipation wells up for the future of agriculture. One of the USDA offices that serves these farmers and students is the Office of Advocacy and Outreach (OAO). OAO staff connect with farmers, community organizers, veterans, educators and students to bring opportunities and services.\nOAO works with community-based organizations to ensure access to USDA programs and services for underserved and limited-resource communities and farmers. A major program is the Outreach and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged and Veteran Farmers and Ranchers Program (also known as the Program).  Forty-five projects from organizations representing 25 States were awarded $8.8 million in . This included a second year of $400,ate University.\nAmong the program grantees are Robert Gates and Clay Taylor, President and Agribusiness Specialist at the Tri-County Agricultural Cooperative (Tri-County Co-op) in Mississippi. The co-op serves approximately 45 small, socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers – 80 percent of whom are under the age of 40.  “Thanks to the program, we are able to do one-on-one work with farmers,” said Gates. “We can spend quality time doing the research they need and training them on marketing practices.”  Taylor added, “The program allows rural individuals to turn family-owned property and rural towns into economic spaces and income generators. In the south we have a lot of space that is underused in terms of agriculture, especially sustainable agriculture. This program helps small, beginning, and socially disadvantaged farmers to unlock the hidden potential of agriculture.”\nIn September , OAO organized the second annual Program Partnership Symposium. I spoke to the group along with officials from Farm Service Agency, Rural Development and Natural Resources Conservation Service emphasizing the importance of leveraging USDA programs to strengthen outreach and services. Among the 300 participants in two years was Robert Gates of Tri-County Co-op who that both meetings where great opportunities to network with other grantees and university and community partners.\nMinority Farmers Advisory Committee\nOAO manages two critical advisory committees to the Secretary -- the Minority Farmers Advisory Committee and the Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Advisory Committee. Both committees provide recommendations to enhance USDA programs.\nThis year, OAO coordinated the USDA/Task Force meeting attended by a record number of Presidents, Agriculture Deans, and Research Directors.  Among the objectives was to continue work on the Centers of Excellence which promote and expand USDA’s partnership with the Land-Grant Universities. USDA agencies have provided $1.6 million to the Centers. OAO also ensures that the National Scholars Program places top students across USDA.  If you are a student or know of any students who would like to apply for the National Scholars Program, please download the application and submit it to USDA by the December 31, deadline.\nUSDA also partners with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF) to provide internships and this year, USDA increased the number to 117 TMCF interns. I am fortunate to have TMCF interns working in my office and one of those is Jay Coleman, a graduate of Southern University Law Center, Baton Rouge, LA. “Interning at the USDA has been eye-opening, and has allowed me to put my Juris Doctor to use,” Coleman said. “I have been given the opportunity to use skills obtained in law school to assist in implementing technological advances in the Office of the Assistant Secretary.”\nIn , USDA hosted 222 Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities interns and set a record. The E. Kika De La Garza Fellowship Program offers faculty and staff from Hispanic Serving Institutions the opportunity to work with USDA to gain an understanding of the Federal government. In , ates and 12 universities. OAO staff also leads the USDA Tribal Land-Grant Colleges and Universities Program serving the Tribal Colleges which includes 34 tribal land-grant institutions.\nWith these OAO services in as well as over the past several years, USDA made great strides in addressing barriers faced by minority and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers. To further strengthen and elevate this engagement with historically underrepresented communities, OAO now will report directly to the Office of the Secretary. The realignment highlights the critical importance of OAO’s mission and function, and also demonstrates USDA’s commitment to maintaining the momentum in addressing long-standing challenges.  This action also will create transparent lines of accountability and authority, and better facilitate oversight and coordination throughout USDA. The Department will continue to strengthen its outreach to customers on programs and services that support agricultural interests and rural communities -- the future of agriculture depends on it. \n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Initiatives\n Farming\n Rural\n Tags:\n National Scholars Program\n USDA/Task Force\n Tribal Land-Grant-Colleges and Universities Program\n Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Advisory Committee\n Farm Service Agency\n Minority Farmers Advisory Committee\n Natural Resources Conservation Service\n Office of Advocacy and Outreach\n Rural Development", "author": "Gregory L.

(Photo courtesy of Nancy Adamson and the Xerces Society)\nA recently awarded USDA Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) will fund research into bee-friendly seed mixes.\nA partnership made up of the Xerces Society, University of Wisconsin Center for Integrated Agriculture Systems and USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service in Wisconsin is working to develop and test seed mixes that will provide the best habitat for native bees. CIG-funded projects use innovative technologies and approaches to address natural resources issues.\nThree-fourths of the world’s flowering plants depend on pollinators to reproduce, and in the U.S., bees are the main pollinators of fruits and vegetables. But bees, bats and other pollinators are struggling as habitat loss, disease, parasites, and environmental contaminants have all contributed to the decline of many species of pollinators, including the more than 4,000 species of native bees in North America.\nTo ensure that bees and other pollinators don’t just survive, but also thrive, USDA programs provide funding and technical assistance for farmers to implement pollinator-friendly practices on their lands. One important practice is incorporating plantings that attract native bees and other pollinators to the borders of fields and other areas and feed them a varied diet throughout the year.\nProviding healthy habitat for native bees will also help feed managed hives of European honey bees—which are used to pollinate many commercial crops in the U.S.—and make them heartier, as they too reap the benefits of a diverse and healthy diet.\nNot long ago, Wisconsin was home to 13 species of bumble bee. Now, two of the most common bumblebees are no longer found here, due to habitat loss and environmental contaminants. (Photo courtesy of Hannah Gaines from UW-Madison Entomology Dept.)\nThat’s where bee-friendly seed mixes come in. Four half-acre demonstration sites have been planted using the new seed mixes in field borders and buffer areas: on apple and fresh vegetable farms, a cranberry operation, and a cucumber-and-pepper farm. The first results will be seen this summer, when scientists will observe how quickly and successfully the new plantings establish themselves, and how quickly the bees return.\nGetting the right seed mix to attract and sustain a healthy native bee population is a challenge. Bees need flowers—but not just any flowers. They need to be the right color and size, and bloom at the right times.\nBees are attracted to white, yellow, blue or purple flowers. Bees also need a variety of sizes, ranging from big sturdy flowers for the bumble bees to small delicate ones for the sweat bees. Timing is also important—for example, bees need some flowers to be steadily in bloom from the time the bees first crawl out of their winter nests in early spring until they go back in late fall.\nFind out more about Conservation Innovation Grants.\nCheck out more conservation stories on the USDA blog.\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Conservation\n Conservation Innovation Grants Program\n NRCS\n pollinators\n Wisconsin", "author": "Renae Anderson"},

The hydroturbine system was funded by NRCS in Utah through a Conservation Innovation Grant. Photo credit Roger Barton.\nLike other farmers in the West, Roger Barton must irrigate the alfalfa hay he raises for horse owners. And like many farmers, Barton has to be creative to make ends meet. He has an off-farm job to support his family and is always trying to think of ways to keep his farm costs down.\nWhen diesel costs rose to $4.25 per gallon a couple of years ago, Barton came up with a new, non-diesel-powered way to power his center pivot irrigation system, which creates those crop circles you may have noticed when flying over rural America. (The center pivot also saves lots of water by spreading just the right amount evenly over the land.)\nWith the help of a Conservation Innovation Grant from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Barton worked with a pump company and NRCS engineers to design a hydroturbine system that generates electricity to power his pivot irrigation system. CIG-funded projects use innovative technologies and approaches to address natural resources issues.\nA close up view of Roger Barton’s hydroturbine system which generates electricity to power a pivot irrigation system on a 127 acre alfalfa field in Utah. Photo credit Roger Barton. \nIrrigation water in his area is delivered from the mountains in a pressurized pipe at about 85 pounds per square inch (psi)—about twice as much as needed. In the past, this caused some damage to Barton’s sprinkler heads.\nNow when the water enters his new system it travels through the vanes of the turbine (Fig. 1), causing the turbine to spin and turn a hydraulic pump that pumps hydraulic fluid through gears that turn the wheels, moving the long irrigation boom around the circle. Along the way the water pressure is reduced to about 45 psi, just the right amount to keep it from damaging the sprinkler heads.\nThis system is terrific,” Barton says. “It not only did away with a $3,500 annual fuel bill, but it eliminates emissions from the old motor, avoids storing fuel on the farm and lessens our dependence on foreign sources of oil. I’d say that’s a win-win for everybody. The turbine runs a 127 acre T-L hydraulic pivot and it is still running like a charm in its fourth year of operation.”\nNRCS State Engineer Bronson Smart estimates the annual operating cost of the new turbine system to be less than $100.Barton has shared information about his system with neighbors, and his ideas, developed with the USDA grant, have been adopted into the NRCS standard practices list approved for use on other farms participating in the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP).\nFind out about the Conservation Innovation Grant program\nRead more about EQIP\nCheck out more conservation stories on the USDA blog\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\nRoger Barton’s alfalfa hay field in Utah is irrigated with a hydroturbine powered center pivot system.Roger Barton’s alfalfa hay field in Utah is irrigated with a hydroturbine powered center pivot system.

NRCS and UK staff view a water line with a high tunnel in the background. NRCS photo.\nSeasonal high tunnels have emerged in the past few years as an important tool for farmers wanting to extend their growing seasons. Right now, thanks to a Conservation Innovation Grant from USDA, a University of Kentucky professor is studying them – and how they can be made more efficient.\nKrista Jacobsen, an assistant professor of horticulture, is studying the soil inside of high tunnels and the possibilities of catching rainwater to irrigate crops inside of them. High tunnels are plastic-covered structures that enable farmers to have crops ready earlier or later in the season.\nIn high tunnels, plants are grown directly in the ground, and the sun’s heat regulates the temperature inside. Since , USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service has provided assistance to help producers construct more than 9,000 high tunnels on farms around the country. In the past two years, more than 400 have been installed in Kentucky.\nMany farmers use drip irrigation to water crops in high tunnels. The water typically comes from natural sources, such as ponds or springs, or from city water. But city water can often cost more and the chemicals sometimes added to it aren’t good for plants because they can cause a buildup of salts, said John Graham, a soil health specialist.\nJacobsen is looking at a device that will catch rainwater and then make it available to irrigate crops. This puts natural water to use, simulating rainfall on traditional field crops. Using rainwater also conserves water by not using underground sources.”\n“A main focus of this project is decreasing the ‘water footprint’ of high tunnel production for a variety of locations in Kentucky,” she said. “In areas with access to city water, this means reducing the use of drinking-quality water for irrigation purposes.”\nAnd in rural areas, it offers a low-cost and simple solution for farmers, she said.\n“Our project focuses on developing rainwater capture systems that are scale-appropriate to the smaller high tunnels popping up throughout Appalachia, and training farmers on efficient irrigation practices using relatively low-cost soil water monitoring equipment,” Jacobsen said.\nThe first of the rainwater catchment devices developed and constructed by the university will be installed and demonstrated for this fall and winter crop.\nThese irrigation systems rely on low-pressure irrigation systems powered by gravity, something the university is studying at two demonstration sites, a partnership with Grow Appalachia in London, Kentucky, and the University of Kentucky Robinson Center for Appalachian Resources for Sustainability in Jackson, Kentucky.\nThe Conservation Innovation Grant program helps groups, like the University of Kentucky, demonstrate innovative approaches to improve soil quality, air quality, and water quality, conserve energy, and enhance wildlife habitat in balance with productive agricultural systems.\nJust yesterday, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced USDA is investing $15.7 million through grants to 47 entities.

This invasive insect causes serious damage to citrus plants and citrus plant relatives through its feeding activities (photos are by R. Anson Eaglin, APHIS).\nUSDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has declared August as Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month.  Invasive plant pests and diseases are not just a concern of scientists, farmers or horticulturalists; they concern us all.  Invasive pests and diseases of plants—such as Asian citrus pysllid, European grapevine moth, Mediterranean fruit fly, and sudden oak death—can transform communities, harm our economy, and impact human health.\nAPHIS works to stop invasive pests and diseases of plants from arriving on our shores, and to address those that gained a foothold in our communities or that threaten agricultural resources, like citrus.  Through safeguarding activities overseas, on the border and across the country, APHIS helps to ensure a diverse natural ecosystem and an abundant and healthy food supply for all Americans.\nThere have been successes.  Invasive pests now eradicated include the Asian longhorned beetle in Chicago and parts of New Jersey.  Mediterranean fruit fly and Asian Gypsy moth infestations in several states are now eradicated.  But the fight to regulate, contain or eradicate invasive pests continues.  In this effort APHIS works very closely with partners at the federal, state, county and local levels, and at universities, and nongovernmental organizations.\nBut, the most important partner in protecting agricultural and forested resources from invasive pests and diseases are those most familiar with their communities—individuals like you.  By using available tools, you can join heroes like the Massachusetts homeowner who spied shiny black beetles spotted with white in her maples and searched the Internet for information out of concern for children handling the insects.  That Internet search and subsequent report to agricultural officials led to the detection of a significant Asian longhorned beetle infestation.\nAsian longhorned beetle infestations have been eradicated in Chicago, Illinois and northern New Jersey.

Volunteers will be working in rural Panama and meeting with local communities to raise awareness about as well as report suspected cases of New World screwworm, one of the most costly and economically significant pests of livestock in South America.\nThe New World screwworm is a parasite of warm-blooded animals, including humans. Female screwworms are attracted to and lay their eggs in exposed flesh wounds.  After eggs hatch, larvae burrow and feed on flesh, causing severe tissue damage and may even be lethal to the host. The screwworm was eradicated from the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Curacao and, finally, all of Central America in using the Sterile Insect Technique in which sterile male flies are released in massive numbers to mate with wild female populations. The mated female flies then lay non-viable eggs, leading to a decrease and subsequent eradication of screwworm populations.

{"theme": "Data", "content": "-Cooperative Service Administrator, Sam Rikkers in\n Rural\n Jan 12, \nKentucky Highlands Promise Zone invests in local foods.\nAs a law student, I spent a summer working and living with the Sokoagon Band of the Chippewa, a Native American tribe located in rural Northern Wisconsin.  Tribal leaders and members extended to me their kindness, friendship, passion and laughter.  They are some of our country’s finest.\nBut, make no mistake, the Sokoagon face challenges shared by many persistently poor rural communities across our country.\nThat summer, I saw with new eyes the importance of dependable and consistent employment, housing, health care systems and education.  That summer I also saw that for many rural Americans these things, taken for granted by many, are luxuries.\nThese agents of economic development are not only critical to a person’s economic success, they are necessary to the success and fate of all people and thriving communities. While our nation is in the heart of a strong economic recovery, too many of our rural communities continue to struggle to build a resilient middle-class.\nFor decades, rural Americans have worked harder and harder, yet found it increasingly more difficult to get ahead in our modern economy.  As a means to uphold his commitment to rural America, the Promise Zone Initiative is part of President Obama’s plan to create a better bargain for the middle-class.\nThis Initiative is driven by three core principles: 1) engage and partner with communities, 2) build community capacity for planning and implementation, and 3) learn from what worked and what didn’t. As we round out the holiday season and gear up for a new year, let’s first start by looking back on the past year and highlight our Promise Zones’ exceptional work.\nAt the heart of the Promise Zone initiative are communities and middle- and low-income families. Many are on the cusp of success, but need the right tools to create jobs, expand educational opportunities, increase economic activity, leverage private investment, and reduce violent crime.\nChoctaw Youth visit with President Obama.\nLast year, President Obama emphasized that communities make the greatest progress when we “bring together local government and nonprofits and businesses and teachers and parents around a shared goal,” and when, “[All hold] themselves accountable by delivering measurable results.” Our first four rural and tribal Promise Zones, Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Kentucky Highlands, South Carolina Low Country, and Pine Ridge Reservation of the Oglala Sioux Tribe are yielding substantial results.\nAccessible local food is a staple in American culture. The Kentucky Highlands Promise Zone’s has seen enormous strides in developing a strong local food economy. In early July, local partners of the Kentucky Highlands Promise Zone announced the creation of a low-interest loan fund for small farmers in the 54-county SOAR region of eastern and southern Kentucky. Investments like these mean real opportunities for small growers who want to make strategic investments in expanding their operations.\nLike electricity was 80 years ago, access to broadband service in rural America can make or break a community.  Broadband is no longer a luxury, but a critical piece of infrastructure. In early July , President Obama announced the ConnectHome initiative, selecting the Choctaw Nation as one of the pilot areas where the federal government and the private sector would partner to expand high-speed broadband. Today, the ConnectHome initiative is making a real difference in people’s lives, linking homes and businesses to a world beyond the small communities of the Choctaw.\nA street sign highlights the budding South Carolina Low Country Promise Zone partnerships.\nRevitalizing a stagnant rural economy is tough without critical investments attracting good-paying dependable jobs. The South Carolina Low Country Promise Zone knows this first-hand. Recently, USDA invested over $8 million in water and waste infrastructure in Hampton County, South Carolina, supporting the development of a regional industrial park. In total, the Promise Zone a whopping $312 million in capital investment and 153 jobs created since September .\nFor communities focused on the bread and butter of economic recovery, planning is fundamental. The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation is opening a planning office to ensure investments are harnessed and deployed effectively. The Pine Ridge Promise Zone has received federal technical assistance and investments to help build basic infrastructure such as water and waste systems and vital community facilities supporting a tribal college and the Oglala Sioux Tribe’s public safety system.\nAs we look toward our third and final round of applicants, the impact of the Promise Zone initiative on these four American communities is powerful. Our communities, federal agencies, and partners will continue to work alongside one another, providing boots-on-the-ground partnership and access to the vital resources necessary to make good on our shared promise.\nThose interested in learning about how to apply for the third and final round of Promise Zone designations can join the Rural or Tribal webinars, or view the recorded webinars online in coming weeks.

This approach values residents’ knowledge of their communities’ strengths and needs; it also includes local leaders as essential partners and collaborators.\nJennifer Irving, Director of Regional Equity for Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation, a local non-profit intimately involved in one-such effort at Pine Ridge said, “It is important to coordinate engagement of the Promise Zone stakeholders to ensure that Tribal Leadership’s vision and priorities are being met while optimizing Tribal commitment of time and resources.”\nPine Ridge was designated a Promise Zone last April and in July a Presidential Disaster Declaration was received following severe summer storms. Since then the federal government, the Oglala Sioux Tribal government, and local organizations, such as Thunder Valley and other key partners have been working collaboratively to ensure activities, investments, and projects of the many entities across the reservation have broad-based community support and coordinated, and likely to yield results for residents.\nDr. Richard Zephier provided an overview of the CEDS process and long term vision to develop a stronger economy for Pine Ridge.\nVisiting Rural Development staff were given an overview of the wide array of work underway including the Tribe’s work on a proposed Tribal Planning Office and a Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) that will lay out a long term vision for developing a stronger economy for Pine Ridge.  Other topics covered included recovery efforts underway in partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recovery efforts and an overview of the work two local organizations, Mazaska and Lakota Funds, are doing to identify housing and other finance-related needs.\nAt Oglala Lakota College we met with President Shortbull who talked about work underway to develop an Ag Expo Center that would be instrumental in making local food a path for economic development. The College has already raised a substantial amount toward the expected total project need.\nA representative from each of the round table break-out sessions provided the entire group a synopsis of the top issues that were drawn out of the round table discussion at their respective table.\nThis project will create educational opportunities in the community by increasing training and hands on experience for producers of all types of agricultural production on Pine Ridge. It will expand their economic opportunities by providing a place where producers can work in a commercial kitchen or work with large animals in a modern facility. This project has broad public support and holds significant potential for the Tribe and people living at Pine Ridge.\nWhile at Pine Ridge we also heard directly from Oglala Sioux youth at a roundtable with high school students at Little Wound School.  Of all of the meetings over the course of the two days, this opportunity to connect with the students at Little Wound that really hit home. The stories of hope, struggle and the students’ passion inspired us even more with the work ahead.\nPersistent poverty and lack of infrastructure investment have taken their toll at Pine Ridge. Now, these placed–based efforts aims to leverage investments, increase economic activity, improve educational opportunities and improve the quality of life in the area through focused work on the six goals the community has identified as instrumental to improve the economic health of the area, increase the quality of life and accelerate the work to create comprehensive community revitalization.\nFirst, accelerate job creation by building the foundation for new businesses including implementation of workforce development programs to ensure people are trained with the skills to fill new positions.\nSecond, increase economic activity by addressing economic issues at the systemic level—like expanding increasing banking options and affordable housing for the workforce on the Reservation.\nThird, improve educational opportunities on the Reservation from primary school through the post-secondary level by offering Lakota immersion education, charter school options and opportunities at the Oglala Lakota College.\nFourth, improve public safety Reservation by addressing substance abuse issues and strengthening the justice system.\nFifth, provide affordable, low maintenance, energy efficient housing for residents of the Reservation, focusing on key issues like affordable rent, homeownership and middle income housing by developing the real estate market and increasing access to capital.\nSixth, systematically develop infrastructure by providing the Tribal government with the ability to operate, maintain, and replace current infrastructure and facilitate future development.\nA representative from each of the round table break-out sessions provided the entire group a synopsis of the top issues that were drawn out of the round table discussion at their respective table.\nThe Promise Zone Initiative is part of the President’s plan to partner with local communities, businesses and Tribes to create jobs, increase economic security, expand educational opportunities, increase access to quality, affordable housing and improve public safety.  To date, thirteen Promise Zones have been designated across the country; Pine Ridge is one of only two Tribal Promise Zones.  Seven more Promise Zones will be designated in and applications are currently being accepted.\nWe know that increasingly, the community where a child grows up in impacts her odds of graduating high school, her health outcomes, and her lifetime economic opportunities. The Administration has been steadily embarking on a different approach to working with communities to ensure where a child is born never determines her destiny.\nThe Promise Zone Initiative is one of the Administration’s community-based initiatives in action across the country.  In these places federal experts are working side by side with residents and local leaders to create customized solutions; bolstering coordination across agencies and improving how we interact with communities as a ‘one Government’ partner; and relying on valuable to help inform solutions and evaluate what’s working and what’s not.\nThe Promise Zone designation enables USDA to work more collaboratively with other federal agencies in partnership with the Oglala Sioux and others across the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation on efforts to increase economic mobility and create opportunities across the entire region.  To view all active community-based initiatives in your community, visit www.whitehouse.gov/omb/place.\nUSDA leadership was able to connect with high school students from Little Wound School.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Pine Ridge\n Promise Zone Initiative\n Promise Zones\n RD\n South Dakota\n StrikeForce\n Tribal", "author": "Bruce Jones"},

Photo by Christopher Leonard. \nWith Independence Day just around the corner, families across the nation are making preparations to honor the day as the grill chef, king of Castle Suburbia, lord of the living room, master of the flames, marches forth.\nWith a meaty feast to honor the day, the Fourth of July has become almost as much a celebration of grilling greatness as it is a celebration of the nation’s independence. However, all that glitters isn’t gold and an infection of Salmonellosis can quickly knock the grill king off his throne and onto another.\nFittingly, the Fourth of July sits in the middle of grilling season. The amber flames roaring up between the grill grates can easily give the false impression of bringing death to all bacteria. However, don’t be misled. Preparing burgers on the grill is a quest that must be tackled safely. Taking the four oaths of food safety (clean, separate, cook and chill) will ensure a feast free from visits to the porcelain throne, or worse, a trip to the emergency room.\nThe battle against foodborne illness begins on the way home from the store. Separating raw meat products from ready-to-eat products on the journey home is an essential step in preventing cross-contamination. Cooking hamburgers to 160 degrees will safely kill Salmonella and dangerous E. coli bacteria, but it does no good if you contaminated a salad with raw meat juice. And the specter of Salmonella isn’t constrained to poultry. No, the risk from this bug reaches to beef, pork and other meats as well as poultry.\nEver hear the phrase “clean as you cook?” It’s sage advice considering cross contamination can ruin nearly any dish. Cutting boards, cabinet handles, countertops, basically anything you may touch with your dirty, meaty hands can potentially transmit pathogens.\nA recent FSIS-sponsored study asked 80 consumers to prepare a meal including a fruit salad and meat dish. The meat provided was inoculated with L. casei, a bacterium found in yogurt, to test average food safety preparation. Half of the group heard food safety messages and half did not. Despite this, 90 percent of the fruit salads were contaminated with the target bacteria. Kitchen towels were a major source of contamination, but the sink, refrigerator, oven and trash cabinet handles were also contaminated, just waiting to infect something else. Check back soon for more information on this study’s findings.\nIf the grill king’s subjects use proper techniques (see FoodSafety.gov for tips), there is still the matter of cooking the meat. Despite the common advice of cooking to color or checking juices, the ONLY way of ensuring doneness is with a food thermometer. Nothing else, short of dragon fire will do.\nFinally, keep cool by keeping food cool. Don’t leave food out in the hot summer air without a way to chill it. Again, fightback.org is a good source for tips on what foods can stay out and for how long.\nStick to these four oaths of food safety and the grill king and his guests will enjoy the feast to honor the day.

Flash Workout.  The Oconaluftee Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center in Cherokee, N.C. has embraced the Let’s Move! concept, and launched a Healthy Eating and Active Lifestyles program. Oconaluftee has gotten behind this national movement by producing a student fitness video using the music and choreography of the Let’s Move! Flash Workout.  \nAs with many songs, the name ‘Move Your Body’ says it all. The flash workout is a dance, an exercise, and a fun activity that all students can participate in. Over 20 students performed the flash workout in front of the entire campus to show how simple and easy it is.  “It was truly amazing and I really enjoyed it” said student choreographer Kayosha Roseboro.\nFor several days leading up to the showcase, students learned the steps, the rhythm changes, and how to coordinate movement in a large group. The flash workout also allowed for many styles of dance including Dancehall, Hip Hop, Salsa, ‘old school’ Running Man, and today’s top moves like ‘the Dougie’.\nBeyonce’s lyrics throughout the song ‘Move Your Body,’ encourage those who may be hesitant to get active, “a little sweat never hurt nobody” and that realize that there is no wrong way to get moving.\n“This whole campaign is about encouraging people around the country to move their body in any way, shape, or form but just move your body” concluded Roseboro.\nAs an education and training program focused on young adults, Forest Service Job Corps can play a critical role in helping students make healthy choices as adults.\n“What we’re talking about is shifting a sedentary and unhealthy body mindset to one of smart food choices and energizing activities” said campus Trainee Employee Assistance Program Coordinator, Lakeisha Gallaspy.  “If a flash workout is what it takes in then that’s what we’ll do!”\nThe Oconaluftee Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center works closely with the Forest Service’s National Forests in North Carolina. It is accredited by the Council on Occupational Education and currently serves 104 students.\nThe mission of the U.S. Forest Service is to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations.

(USDA Forest Service photo by Deborah Lee Soltesz)\nThe country’s annual celebration of its independence is not complete without family gatherings, picnics, parades, and the sights and sounds of fireworks.\nYet on national forests and grasslands, fireworks and other explosives are prohibited permanently. Public lands provide another option for celebrating the Fourth: Simply look up at night. Nature’s light show can provide its own “oohs and ahhs.” Stargazing, especially in areas where darkness is broken only by campfires, provides spectacular shows.\nAlthough fireworks are not allowed, national forests and grasslands are the perfect spaces to spend your holiday. They provide entertainment for everyone, from camping, to cookouts, to places to enjoy water recreation.\nIf camping or picnicking is what you are planning, make sure you check with the local ranger district of your national forest or grassland for any bans on open flames, whether it’s a fire pit, grill or campfire. Even if there are no bans, please be cautious. The rule to ensuring your campfire is out is to drown, stir, drown and feel with the back of your hand to ensure the fire is fully out. Letting a campfire die out naturally is not safe. Hot embers could be smoldering underneath the ashes and could reignite. Remember, the ashes should be cold to the touch.\nYou can also use a mesh dome over fire pits to help stop embers from flying in the air and landing on dry grass. These embers could spark a fire in an area further than your campsite.\nOther safety tips include being careful to not park on tall, dry grass. The heat from the car, or chains dragging along the ground if you are pulling something, could spark a fire.

Each year, as part of this nationwide celebration, USDA highlights programs that help people in rural and Tribal areas buy, build and repair affordable homes.\nAt USDA, we believe every American should have the opportunity to own a home. Since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, Rural Development has helped over 266,000 rural individuals and families buy, build and repair homes through programs including the Single Family and Multifamily Housing Programs. USDA is ready to support the housing needs of all people living in rural and Tribal communities.\nTake, for instance, Norma Nix, a resident of Mineral Hills, New Mexico. When a forest fire destroyed her family home, USDA Rural Development stepped in to help. “I lost everything on Mother’s Day—my entire home, my photos, and of my children’s childhood memories,” Nix explained. Through the Rural Disaster Housing Repair Grant Program, Norma was able to apply for assistance and rebuild her new home. Stories like Norma’s highlight how USDA is helping rural and Tribal Americans and is committed to aiding families who lost their homes to disaster.\nUSDA Rural Development’s number one program, Single Family Housing Direct Home Loans, enables qualified lower-income applicants to buy homes with no money down. Kailee Meyer, a recent graduate and resident of Jasper County, Iowa, realized her dream of homeownership through this program. “When I graduated from Central College in Pella, I wondered what I was going to do for housing,” said Meyer. “I never had to worry about it before”. Meyer researched USDA after a family friend introduced the idea to her and found the program that helped her purchase the home of her dreams. Since its inception, approximately 2.2 million families and individuals have purchased homes with USDA’s Single Family Housing Direct Loans program.\nPresident Biden announced a plan to increase affordable housing throughout the country, especially in rural areas. The plan aims to close America’s housing supply shortfall by creating and preserving hundreds of thousands of affordable housing units. It will also help renters struggling with high rental costs by focusing on building and preserving rental housing for low- and moderate-income families.\nFor more information about homeownership, home repair, and rental assistance programs, visit the Single Family Housing program webpage or contact a Rural Development State Office to learn more about USDA homeownership programs near you.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Equity\n Tags:\n Rural Development\n National Homeownership Month\n Single Family Housing Direct Loan program\n Multi-family Housing Program\n Iowa\n New Mexico\n You May Also Like\n USDA Thinks Outside the Box at Inaugural Innovation Event\n Diversifying the Policy Space: Tribal Policy Intern Celeste Lucero\n Investing in Wastewater Infrastructure is Key to Preserving Smith Island, Maryland", "author": "Jennifer Williams"},

But it’s about more than the beautiful views of the Chesapeake Bay from the picturesque island ten miles from the mainland. The multi-generational residents depend on the surrounding Chesapeake Bay for their livelihoods. For many, crabbing, oystering, and ecotourism are what puts dollars in their bank accounts, and food on their tables.\nIn rural communities like Smith Island, located in and along the Chesapeake Bay, aging wastewater facilities are in need of upgrades. Not only can this be an expensive problem for towns with small populations, but without the critical upgrades, the threat of combined sewer overflows from more frequent weather events and climate change could contribute to pollution of the Chesapeake Bay.\nSo, what is being done to help these rural communities protect the environment and preserve a way of life that impacts so many?\nUSDA Rural Development and partners are answering the call by investing in state-of-the art, modern wastewater treatment facilities in communities like Smith Island and many others located throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed.\nSmith Island Wastewater Treatment Facility\nSmith Island’s wastewater treatment facility consisted of two pump stations, serving the three communities that make up Smith Island: Ewell, Rhodes Point, and Tylerton. After four decades and prolonged exposure to the elements, the components of the wastewater treatment facility began to corrode, break down, and fail. This left the surrounding bay and wildlife vulnerable to combined sewer overflows.\nFederal, state, and local agencies collaborated on a solution: a new, modern wastewater treatment facility. Through the Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant Program, USDA Rural Development provided the community with $83,000 in loan, and $5,000,000 in grant funds, with other partners providing the balance, to help the community afford the $22.3 million Smith Island Wastewater Treatment Facility.\nPeter Bozick, Executive Vice President of George, Miles & Buhr, LLC, the engineer and architecture firm that designed the new facility said, “The island is sinking slowly due to climate change and rising sea levels, and the former infrastructure was susceptible to flooding. In addition to replacing the treatment facility with new materials that can resist corrosion, we raised the pumping stations about five feet higher in order to be above the 100-year flood zone.”\nRead more about how this significant investment in improving infrastructure on Smith Island is contributing to a positive outlook for the future of Smith Island.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Rural Development\n Wastewater\n infrastructure\n Maryland\n You May Also Like\n USDA Thinks Outside the Box at Inaugural Innovation Event\n Diversifying the Policy Space: Tribal Policy Intern Celeste Lucero\n USDA Rural Development Celebrates National Homeownership Month", "author": "Emily Cannon"},

It's better than an hour's drive northwest of Palmer, the headquarters of the Matanuska Telephone Association (MTA). With a population of fewer than 250 residents, the unincorporated community hosts a lodge, a gas station, and tourism-related businesses that provide visitors access to the massive glacier just south of  the community.

With a USDA Community Connect investment, and local investment from MTA, students, families, manufacturers, small businesses, and Native communities will have access to upwards of 10 Mbps upload and download speeds – that allows these very rural communities to connect and compete globally.\nAdditionally, with the Community Connect grant, the folks that live along the Glenn Highway between Chickaloon and Glacier View will also have access to a brand new Community Connect Center providing free broadband access for the next two years.\nThe Community Connect grant creates an opportunity for USDA to partner with our cooperatives and other public and private sector entities to provide rural residents access to advancing technology, to help educate students, and to give rural crafters and manufacturers access to a global customer base.\nAs Secretary Vilsack said in today’s announcement, “Modern telecommunications and broadband access is as essential to the businesses and residents of Rural America as electricity was in the s.”\nInvesting in rural America adds to the economic viability of rural communities, which strengthens the nation’s economy and helps all of America to thrive.

{"theme": "Disaster", "content": "International Trade and Development Branch, Economic Research Service and Gopi Munisamy, Director, Market and Trade Economics Division in\n Research and Science\n Trade\n May 09, \nIn terms of employment growth, sectors outside of farming have been the major beneficiaries of agricultural exports in the past dozen years. Starting around , a divergence appears between the estimated numbers of farm and nonfarm jobs, with the latter accounting for a rising share of total employment supported by agricultural exports.\nDid you know that the United States is the world’s second largest agricultural exporter after the European Union? Agricultural trade supports American jobs and spurs non-farm economic activity. In , U.S. agricultural exports over one million full-time civilian jobs, including 764,000 jobs in the nonfarm sector. Each dollar of U.S. agricultural exports supported an additional $1.28 in farm and non-farm business activity. Moreover, U.S. agricultural trade surplus has historically helped to offset some of the trade deficit in non-agricultural sectors.\nUnderstanding agricultural trade trends, opportunities and challenges help inform policy decisions on trade. That is why the Economic Research Service (ERS) conducts research and analysis on the economic and policy factors underlying U.S. and global agricultural trade.\nSome ERS are broad in scope, focusing on factors that affect the international competitiveness of the U.S. food and agriculture sectors. The Global Landscape of Agricultural Trade, - explores growth and change in global agricultural trade and ways in which key policies have affected global trade patterns. During the last two decades, global agricultural trade volume has risen over 3.5 percent per year, and five countries—Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, and China—account for much of that increase in trade due to rising incomes and productivity growth.\nOther ERS research focuses on the export potential of key emerging markets and agricultural commodities of interest to U.S. producers. For example, India is the world’s largest producer and consumer of milk and has the world’s largest dairy herd. A recent ERS report, India’s Dairy Sector: Structure, Performance, and Prospects, finds that future production prospects depend heavily on productivity gains, primarily through improved breeding and feeding practices, and demand for feeds and improved genetics may offer opportunities for increased trade. Another recent ERS report, China’s Foreign Agriculture Investments, explores alternative motivations of China’s overseas investments in agriculture and their implications for U.S. agricultural exports to China.\nIn addition, ERS works with USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) to provide forecasts for agricultural trade in the United States. These forecasts of current and next year U.S. exports and imports cover major agricultural commodities. ERS’s Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States (FATUS) provide monthly estimates of U.S. agricultural imports and exports—both value and volume—by country and commodity. Using U.S. farm-cash-receipts , ERS also estimates annual U.S. agricultural export values by State and commodity.\nTo learn more about agricultural trade, visit the International Markets & U.S. Trade section of the ERS website and view a presentation on The Global Landscape of Agricultural Trade.\nBetween and , world agricultural trade more than tripled in nominal terms (not adjusted for inflation) and nearly doubled in real terms (adjusted for inflation). Key factors driving this expansion include a more than 25-percent increase in the world’s population and about a 75-percent increase in the real size of the world’s economy. Other factors have also stimulated agricultural trade, including falling trade barriers and technological advances in agricultural production, transportation, information, and communications.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Trade\n Tags:\n Economic Research Service\n Trade\n agricultural exports\n Exports", "author": "Cheryl Christensen"},

The focus of the tour is to help small- and medium-sized businesses gain access to the resources they need to export their products internationally. \nEarlier this year, the U.S. government kicked off the nationwide National Export Initiative “New Markets, New Jobs” tour designed to help connect small businesses with the resources they need to sell their products globally.\nThe most recent stop on the tour took place in Milwaukee on August 3. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack hosted the event, which was collaboration between USDA, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), the U.S, Department of Commerce (DOC), the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Export-Import Bank (EXIM).\nVilsack was in Wisconsin to focus on the state’s success story, as farm exports grew 36 percent over figures, delivering a record $2.4 billion in sales. Only Texas and Tennessee farm exports grew at a better rate. Wisconsin’s agriculture industry supports nearly 350,000 jobs in the state, or 1 in 10 jobs overall.\nIn Milwaukee and other cities on the “New Markets, New Jobs” tour, small businesses learn about a variety of export assistance programs available to them. One such program is FAS’s Market Access Program (MAP). Through MAP, FAS helps agribusinesses with promotional efforts, technical assistance, market research and more. In alone, more than 625 new small businesses joined the thousands of companies already benefiting from MAP.\nLast year, WildRoots, a snack food company that is headquartered in Oklahoma and has productions facilities in Illinois and Nebraska, exported nearly $6.5 million worth of their healthy treats to Canada. While $6.5 million in exports may be a small feat for a major American food corporation, for a small agribusiness like WildRoots – who as of hadn’t begun exporting their products – achieving such a sale and gaining international customers is invaluable to the future of their business.\nSmall- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) like WildRoots are vital to achieving President Obama’s NEI goal of doubling all U.S. exports by the end of . As part of this initiative, the President is committed to helping U.S. farmers and small businesses expand their access to international markets.\nUSDA and the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), which has been the department’s lead agency for accessing overseas markets for more than 50 years, have taken the President’s NEI challenge to heart.\nWildRoots used MAP for support with their marketing efforts in Canada. According to one of the company’s founders, without MAP “we simply would never have been able to compete with Canadian producers. It has moved our business to a new level.”\nMAP funding can also be used to help SMEs offset the cost of participating in USDA-endorsed international trade shows, which is another significant way FAS has helped SMEs boost international sales. In alone, USDA supported U.S. pavilions at 27 international food shows in 19 countries. Nearly 1,000 exhibitors – mostly SMEs – reported $179 million in on-site sales and more than $1 billion in 12-month sales, all resulting from their participation in these shows.\nUltimately, by helping increase the agricultural exports among American SMEs, FAS is helping the United States stay on the road to economic recovery.  Even in this trying time in American economic history, agricultural exports continue to thrive. By the end of fiscal year , the United States is forecast to reach a record-breaking $137 billion in agricultural export sales. In calendar year , the first full year under NEI, U.S. agricultural exports reached $116 billion – an 18 percent increase over the previous year.\nFor $1 billion in agricultural exports supports 8,400 American jobs and generates $1.31 billion in economic activity.  This means that increased exports for our nation’s agricultural small businesses is good for news for all Americans.\n“Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack speaks at the National Export Initiative (NEI) “New Markets, New Jobs” tour in Milwaukee, Wis. on Aug. 3, .

During their meeting, they discussed science-based solutions to U.S. beef and beef products and global food security. Additionally, Vilsack reiterated the United States’ commitment to achieving an ambitious and balanced conclusion to the Doha Round and his belief that a Doha success can be achieved if all major economies—including Japan—are willing to come to the negotiating table.\nVilsack said, “This [beef] issue remains a high priority for the United States and the U.S. objective remains a framework that is consistent with science and international standards. Minister Akamatsu and I concluded our meeting by confirming that the U.S. - Japan bilateral relationship in agriculture is a strong and positive one and vowed to continue in this direction.”\nOn the heels of his meeting with Minister Akamatsu, Secretary Vilsack boarded a train traditionally used by the Emperor for a scenic two hour ride to Kofu in the Yamanashi Prefecture for the 50th Anniversary Celebration of the now-famous “hog lift” – when generous Iowa farmers sent a group of 36 hogs to Yamanashi after Japan’s hogs were nearly wiped out by a major typhoon.  Three years after the hogs’ arrival, the original hogs had multiplied to more than 500. Vilsack had previously traveled to Japan to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the event.\nUpon arrival in Kofu, the Secretary, his wife, and the rest of the U.S. delegation were greeted by local elementary school children singing and playing traditional Japanese taiko drums – an event that included Yamanashi Governor Shomei Yokouchi and other Prefecture officials.\nSecretary Vilsack then paid a visit to the Yamanashi Prefectural Museum of Art where he participated in a tree-planting ceremony of an oak tree—Iowa’s official state tree—on the grounds of the museum to mark the 50th anniversary.  In his dedication, Secretary Vilsack stressed the importance of the diplomatic bond that had been formed between the United States and Japan as a result of this event, noting that just as the tree planted today will continue to grow stronger roots and larger branches, so too would the relationship between Japan and the U.S. grow more solid over the next 50 years of friendship and cooperation.\nLater that evening, Vilsack offered congratulatory remarks at the 50th anniversary ceremony where he celebrated the sister-state relationship that has been formed between Iowa and Yamanashi and how this reminds us of the benefits of cooperation and trade.  After the traditional breaking of the sake barrel to begin the festivities, Iron Chef Yukio Hattori presented an award to the winners of contest to come up with the best recipe using products grown in Iowa and Yamanashi.\nSecretary Vilsack (second from the left) joined (l-r) U.S. Ambassador Roos, Iowa Governor Bill Northey, Yamanashi Governor Shomei Yokouchi, and the Speaker of the Yamanashi Diet to plant an oak tree—Iowa’s official state tree—on the grounds of the Yamanashi Prefectural Museum of Art to recognize the longstanding friendship between the two states and countries. \nSecretary Vilsack joined Japan and Iowa leaders to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Iowa Hog Lift to Yamanashi, Japan\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Trade\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Bill Northey\n Doha\n Farmers\n Iowa\n Japan\n Kofu\n Minister Akamatsu\n Shomei Yokouchi\n Tom Vilsack\n Yamanashi\n Yamanashi Prefectural Museum of Art", "author": "Unknown"},

Families would gather in camps at rice lakes to harvest and process the grain, as well as to rekindle social relationships.\nToday, wild rice is still collected by traditional methods. Canoes are poled through the rice bed as a second person uses cedar sticks to pull the stalks into the boat and knock the rice off.\nUnfortunately, the distribution of wild rice throughout northern Wisconsin has greatly diminished from its historic range, lessening the opportunities for successful harvest.  Reasons for the decline include the negative impacts of pollution, recreational boating, and the unintentional introduction of invasive plant species.  Perhaps the most significant reason for the diminished harvest is the fluctuations of water depth.\nWild rice grows in shallow water under some very specific requirements. Even subtle changes to water depth during the critical early growing period can destroy a rice bed for a season.  Continued water depth problems eventually eliminate wild rice from a lake altogether.   Beaver dams blocking the outlets of rice lakes commonly contribute to fluctuating water depth. Removal of beaver dams often serve as a critical component of wild rice restoration.\nU.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Wildlife Services (WS) in Wisconsin provides expertise in beaver damage management for wild rice recovery and maintenance, through a partnership with the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC), individual tribes, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR).  WS monitors 23 wild rice lakes spread across northern Wisconsin for the presence of beaver dams.  On-the-ground surveys of each lake are conducted in late winter or early spring, prior to the wild rice growing season.  Any beaver dams discovered at lake outlets are removed, thereby preventing unnecessary fluctuations of water depth and allowing the wild rice to grow naturally. Lakes are monitored throughout the growing season for any increase in beaver activity.  Similar projects are undertaken by WS in Minnesota for the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe and the Chippewa National Forest.\nWS’ efforts have contributed to the resurgence of wild rice beds on many lakes, helping to ensure successful wild rice harvests for the future.\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Tags:\n APHIS\n damage management\n Menominee Tribe\n Ojibwe Tribe\n Potawatomi Tribe\n Tribal\n Wildlife Services\n Wisconsin", "author": "Robert Willging"},

{"theme": "Disaster", "content": "Posted by Secretary of State John Kerry, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Dr. Rajiv \"Raj\" Shah, Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development in\n Conservation\n Food and Nutrition\n Trade\n Sep 24, \n From record droughts in Kansas to deadly wildfires in California, the United States is feeling the effects of climate change. These same conditions have a dire impact across the developing world, especially for poor, rural smallholder farmers whose very lives are threatened every time the rains arrive late, the floods rush in, or the temperature soars.\nBy , the world’s population is expected to reach nine billion people. Feeding them will require at least a 60 percent increase in agricultural production. There is no greater challenge to meeting this need than climate change. It poses a range of unprecedented threats to the livelihoods of the world’s most vulnerable people and to the very planet that sustains us. In order to ensure that hundreds of millions of people are not born into a debilitating cycle of under-nutrition and hunger, we must address the urgent threat that climate change poses.\nThat’s why today we’re announcing the launch of the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture. The idea was born eight months ago, when an international delegation of leaders—including many from the USDA, the State Department, and USAID—met in South Africa for the Global Conference on Climate Change, Food Security, and Agriculture. There, we charted a more sustainable path to food security—one that preserves the environment while driving broad-based economic growth.\nThe Alliance's solutions will encompass every type of climate and agricultural system, including better crop, livestock, and aquaculture varieties that can tolerate extreme heat, drought, and floods. We are also testing and deploying innovative tools for farmers, like weather-indexed crop and livestock insurance to help communities build resilience to severe weather.\nThe Alliance will advance a more inclusive, innovative, and evidence-based approach to food security. It will provide platforms for partners to collaborate on agricultural practices, make key investments, develop policies that empower producers to mitigate the impact of climate change and, through sustainable agriculture practices, contribute to a dramatic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. It will also provide farmers—particularly women—with greater economic opportunities.\nJoining the Alliance represents an ambitious step in the United States’ efforts to integrate climate change policies into every area of our work. The Alliance will work in concert with the U.S. Global Climate Change Initiative, drawing on its expertise and experience grappling with climate change challenges in more than 50 developing countries around the world. This climate-specific knowledge and practice being pioneered today will be critical to protect lives and livelihoods, and promote low-carbon growth and development around the world.\nAs one of his Administration's first foreign policy acts, President Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton launched Feed the Future, the U.S. Government’s global hunger and food security initiative. Led by USAID—in partnership with USDA, the State Department, and eight other federal agencies—Feed the Future empowers vulnerable communities to move from dependency to self-sufficiency.\nIn the last year alone, Feed the Future has improved the nutrition for 12.5 million children across 19 countries. At the same time, it has helped 7 million farmers grow their yields, raise their income, and begin the journey out of the devastating cycle of extreme poverty.\nIn , President Obama rallied a group of global leaders at the G8 Summit at Camp David to launch the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, aimed to increase public-private partnerships and increase investment in agriculture. Today, we’ve leveraged $10 billion in investment from more than 200 companies—the majority from local African firms, including farmer-owned businesses.\nHere in the United States, we’ve taken steps to address climate change and its impact on agriculture, setting up seven climate hubs and three sub-hubs; launching the Soil Health Initiative (healthier soil captures more carbon and helps farmers succeed), engaging more farmers than any time in American history in land and water conservation efforts, and we’re contributing to the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gasses. Our experiences at home can provide lessons that are valuable for farmers around the world.\nWe don’t have time to wait. From India to the United States, climate change poses drastic risks to every facet of our lives. Ground water supplies are vanishing faster than they can be replenished. Typhoons, wildfires, and floods are showing signs of becoming more frequent and more deadly. And with each day, families are pushed to the brink of survival—threatening our own prosperity and security in an increasingly connected world.\nAddressing climate change will not be an easy fix, and it won’t be simple. Long term global food security depends on us acting together now.  That’s why the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture is so critical. By joining together, we can design new technologies and create new alliances to effectively protect and manage the environment that supports us—and the thriving ecosystems that will sustain our world for generations to come.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Food and Nutrition\n Trade\n Tags:\n California\n Climate Change\n Department of State\n Dr. Rajiv Shah\n Feed the Future\n Food security\n Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture\n Hillary Clinton\n India\n John Kerry\n Kansas\n President Obama\n South Africa\n Tom Vilsack\n USAID", "author": "Unknown"},

The book is narrated by the Once-ler, a faceless character who tells a young boy the story of the lost Truffula trees, which are nowhere to be found. But as he tells his story, the Once-ler says to the boy:\nUnless someone like you\ncares a whole awful lot\nnothing is going to get better\nIt’s not.*\nThe Lorax then tosses the last Truffula tree seed, urging the boy to set out and plant the seed and help bring back a forest of Truffula trees as well as the Barb-ba-loots, Swoomee-Swans and Humming-Fish that relied on a healthy forest to survive.\n“Given the many threats to America’s private and public forests due to a changing climate, pests and pathogens, and land conversion, this children’s story can spur conversations about what has to happen today to restore the health and productivity of America’s forests,” Tidwell said. “This is an opportunity to start a dialogue about the inherent value of forests and the importance of sustainable management.”\nThe nation’s 193 million acres of forest and grasslands provide a wealth of public benefits: clean air and water, wildlife habitat, recreation and the wood and paper products Americans use every day.\n“Forests matter to everyone, and we must use and care for them responsibly and sustainably,” Tidwell said. “The Forest Service, our state partners, family forest owners and the many partner organizations we work with are helping to protect more than 751 million acres of forest land in America. Ensuring that trees are part of America’s landscape is a goal we all share with The Lorax.”\nThe Lorax also is an integral part of a public service campaign with the Forest Service and the Ad Council. The two agencies have worked together since on a public service campaign designed to inspire children and their families to unplug and reconnect with nature.\nThe Ad Council helped the Forest Service join forces with Universal Pictures, which created pro bono a series of new English and Spanish television, radio and outdoor public service advertisements that feature characters from the movie, which will open nationwide March 2, Dr. Seuss’ 108th birthday.\nThe PSAs encourage viewers to go Discover the Forest, an online site that helps children learn about how to discover the wonders of forests around them.\n*Excerpt from The Lorax by Dr. Seuss, Random House, .\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Discover The Forest\n Forestry\n FS\n The Lorax\n Tom Tidwell", "author": "Kathryn Sosbe"},

Then imagine the excitement when an actual Dr. Seuss character enters the room!\nArthur “Butch” Blazer and the Lorax.\nThat’s what happened when Arthur “Butch” Blazer, USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, recently spoke to more than 300 students at James K. Polk Elementary School in Alexandria, Va. about the importance of trees and forests.\n“Why are trees important?” the former State Forester of New Mexico asked the students. “Do you know where you get your drinking water every day? Much of that water comes from the forest”.\n“It’s so important that we take care of our forests. Remember it’s important that we keep our forests healthy so we have good water to drink. If our forests go away, where will we find our water?”\nBlazer proceeded to share with the curious young faces the story about The Lorax, which revolves on the Dr. Seuss character’s quest to reinvigorate a forest filled with trees and their reliant ecosystems.\nStanding between the students and a drop-down screen that displayed accompanying images, Blazer, who was donning his cowboy hat, began reading The Lorax. The lights were dimmed and the school’s multipurpose room was quiet with the occasional bursts of giggles by students, whose grade ranges included kindergarten, fourth and fifth grades. The kindergarteners proudly wore paper hats made to mimic Dr. Seuss’ signature Cat in the Hat.\nAfter Blazer’s storytelling came to an end, the lights came on and the students’ applause grew thunderous when their school principal surprised them with another guest -- The Lorax himself, who entered the room to greet the excited students!\nThis event coincides with the release of Universal Pictures’ film, The Lorax. Blazer’s reading of the story also served as a component of the National Education Association’s Read Across America Day, an annual event sponsored by the association to promote literacy among children in the United States. The character, The Lorax, has additionally been part of a major public service campaign, jointly led by the Forest Service and the Ad Council since , that encourages kids to Discover the Forest.\n“I hope that the students learn to share our love for the environment and our love for trees,” said Heidi McAllister, assistant director of the Forest Service’s Conservation Education program in Washington, D.C., who attended the school’s special event. “I hope that they establish a relationship with the environment that will grow over time and help sustain them throughout their lives.”\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Butch Blazer\n Forestry\n The Lorax\n U.S. Forest Service", "author": "Renee Lee"},

Year after year of seeing trees removed without a plan for replacement worried the city staff members who performed tree work. No one, however, had any basis for articulating an argument that Casper’s prized legacy—their tree canopy—was poised for imminent decline. The last large scale tree planting initiative in Casper was at the end of World War II and their urban forest, full of Siberian elms, was not aging gracefully. For a few staff members, finding a way to make a compelling argument to care for community trees that was cost effective, accessible and credible became their personal charge.\n“After considering our options, we felt that i-Tree would not only give us a comprehensive picture of our urban forest, but also tell us what it was doing for the community,” recalls Jim Gerhart, a member of the staff. “We needed to make a case for funding an urban forestry program and a person to run that program…we wanted to have information that would help that person hit the ground running!”\nGerhart attended an i-Tree workshop in , and used his new know-how to train staff and volunteers to begin studying the value and benefits of Casper’s trees. In all, 243 tenth-acre plots located throughout the city were inventoried in this highly visible effort.\nThe Casper Urban Forest Effects report provided a scientifically credible snapshot of Casper’s entire urban forest: street trees, park trees, and those on private lands. The results not only confirmed the vulnerability of an aging and homogenous urban forest, but also put economic values on the city’s “green” capital and the benefits it provides. Using the , city staff were able to illustrate, with certainty, that Casper’s trees were not only a valuable asset, but a fragile one too.\nMore startling than the hundreds of thousands of dollars in energy and air quality benefits the forest produces yearly, is the investment the city found it would need to replace this component of the infrastructure if all was lost: $243 million dollars!\nAfter seeing the  i-Tree results, the city committed $450,000 to launch and administer a pilot urban forestry program over three years, and they hired the first City Forester of Casper, William Scott.\n“Every day we use the baseline i-Tree to determine what trees we plant and where the priorities are,” said Scott. “It really has enabled us to not only diversify the city’s tree resource, but the emerging resource that cares for the trees: the newly founded Urban Forestry Section. Our i-Tree project has allowed us to build external and internal relationships with other departments such as engineering, planning and community development that didn’t exist two years ago.”\ni-Tree was developed in partnership between the Forest Service, the Davey Tree Expert Company, the National Arbor Day Foundation, the Society of Municipal Arborists, the International Society of Arboriculture and Casey Trees.\nCasper, WY Quick Facts:\n___\nStructural Value\nNumber of trees - 123,000\nCompensatory value of trees - $243 million\nCarbon storage - $689,000\nTree cover - 8.9%\n___\nAnnual Functional Values\nCarbon sequestration $22,000\nPollution removal $249,000\nEnergy savings $26,700\n___\nSiberian elms are:\n33% of all city trees\n70% of street & park trees alone\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Casper Urban Forest Effects report\n Forestry\n FS\n i-Tree\n urban forest", "author": "Al Zelaya"},

{"theme": "Disaster", "content": "Natural Resources Conservation Service, Texas in\n Conservation\n Jul 25, \nSimon Winston and his family recently won the national Leopold Conservation Award for their conservation work.\nIn deep East Texas, pine trees are king. Towering pines line the roads and blanket the rolling countryside and national forests. Loblolly and slash pine dominate the landscape in contrast to the area’s historic longleaf pine trees that once reigned.\nThe reduced number of longleaf pines has not gone unnoticed by landowners and conservationists. In response to the striking loss of longleaf pine trees from Texas to Florida, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) launched the national Longleaf Pine Initiative, which provides technical and financial assistance for conservation practices that help restore longleaf pine forests and enhance existing pine stands.\nWorking alongside NRCS, Simon Winston of Winston 8 Ranch of Nacogdoches, Texas, is one landowner who is doing his part to help restore longleaf pine to its native habitat. In turn, his stewardship efforts are also benefiting native grasses and wildlife populations.\n“What I like about them is that when they are young you can burn in them,” Winston said. “Loblolly you can’t burn in them until they are bigger.”\nPrescribed burns are a conservation practice used on longleaf pine forests. Fire reduces moisture and nutrient competition. The elimination of brush and other woody species also allows for native grasses and foraging plants to thrive. In turn, wildlife are drawn to the understory of longleaf pine forests.\n“We’re getting wild plums and seeing more deer. There’s something for them to eat and for the birds to nest in,” Winston said. “Burning helps establish bluestem grasses which are good nesting habitat for turkeys and quail.”\nLongleaf pine restoration continues on the Winston 8 Ranch.\nBut the cost of establishing longleaf pine trees can be greater than other pine species. Longleaf seedlings can cost more, and site preparation is a vital component for establishment success.\nThis is where NRCS in partnership with private landowners makes a difference on the landscape. Through the initiative, Winston was able to recover some of the costs associated with seedling establishment and site preparation. In fact, Winston said the financial assistance made a difference in what he was able to accomplish on his ranch.\n“We’re just trying to make better conservation and do what’s right,” Winston said. “That’s what we do everyday. It’s naturally what we do.”\nWinston’s dedication to environmental stewardship recently caught the attention of the Sand County Foundation, which honored Winston with the national Leopold Conservation Award.\nLongleaf pine once covered 90 million acres from Texas to Florida. Today, an estimated 3 percent of these forests remain. Partnerships between NRCS and landowners like Winston can result in improved ecological diversity, wildlife habitat, and increased longleaf pine trees on the landscape of East Texas.\nNRCS and its many conservation partners are working to reverse the century-long decline in longleaf pine forests through the America’s Longleaf Restoration Initiative. Earlier this week, NRCS joined fellow partners in this initiative to mark the five-year anniversary of creation of the initiative’s Range-wide Conservation Plan for Longleaf Pine.\nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS) Chief Jason Weller speaks at the closing ceremony of the the America’s Longleaf Restoration Initiative event at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Tuesday, Jul. 22, .

He accomplished that and much more. Read on...\nAbout halfway through working on my Ph.D., I came across a recurring problem. My dissertation focused on helping small-scale meat processors expand, upgrade, and build new facilities, essential for allowing smaller, diversified farms to access meat markets and for creating more demand for meat processing.\nThe problem was that butchers were getting older and looking to retire and finding someone young to take over was challenging. The trade of butchering, a practice even older than agriculture itself, was fading due to a lack of job appeal among people my age .\nWith a USDA Sustainable Agriculture Research & Education grant, I developed a training program and resource guides, and helped form one of the most active stakeholder networks in livestock agriculture, now called the Niche Meat Processor Assistance Network. Yet one question haunted me: How could I convince young people to take on this task of being the noble and honest butcher, when I couldn’t convince myself to do it? So I finished my Ph.D. and took a job as a meat processor.\nThat was not an easy decision. Going through 22 years of schooling to slaughter animals for a living might not strike folks as the best use of an education, but I disagree: As we seek to build a more sustainable future, all of us—regardless of profession—need to contribute our talents to build that future. If those of us who feel strongly about butchering don’t contribute, who will?\nThere’s much work to be done in many vocations.

Expenses vary depending on the age of the child.\nAs families often need more room to accommodate children, housing is the largest expense.\nWe did the analysis by household income level, age of the child, and region of residence. Not surprising, the higher a family’s income the more was spent on a child, particularly for child care/education and miscellaneous expenses.\nExpenses also increase as a child ages.  Overall annual expenses averaged about $300 less for children from birth to 2 years old, and averaged $900 more for teenagers between 15-17 years of age. Teenagers have higher food costs as well as higher transportation costs as these are the years they start to drive so insurance is included or a maybe a second car is purchased for them.\nRegional variation was also observed. Families in the urban Northeast spent the most on a child, followed by families in the urban West, urban South, and urban Midwest.  Families in rural areas throughout the country spent the least on a child—child-rearing expenses were 27% lower in rural areas than the urban Northeast, primarily due to lower housing and child care/education expenses.\nChild-rearing expenses are subject to economies of scale. That is, with each additional child, expenses on each declines. For married-couple families with one child, expenses averaged 27% more per child than expenses in a two-child family.  For families with three or more children, per child expenses averaged 24% less on each child than on a child in a two-child family.  This is sometimes referred to as the “cheaper by the dozen” effect. Each additional child costs less because children can share a bedroom; a family can buy food in larger, more economical quantities; clothing and toys can be handed down; and older children can often babysit younger ones.\nFood costs have decreased over the years thanks to increased efficiency in American agriculture.\nThis report is one of many ways that USDA works to support American families through our programs and work. It outlines typical spending by families from across the country, and is used in a number of ways to help support and education American families.  Courts and state governments use this to inform their decisions about child support and foster care payments.  Financial planners use the information to provide advice to their clients, and families can access our Cost of Raising a Child calculator, which we update with every report on our website, to look at spending patterns for families similar to theirs. This Calculator is one of many tools available on MyMoney.gov, a government research and clearinghouse related to financial education.\nThis year we released the report at a time when families are thinking about their plans for the New Year.  We’ve been focusing on nutrition-related New Year’s resolutions – or what we are referring to as Real Solutions - on our MyPlate website, ChooseMyPlate.gov.  This report and the updated calculator can help families as they focus on financial health resolutions.  This report will provide families with a greater awareness of the expenses they are likely to face while raising children.\nIn addition to the report and the calculator, we also have a dedicated section on ChooseMyPlate.gov that provides tips and tools to aid families and individuals in making healthy choices while staying on a budget. For strategies beyond food, our friends at MyMoney.gov offer a wealth of information to help Americans plan for their financial future.\nFor more information on the Annual Report on Expenditures on Children by Families, also known as the cost of raising a child, go to: www.fns.usda.gov/resource/expenditures-children-families--all-years.\n*Projected inflationary costs are estimated to average 2.2 percent per year. This estimate is calculated by averaging the rate of inflation over the past 20 years.\nEditor’s Note (March 8, ): The comparison of rural vs. urban northeast child care and education value has been updated.\nVisit the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s MyMoney.gov for more resources to ensure financial well-being this New Year’s season!\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n children\n choosemyplate.gov\n CNPP\n Cost of Raising a Child\n economics\n Expenditures on Children by Families\n Food and Nutrition\n mymoney.gov\n MyPlate\n Research", "author": "Mark Lino"},
{"theme": "Disaster", "content": "Honoring my Teachers, Sharing Traditions on the San Carlos Apache Reservation\n With more than 40 years of professional experience working in the field of natural resources, I am sometimes asked to share the personal outdoor experiences I had as a tribal member growing up on my reservation. When the request involves children, and those children are Native American, I am especially honored because in my culture the elders share traditional teachings of how we are connected to nature, both through stories and traditional songs.\nAs we celebrate Earth Day , I am reminded of a recent invitation from the U.S. Forest Service Tonto National Forest and Smokey Bear to speak at a career day on the San Carlos Apache Reservation in Arizona. I had an audience of 180 tribal fourth graders from Rice Elementary School to share my experiences growing up on a reservation and the lessons I learned about the outdoors.\n Deputy Under Secretary Arthur \"Butch\" Blazer, Natural Resources and Environment\n Posted in\n Conservation\n Initiatives\n Forestry\n Apr 22, \n 1 Response", "author": "Unknown"},

The Child Nutrition Department for the district has a centralized menu providing daily:  four entrees, chef or specialty salads, three to four fruit and vegetable choices, and whole grain bread and croutons baked daily.  An annual PTO Academy is conducted keeping parents and faculty abreast of wellness policy regulations and fresh ideas on healthier snacks and fundraising.\nIn addition, some of the schools have their own gardens. Some require walking a few laps around the track or field before starting free play at recess.  The Child Nutrition Staff has a lot of training every year in food preparation and presentation, and whole grain breads are baked from scratch daily at all of the schools.\nI think you can readily see why Lamar County School District is an outstanding organization that encourages wellness.  So many of its schools are providing an excellent nutrition environment and exercise opportunities for their students.  I was encouraged by what I saw and I hope many more schools will follow Lamar County School District’s example.      USDA’s HealthierUS School Challenge recognizes schools that create and maintain healthy school environments by promoting good nutrition and physical activity.  It’s a key component of First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! campaign to end childhood obesity within a generation.\nUSDA FNCS Deputy Under Secretary Dr. Janey Thornton speaks at Sumrall Elementary School during a HealthierUS School Challenge awards ceremony where she presented two Gold Awards. \n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Initiatives\n Tags:\n Gold of Distinction Awards\n HealthierUS School Challenge\n Janey Thornton\n Let's Move\n Michelle Obama\n Mississippi\n Purvis", "author": "Deputy Under Secretary Janey Thornton"},
