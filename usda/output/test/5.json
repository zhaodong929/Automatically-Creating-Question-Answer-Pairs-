As the final days of this administration are approaching, it gives me a great deal of pride to look back at what USDA has accomplished in the areas of research and innovation.\nScientific research is a fundamental part of our mission at USDA. But, ultimately, what's behind all the science is people – people who do the research and people who are affected by it. As USDA's Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics, I've met and worked with both as I've traveled across the country and around the world.\nI've seen the dedication and innovation of researchers at a USDA laboratory in California as they developed uses for drones and laser-guided sprayers as part of a \"precision agriculture\" movement. Their work allows the wise, efficient application of water and chemicals – as well as increased crop yields – in drought-ridden areas.\nI've seen the confident, solitary efforts of a Cornell University professor in the field of urban aquaponics who, with USDA funding, proved that he can not only raise 10,000 tilapia in fish tanks housed in the unlikely location of a high school basement in midtown Manhattan, but could then recirculate the fish tank water to nourish a thriving edible garden a few floors up in the school building.\nAnd I've seen the eagerness reflected in the faces of two young girls taking part in 4-H National Science Day activities in the nation's capital, applying science and technology skills and equipping themselves to possibly become part of the next generation of leaders in agricultural science.\nThese people, and so many before them, embody the commitment to scientific innovation that is a major reason why Americans have not had to worry about food security since the Dust Bowl days of the s. To learn more about USDA's important scientific work, I invite you to take a few minutes to take a look at our results over the past eight years in our USDA Medium Chapter 11: Food and Ag Science Will Shape Our Future.\nThe 21st Century has been referred to as the “Century for Biology,” and we are witnessing the applications of our heightened understanding of genes and gene traits to enhance crops and livestock. These applications, in turn, have been integral to USDA efforts like the transfer of germplasm and new plant varieties to the private sector here in the U.S.\nWe are helping, through USDA’s partnership with the Agency for International Development and the “Feed the Future” initiative, in delivering UG99-resistant wheat varieties and improving the nutritional content of legumes—two examples of how our research and innovation are being applied to help improve food security around the world.\nOur work has been informed by projections that our global population will reach over 9.5 billion people by the year . To adequately feed that number of people would require an almost doubling of the world’s current level of agricultural production and a reduction in food loss and waste, at the same time the amount of farmable land is decreasing. As we continue to learn about the effects of a changing climate, our focus is on sustainably intensifying agricultural production to deliver the array of foods to provide for good health and foods that are free of disease-causing pathogens and toxins.\nWe have developed a vision of a bioeconomy that by the year will produce a billion tons of biomass – agricultural residues, grasses, energy crops, forestry trimmings, algae and other sources – that will provide alternative sources of fuel, energy and other bioproducts. We have also focused research on developing agricultural systems that will be able to provide all of these services and be resilient in the face of climate change.\nOver the last eight years. We have faced numerous challenges and the results have been remarkable. There is still much to do, but we have left a solid foundation for continuing USDA’s work to support the American agricultural economy, to strengthen rural communities, to protect and conserve our natural resources, and to provide a safe, sufficient, and nutritious food supply for the American people.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n 4 H\n agricultural research\n Dr. Cathie Woteki\n Feed the Future\n Science", "author": "Cathie Woteki"},

The course’s meticulously groomed putting greens and fairways—like those of so many other golf facilities—are an inspiration to lawn-care enthusiasts near and far.\nBut professional golf course superintendents and lawn-loving homeowners alike face a common foe: chubby, C-shaped pests called “white grubs,” which eat the turf grass roots. Unchecked, they cause brown spots or barren patches that mar the turf’s aesthetic value and even playability.\nRobert Behle isn’t an avid golfer, and you won’t find him competing with his neighbors for the best-looking lawn. But he does know a thing or two about insects—and even more about controlling them using their natural enemies. An Agricultural Research Service (ARS) entomologist, Behle specializes in ways to formulate naturally occurring fungi and other microorganisms into bio-based pesticides.\nIn fact, he and Purdue University colleague Doug Richmond recently finished a three-year project funded by the U.S Golf Association (USGA) to evaluate the potential of the fungus Metarhizium brunneum to kill white grubs, the larval stages of Japanese, June, and other scarab beetles. The practice, known as “biological control,” is one that’s already found its way onto some golf courses. Indeed, a survey by the Environmental Institute for Golf found that 42 percent of 27-plus-hole golf facilities sometimes or frequently use biocontrol in their pest management practices.\nThe researchers used an ARS patent-pending process called “liquid culture fermentation” to mass-produce the fungus and turn it into clay granules, which they applied at different rates to grub-infested turf grass plots at Purdue University.\nWhen they rolled back patches of the turf, a grizzly sight awaited them. Depending on the rates applied, 50 to 70 percent of the grubs lay dead beneath the soil, covered in a fuzzy growth that confirmed the fungus had infected and killed them—typically 7 to 10 days after exposure.\nAn insecticide applied to different plots worked even faster, killing 95 percent of the grubs. However, when used in the fall, the chemical had lost some of its “punch” against larger-sized grubs compared to the fungus, which worked better with the cooler temperatures. \nThe findings, which the researchers published in a USGA annual report, could help golf course superintendents identify ways to use the fungus as part of an integrated pest management (IPM) approach, which combines judicious insecticide use with cultural, biological and other controls.\nGolfers needn’t be distracted by the prospects of this biocontrol fungus quietly working underfoot, though. Its absolute preference for infecting white grubs and other insect turf eaters means people, pets and wildlife won’t suffer the same fuzzy fate as these pests.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Agricultural Research Service\n ARS\n Science\n biocontrol\n golf\n white grubs\n turf grass\n fungus\n integrated pest management", "author": "Jan Suszkiw"},

As one of the principal statistical agencies in the U.S., the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) has been heavily involved in establishing and improving agricultural statistics systems in countries around the world since the end of World War II.\nFood insecurity, shortfalls in regional food production and lack of reliable information on the agricultural sector are major concerns in many countries. Improved agricultural systems can provide more and better information to address these issues. This is why, over the past 10 years, NASS international projects have been instrumental in helping more than 30 developing and emerging market countries in Africa, Central and South America, Asia, and Central and Eastern Europe to develop and improve their agricultural statistics programs.\nUsing our experience in conducting the census of agriculture, NASS is currently working with the Armenian National Statistics Service and the Ministry of Agriculture to conduct a full count of agriculture in Armenia. It has been 90 years since Armenia conducted its last census of agriculture. The upcoming census will also be Armenia’s first since the country gained its independence in .\nIn addition to the Armenian census of agriculture, NASS is also currently working with the governments in Georgia, Brazil, Mongolia, Nigeria and Serbia. Our agency is also gearing up to start a new project in Moldova. We work to provide all of these countries with technical assistance and training on a reimbursable basis in all aspects of statistical surveys and systems.\nThe benefits of such assistance extend beyond serving the interests of the various countries. By helping other countries improve their agricultural statistics systems, USDA’s ability to assess world food and fiber production is also improved. Establishing strong working relationships with other agricultural statisticians around the world allows NASS staff to gather and develop new ideas for improving the U.S. agricultural statistics system, while exposure to other cultures and work situations enhances our employees’ abilities to solve problems.\nFor more information on NASS’s international programs for improving agricultural statistics, please contact our International Programs Office at 202-720- or nass-ipo@nass.usda.gov.\nIraqi visitors traveled to Kansas to observe the wheat harvest\n Category/Topic:\n Trade\n Tags:\n Afria\n Armenia\n Brazil\n Central America\n Central Europe\n Eastern Europe\n food insecurity\n Georgia\n Moldova\n Mongolia\n NASS\n Nigeria\n Serbia\n South America\n World Statistics Day", "author": "Larry A.

For more information, visit: www.pewtrusts.org/SchoolFoodParentPoll. Click to enlarge.\nOver the past four years, USDA has worked closely with schools, parents, community leaders, and nutrition experts to ensure that when children go off to school, they are greeted by a healthier school environment.  According to the CDC, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years, leading to an increase in obesity-related health outcomes in children, including cardiovascular disease, pre-diabetes, and bone and joint problems.  Improving school nutrition is vital to reducing childhood obesity, because many children consume half of their daily calories during the school day. Making the healthy choice the easy choice sets our nation’s children up for a lifetime of healthy choices, and supports a healthier next generation.  Recently, we’ve seen evidence that student acceptance of healthier meals is increasing across all grade levels.  Today, we are pleased to see the results of the latest poll by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the American Heart Association, showing that most parents support the healthier meal and snack standards implemented through the Healthy, Hunger-free Kids Act of . \nRead more about the results of that study in this guest blog, from the American Heart Association.\nA majority of parents favor strong national nutrition standards for food and drink sold at schools, according to a poll released Monday by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the American Heart Association.\nIn addition, the poll found that parents would also like to see salt limited in school foods and more fruits and vegetables served.\nThe poll, which was conducted in June among 1,112 parents, said that 80 percent of the parents said they were concerned about their children’s health. Seventy-four percent said they were concerned about childhood obesity, a major risk factor for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar and cardiovascular disease later in life. Currently, more than one third of children and adolescents are clinically overweight or obese. Among children ages six to 11, obesity rates rose from 7 percent in to 18 percent in . The rates increased from 5 percent to 21 percent during that same period for youth ages 12 to 19.\nChildhood obesity has been a major national focus, with federal agencies and advocacy organizations, including the American Heart Association, working on ways to curb the trend.\nThe poll was conducted just weeks before the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued “Smart Snacks” standards on July 1, which mandated that school snacks must be a fruit, a vegetable, protein, dairy, or whole grain; have fewer than 200 calories; and be low in fat, salt, and sugar.\nThe poll revealed that support for stricter school nutrition standards cut across racial and political lines. Sixty-eight percent of whites, 85 percent of Hispanics and 91 percent of African-Americans said they support the standards.\nFifty-six percent of Republicans, 71 percent of independents and 84 percent of Democrats favored stronger standards. Only 22 percent of parents expressed that they strongly opposed higher school nutrition standards.\nAmong the poll’s other findings:\n72 percent favor national standards for school meals;\n72 percent support standards for school snacks;\n91 percent support requiring schools to include a serving of fruits or vegetables with every meal;\n75 percent think salt should be limited in meals;\n23 percent believed food sold a la carte at schools was nutritious, whereas only 8 percent believed the same of food sold in vending machines.\nPenny Kris Etherton, PhD, a professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pennsylvania, said the findings are encouraging, but parents voicing support is just the beginning.\n“Schools and parents need to be on the same page about what the kids eat,” she said. “You can’t have one set of standards at school and another set of standards at home. It’s encouraging to see that parents are supportive of higher nutritional standards, but we need to educate across the board so that parents understand what this really means for how their kids should eat.”\nReducing sweetened beverages can lower a child’s intake of “empty” calories, Kris-Etherton explained. However, some parents might believe fruit juice is healthy “when it’s really just sugar water. The child would be better off either drinking plain water or eating a piece of fruit to get the fiber and nutrients from the fruit. The challenge will be making healthy eating fun and interesting for kids.”\nThe poll was conducted by Hart Research Associates and Ferguson Research.  Pew, RWJF, and AHA are jointly supporting efforts to ensure all foods and beverages in schools are healthy.

This ritual takes place in schools all over the world. But for the children in Mali, a country ranked 160 out of 169 of the poorest countries in the world, this may be their one nutritious meal for the day. With the number of chronically hungry people surpassing one billion, a sustainable approach is necessary to answer the call of those in need. USDA’s McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program answers that call and works to not only feed the world’s hungry, but also improve the nutrition and education of children around the world.\nAt noon each day, the students line up and eagerly wait for their turn to get their plate full of rice and split peas thanks to USDA (CRS/Carmen Matty-Cervantes).\nThe McGovern-Dole Program supports education, child development and food security in low-income, food-deficit countries that are committed to universal education. It provides for donations of U.S. agricultural products, as well as financial and technical assistance for school feeding and maternal and child nutrition projects. Currently, USDA funds 36 active agreements with 17 cooperating sponsors in 28 countries, assisting more than five million beneficiaries. To date, the Program has provided meals to more than 22 million children.\nSince , Catholic Relief Services, with the help of the McGovern-Dole program, has played a large role in improving the lives of children and their families in Mali, a country with a population of more than 12.5 million. The United Nations recently reported that 10 percent of the total population was undernourished and that 38 percent of pre-school aged children are physically stunted. In light of Mali’s situation, this McGovern-Dole project has enhanced the welfare of targeted communities through improving access to food and education for children.\nBy the end of the fiscal year, the CRS/Mali program had directly impacted the lives of over 45,000 individuals in Mali. In promoting the health of students, teachers, and school cooks, more than 5 million meals, as well as vitamins and medications, were distributed among 120 schools. Nearly 2,000 members of school management committees supported by the program participated in literacy sessions and radio broadcasts about the importance of education. Through these efforts, overall school enrollment in targeted communities has increased from 26 percent to 32 percent for boys and from 39 percent to 55 percent for girls since the program began in .\nIn May , the Obama administration unveiled the Feed the Future (FTF) Initiative. The Initiative supports the international effort to increase the availability and accessibility of food and to improve nutrition and food safety. It serves as a springboard for broader economic development and food security. It also serves as a foundation for peace and opportunity in developing countries, which ensures our own national security. USDA is working with the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of State, and international organizations to help implement the Initiative.\nThe McGovern-Dole program is one way USDA leverages its resources to support Feed the Future.

However, one residential backyard, nearly 6 miles from downtown Atlanta, calls into question whether this is suburbia at all. There were swings, a tree house, and even patio furniture. Yet one feature certified this was not your mother’s suburban home: over a dozen chickens living comfortably in a custom made “Coop de Ville.”   \nThe rise of “backyard poultry” is one of many agricultural phenomena tied to a growing food consciousness and increased urbanization. And while USDA’s fundamental job doesn’t change, the Department does because the challenges do.  The recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at increasingly popular backyard chicken coops underscore this. While this concern was not clearly expressed in the Act of Congress that created the Department, the mandate was. USDA still works to “acquire and to diffuse…information” towards facilitating the protected growth of American agriculture.

(Click to enlarge)\nThis has been the year of innovation at USDA Rural Housing Service. We are working smarter, faster, more efficient and environmentally conscious than ever before.  After years of brainstorming, planning, reengineering, testing, and training, RHS has realized its vision: the Section 502 Guaranteed Single Family Home Loan Program now operates paperless, and we’re saving more than we ever imagined possible.\nUSDA’s Rural Development State field offices now transact business with private lenders via Web-based uploads and electronic signatures.  This means RHS and our private partners are no longer printing and sending hundreds of pages of paper back-and-forth every time a loan guarantee is used to help a rural American family buy their home.\nAs a result, loan guarantees are processed faster and families move into homes more quickly. Postage fees will be eliminated and huge print jobs avoided for every one of the 140,000+ home loans USDA guarantees we will make in the coming year. Initial estimates show USDA Rural Housing Service will save 37,500 reams of paper every year now that we do more business in a paperless environment.\nMore than 135,333 staff hours per year nationwide were being spent managing these paper processes. Staff will have more time to assist our customers, connect with potential partners and, of course, help more rural Americans buy their own homes through our 502 homeownership programs.\nAll of the savings in time, paper and postage adds up to some serious savings of American tax dollars. In fact, we estimate RHS will save more than $4.2 million in just one year of using the new process nationwide.  This means we can allocate more time and money into oversight initiatives that will work to ensure lender compliance, and more adequately staff other Single Family Housing Programs to better serve Rural America.\nThe people who work in the Rural Housing Service are proud of this milestone! But, as they like to remind everyone, RHS is just getting started.  Innovation projects of this sort have begun to touch every one of the Agency’s programs.

(Janie) Dunning, Missouri State Director, and Jonathan Adelstein, RUS Administrator (center), painting the Ralls County PWSD No. 1 water tower\nA three day visit to Missouri, the “Show Me State” allowed me to join Janie Dunning, Rural Development State Director, to see how rural areas benefiting from infrastructure investments made possible through USDA Rural Development programs and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) financing.\nMy trip started on Wednesday, May 18, , with a visit to Socket Telecom, LLC in Columbia, MO.   We learned of their progress on a $23.7 million Rural Utilities Recovery Act investment for high speed fiber-to-the-home broadband access to 2,700 homes, 36 critical community institutions and 270 businesses in Callaway County.  That afternoon, as a member of President Obama’s White House Business Council on “Winning the Future,” I facilitated a roundtable discussion with 20 community and business leaders of Mexico, MO, hosted by Frank Cordie of Mid America Brick. When you think of “bricks and mortar” for cementing economic development, there is no better place than in America’s heartland at a brick plant.  I gathered feedback on ways we can help businesses expand, create jobs, and improve the economic base in their area.  The roundtable was followed by a very interesting tour of the brick plant to see how the $10 million from the agency’s Business and Industry guaranteed funds was being used to bring this regional business icon back to life.\nJonathan Adelstein, RUS Administrator; Barry Hart, CEO of the Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives; Jay Nixon, Governor of Missouri; Dan Strode, President/CEO of Ralls County Electric Cooperative.\nThe next day, I joined Missouri Governor Jay Nixon for a “light up” ceremony at Ralls County Electric Cooperative (RCEC). They were celebrating the construction and hooking up the first customers of $19.1 million project, funded by USDA under the Recovery Act, to serve 4,600 households, 300 business and 58 anchor institutions in northeast Missouri.  I found most interesting is that the RCEC is reinvesting 10 percent of their earnings from the broadband investment for economic development opportunities for individuals and businesses in their service area.  This ceremony was followed by a working lunch to discuss other broadband opportunities with Damon Porter, Governor Nixon’s point-man on broadband.\nMy next stop was to Ralls County Ralls County Public Water Supply District No. 1 to visit the site of water improvements including a new 250,000 gallon water tower.  Janie and I grabbed paint brushes and assisted with painting the water tower support.  Yes, that was a first for me. That evening the Missouri state office staff hosted me in a discussion with Barry Hart, CEO of the Association of Electric Cooperatives and other electric cooperative leaders to talk about partnering strategies to assist rural Missourians.\nMy third day, included a tour of USDA funded Water and Wastewater projects in Howard County.  First stop was to a state of the art, environmentally friendly lagoon at the City of Fayette.  I was very impressed with this new technology and treatment of waste water.  One of the stages in the water treatment includes a process in a lagoon covered with a heavy duty rubberized material. I made a closer inspection of the rubberized material and verified that it was strong enough for opportunity for me to “walk on (waste) water”!  This may be a first for an Administrator.\nJonathan Adelstein, USDA Utilities Administrator, walking on (waste) water at the City of Fayette lagoon.\nThe next stop was to see another investment to the City of Fayette for improvements to their water system including the construction of a new water tower.  The last stop was for a celebration of strategies supported by President Obama and Secretary Vilsack for regionalization.  The Howard County Regional Water Commission was established as a regional water waste supply and treatment system to serve three public water systems in the southern part of Howard County including: the City of Fayette, the City of New Franklin and Howard County PWSD No. 1.\nIt was definitely a packed three days but gave me a great appreciation for the hard work that the Missouri Rural Development staff perform in administering programs and “yes” they did “Show Me” some wonderful examples of our programs benefiting rural Missourians!\n Category/Topic:\n Initiatives\n Rural\n Technology\n Tags:\n ARRA\n Broadband\n Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan\n Columbia\n Janie Dunning\n Jay Nixon\n Jonathan Adelstein\n Mexico\n Missouri\n President Obama\n Rural Development\n Rural Utilities Recovery Act investment\n Tom Vilsack\n Wastewater Treatment", "author": "Jonathan Adelstein"},

This program offers funds to states to support research and marketing projects that do things such as increasing crop yields. Photo courtesy of the U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council.\nBlueberries are often highly sought after because of their long list of health benefits and their sweet taste. Whether purchased fresh, frozen, or pureed, the blueberry has long been a staple in the diets of many people. Every July, the entire nation celebrates Blueberry Month by coming up with creative recipes and other unique ways to get their fill. Here at USDA, every month is Blueberry Month. One of the ways that we show our appreciation for our nation’s blueberry producers and processors is by creating more opportunities for people to enjoy this delicious fruit.\nIndigenous to North America, the history of blueberries can be traced all the way back to Native Americans, who added them to soups, stews, and even meats. Highbush or cultivated blueberries are grown on large bushes that are planted in rows. These blueberries are often sent to the fresh market. Lowbush or wild blueberries produce smaller sized berries and are pruned every couple of years. The majority of lowbush blueberries are processed into items like jams, jellies and baked goods.\nMy agency, the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), does its part to help more people eat these little blue dynamos.® Through our Commodity Procurement Program, we purchase frozen cultivated and wild blueberries. The purchases send this highly nutritious food to school children, families, and communities through federal food distribution programs like the National School Lunch Program.\nIn , we bought nearly $17.9 million or 11.3 million pounds of frozen wild blueberries. This provided a reliable outlet for producers in places like Maine where 98% of the nation’s wild blueberries are harvested. As a result of this purchase, states like Maine can continue to strengthen their rural economies.\nOur purchases are also making a big difference in states like New Jersey -- the birthplace of the cultivated blueberry. The state’s blueberry industry produced more than 51 million pounds that  yielded nearly $81 million in revenue in . This was by far the largest revenue generator in the Garden State’s fruit and vegetable sector that year. In , AMS helped continue this trend by buying $18.4 million or 15.4 million pounds of frozen cultivated blueberries from growers across the country.\nIn addition to our purchases, AMS supports the blueberry industry by offering grants to help it remain competitive in the marketplace. Classified as specialty crops, blueberries are eligible for grants through our Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. This program offers funds to states to support research and marketing projects that do things such as increasing crop yields. So, thanks to Specialty Crop Block Grant funds, several state agriculture departments can conduct research to mitigate the damage to its blueberry crops created by the Brown Marmorated Stinkbug and other invasive pests.\nWhether it’s July or any other part of the year, AMS is committed to supporting our nation’s blueberry producers and processors. We recommend that you add some color to your plate with some blueberries. The U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council’s website has some great recipes to get you started.\nIn , AMS purchased nearly 11.3 million pounds of frozen wild blueberries and 15.4 million pounds of frozen cultivated blueberries from growers across the country.

{"theme": "Research and Science", "content": "Recreation, Heritage and Volunteer Services, U.S. Forest Service in\n Conservation\n Forestry\n Mar 18, \nAn owl seems to plead for help after getting stuck in a vault toilet. A movement to save birds from serious injury and death garnered a Wings Across the Americas Award for the Teton Raptor Center of Jackson Hole, Wyo., and employees from several national forests. (Photo courtesy Teton Raptor Center)\nSmall owls, such as western screech and northern saw whet owls, weigh between 3 and 7 ounces, or about the same weight as a small cell phone or a deck of cards.\nThey prefer dark, narrow spaces for nesting and roosting, which is why they are called cavity birds. Their habitat preferences make them prone to using man-made features, such as open pipes, that mimic their natural nesting and roosting cavities. But on some public lands, that natural act of finding habitat in ventilation pipes has led to their death.\nThe resolution that could save thousands of birds resulted in an award from Wings Across the Americas, a program of the U.S. Forest Service and its partners to conserve birds, bats, butterflies and dragonflies across all landscapes and boundaries. The project received the Habitat Management and Partnership Award, shared with Forest Service employees and the Teton Raptor Center in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\nMany public agencies use vault toilets to manage sanitary waste on their lands, and the ventilation pipes seem to attract the birds. The small owls enter the hole at the top of the vent, fall down the vertical pipe and land in the waste holding reservoir. The small size and weight of the birds make it impossible for them to gain any lift to escape.\nIn , the Teton Raptor Center heard about the problem and decided to do something.\nRoger Smith, founder of Teton Raptor Center, said a photo of an owl peering up from the reservoir made him realize the need for “…a real, tangible conservation project that people could understand and commit to – preventing bird mortality from a man-made problem by covering the hole with a screen.”\nAs a non-profit organization with a mission focused on conservation, education and rehabilitation, the Teton Raptor Center resolved to launch a public awareness campaign:  the Port-O-Potty Owl Project. Of course, it quickly gained the nickname “Poo-Poo Project.”\nUnbeknownst to Smith was the collaboration between Gerardo Chavarria, a Forest Service regional engineer based in Denver, and Greg Hayward, an agency wildlife ecologist working in Alaska. Hayward sought out Chavarria because he wanted an engineering fix to prevent the bird deaths.\n“His concern was contagious and provided a challenge for me to investigate if there was a cost effective way to screen the toilet vent stacks without too much negative effect on air flow out of the stacks.” he said.\nChavarria used his engineering skills to design a screen that would not adversely affect the functional design of a vault toilet. In fact, his work helped to advance the quick fixes the raptor center sought on vault toilets on three national forests in Wyoming. Chavarria’s advance research determined the types of screen that would work, which allowed the raptor center and the Forest Service to immediately cap the toilet vents.\nBecause the need and resolution were already pre-determined, Forest Service employees Joe Harper of the Shoshone National Forest, Tammy Fletcher of the Caribou-Targhee National Forest and Bernadette Barthelenghi of the Bridger-Teton National Forest could more quickly answer the raptor center’s call.\nHarper brought the awareness of what happened to the birds to the forest, and all vault toilets are now screened and any new toilets and pipes also will be screened. Fletcher helped to secure grant funding to purchase screens for the Caribou-Targhee and all participating land agencies within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. And Barthelenghi made the work possible on her forest and worked to ensure the project and solution were shared with all agency offices.\nJoe Alexander, forest supervisor on the Shoshone, said they partnered with community organizations to help install the necessary screens.  Local chapters of the Audubon Society and Boy Scouts engaged on this real world problem and helped to make a difference.\n“The Shoshone National Forest prides itself on being the leader in conservation,” Alexander said. “After implementation of these new toilets it became apparent that some small efforts could go a long ways in protecting our avian resources.\nThe Wings Across the Americas awards were presented March 12 during the 79th North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference. Other award winners are:\nThe Barto Fen Restoration Project on the Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri received the first Dragonfly Conservation Award for one of the largest and most genetically diverse populations of this dragonfly.\nThe Monitoring and Conservation of Black-Backed Woodpecker in Burned Forests project received the Research Management & Partnership award. Since , several organizations, including the Pacific Southwest Regional Office of the U.S. Forest Service and the Institute for Bird Populations, worked to better integrate the habitat needs of the bird into forest management plans.\nThe Bat Cave Gating Project on the Mark Twain National Forest also received the Bat Conservation Award. The forest is home to a large gray bat maternity colony, and the project’s goal is to protect the bats by closing nearby trails and installing chute gauges and flyover gates at entrances of bat maternity caves.\nThe Migratory Shorebird Project: Connecting Communities of the Americas through Research for Conservation received the International Cooperation Award. The project looks at two species, the Western Sandpiper and the Pacific population of the Dunlin, measures their response to management actions, studies what influence population changes and educates people on the importance of wetland resources all along the Pacific Coast of the Americas.\nThe University of Minnesota Monarch Lab received the Communities in Conservation award.  For more than 20 years, the lab has linked academic research with community outreach programs associated with monarch conservation.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Alaska\n birds\n Bridger-Teton National Forest\n Colorado\n Conservation\n Forestry\n FS\n Missouri\n owls\n Shoshone National Forest\n University of Minnesota\n Wildlife\n Wings across America\n Wyoming", "author": "Kristen Nelson"},

(Photo by Kim Lanahan-Lahti, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Division of Forestry)\nFor years now, the U.S. Forest Service has been encouraging visitors to our nation’s forests and grasslands, to not only enjoy all there is out there, but to play safe and play clean.\nOne example of this outreach effort is the PlayCleanGo: Stop Invasive Species In Your Tracks campaign.\nPlayCleanGo has 130 partners, all fostering active participation in actions designed to interrupt recreational pathways of spread for invasive species. By becoming a partner, you can spread the message to stop invasive species in your tracks.\n“PlayCleanGo is designed to give outdoor recreationists a clear call to action to be informed and attentive in helping stop the spread of invasive plants and insects and improving overall forest health,” said Monica Lear, U.S. Forest Service Forest Health Protection Director. “These pests can expand like a different kind of wildfire, from forest to forest by unsuspecting visitors just looking for some fun and adventure.”\nFrom camping to fishing to hiking, getting outside and into nature is one of the many activities that our forests support. Outdoor recreation provides physical challenges, contributes greatly to the physical and mental health of individuals, provides economic benefits to communities, and has become an essential part of American culture. PlayCleanGo is helping these recreationists preserve the land they already love and enjoy.\nThrough positive messaging, the program provides simple steps people can take to avoid accidently spreading invasive species. \nThis advice includes letting visitors know to stay on designated trails, remove mud and seeds from shoes and gear, and burn only local or certified firewood. For example, garlic mustard, an aggressive plant invader of wooded areas throughout the Northeastern and Midwestern US, can form dense stands and displace native species by competing for available light, nutrients and water resources. Garlic mustard seeds stick together when damp and adhere readily to small soil clusters, making it easy for them to stick to muddy boots, pant cuffs, and animal fur. Through easy actions like inspecting hiking equipment, clothing, and pets before going out on a hiking trail and conducting the same inspection upon leaving the trail, the PlayCleanGo campaign is helping slow the spread of invasive species.\nPlayCleanGo was launched by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, in partnership with the University of Minnesota Extension, Minnesota departments of Agriculture and Transportation, and Explore Minnesota.\nCreating a new and successful awareness campaign, like Smokey Bear and his fire prevention message, depends on broad, frequent exposure to the public. For this reason, PlayCleanGo invites public and private organizations to join the effort by becoming a partner.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Forestry\n FS\n invasive species\n Minnesota\n PlayCleanGo\n Smokey Bear\n University of Minnesota", "author": "Melissa Jenkins"},

{"theme": "Research and Science", "content": "Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in\n Forestry\n Oct 24, \nBat Week graphic.\nBy the time October comes around, store shelves are stocked with Halloween candy, costumes, and decorations. Bats are often situated among this imagery, whether as silhouettes in the background or as blood-sucking monsters.\nBut bats are none of these things. They are primarily nocturnal, they make their homes in dark places, but there’s nothing scary about them.\nThat is why Bat Week, October 24-31, is a time to celebrate bats, what they contribute to our society, and to dispel the myths that cause so much misunderstanding of these gentle, intelligent creatures.\nThere are more than 1,300 species of bats worldwide, and they are diverse. Some, like Kitti’s hog-nosed bat, also known as the bumble bee bat, can be as small as your thumbnail and survives on insects. Others like the flying fox eat fruit and have earned their name due to their impressive size.\nBats like this Mexican free-tailed bat feed on insects and play an important role in pest control on agricultural crops. Photo by MerlinTuttle.org.\nThere are three species of vampire bat among those 1,300. However, they live in Mexico, Central and South America; feed primarily on large livestock; and take about an ounce of blood in a feeding. Forty-seven species of bat call the United States home.\nBats provide valuable services to us. Most feed on insects and play an important role in pest control on agricultural crops. The various species of beetles, moths, and other insects that often plague crops represent a tasty meal to a hungry bat. In fact, it is estimated that if bats were lost in North America, savings of up to $3.7 billion dollars annually would be lost due to increased pesticide requirements in agriculture. In one case, a Georgia pecan farmer was able to abandon pesticide use altogether after he built bat houses housing several thousand Mexican free-tailed bats.\nThe Forest Service is looking into the role that bats play in pest insect control on the forest as well. Many insects, like bark beetles and gypsy moths, can be devastating to forests, and as voracious insect eaters, bats have the potential to help cull their numbers.\nRecognizing the role they play, the Forest Service has long been a champion of bat conservation. Over the last decade, the fungal disease white-nose syndrome has killed more than six million bats. While Forest Service researchers seek a solution to white-nose syndrome, the agency’s land managers explore improved ways to manage bat habitat.\nWithin the 193 million acres of forests and grasslands that the agency manages, there are more than 25,000 abandoned mines that present both opportunity and hazard. Recognizing the potential of abandoned mines as ideal roosting, hibernation, or maternity sites, the Forest Service has constructed “bat gates” that provide a grating to keep visitors from stumbling into a potential hazard while allowing bats to fly freely.\nYou too can make a big difference by planting bat-friendly gardens, building bat houses, and helping dispel myths about bats.\nLittle Brown bats found in Maine with white-nose syndrome.

Just ask the employees of USDA Rural Development in Washington State who, on July 13, donated two hours of their time at the end of a hectic day to make food packages for the elderly, young mothers, infants and children at the Thurston County Food Bank located in downtown Olympia.\nAccording to Thurston County Food Bank Executive Director Robert Coit, it was opportune that the Rural Development team were packaging food for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), which is a USDA program that provides nutritious food \"packages\" designed specifically for the nutritional  needs of low-income pregnant and breastfeeding women, infants, children up to age six and elderly people 60 and older.\n\"It's a great program and helps us with our mission to eliminate hunger in Thurston County,\" Coit said, adding that the food bank serves 10,000 families annually, including 37,000 individuals, half of which are children, around the communities of Lacy, Olympia  and Tumwater.\n\"This was a great opportunity for us to help out in our local community,\" said Mario Villanueva, Washington State Director, USDA Rural Development. \"Too many Americans live in food deserts and lack access to healthy food.  USDA is a key partner in providing access to healthy food by administering the nation's nutrition programs, funding projects that provide underserved areas with greater access to fresh produce\"\n\"It was great!,\" said Becki Southworth, Multi-Family Housing Loan Specialist. \"I really feel like we were able to help our local community by not only what we do every day through housing, business and community programs, but by taking it up a level and getting out in the community, we were able to help meet another need, provide food to those that need it most.  I am so glad I was able to go and I would love to do it again.\"\n\"I had fun and it felt great to know that we helped 210 families in just an hour and a half of work of great teamwork,\" said Housing Specialist Leslie Schmidt. \"It just shows how much you can help the community with just a little bit of our time.\"\nIn addition to helping out at the local food bank (an exercise the agency plans to repeat on a regular basis), Rural Development is participating in a summer food drive as part of the 2nd Annual \"Feds, Farmers, and Friends Feed Families\" (F5) initiative.  The Washington State food drive kicked off July 6 in Olympia and other area offices and will run through July 31.\nThe food drive makes a big difference. Last summer, federal employees around the country donated more than 1 million pounds of nonperishable goods and daily essentials for those in need.\nThe new goal for across the Federal government is 1.2 million pounds of non-perishable items.\n\"We know the need is great in our area and this was a chance for our agency and federal partners to contribute to a worthwhile cause,\" said Gayle Hoskison, Olympia Area Director. \"And, I agree with our staff - it was a great team effort and felt really good to help out at the food bank.  We added another 'F' to the 'F5' effort - the 6th 'F' stands for Fun!\"\nRepresentatives from USDA Rural Development State Office Employees. \nHousing Specialist Leslie Schmidt puts together food packages as part of USDA's Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP).\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n CSFP\n Food Bank\n food drive\n Olympia", "author": "Unknown"},
{"theme": "Research and Science", "content": "Agricultural Research Service in\n Research and Science\n Oct 31, \nA wasp works its way out of an aphid mummy after developing inside as larvae. (Photo courtesy of the ARS Electron and Confocal Microscopy Unit)\nAt Halloween, people revel in ghosts, goblins, and things that go bump in the night. Not all are in books or movies, though. There are plenty of creepy critters doing downright scary things every day in your own backyard.\nThat’s not necessarily a bad thing, since many of these “monsters” are actually good guys getting the bad guys out of town; it’s just not always pleasant to watch.\nFire ants are common in subtropical Southeastern states and have shown up as far west as California. These stinging ants are not just painful pests; they’re also a bane to agriculture, feeding on young plants and seeds, causing an estimated crop loss of $750 million per year. There are many ways to control or eliminate fire ants, but nature provides one that is tailor made for the silver screen!\nEnter the phorid fly, a natural predator of the fire ant. The fly swoops in on its target and deposits an egg into the ant. After hatching inside the ant, the maggot works its way into the ant’s head, where it lives for a couple of weeks, feeding on bodily fluids. The maggot then releases chemicals that eat away at the ant’s body until its head falls off. The maggot then stays in the severed head and feeds on brains until it reaches maturity and breaks out through the ant’s mouth.\nLike zombies? You will, if you don’t like cockroaches. The jewel wasp injects a serum into its victim, which “zombifies” the roach into submitting to its will. The passive zombie roach allows the wasp to lead it by an antenna into a nest, which quickly becomes a nursery after the wasp lays its egg. As with the phorid fly larvae, it feeds off its host until it reaches maturity.\nMummies also abound in gardens and fields, courtesy of a pair of wasps. These wasps (Aphidiinae braconid wasps – pictured – and Pteromalid chaclid wasps) also deposit an egg inside the body of their prey, this time an aphid. The wasp larvae grow inside the aphid, which soon becomes mummified in that it turns inflated, rigid, and off-color. After the larva becomes an adult wasp, it chews its way out, leaving the mummy husk behind.\n“Husks are fun to collect and are routinely encountered in gardens,” said Matt Buffington, a research scientist with the Agricultural Research Service’s Systematic Entomology Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. “In fact, if you have them, it’s a good sign your aphid problems are being somewhat controlled.”\nAphids are a scourge to crops and horticulture, where they suck on sap, which causes yellowing, stunting, distortion of plant parts, leaf mold, and, in cotton, poor fiber quality. Aphids can also transmit plant viruses.\nNot to be outdone, some bees (Trigona hypogea) make an appearance as scavenger vampires.\n“Instead of providing their young with protein from pollen, vampire bees gather protein from carcasses on the forest floor,” Buffington said. “Further, they have unique jaws for tearing into dead animal flesh and cutting it into pieces for transport and digestion.”\nThere are plenty of other examples of insects that exemplify Halloween, but one of the spookiest is actually a mammal – the humble bat. If you can get past the vampire nature of some bats, you’ll find that many species of bats are great friends of plants; they pollinate, spread seeds, and feed on pesky bugs.\nSo, on All Hallows’ Eve, as you’re greeting young ghosts and goblins doing their rounds of trick-or-treating, don’t forget about those beneficial creepy critters in your own backyard.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Agricultural Research Service\n ARS\n Halloween\n nature\n fire ants\n aphids\n wasps\n Bees", "author": "Scott Elliott"},

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\nWhen people think about keeping our homeland safe, they don’t usually think about animal diseases that threaten our nation’s economy and food supply, but USDA scientists do. Years of dedicated research on foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is paying off.\nA team of USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists and their U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) collaborators received the DHS Secretary's Exceptional Service Gold Medal Award at a recent ceremony in Washington, D.C. The award recognizes outstanding leadership or service distinguished by achievements of national or international significance that improves our homeland security. The team successfully developed and licensed the world’s first molecular FMD vaccine for cattle—the most significant scientific accomplishment in FMD vaccine development in the past ates.\nResearch leading to this award was initiated by retired scientist Marvin Grubman while working at ARS’ Foreign Animal Disease Research Unit (FADRU) at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in Orient Point, New York. Grubman created a novel FMD vaccine, which was used as the foundation for this work.\nARS scientists receiving the award were Luis Rodriguez and Teresa de los Santos at FADRU, and Laszlo Zsak at ARS’ Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory in Athens, Georgia. Other FMD team recipients were Lawrence Barrett, Jeffrey Babcock, Michelle Colby, John Neilan, Michael Santillo and Christopher Schutta, with DHS’ Science and Technology Directorate at Plum Island; and Lavanya Ratnam and Robert Webb, with the Office of General Counsel in Washington, D.C.\nFMD is a highly contagious disease that affects cattle, swine and other cloven-hoofed animals. Infection can lead to critical economic consequences with potential severe losses in producing and marketing meat and milk.  Although the United States has not had an FMD outbreak since , the disease is still considered a serious threat to our nation's economy and food supply.\n“This award is an achievement for all of us in ARS and emphasizes the importance of the work we do every day,” said Rodriguez, FADRU research leader. “Our FMD research is part of our mission, but also part of our homeland security.

Migrating mallards can cover 800 miles in 8 hours if helped by 50 mile per hour tail winds.\nWe know you’ve heard it before: seasonal migratory patterns bring an increased risk of disease-carrying birds interacting with commercial or backyard poultry. But the health and safety of our U.S. poultry flock is important enough to make it worth repeating. Birds, particularly waterfowl like ducks and geese, can carry avian influenza without showing any symptoms or signs of disease. Because the risk of introduction never goes away, having strong biosecurity practices on poultry operations can help prevent the spread of infectious disease before it starts. The - U.S. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreak is never far from my mind. It forced us to reevaluate our preparedness and response capabilities, from a federal, state, and industry standpoint. Today, we are all better prepared to handle and quickly respond to avian influenza detections.\nOur Wild Bird Surveillance Program, which has been in place for more than a decade, is on-going. Since July , USDA and our partners have collected more than 90,ates. This improves our ability to detect these viruses and helps poultry producers and others make informed management decisions. The program also gives us a chance to learn more about the virus, including the make-up and transmission of various virus strains.\nWe’ve taken these experiences and lessons learned from the -15 outbreak and developed Defend the Flock, an outreach program that offers commercial poultry growers important information to help put the best biosecurity practices into place. Defend the Flock provides multiple resources for poultry growers, including guidance on biosecurity basics, an assessment tool to help strengthen their biosecurity programs, and sharable materials to help everyone at their operations better understand biosecurity’s importance.\nStay up-to-date on the latest biosecurity information by following on Twitter.\nEveryone who has poultry in their care can help defend the U.S. poultry industry by reviewing the following biosecurity basics. Together, we have made great strides in our preparedness and response capabilities. Protecting American poultry remains a top USDA priority. Biosecurity can stop the disease before it stops.

Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service photo by Porter Libby.\nDubbed “Bat Blitz,” the 5-day event was hosted by the Florida Bat Working Group, which partnered with the U.S. Forest Service, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the University of Florida\n“We’re mapping locations where each species was captured to learn more about the types of forest and water bodies that each species is associated with here in the Panhandle,” said Assistant Professor Holly Ober of the University of Florida Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation. “We'll also study the bat guano to determine which insects each bat species is feeding on.”\nBat testing to date has confirmed a very low probability of local bats being affected by white-nose syndrome, a condition linked to the deaths of more than a million hibernating bats from New Hampshire to Tennessee.\nAccording to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the cause of the bat deaths remains unknown despite the continuing search to find the source of this condition by numerous laboratories and state and federal biologists.\nEach night, 12 teams of five biologists spread out across the forest and surveyed bats in places where they were expected to be feeding.\n“Because bats are active at night, few people see them, and even fewer understand or appreciate their importance in our daily lives,” said Micah Thorning, wildlife biologist for the U.S. Forest Service. “For example, as the primary consumers of flying insects, bats play a crucial role in insect control.”\nThe survey netted 246 bats of eight different species with the number of bats caught at one site totaling 57. The most widespread species caught were the Seminole Bat, Evening Bat, Red Bat and Southeastern Bat, but rarer species such as the Tricolored Bat, Big Brown Bat, Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat, and Brazilian Free-tailed Bat were also captured and tested.\nThe event started in with the Southeastern Bat Diversity Network (SBDN) selecting Tennessee to host the first Bat Blitz. SBDN promotes, facilitates and organizes the event every year.\nThe Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat is one of two of its kind caught on found on the Apalachicola National Forest during Bat Blitz, May 22, . The Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat is listed as a sensitive species and is a rare find on the National Forests of Florida. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service photo by Porter Libby.\n“Planning a Bat Blitz takes a lot of time and effort -- most states begin planning one and a half to two years in advance,” said Ober. “We began a bit late, so we have been working feverishly for the past eight months.”\nOber credited their success to the dedication of a core group of individuals from the Florida Bat Working Group, an organization of local, state and federal agencies and private partners.\nVisit this link for more bat facts and information.\nThe Forest Service also partners with BatsLIVE!

And in , the Choctaw Nation was awarded the Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award, the highest recognition of support of employees who serve in the National Guard and Reserve.  So while the Choctaw Nation has shown outstanding compassion for the nation and its tribal members, the local economies of Choctaw communities have suffered tremendously.  Of the five counties on tribal lands that will be served by PTC, all of them are plagued with unemployment rates that soar above the state average and a substantial proportion of residents living below the poverty line.\nPTC spent years testing broadband technologies that would offer reliable internet service to residents of this remote region, and they determined that advanced 3G technology presents the most viable solution. The system is designed to be scalable and to cost-effectively accommodate technology upgrades, so that it will remain viable for years to come.\nPTC’s system will offer service to nearly 5,000 households, 10 school districts, and 12 volunteer fire departments and ambulance services. With reliable, high speed wireless access, the region will be able to overcome their geographic isolation to stimulate the sustainable economic growth that it needs.  And offering quality internet access to key community institutions, like schools and public safety bodies, will mean better educational opportunities and enhanced health care and public safety for residents of this region.\nAnd in addition to the many benefits to be reaped by members of the Choctaw Nation, this Recovery Act project will also create more than 150 jobs over the multi-year construction period.\nWith assistance from Oklahoma USDA Public Information Coordinator Kathleen James.\nA Pine Telephone Company broadband site in Oklahoma.

Photo courtesy Alameda County Community Food Bank\nWith FSMIP funding, the Ohio Direct Marketing Team led by Ohio State University used surveys and case studies to evaluate the current marketing strategies and practices of Ohio food producers.  The goal was to determine if and how a web-based marketing system called MarketMaker improved the effectiveness of their marketing efforts.  MarketMaker is currently one of the most extensive collections of searchable food industry related in the country and contains over 400,000 profiles of farmers and other food related enterprises in 19 states and the District of Columbia.\nThis investment continues to benefit Ohio food producers in numerous ways.  The FSMIP study was the first step in developing standardized protocols to evaluate the contribution of marketing tools on reducing transaction costs and leveling the playing field for local food enterprises on a national level. As a result, the Ohio Direct Marketing Team attracted additional funding to develop training modules such as MarketReady to prepare producers to enter new markets.  They also held “Meet the Buyers” forums to bring buyers and sellers together for targeted sales meetings, and developed maps, apps & mobile media marketing tools to help consumers find producers.\nIn , the number of registered producers and users of Ohio MarketMaker increased significantly.  There were more than 5,000 visitors and 679 registered producers by the end of the year.  In , Ohio was one of two states recognized with the first National Food MarketMaker Innovation Awards, sponsored by Farm Credit.  Building on strong food industry partnerships, the “Get Connected” campaign engaged new organizations through customized promotional and educational materials. As a result, the number of registered MarketMaker users nearly doubled from to . The creation of “Get Connected” artwork and marketing resources will benefit the entire national MarketMaker network of states.\nThere are many other tales of innovative and collaborative FSMIP projects, and this year’s projects are no different.  More than half of the 22 projects focus on increasing sales of meat products, aquaculture products, and fresh and processed produce in local and regional food systems. Other research topics include forestry, bioenergy and horticulture.\nI’m sure that over the next few years—as these great ideas continue to build and have a positive impact on American agriculture—we’ll have even more success stories to share.\nYou can view a full list of this year’s awards online.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n AMS\n California\n Federal State Marketing Improvement Program\n FSMIP\n Grants\n innovation\n Ohio", "author": "Janise Zygmont"},

Photo courtesy of Nick Richter.\nHabitat conservation practices make a difference for lesser prairie-chickens. That's the finding of a recent scientific study – the first part of a multi-year study – described in a new report from the Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiative (LPCI).\nLPCI, led by USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), works with partner organizations and ranchers to improve habitat and address threats to the bird. Since , more than 1 million acres of habitat have been restored on working lands.\nNRCS works with partners to monitor the outcomes, which helps determine if conservation practices are making a difference, but accurately estimating wildlife populations can be challenging with uncommon, widely dispersed species like the lesser prairie-chicken.\nA recent study identified a new model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, and it shows encouraging evidence that NRCS-recommended conservation practices through LPCI are working and that large blocks of intact prairie are important to prairie-chicken conservation.\nThe study assessed one year of from the annual aerial survey of lesser prairie-chicken lek sites conducted by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and it looked at four factors that might impact site occupancy — patch size of native vegetation, percent of land cover managed with prescribed grazing; percent of land cover enrolled in USDA’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); and density of primary roads. The research team intends to continue with a multi-year study that assesses additional variables.\nAs the amount of land enrolled in CRP or using prescribed grazing increases, the likelihood that lesser prairie-chickens will occupy that land also increases.\nLesser prairie-chickens face many threats, including habitat loss and fragmentation from row-crop agriculture, fire suppression, unmanaged grazing, development, and drought. The species currently occupies just 16 percent of its historic range.\nBut in western Kansas, lesser prairie-chickens have reoccupied portions of their historical range and have even moved into areas outside that historical range. The range expansion coincides with former croplands enrolled and maintained as grasslands through CRP as well as native grasslands managed using LPCI prescribed grazing practices.\nA team of researchers tested whether there was a quantifiable link between land where ranchers are implementing LPCI prescribed grazing plans or have enrolled their land in CRP and the likelihood of prairie-chickens occupying a landscape. Their results indicate that these habitat conservation efforts are working.\nAfter developing an expanded model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, the team found that occupancy increases as prairie patch-size increases, as well as in landscapes with ongoing conservation practices. Specifically, the results indicate that when ranchers are using prescribed grazing or enrolling land in CRP, the likelihood of lesser prairie-chickens occupying that habitat increases significantly.\nThe report’s management recommendations include:\nEnrolling acreage within the lesser prairie-chicken active range in prescribed grazing or CRP.\nMaintaining large blocks of native prairie across the range through sustainable ranching.\nIdentifying potential landscapes with willing landowners to develop conservation easements, particularly if combined with prescribed grazing and other proven habitat conservation practices.\nImplementing prescribed grazing on dispersed patches throughout large blocks of rangeland.\nCultivating diverse stands of CRP-enrolled grasslands that serve as connective tissue to larger patches of native prairie.\nRetaining CRP acreage as grasslands after contract expiration.\nNRCS outlined its three-year conservation strategy for lesser prairie-chicken conservation, which encourages adoption of many of the above recommendations on 500,000 additional acres, such as prescribed grazing, using easements to protect key habitat corridors, and providing assistance to convert expiring CRP lands to grazing.\nLearn more about these findings by downloading this new report.

Photo by Jesse Bussard.\nThis past April, we woke up at 3 a.m. and made our way to a blind amid an expanse of sagebrush on a ranch in central Montana. When the sun rose that morning, I saw my first sage grouse--actually, I got to see more than 100 of them!--when the birds arrived at the lek site for their famous tail-shaking springtime courtship dance.\nSeeing sage grouse in action reminded me how important it is to do what we do here at USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). I saw firsthand how agriculture and wildlife can co-exist and thrive. In the West, we work with over 1,300 ranchers through the NRCS-led Sage Grouse Initiative (SGI) to improve their ranching operations while also helping this iconic bird.\nIt’s been a big year for sage grouse. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) determined last year that the species didn’t merit protections under the Endangered Species Act because of the collaborative conservation efforts underway to help the species. Central to that effort were ranchers, who have stepped forward for many years to make a difference.\nBut last year’s decision did not mean we slowed down our conservation work through SGI. We’re here for the long haul, building on previous successes by implementing our Sage Grouse Initiative 2.rategy, which will conserve an estimated 8 million acres of sagebrush—along with 350+ species that depend on it--by .\nSage grouse are an “umbrella species” and an icon of the Western range. When ranchers implement conservation practices that benefit sage grouse, those practices also benefit 350-plus sagebrush-dependent species. Photo by Tatiana Gettelman.\nWith the help of conservation partners, NRCS has conserved 5 million acres of sagebrush rangeland and reduced threats to sage grouse. In the past six years, SGI and ranchers have:\nReduced the threat of invasive grasses and wildfire by managing for healthier rangelands on 1.8 million acres.\nRemoved 457,000 acres of expanding conifer to reclaim core sage grouse habitat.\nProtected 451,000 acres of agricultural land and prime wildlife habitat for 350-plus sagebrush-dependent species.\nImproved grazing strategies to enhance range habitat on more than 2.7 million acres for sage grouse and other wildlife species.\nConserved 12,000 acres and improved 179 acres of wet meadow and riparian areas for brooding hens.\nMarked or moved 628 miles of high-risk fences to reduce sage grouse collisions by 83 percent.\nWe continue to fine-tune our conservation efforts through science and research. In the past year, we’ve documented how removing encroaching juniper to restore sagebrush benefits songbirds as well as sage grouse. We’ve also studied how and where to reduce the risk of converting sagebrush into cultivated cropland, which we made available on the new SGI Interactive Web Application. This new online mapping tool provides free on rangewide conditions, helping NRCS conservationists and partners plan and prioritize conservation projects.\nPlus, we now use our successful efforts in sagebrush country as a model for the rest of the country. We are applying what we’ve learned to other priority species and landscapes to replicate success through Working Lands for Wildlife (WLFW). The future of wildlife, agriculture and rural ways of life depend on this shining model of collaborative conservation.\nSGI uses science, research and tools to improve and fine-tune conservation efforts.

A recent study indicates that over half a million of Detroit’s residents live in neighborhoods where they must travel twice as far to reach a grocery store than they do to reach a convenience store. As a result, many families are forced to buy their meals at these convenience stores, where microwavable pre-prepared meals and fast food are well-stocked, and fresh and healthy foods are often hard to find. Detroit, in other words, is a food desert.\nBut, there is good news! Eastern Market Corporation, one of the nation’s longest operating public markets has taken on the challenge of addressing Detroit’s significant food access issues. Eastern Market has developed a comprehensive “food hub,”  coordinating aggregation and distribution for many of Michigan’s small and mid-size farmers who are producing the healthy food that Motor City residents need and want.  With nearly 500,000 of Wayne County’s 1.9 million residents relying on SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) for their food purchases, the market director knew that it was important to ensure that his organization could process SNAP benefits. Today, Eastern Market processes up to $30,000 of SNAP transactions per month.  What’s more, SNAP benefits redeemed at Eastern Market are doubled for each participating household with the support of the Fair Food Network, an organization that provides a financial match to SNAP redemptions through its Double Up Food Bucks program.\nAs part of the USDA’s interest in examining  how actively coordinated food hubs can play an important role in eradicating food deserts, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service has partnered with Eastern Market through a cooperative research agreement to expand the availability of fresh, healthful  and locally-produced food throughout Detroit.  Our to-do list includes:\nDeveloping more direct-to-consumer marketing activities in neighborhoods challenged by poor public transportation systems;\nTraining farm vendors  about emerging opportunities for direct-to-consumer sales in food desert neighborhoods;\nFacilitating deliveries between the region’s local growers and organizations who are dedicated to distributing fresh, healthful food directly to Detroit’s neighborhoods in need; and,\nEducating local residents about available nutrition assistance programs and emerging market outlets.\nAs a food hub, Eastern Market is uniquely positioned to serve all people in Detroit while economic benefits to local farmers, ranchers, and dairies.  Eastern Market and its member tenants provide a bevy of wholesale services that open new markets for the region’s small and midsize producers—including aggregation, distribution, processing and commercial market opportunities.  Eastern Market also houses prepared food businesses (like ravioli and fresh salsa).  They’re even planning to redevelop a full square mile in a dedicated economic development district to bring in additional business incubators, restaurants, retailers, wholesale services and a distribution center – all designed to help rebuild southeast Michigan’s regional food system and eliminate Detroit’s food access problems.\nBy integrating all of these diverse business functions into one centralized, coordinated regional “food hub,” Eastern Market’s business development model can be expected to bring good things to Detroit.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n Detroit\n Double Up Food Bucks\n Fair Food Network\n Food Hub\n KYF2\n Michigan\n SNAP\n Wayne County", "author": "Debbie Tropp"},

Here are a few reasons to get started today:\n Feed the soil without using chemical fertilizers.\n Keep food waste out of the landfills and prevent greenhouse gas emissions.\n Conserve water by building healthy soils.\nGet Started\nThere are different ways to get started composting today. You can start a backyard composting bin or use worms to do the work.\nBackyard composting in three easy steps:\n Choose a location. A good site is dry in either the sun or partial shade.\n Set-up your compost bin. Purchase a compost bin or create an inexpensive bin with wire mesh and 3-4 poles for support.\n Get composting. Include 2-3 parts “brown material” (fall leaves, twigs, shredded newspaper, straw, wood chips, and shredded wood) and 1 part “green material” (vegetable and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, crushed eggshells, garden and grass clippings, tea bags without staples) by volume then add water to keep moist. Don’t forget to turn your pile! A monthly rotation is a good rule of thumb.\nWorm Composting Setup:\n Select Container. Purchase a worm bin or make your own from a plastic or wood storage container. Worm bins require holes drilled for aeration and drainage. There are several online sources with instructions to create a worm bin.\n Locate bin. The ideal temperature for worm composting is 59-77 degrees F. The bin can be kept indoors or outdoors in the shade. During colder months, insulate the worm bin with blankets, straw, or other material to keep it warm.\n Worm Bin Setup:\n Worms need bedding such as a mixture of non-glossy paper, cardboard, or leaves. Soak the material for 10 minutes, wring out the water so it is moist but not saturated, and place it in the bin with a handful of soil.\n Now you are ready to add your worms. There are over 9,000 species of earthworms, but only 7 are suitable for vermicomposting. The most widely used species is the “red wiggler” which you can buy from a worm grower.

Recently I had the privilege to attend the Pottawatomie County Farmers Market five-year anniversary in Shawnee, OK. Having grown up in a very rural town, representing FNS was a learning experience that reminded me of home. The event was a total success, as the market was full of people including farmers, seniors, families and children. Celebrating five years of service, the event included live music, family and children’s activities, and most important of all: fresh fruit and vegetables.\nI learned that famers drive hours to sell their crops at the market, and it accounts for as much as over two-thirds of their income. Most farmers market customers swear by the produce bought there, as it is much fresher and lasts longer than normal store-bought produce. In some cases, supermarket produce makes a week-long journey of over 1,500 miles before getting into the kitchen. But the most important part was seeing FNS programs like WIC and SNAP EBT represented.

{"theme": "Research and Science", "content": "Cover Crops\nCover crops are traditionally planted on farms but can be used in gardens. A cover crop is any crop grown to cover the soil and may be incorporated into the soil later for enrichment. Planting cover crops in your garden provides multiple benefits such as controlling erosion, suppressing weeds, reducing soil compaction, increasing moisture and nutrient content of soil, improving yield potential, attracting pollinators, and providing habitat for beneficial insects and wildlife as well as food to animals.\nCover crops (grasses, legumes and forbs) recommended for seasonal cover and other conservation purposes include annual ryegrass, oilseed radish, winter cereal rye, and oats used for scavenging unused fertilizer and releasing nutrients back into the soil for the next crop to use. Good cover crops to break up compacted soils are forage radish (also known as oilseed radish) and forage turnip. Similar to commercial nitrogen (N) fertilizers, legume cover crops like crimson clover, hairy vetch and Austrian winter pea can help “grow” some of your N needs.\nCrop Rotation\nIt has long been a common practice for farmers to vary the crops grown in each field from year to year. This same practice of rotating crops can be applied to small-scale food gardens.\nMake a plan to grow certain plant families in one area of the garden this season and in a different area next season.\nFor crop rotation to be most effective, don’t plant an area with vegetables from the same plant family more than once every three to four years.\nRotating crops can have important production benefits such as increasing yields, improving nutrients and organic matter in the soil, and it can help disrupt the lifecycle of crop pests, reducing chemical use. Don’t forget to add a cover crop to your rotation –especially when the garden is fallow –to reduce soil erosion and improve wildlife habitat.\nLearn more\n Using Crop Rotation in the Home Vegetable Garden – University of Wisconsin Extension\n Rotating Vegetables by Family – Cornell Cooperative Extension", "author": "Unknown"},

Home canning held an important role in 20th century food preservation, particularly through the two World Wars, and continues to be practiced today.\n“How Did We Can?” highlights changes in home canning based on a growing understanding of bacteriology. Around the turn of the 20th century, the four most prominent canning techniques were oven, open-kettle, water bath, and pressure canning. By the end of World War II, the USDA recommended only two techniques: water bath for high-acid foods and pressure canning for low-acid foods. Those recommendations remain the same under the current USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning.\nDuring World War I and World War II, canning was touted as being imperative to the war effort on the home front and was referred to as “a real war job” in a Office of War Information poster. Home canning peaked during World War II when over four billion cans were processed in .

Sampson shoe factory.\nAt church, Lue met Fannie Burlingame, the daughter of a wealthy farmer and merchant.  She immediately recognized his desire to learn and his natural talent with plants.   He eventually came to live with her family and they helped him become an American citizen in .\nAlong with his green thumb, Lue had a knack for storytelling and a way with animals.  While his personality and desire to learn were larger than life, his body was frail and at some point in his youth he became very ill, possibly with tuberculosis.  His condition was made worse by the cold New England climate, so Fannie suggested he move to DeLand, Florida, where she and her sister owned a house and orchard. Working with William Dumville, Fannie’s brother-in-law, Lue planted orange trees and other fruits, immersing himself in the world of horticulture.\nIn the winter of -95, Florida saw some of the worst freezes in recorded history.  Almost all of the citrus groves were lost—including the ones worked by Lue and Dumville.  Lue’s experiments in cross-pollination became focused on producing fruits that were more tolerant of cold weather.\nFannie passed away in , leaving Lue the house and property in DeLand.  Devastated by the loss of “Mother Fannie,” Lue became a bit of an eccentric fixture in the small Florida community.  His pet rooster, March, and two horses named Baby and Fannie were his main companions, but his work with plant varieties continued.\nIn , he was recognized for successfully cross-pollinated a “Hart’s Late” Valencia orange with a “Mediterranean Sweet” to produce a new orange named the “Lue Gim Gong.”  This sweet new variation, later found to be a nucellar seedling of the Valencia, ripened in the early fall and was much more resistant to the cold.  It is sold under the Valencia name today.\nHis achievement won the Silver Wilder Medal, awarded by the American Pomological Society—the first such award for a citrus fruit.\nLue also developed an apple that ripened a month earlier than other varieties, tomatoes that grew in clusters, and a peach that would ripen in late November.  His continued efforts with citrus plants also produced varieties of grapefruits that grew singularly (instead of in clumps), a cold-tolerant grapefruit that was slower to drop and a “perfumed” variety that had a heavy fragrance.\nLue’s conviction to do lasting good changed the Florida citrus industry and broadened the seasonal range for many orchard-grown trees.  While his life was lived simply and mostly outside of the limelight, he certainly did his best to create something good for the generations of farmers that came after him.\nUSDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), celebrates the life of Lue Gim Gong and spirit of the words he lived by.  From our programs that support farmers and ranchers of all sizes to our role in bringing food to U.S. troops, we strive to do good for those around us and those who will come after us.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n AMS\n Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month\n citrus\n Florida\n Lue Gim Gong", "author": "David R.

{"theme": "Research and Science", "content": "Public Affairs Specialist, APHIS in\n Animals\n Plants\n Apr 16, \nDelicious citrus: Scott Bauer, USDA Agricultural Research Service\nIt’s time to grab those gloves and get outside for some gardening!  April is not only a great time to plant citrus trees, but it’s also Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month. Before wielding that shovel, take a few minutes to learn how to keep your trees healthy and prevent the spread of citrus disease.\nCitrus greening disease, also known as Huanglongbing (HLB), is one of the most severe plant diseases in the world. The disease has devastated millions of citrus trees in the United States and now has the potential to eliminate the citrus industry.  Once a tree is infected with the disease, there is no known cure.\nCitrus greening is spread by a bug the size of the head of a pin—the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP). When the bug feeds on an infected tree, it becomes a carrier, spreading the disease from one tree to another.  Although the disease is not harmful to humans, fruit from infected trees are not suitable for consumption because of their green color, misshapen appearance and bitter taste.\nHere are four tips to help get you started with citrus while preventing the spread of citrus greening disease:\n1. Be Aware of Quarantines. If you are thinking about buying a citrus plant, be sure not to move it from quarantined states or territories. Not only are you risking spreading citrus diseases by transporting citrus outside of these areas, but it's also against the law. Review the quarantine map at SaveOurCitrus.org.\n2. Check the Citrus Plant Supplier. Be a savvy buyer. Citrus plants sold in a regulated state must be sold from a certified vendor and be properly labeled. \n3. Keep Homegrown Citrus at Home. Help reduce the spread of citrus diseases by not moving your homegrown citrus fruit or plants from quarantine areas.\n4. Inspect Citrus Plants Regularly for Diseases and Insects. Visit our symptom checklist and corresponding photos to identify a plant impacted by ACP, citrus greening, citrus canker, citrus black spot and sweet orange scab. If you detect an infected plant, report it immediately.\nIf you suspect your citrus may be diseased, report it immediately to the USDA.  The USDA’s Save Our Citrus iPhone App offers a convenient way for people to identify and report suspected citrus disease. This free app is available for download from the iTunes store.   To learn more about the Save Our Citrus program, visit www.saveourcitrus.org or follow the program on Facebook and Twitter.\nUSDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has declared April as Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month. Throughout the month, APHIS is posting a series of blog entries here and also share invasive plant pest and disease information through our twitter feed. APHIS and its federal and state partners are fighting to protect our communities, our public lands, and our agricultural resources from invasive species. But we can’t do it alone.

While the issues have been challenging, Goodwin views the exercise as an opportunity for the Forest Service to strengthen relationships with its tribal partners.\n“My experiences with the (California Highway Patrol) got me into situations that were very stressful or difficult, where I had to look at all the possibilities on how these things could be resolved,” said Goodwin.\nAlong with his experience with the highway patrol, Goodwin, who is an enrolled member of the Karuk Tribe part Karuk, was elected to the Karuk Tribal Council and served two four-year terms. Despite his tribal connection and experience, he was uncertain about applying for the position with the Forest Service because he wondered whether he could serve the needs of both the agency and the Tribes. But after careful consideration, he determined that his unique experience brings an understanding that would be valuable for both parties.\nGoodwin says he is particularly interested in protecting natural resources and developing stewardship opportunities for all tribes across the state.\n“Bob has first-hand experience from the tribal side which gives him a leg up in the job,” said Leaf Hillman, director of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy for the Karuk Tribe.  “He handles tough situations calmly and doesn’t get rattled.”\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n California\n Forestry\n FS\n Inyo National Forest\n Native Americans\n OTR\n Sequoia National Forest\n Sierra National Forest\n Tribal", "author": "John C.

Take southwestern ponderosa pine, for example. Where thick grasses once waved under big orange-barked pines, thickets of spindly trees now threaten natural and human communities alike through outbreaks of insects and disease, followed by devastating fires.\nNow people are joining together around common conservation goals to restore landscapes like these. The U.S. Forest Service is working with partners to restore healthy watersheds capable of delivering all the values and benefits that Americans want and need. The goal is to restore landscapes that future generations will describe with the same awe inspired in the first European visitors.\nIn Arizona, environmentalists, local officials, and others have coalesced behind a Forest Service initiative to furnish small-diameter materials from four overgrown national forests to local mills and bioenergy facilities. “I’m hoping to look back on this day as the official end of the forest wars,” said Todd Schulke of the Center for Biological Diversity.\nThe time is right for a restoration economy. The Forest Service is tailoring its programs and projects to a new management environment associated with climate change, demographic growth, and other large-scale drivers of landscape changes that are undermining the health of America’s forests and grasslands. Restoration treatments are based on collaboration with stakeholders to achieve mutual goals across entire landscapes, leading to more jobs and a better future for forest-based communities hard hit by recession.\nA restoration economy will take time to develop. It will take years to establish confidence and mutual goodwill, overcoming lingering doubts and festering fears and suspicions. In time, however, Americans can unite to achieve their mutual restoration goals through landscape-scale conservation. Joining together, we can link ecological restoration to jobs and economic opportunities for communities across the nation, for the sake of generations to come.\n Category/Topic:\n USDA Results\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Forestry\n FS\n jobs\n restoration\n Tom Tidwell", "author": "Tom Tidwell"},

Photo courtesy of 4-H.\nNational 4-H Week happens each October, a time when nearly six million youth celebrate their participation in 4-H.  Every year, clubs around the country showcase the great things that 4-H offers young people and highlight the incredible things they do to make a positive impact in their communities.\nThe 4-H clover is one of the most recognized in the country, but it wasn’t always that way.  Like most things, it grew – this case from three leaves.\nThe seeds of 4-H were planted at the start of the 20th century by several adults in different states who were concerned about young people. Clark County, Ohio, claims credit as being the birthplace of 4-H, although the initial groups were called “The Tomato Club” or the “Corn Club.”\nThe times were ripe for a new youth innovation like 4-H. During the late s, public universities’ researchers saw that adults in the farming communities did not readily accept the new agricultural discoveries being developed on campuses, such as hybrid seed corn, milk sanitation and home canning procedures. However, they found that young people were open to new thinking. Rural youth programs became an innovative way to introduce new agricultural technology to their communities.\nIn , Iowa school superintendents Jessie Field Shambaugh and O.H. Benson developed a 3-leaf clover pin with an “H” on each leaf to signify “head,” “heart,” and “hands.” In a meeting, club leaders approved the design of a 4-leaf clover with an H on each leaf, adding “health.” By , the groups were becoming known as 4-H clubs.\nCongress passed the Smith-Lever Act in , creating the Cooperative Extension System at USDA, which included work of various boys' and girls' clubs involved with agriculture, home economics and related subjects. This action effectively nationalized the 4-H program. Between and , clubs were formed at some historically black land-grant colleges in Southern states opening up 4-H to more African-American youth.\nAs 4-H grew, its focus moved beyond the translation of science to include personal growth so that youth could gain skills to help them transition to adulthood in a contributing, productive and self-directed manner.\nWith its national headquarters located within USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), today 4-H serves nearly 6 million youth in rural, urban and suburban communities in every state and many U.S. military installations around the world.\nToday’s 4-H’ers tackle the nation's top issues, from global food security, climate change and sustainable energy to childhood obesity and food safety. To improve the nation's ability to compete in key scientific fields and take on the leading challenges of the 21st century, 4-H programs offer a wide variety of science, engineering, technology and applied math educational opportunities, including agricultural sciences, rocketry, robotics, environmental protection and computer science.

Photo by Carlos Harris\nThere is no one-size-fits-all approach to career development and, according to one of the nation’s new leaders in agriculture, the course one steers toward a profession in agriculture can be as varied and diverse as the population itself.\n“I’m not a big fan of the term ‘pipeline’ because it implies that there is only one way in and only one direction you can go,” said Dr. Victoria LeBeaux, a national program leader (NPL) with USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).  “If that were true I certainly wouldn’t be here, since I had no intention of studying agriculture.”\nAs an undergraduate, she studied economics with the goal of working in international development. Prior to starting her doctorate in sustainable agriculture, LeBeaux lived in rural areas in France and Austria and volunteered in Mexico.  Iowa State University ultimately recruited her to complete doctoral training in a three-year NIFA-funded National Needs Fellowship (NNF) program.\nNNF trains students for masters and doctoral degrees. In some cases it also provides additional post-doctoral training for the Fellows.  For LeBeaux, that additional training meant a six-month stint in Guatemala where she examined how technical assistance providers helped enhance regional food security by advancing sustainable agriculture practices.\nLeBeaux returned to NIFA in after completing her Ph.D. and subsequent postdoctoral studies, and became an NPL in NIFA’s Division of Community and Education.  In that role she manages about $10 million in federal funding that supports secondary and postsecondary research, education and extension in the food, agricultural, and human sciences. These programs include the Educational Literacy Initiative’s Research and Extension for Undergraduates (REEU) fellowships program.  REEU provides experiential learning opportunities for underrepresented and first-generation college students. In addition, she uses her scientific training to represent NIFA in federal initiatives like USDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food, which helps coordinate USDA programs to strengthen local and regional food networks nationwide.\n“I sincerely appreciate the opportunities provided though the NNF program,” she said.  “As with many other young people, pursuing doctoral education was not on my radar and would not have been possible had I not had the financial support provided by the grant.  I think we need to create a diverse array of pathways to link young people to careers in agriculture and to show them that whatever they are interested in, there are opportunities in agriculture.”\nNIFA programs offer grants for K-12 schools and community colleges, such as The Secondary Education, Two-Year Postsecondary Education, and Agriculture in the K-12 Classroom Challenge Grants (SPECA) program; funding for undergraduate and masters level education such as the Higher Education Challenge Grants program and the Multicultural Scholars Program (MSP); and support for doctoral studies is provided by the NNF Fellowship and the Education and Literacy Initiative.\nNNF supports 45 new masters and doctoral students each year, while MSP supports 35 undergrads.\nBeyond grants, there are many other ways people can benefit from NIFA. For example, educators can access free curriculum from AITC through its Curriculum Matrix. NIFA is also the home of 4-H National Headquarters that supports the positive youth leadership development. NIFA is also a key partner with the Cooperative Extension Service, which operates offices across the country to provide community education in agriculture, health, nutrition, personal finances, and more.\nNIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges. \n Category/Topic:\n Initiatives\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n 4 H\n Education\n educational fellowships\n KYF2\n NIFA\n youth development", "author": "Scott Elliott"},

USDA-ARS photo by Stephen Ausmus.\nCalling all insect enthusiasts and frustrated gardeners!  USDA scientists need your help in documenting Brown Marmorated Stink Bugs (BMSB) in your home. Beginning September 15th through October 15th, we’re asking citizens across the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States to record daily counts of this pest on the exterior of their homes, along with their location and the time of each count. While USDA scientists are focusing on the Mid-Atlantic region, any they can get from other U.S. regions would also be helpful to their research.\nThe quest to find out just how many stink bugs there are, and how they behave, is the brainchild of a consortium of researchers from USDA, the University of Maryland, Pennsylvania State University, Rutgers University, Virginia Tech, the Northeastern IPM Center, Oregon State University, North Carolina State University, Cornell University, the University of Delaware and Washington State University. This project is represented on the website, “Stop BMSB (www.stopbmsb.org),” which was launched in .\nThe project involves more than 50 scientists who are investigating the impact BMSB have on grapes, orchard crops, small fruits, ornamental crops and vegetables, as well as ways to prevent or minimize the pest’s impact. BMSB have been found in 40 states and have caused the most damage in the Mid-Atlantic region. The value of at-risk crops where BMSB have been established or identified exceeds $21 billon.\nBecause landscape features such as woodlands, structures, roads and different land use types affect the spread of the insects, it is important to collect related to BMSB locations. BMSB survive cold winter temperatures near farmland in homes, office buildings and warehouses.\nScientists are just beginning to understand how landscape features will be a key component in combating stink bugs.

If you can’t remember, or you’ve never done these things you should because according to the Arbor Day Foundation, America has the “grandest trees on earth – the largest, the oldest and some of the most magnificent.”\nToday, April 26, is National Arbor Day. Take a moment to celebrate trees and all they provide for us.\nThere are so many things most of us don’t know about trees and Arbor Day is a great time to learn a thing or two. For instance, did you know the mighty oak tree is America’s national tree?\nIn fact, each state celebrates their own Arbor Day and has designated a tree to represent them. Our nation’s capital honors the scarlet oak.  Alaska’s Sitka spruce,  Maine’s eastern white pine, Florida’s cabbage palmetto, Washington state’s  western hemlock and California’s mighty sequoias all paint the landscapes of our lives.\nOur urban forests, the trees that line our streets and shade our parks and yards, not only add beauty but their shade can help reduce our utility bills. Trees soften the harsh angles of a city’s brick and mortar skyline and add a touch of color; for a moment we can envision what it must have looked like before there was a city.\nBut, you may still be asking yourself:  What else do trees do for me? They also absorb as much as 13 percent of carbon emissions thus cleaning the air that we breathe and reducing the effects of climate change. In short, they make our planet a safer place to live. Forests also help filter nearly half of all the drinking water we need to sustain our lives and they provide the lumber we need to build our homes, make furniture and, in some cases, provide sources of bio-energy to whole communities.\nSo, since trees and our forests do so much for us, why not use Arbor Day as the perfect opportunity to give back by planting trees—lots of them—so that future generations will look back with gratitude for all that we did to help protect and restore our forested lands.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Alaska\n Arbor Day\n California\n Climate Change\n Florida\n Forestry\n FS\n Maine\n trees\n urban forests\n Washington DC\n Washington State", "author": "Joanna Stancil"},

NRCS photo.\nA 53-acre conservation easement is an ideal environmental learning lab for students at Francis Hugh Wardlaw Academy in Johnston, South Carolina.  The land was once pastures for cattle, but now it’s a vibrant wetland just across the street from the high school.\nThe contractor hired to install the restoration work, Charles Kemp, was instrumental in involving the school’s students in creating and managing the wetland. “These students are exploring what a career in agriculture or environmental science would be like, and they love being outside and escaping the confines of the classroom,” Kemp said.\nUSDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service provided technical and financial assistance to develop the restoration plan, and install the structures and earthwork to convert the wet pasture into a functioning wetland.\nKemp coordinated with the school’s football coach and director of the agricultural education program, Mark Rodgers, who incorporated the wetland restoration activities into a hands-on learning experience for his students.\nSeveral of the students, like senior Jacob Baynham, hope to make farming a career. He will graduate from Wardlaw Academy in a few weeks and will attend an agricultural college in Georgia.\n“When you plant something and watch it grow, you feel a sense of accomplishment, and conservation is so important when it comes to farming,” Baynham said.\nRodgers started the agricultural program two years ago and has been thrilled with the interest and enthusiasm from the students. The students spend 3 to 4 days a week working at the wetland easement.  “I want to inspire these students to care about the environment,” he said.\nThe area was once pastures for livestock. The landowner worked with NRCS through the former Wetlands Reserve Program to create the wetland. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals.\nIt’s estimated that 87 percent of the wetland losses from the mid-s to the mid-s were because of conversion to farms and ranches. This program aims to restore wetlands in places where they’re best suited.\n“We traditionally restore altered or degraded floodplains and forested depressions back to wetlands, so converting this pastureland back to its original hydrologic state was unique,” said Sudie Daves-Thomas, a wildlife biologist with NRCS.\nWhen wetlands are drained or altered, this can create very uniform topography through land leveling or other agricultural activities. This wetland restoration plan called for macrotopographic features, which are wetland “ridge and swale” areas.\nThese are areas that will hold water after a rain event, and they create a diversity of water features, which aid in flood storage, enhance plant diversity and provide important wildlife habitat. The students helped create this wetland by planting almost all of the plants there.\nThe area is now teeming with amphibians, birds, beneficial insects and native vegetation. Many migratory birds stop at wetland areas on the way to their winter or summer homes, and more than one-third of the United States’ threatened and endangered species live only in wetlands. This South Carolina wetland is now home to shorebirds, songbirds, waterfowl, egrets and herons.\nThanks to the dedication and vision of Kemp and Rodgers, these students are getting a unique educational experience by witnessing what happens when a wetland comes back to life.\nThis May, NRCS is celebrating American Wetlands Month by sharing the stories of wetland restoration, like this one in South Carolina.

This is especially true in rural America, where dedicated farmers and ranchers rely on each other and the communities around them to fuel innovation and create opportunity. From nutritional research to competitions that promote sustainability and continued environmental care, ag promotion programs—with oversight from USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)—help American farmers make long-term investments that ensure a better future for everyone.\nFor more than 30 years, California almond growers have pooled their resources under the Almond Board, focusing on research and techniques to make the most of precious water resources.  Efficient water use and irrigation management are vital to the success of California’s Central Valley almond growers, ensuring that consumer demand for almonds can be met sustainably.  State-of-the-art farming and production developments over the past two decades have helped farmers reduce the amount of water they use per pound of almonds grown by 33 percent. Key strategies have included the wide adoption of micro-irrigation as well as advances in soil assessment and monitoring.\nInnovative use of wood products is beginning to change the face of construction, and USDA is doing its part to support these advancements. A new prize competition was launched earlier this month, challenging developers, institutions, organizations and design teams to demonstrate the architectural, structural and commercial viability of using sustainable wood products in tall-wood construction. USDA is investing up to $1 million in the competition and nonprofit partners—the Softwood Lumber Board and the Binational Softwood Lumber Council—have committed an additional $1 million.\n Pork Industry Environmental Stewards Bruce and Jenny Wessling from Grand Junction, Iowa.

Each year, the National Pork Board, along with its co-sponsor, National Hog Farmer magazine, highlights farms that represent environmental stewardship. Most of these stewards employ state-of-the-art technology and new approaches to pig farming, which have benefits for their surrounding communities as well.  The stewards are evaluated on manure management systems, water and soil conservation practices, odor-control strategies, farm aesthetics and neighbor relations, as well as wildlife habitat promotion.\n“Our environmental stewards clearly understand the role technology plays in a comprehensive approach to raising pigs,” said Lynn Harrison, chair of the selection committee. “It illustrates how bright ideas can become innovative solutions. From relying more on solar power to giving back to their communities, our stewards put their own stamp on raising high-quality pork for customers.”\nDavid and Sharon Stephens from Malta Bend, Missouri, Pork Industry Environmental Stewards.

There was talk of the endangered blanding turtles living in the wetland, too. It’s a wonderful scene, but it was much different 14 years ago.\nThe land, located along Raccoon Creek at the confluence of the Rock and Pecatonica rivers, was once forests and crops. The Natural Land Institute purchased the land in , and that’s when transformation began.\nThe institute works to create an enduring legacy of natural land in northern Illinois for people, plants and animals. The wetland was made possible by the institute’s partnership with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, along with a trust given to the institute by the Nygren family.\nNRCS provided $1 million toward the purchase of the 655-acre easement from the land’s original owner.\nFlooded cropland that eventually became Nygren Wetland Preserve. Natural Land Institute photo.\nThe land was enrolled in the former Wetlands Reserve Program, which provides financial assistance for restoring wetlands. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals.\n“NRCS assistance and countless other partners have helped with developing this property into what it is today and for the general public to enjoy on a daily basis,” said Josh Franks, NRCS district conservationist in Winnebago County, Ill. “I think we all should feel good about that.”\nThe Nygren Wetland Preserve includes six types of plant communities, including wetlands, prairie and woodlands. Each requires specific management and maintenance that include re-seeding and prescribed burns. The burns reduce the unwanted plants and stimulate the native grasses.\n“It has been great working with the entire NLI staff at the Nygren WRP site,” Franks said. “They truly are great conservation stewards and protect the valuable natural resources in northern Illinois.”\nAn extensive flood in caused reed canary grass to take over a portion of the wetland. Reed canary grass is an invasive species that will overtake native plants if not controlled.\nKevin Rohling talks about the plants in the wetland with Josh Franks, NRCS district conservationist, and Ellen Starr, NRCS area biologist. NRCS photo.\n“We have an ongoing attempt to eradicate the invasive grass,” said Kevin Rohling, the institute’s stewardship director.\nThe institute also has a reed canary grass experiment plot. “We are attempting to see if we can eradicate the grass without using herbicides,” Rohling said, saying they clip seed heads before seeds are naturally dispersed by the plant.\nThe institute intends to restore the wetland with original grasses and forbs. “Seeds are collected on site, and if not available, we reach out to surrounding areas for those hard to find seeds,” Rohling said.\nYears ago, Raccoon Creek was straightened to improve farming activities. When deciding how to return the stream to its meandering state, it was discovered the old stream channel was still intact.  Dikes were placed to force the water back to the original channel. Three years later, a study on the meandering creek showed there was a 100 percent increase in fish species and 1,000 percent increase in fish abundance.\nPartnerships and volunteers have made this wetland what it is today and the volunteers are the heart of the preserve.\nThe Nygren Wetland Preserve not only has tremendous volunteer support but is also located next to three forest preserves. The contiguous preserves provide a large nesting, breeding and flyway for birds, amphibians and mammals, not to mention the enjoyment and educational opportunities for local residents.\nAs beautiful as it is today, the Nygren Wetland Preserve maintenance and support is ongoing. “We are currently assisting them with a restoration contract approved last year to manage 36 acres of reed canary grass and 156 acres of prescribed burning in and ,” Franks said. “They are always excited to try new things at the property and I anticipate us assisting when we are able to in the future.”\nWhite pelicans enjoy a rest before moving on to more northern nesting grounds.

It’s an impressive operation - in no small part because the Coles still run their agricultural business on the fundamental values their family began with over a century ago.\nAndy’s Agway started as a family farm purchased just after the Civil War. At first, the farm supplied only the Cole family but slowly it grew to provide for surrounding families, producing vegetables, hay, wood, and ice for nearby communities. In the s, the farm went into dairy production and provided milk deliveries to Biddeford and other towns in southern Maine.\nAndy Cole, Owner of Andy’s Agway, provides a tour of his business to Bette Brand, USDA Administrator for Rural Business and Cooperatives Service.\nDuring my visit to Andy’s Agway with USDA Administrator for Rural Business and Cooperatives Service Bette Brand, we got the opportunity to meet Andy and Valerie and watch them enthusiastically waiting on customers. Clearly these folks take both agriculture and customer service to heart, and it’s not surprising given that’s what they were raised on. Andy grew up on the family farm, studied Ag Mechanization in college, and began working as a management trainee for Agway as soon as he graduated. His wife Valerie owned horses and many other pets as a child, then studied Animal Science in college. The couple met while working at Agway and made agribusiness their life’s work when they opened the store in Dayton.\nThe business recently received a Rural Energy for America Program Grant from USDA Rural Development to install a solar photovoltaic system nearby the barn that houses the store. This modern technology will help the business save money on energy. The solar panels will save $2,700 per year and generate nearly 29,000 kWh annually, replacing all of the energy needs for their business. Valerie said, “We feel very strongly about reducing our carbon footprint and using resources that are cleaner and greener.”\nMany things have changed at Andy’s Agway through the years - but not the values that make Andy’s Agway a staple to the local farming and agricultural community. Despite the present-day solar technology near the antique barn, the principles Andy’s Agway was established on generations ago have remained: Christian values, good work ethic, and a positive ‘help-your-neighbor’ attitude that is apparent in the day-to-day operations at the store.\nThe Cole family has remained in agriculture throughout multiple generations because, according to Andy, “We want to help people realize the importance of agriculture, especially local agriculture. We enjoy helping people to be as self-sustaining as they want to be and we make it easy by delivering things right where people want them - whether it’s on the front porch, in the barn, or right on the edge of the garden.”\nIt’s investment in rural small businesses and producers like the Cole family that helps our rural communities not only survive, but thrive – and when rural America thrives, all America thrives. Operations like Andy and Valerie’s Agway are the underpinnings of our nation’s economy, and I’m proud we could be a part of helping them grow.\nAndy Cole and Bette Brand show off some brand-new baby chicks at Andy’s Agway in Dayton, Maine.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Rural Development\n Maine\n Bette Brand\n Agribusiness\n Rural Energy for America Program\n Rural America", "author": "Timothy P.

DeKalb County Forest Preserve District photo.\nIf the land floods more often than growing a crop, why not let it go back to what it wants to be – a wetland. That’s what happened on the Hoppe Heritage Farmstead in . The Hoppe sisters owned cropland along the southern branch of the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb County, Ill. About half of the land would flood on a regular basis.\nAfter several years of dealing with the floods, the sisters decided to do something about it. They sold the homestead to the DeKalb County Forest Preserve District, which preserves and restores landscapes and their plant and animal life.\nTerry Hannan, the forest preserve’s superintendent, contacted USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service about a conservation easement as a possible opportunity to improve the land.\nNRCS provides technical and financial assistance for wetland restoration projects like this one. The Hoppe sisters enrolled 55 acres land into the former Wetlands Reserve Program. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals.\n“This was a three way deal,” said Paul Searl, a district conservationist with NRCS. “We bought the easement from the sisters, and then they sold the land to the forest preserve. We started the process in early .”\nBefore re-establishing the native plants, extensive research was done to ensure plant were accurate to pre-settlement conditions. Al Roloff, the forest preserve’s natural resources manager, used several reference books as well as records and observations of plant species that exist in local remnant plant communities.\nNRCS provided six-inch topographic measurements that made planting much easier. The map gives elevations of the land, enabling Roloff to select the proper plants for the soil type.  The lowest elevation, because of the standing water, was planted with root divisions, mud clumps and plugs.\nLater, when the area dried, he and volunteers scattered seeds by hand of bulrushes, other sedges and forbs. Roloff was excited by the rapid results of their restoration work. “The first year germination rates far surpassed my expectations,” he said.\nThe main threat is the canary reed grass and some cattails, both invasive plants. “The main focus was the vegetation with a concern of invasive species,” Searl said.\nThe tile that originally drained the field was brought to the surface with a riser. Now, instead of water leaving the fields through this drainage system, it holds water on the fields, helping in its transformation to a wetland.\nAfter just two growing seasons, the plantings have taken hold dramatically. “The diversity and density of plants has been amazing,” Roloff said. Including the prairie buffer, there are more than 100 different species located in this 55 acre plot.\nFrom to , a study was conducted on the mussel populations in the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb County, including the stretch of river that runs through South Branch Prairie and the connecting Russell Woods Preserve.\nMussels are indicators of water quality because their survival rate is lowered when covered with sediment and pollutants. Wetlands improve water quality by filtering nutrients, pollutants and sediment and lead to other environmental benefits, including creating better habitat for mussels.\n“They found 14 species of mussels in large numbers, much large than anywhere else in the river,” Roloff said. “It is the most rich and diverse portion of the Kishwaukee River.”\nRoloff said these discoveries help highlight the important of wetlands on water quality.\nThrough NRCS conservation easements, South Branch Prairie, added to the corridor of other existing forest preserves, wildlife has flourished with sightings of bald eagles, sandhill cranes and many different shorebirds. Diversity in plants benefits pollinators, protects the soil and improves water quality.\n“With the forest preserve and wetland collecting water runoff and filtering it before entering the river,” the water quality in this stretch of the river is the best in northern Illinois,” Searl said.\nView of South Beach Prairie of a before/after of restoration.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Agricultural Conservation Easement Program\n Conservation\n Farm Bill\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n Illinois\n NRCS\n water quality\n wetlands\n Wetlands Reserve Program", "author": "Jody Christiansen"},

U. S. Department of Agriculture research is helping shed light on this promising concept. USDA photo by David Bergman.\nMost people are familiar with the weekly summer ritual of mowing the lawn.  At best, the smell of fresh cut grass is appealing, but often the task is considered time consuming, tiring and expensive.  What if your “lawn” was actually hundreds of acres in size, and how often you mowed it, what type of grass you had, and if you used pesticides greatly impacted the safety of nearby residents?  “Mowing the lawn” is just one of the tasks airport managers and biologists confront as they work to keep wildlife away from runways and aircraft.\nCurrently, productive land use near airports is limited and keeping the land fallow is usually the norm.  What airport managers see as a cost of doing business, USDA researcher Dr. Travis DeVault sees as an opportunity.\nSince , DeVault and colleagues at the National Wildlife Research Center’s Sandusky, Ohio, field station, a part of the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, have partnered with Mississippi State University researchers to explore alternative uses for lands on and near airports with the goal of reducing wildlife hazards, while also providing a source of revenue for airports.\nIn a recent study, DeVault and colleagues estimated that airport properties in the contiguous United States contain approximately 1,276 square miles of idle grasslands─an area larger than the state of Rhode Island.  In DeVault’s eyes, much of this land could potentially be converted to biofuel, solar or wind production.\nResearchers and airport biologists with the U. S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Wildlife Services program provides technical assistance to civil and military airports in an effort to reduce wildlife collisions with aircraft. Photo courtesy of USDA.\n“Though there’s a big push to increase renewable energy production in our country, land managers are cautious about the impacts that wind, solar and biofuel production may have on wildlife and conservation efforts,” notes DeVault.  “Why not locate alternative energy production on and near airports where wildlife presence is already discouraged?”\nCurrent research efforts are investigating wildlife use of solar arrays and biofuel crops, such as switchgrass and mixed warm-season grasses.\n“Our goal is to identify biofuel crops or other renewable energy sources that are undesirable habitats for wildlife hazardous to aviation.  Finding such land uses will not only help reduce wildlife collisions at airports but also promote renewable energy production in areas inappropriate for wildlife conservation.”\nFor more information, please visit NWRC’s reducing wildlife hazards to aircraft project page.\n Category/Topic:\n Animals\n Plants\n Tags:\n APHIS\n aviation safety\n Biofuel\n bird strikes\n National Wildlife Research Center\n NWRC\n Renewable Energy\n Travis DeVault\n Wildlife", "author": "Gail Keirn"},

NRCS photo.\nA 53-acre conservation easement is an ideal environmental learning lab for students at Francis Hugh Wardlaw Academy in Johnston, South Carolina.  The land was once pastures for cattle, but now it’s a vibrant wetland just across the street from the high school.\nThe contractor hired to install the restoration work, Charles Kemp, was instrumental in involving the school’s students in creating and managing the wetland. “These students are exploring what a career in agriculture or environmental science would be like, and they love being outside and escaping the confines of the classroom,” Kemp said.\nUSDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service provided technical and financial assistance to develop the restoration plan, and install the structures and earthwork to convert the wet pasture into a functioning wetland.\nKemp coordinated with the school’s football coach and director of the agricultural education program, Mark Rodgers, who incorporated the wetland restoration activities into a hands-on learning experience for his students.\nSeveral of the students, like senior Jacob Baynham, hope to make farming a career. He will graduate from Wardlaw Academy in a few weeks and will attend an agricultural college in Georgia.\n“When you plant something and watch it grow, you feel a sense of accomplishment, and conservation is so important when it comes to farming,” Baynham said.\nRodgers started the agricultural program two years ago and has been thrilled with the interest and enthusiasm from the students. The students spend 3 to 4 days a week working at the wetland easement.  “I want to inspire these students to care about the environment,” he said.\nThe area was once pastures for livestock. The landowner worked with NRCS through the former Wetlands Reserve Program to create the wetland. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals.\nIt’s estimated that 87 percent of the wetland losses from the mid-s to the mid-s were because of conversion to farms and ranches. This program aims to restore wetlands in places where they’re best suited.\n“We traditionally restore altered or degraded floodplains and forested depressions back to wetlands, so converting this pastureland back to its original hydrologic state was unique,” said Sudie Daves-Thomas, a wildlife biologist with NRCS.\nWhen wetlands are drained or altered, this can create very uniform topography through land leveling or other agricultural activities. This wetland restoration plan called for macrotopographic features, which are wetland “ridge and swale” areas.\nThese are areas that will hold water after a rain event, and they create a diversity of water features, which aid in flood storage, enhance plant diversity and provide important wildlife habitat. The students helped create this wetland by planting almost all of the plants there.\nThe area is now teeming with amphibians, birds, beneficial insects and native vegetation. Many migratory birds stop at wetland areas on the way to their winter or summer homes, and more than one-third of the United States’ threatened and endangered species live only in wetlands. This South Carolina wetland is now home to shorebirds, songbirds, waterfowl, egrets and herons.\nThanks to the dedication and vision of Kemp and Rodgers, these students are getting a unique educational experience by witnessing what happens when a wetland comes back to life.\nThis May, NRCS is celebrating American Wetlands Month by sharing the stories of wetland restoration, like this one in South Carolina.

This orchard uses micro-irrigation, which efficiently directs water. Photo courtesy of the Almond Board.\nIt takes a lot of hard work to make a living out of farming, to build a thriving agricultural business and it takes ingenuity. This is especially true in rural America, where dedicated farmers and ranchers rely on each other and the communities around them to fuel innovation and create opportunity. From nutritional research to competitions that promote sustainability and continued environmental care, ag promotion programs—with oversight from USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)—help American farmers make long-term investments that ensure a better future for everyone.\nFor more than 30 years, California almond growers have pooled their resources under the Almond Board, focusing on research and techniques to make the most of precious water resources.  Efficient water use and irrigation management are vital to the success of California’s Central Valley almond growers, ensuring that consumer demand for almonds can be met sustainably.  State-of-the-art farming and production developments over the past two decades have helped farmers reduce the amount of water they use per pound of almonds grown by 33 percent. Key strategies have included the wide adoption of micro-irrigation as well as advances in soil assessment and monitoring.\nInnovative use of wood products is beginning to change the face of construction, and USDA is doing its part to support these advancements. A new prize competition was launched earlier this month, challenging developers, institutions, organizations and design teams to demonstrate the architectural, structural and commercial viability of using sustainable wood products in tall-wood construction. USDA is investing up to $1 million in the competition and nonprofit partners—the Softwood Lumber Board and the Binational Softwood Lumber Council—have committed an additional $1 million.\n Pork Industry Environmental Stewards Bruce and Jenny Wessling from Grand Junction, Iowa. Evaluations were based on manure management systems, water and soil conservation practices, odor-control strategies, farm aesthetics and neighbor relations, and wildlife habitat promotion. Photo Courtesy of the National Pork Board\nThe pork industry continues to support and recognize operations that are innovative and use sustainable practices. Each year, the National Pork Board, along with its co-sponsor, National Hog Farmer magazine, highlights farms that represent environmental stewardship. Most of these stewards employ state-of-the-art technology and new approaches to pig farming, which have benefits for their surrounding communities as well.  The stewards are evaluated on manure management systems, water and soil conservation practices, odor-control strategies, farm aesthetics and neighbor relations, as well as wildlife habitat promotion.\n“Our environmental stewards clearly understand the role technology plays in a comprehensive approach to raising pigs,” said Lynn Harrison, chair of the selection committee. “It illustrates how bright ideas can become innovative solutions. From relying more on solar power to giving back to their communities, our stewards put their own stamp on raising high-quality pork for customers.”\nDavid and Sharon Stephens from Malta Bend, Missouri, Pork Industry Environmental Stewards.

There was talk of the endangered blanding turtles living in the wetland, too. It’s a wonderful scene, but it was much different 14 years ago.\nThe land, located along Raccoon Creek at the confluence of the Rock and Pecatonica rivers, was once forests and crops. The Natural Land Institute purchased the land in , and that’s when transformation began.\nThe institute works to create an enduring legacy of natural land in northern Illinois for people, plants and animals. The wetland was made possible by the institute’s partnership with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, along with a trust given to the institute by the Nygren family.\nNRCS provided $1 million toward the purchase of the 655-acre easement from the land’s original owner.\nFlooded cropland that eventually became Nygren Wetland Preserve. Natural Land Institute photo.\nThe land was enrolled in the former Wetlands Reserve Program, which provides financial assistance for restoring wetlands. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals.\n“NRCS assistance and countless other partners have helped with developing this property into what it is today and for the general public to enjoy on a daily basis,” said Josh Franks, NRCS district conservationist in Winnebago County, Ill. “I think we all should feel good about that.”\nThe Nygren Wetland Preserve includes six types of plant communities, including wetlands, prairie and woodlands. Each requires specific management and maintenance that include re-seeding and prescribed burns. The burns reduce the unwanted plants and stimulate the native grasses.\n“It has been great working with the entire NLI staff at the Nygren WRP site,” Franks said. “They truly are great conservation stewards and protect the valuable natural resources in northern Illinois.”\nAn extensive flood in caused reed canary grass to take over a portion of the wetland. Reed canary grass is an invasive species that will overtake native plants if not controlled.\nKevin Rohling talks about the plants in the wetland with Josh Franks, NRCS district conservationist, and Ellen Starr, NRCS area biologist. NRCS photo.\n“We have an ongoing attempt to eradicate the invasive grass,” said Kevin Rohling, the institute’s stewardship director.\nThe institute also has a reed canary grass experiment plot. “We are attempting to see if we can eradicate the grass without using herbicides,” Rohling said, saying they clip seed heads before seeds are naturally dispersed by the plant.\nThe institute intends to restore the wetland with original grasses and forbs. “Seeds are collected on site, and if not available, we reach out to surrounding areas for those hard to find seeds,” Rohling said.\nYears ago, Raccoon Creek was straightened to improve farming activities. When deciding how to return the stream to its meandering state, it was discovered the old stream channel was still intact.  Dikes were placed to force the water back to the original channel. Three years later, a study on the meandering creek showed there was a 100 percent increase in fish species and 1,000 percent increase in fish abundance.\nPartnerships and volunteers have made this wetland what it is today and the volunteers are the heart of the preserve.\nThe Nygren Wetland Preserve not only has tremendous volunteer support but is also located next to three forest preserves. The contiguous preserves provide a large nesting, breeding and flyway for birds, amphibians and mammals, not to mention the enjoyment and educational opportunities for local residents.\nAs beautiful as it is today, the Nygren Wetland Preserve maintenance and support is ongoing. “We are currently assisting them with a restoration contract approved last year to manage 36 acres of reed canary grass and 156 acres of prescribed burning in and ,” Franks said. “They are always excited to try new things at the property and I anticipate us assisting when we are able to in the future.”\nWhite pelicans enjoy a rest before moving on to more northern nesting grounds.

{"theme": "Rural", "content": "USDA Rural Development State Director for Maine in\n Rural\n Sep 12, \nPartners gather with Andy and Valerie Cole to celebrate a grant the business received to install solar panels on the historic barn that has housed the family business for over a century.\nAndy and Valerie Cole are the husband and wife team who own Andy’s Agway in rural Dayton, Maine. It’s an impressive operation - in no small part because the Coles still run their agricultural business on the fundamental values their family began with over a century ago.\nAndy’s Agway started as a family farm purchased just after the Civil War. At first, the farm supplied only the Cole family but slowly it grew to provide for surrounding families, producing vegetables, hay, wood, and ice for nearby communities. In the s, the farm went into dairy production and provided milk deliveries to Biddeford and other towns in southern Maine.\nAndy Cole, Owner of Andy’s Agway, provides a tour of his business to Bette Brand, USDA Administrator for Rural Business and Cooperatives Service.\nDuring my visit to Andy’s Agway with USDA Administrator for Rural Business and Cooperatives Service Bette Brand, we got the opportunity to meet Andy and Valerie and watch them enthusiastically waiting on customers. Clearly these folks take both agriculture and customer service to heart, and it’s not surprising given that’s what they were raised on. Andy grew up on the family farm, studied Ag Mechanization in college, and began working as a management trainee for Agway as soon as he graduated. His wife Valerie owned horses and many other pets as a child, then studied Animal Science in college. The couple met while working at Agway and made agribusiness their life’s work when they opened the store in Dayton.\nThe business recently received a Rural Energy for America Program Grant from USDA Rural Development to install a solar photovoltaic system nearby the barn that houses the store. This modern technology will help the business save money on energy. The solar panels will save $2,700 per year and generate nearly 29,000 kWh annually, replacing all of the energy needs for their business. Valerie said, “We feel very strongly about reducing our carbon footprint and using resources that are cleaner and greener.”\nMany things have changed at Andy’s Agway through the years - but not the values that make Andy’s Agway a staple to the local farming and agricultural community. Despite the present-day solar technology near the antique barn, the principles Andy’s Agway was established on generations ago have remained: Christian values, good work ethic, and a positive ‘help-your-neighbor’ attitude that is apparent in the day-to-day operations at the store.\nThe Cole family has remained in agriculture throughout multiple generations because, according to Andy, “We want to help people realize the importance of agriculture, especially local agriculture. We enjoy helping people to be as self-sustaining as they want to be and we make it easy by delivering things right where people want them - whether it’s on the front porch, in the barn, or right on the edge of the garden.”\nIt’s investment in rural small businesses and producers like the Cole family that helps our rural communities not only survive, but thrive – and when rural America thrives, all America thrives. Operations like Andy and Valerie’s Agway are the underpinnings of our nation’s economy, and I’m proud we could be a part of helping them grow.\nAndy Cole and Bette Brand show off some brand-new baby chicks at Andy’s Agway in Dayton, Maine.\n Category/Topic:\n Rural\n Tags:\n Rural Development\n Maine\n Bette Brand\n Agribusiness\n Rural Energy for America Program\n Rural America", "author": "Timothy P.

DeKalb County Forest Preserve District photo.\nIf the land floods more often than growing a crop, why not let it go back to what it wants to be – a wetland. That’s what happened on the Hoppe Heritage Farmstead in . The Hoppe sisters owned cropland along the southern branch of the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb County, Ill. About half of the land would flood on a regular basis.\nAfter several years of dealing with the floods, the sisters decided to do something about it. They sold the homestead to the DeKalb County Forest Preserve District, which preserves and restores landscapes and their plant and animal life.\nTerry Hannan, the forest preserve’s superintendent, contacted USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service about a conservation easement as a possible opportunity to improve the land.\nNRCS provides technical and financial assistance for wetland restoration projects like this one. The Hoppe sisters enrolled 55 acres land into the former Wetlands Reserve Program. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals.\n“This was a three way deal,” said Paul Searl, a district conservationist with NRCS. “We bought the easement from the sisters, and then they sold the land to the forest preserve. We started the process in early .”\nBefore re-establishing the native plants, extensive research was done to ensure plant were accurate to pre-settlement conditions. Al Roloff, the forest preserve’s natural resources manager, used several reference books as well as records and observations of plant species that exist in local remnant plant communities.\nNRCS provided six-inch topographic measurements that made planting much easier. The map gives elevations of the land, enabling Roloff to select the proper plants for the soil type.  The lowest elevation, because of the standing water, was planted with root divisions, mud clumps and plugs.\nLater, when the area dried, he and volunteers scattered seeds by hand of bulrushes, other sedges and forbs. Roloff was excited by the rapid results of their restoration work. “The first year germination rates far surpassed my expectations,” he said.\nThe main threat is the canary reed grass and some cattails, both invasive plants. “The main focus was the vegetation with a concern of invasive species,” Searl said.\nThe tile that originally drained the field was brought to the surface with a riser. Now, instead of water leaving the fields through this drainage system, it holds water on the fields, helping in its transformation to a wetland.\nAfter just two growing seasons, the plantings have taken hold dramatically. “The diversity and density of plants has been amazing,” Roloff said. Including the prairie buffer, there are more than 100 different species located in this 55 acre plot.\nFrom to , a study was conducted on the mussel populations in the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb County, including the stretch of river that runs through South Branch Prairie and the connecting Russell Woods Preserve.\nMussels are indicators of water quality because their survival rate is lowered when covered with sediment and pollutants. Wetlands improve water quality by filtering nutrients, pollutants and sediment and lead to other environmental benefits, including creating better habitat for mussels.\n“They found 14 species of mussels in large numbers, much large than anywhere else in the river,” Roloff said. “It is the most rich and diverse portion of the Kishwaukee River.”\nRoloff said these discoveries help highlight the important of wetlands on water quality.\nThrough NRCS conservation easements, South Branch Prairie, added to the corridor of other existing forest preserves, wildlife has flourished with sightings of bald eagles, sandhill cranes and many different shorebirds. Diversity in plants benefits pollinators, protects the soil and improves water quality.\n“With the forest preserve and wetland collecting water runoff and filtering it before entering the river,” the water quality in this stretch of the river is the best in northern Illinois,” Searl said.\nView of South Beach Prairie of a before/after of restoration.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Agricultural Conservation Easement Program\n Conservation\n Farm Bill\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n Illinois\n NRCS\n water quality\n wetlands\n Wetlands Reserve Program", "author": "Jody Christiansen"},

U. S. Department of Agriculture research is helping shed light on this promising concept. USDA photo by David Bergman.\nMost people are familiar with the weekly summer ritual of mowing the lawn.  At best, the smell of fresh cut grass is appealing, but often the task is considered time consuming, tiring and expensive.  What if your “lawn” was actually hundreds of acres in size, and how often you mowed it, what type of grass you had, and if you used pesticides greatly impacted the safety of nearby residents?  “Mowing the lawn” is just one of the tasks airport managers and biologists confront as they work to keep wildlife away from runways and aircraft.\nCurrently, productive land use near airports is limited and keeping the land fallow is usually the norm.  What airport managers see as a cost of doing business, USDA researcher Dr. Travis DeVault sees as an opportunity.\nSince , DeVault and colleagues at the National Wildlife Research Center’s Sandusky, Ohio, field station, a part of the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, have partnered with Mississippi State University researchers to explore alternative uses for lands on and near airports with the goal of reducing wildlife hazards, while also providing a source of revenue for airports.\nIn a recent study, DeVault and colleagues estimated that airport properties in the contiguous United States contain approximately 1,276 square miles of idle grasslands─an area larger than the state of Rhode Island.  In DeVault’s eyes, much of this land could potentially be converted to biofuel, solar or wind production.\nResearchers and airport biologists with the U.

It’s no wonder more than six million women, infants, and children across America participate in the program.\nBut still, that’s only about half of those who are eligible, which means millions are missing out on WIC’s proven benefits.

In line with the Executive Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery and the Biden-Harris Administration National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, FNS is encouraging states to easily connect eligible moms and kids who already participate in programs like SNAP, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Medicaid with WIC benefits.

Put simply, nutrition security means having consistent and equitable access to healthy, safe, affordable foods essential to optimal health and well-being. It’s my honor and privilege to join this effort as the second director of nutrition security and health equity at the Food and Nutrition Service within USDA and lead the department’s approach to advancing food and nutrition security.\nIn this role, I will work to elevate the administration of USDA’s 16 nutrition assistance programs. These programs reach one in four Americans over the course of a year, and they are some of the most far-reaching, powerful tools in the federal government to help ensure that everyone — of all demographic groups and life stages—experiences nutrition security. Every day, USDA works hard (, 792 ) to connect nutritious foods to those most in need. Part of this work includes leveraging the momentum (, 10.0 ) of the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health and the corresponding National Strategy, which set ambitious goals to end hunger, improve nutrition and physical activity, and reduce diet-related diseases and disparities. We are also working to better integrate nutrition and health. Since hosting a National Summit this past fall, USDA has participated in three regional summits hosted by ProMedica and The Root Cause Coalition. We look forward to participating in their four remaining summits. We have learned so much about the power of integrating nutrition and health and the power of our partners in healthcare.\nI am excited to work across our department and with our partners in government, non-government organizations, and people working in communities across America to continue building awareness of our efforts and identify opportunities for collaboration. This work includes building new and enhancing collaborative activities with our National MyPlate Strategic Partners, SNAP-Ed implementing agencies, and everyone committed to advancing food and nutrition security. I know these programs are key ingredients to our work ahead. I know this firsthand through my experience as a community engaged researcher, like when a parent told me their child requested broccoli and kiwi after participating in our SNAP-Ed supported programming. That’s the power of USDA programs!\nBuilding on the momentum of this past year and half, we are excited to release a new video explaining USDA’s efforts to promote nutrition security. Please share this video to help spread the word about ways we are partnering to connect individuals, families, and communities across this country with foods that support optimal health and well-being.

Photo by Rey T. Adame.\nLast week, I visited with local communities in northern New Mexico. Many of these communities rely on irrigation ditches, called acequias, as their primary water source in an otherwise arid region. These are ditches that were used by their parents, and their grandparents, and their great-grand parents. Some acequias in the area date back more than 400 years.\nThrough the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), NRCS is working with acequia communities and partners across the state of New Mexico to improve water quality, water quantity, and boost the overall health of these local irrigation ditches that so many rural American communities depend on. The Acequia San Rafael del Guique, for example, provides water for roughly 150 people in the Ohkay Owengeh and El Guique communities – it’s being revitalized as part of our RCPP project in the state.\nThis is one of 115 conservation projects currently being funded by RCPP in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. Together, USDA investments and partner contributions have brought our total conservation investment through RCPP to almost $800 million – and we’re just getting started. Last week, Secretary Vilsack announced that the second round of RCPP funding is now available. A new bucket of $235 million will be put to work funding innovative new projects to benefit our soils, water, and wildlife.\nRCPP is an example of government working at its best. We’re empowering local communities and private landowners to take control and identify what the needs are in their backyards. We’re harnessing the power of public-private partnership – bringing in new partners, new resources and new ideas to the table, resulting in conservation outcomes that we never could have realized on our own.\nJust like the first round of RCPP, 25 percent of the funding will be awarded to state-level projects; 40 percent for multi-state and national projects; and 35 percent for projects in eight Critical Conservation Areas, including: the California Bay Delta; Chesapeake Bay Watershed; Colorado River Basin; Columbia River Basin; Great Lakes Region; Longleaf Pine Range; Mississippi River Basin; and the Prairie Grasslands.\nWe’re looking for projects that deliver the most conservation for the tax payer dollar – and leverage additional financial and technical resources to get the job done. We’re looking for innovation. We’re looking for ideas that help producers boost their operations and mitigate threats, while meeting regulations and protecting the natural resources we all depend on.\nSeeing how our investments are changing lives for families in acequia communities in New Mexico and communities across the country pushes me to be a better public servant.  I’m grateful for these opportunities.\nI’m eager to see our current RCPP projects come to fruition and the new ideas coming to the table in the months ahead.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n California\n Chesapeake Bay Watershed\n Colorado\n Conservation\n Irrigation\n Jason Weller\n Maryland\n Mississippi\n ModernUSDA\n New Mexico\n NRCS\n Regional Conservation Partnership Program\n Tom Vilsack\n water\n water quality", "author": "Chief Jason Weller"},

{"theme": "Trade", "content": "Under Secretary of Agriculture for Natural Resources and the Environment and Anne Castle, Assistant Secretary for Water & Science at the Department of the Interior in\n Forestry\n Sep 12, \n Cross posted from the White House Council on Environmental Quality blog:\nAmericans know the importance of forests to our communities and our economy.  They provide jobs and recreational opportunities, filter our air and water, and make up essential habitat for wildlife and natural resources.  But increasingly, we’re also recognizing that forests play an important role in mitigating climate change.\nRecently, President Obama announced a Climate Action Plan to reduce carbon pollution, prepare for the impacts of climate change on our communities and economy, and lead international efforts to combat global climate change. This plan recognizes that America’s forests play a critical role in addressing carbon pollution, absorbing as much as 14 percent of our country’s greenhouse gas emissions each year.  Over the last several decades, forest regrowth on former farm lands, reforestation, and maturing forests have kept our forest growth rates high, helping us absorb even more carbon.\nAt the same time, development of forest lands is reducing the amount of carbon we can absorb now and in the future.  Carbon pollution is also taking a toll on our forests – heat waves, wildfires, pests and drought are all worsened by climate change, reducing our forests’ ability to sequester carbon.\nIt is difficult to predict precisely how much these impacts will reduce the potential of our forests to combat climate change – but we do know that we must start now to find new ways to enhance forests’ ability to absorb carbon and become more resilient. As part of the President’s Climate Action Plan, the Administration is bringing Federal agencies together to tackle this challenge.  An interagency Task Force is working to provide more accurate and consistent annual updates of carbon fluxes from forests and other lands.  This will help us ensure that we have up-to-date information on how major disturbances like wildfires, as well as land development trends, impact the capacity of the nation’s forests to absorb carbon. It will also provide the tools we need to make more effective policy decisions, ensuring land managers are able to take into account the carbon sequestration value of our forests.   The Task Force is also developing new approaches to retain and restore our forests and other important landscapes like grasslands and wetlands.\nThis initiative will build on the significant work the Administration already has underway to ensure healthy, thriving forests. For example, the Department of Agriculture announced this year the creation of seven new regional hubs to provide research and timely information to farmers and forest landowners as we work together to combat climate change. This work will complement research by DOI Climate Science Centers, in areas such as evaluating management options, projecting forest conditions and carbon storage under climate change, evaluating the effects of changing rainfall and snow conditions, and studying the effects of changing forests on particular species and ecosystem services. This information is helping to inform restoration efforts undertaken by the Forest Service and its partners to make our forests more resilient. And DOI and USDA are working together with other Federal agencies, states, tribes, and private landowners to engage in historic, landscape scale conservation projects that will put critical ecosystems on a stronger footing for the future.\nClimate change poses a tough new challenge for the forest ecosystems that provide so much for all Americans. Following President Obama’s lead, we’re getting ahead of the game – focusing on new partnerships, strengthening interagency collaboration, and ensuring that the best science is available as we take on climate change in the years to come.\nRobert Bonnie is Under Secretary of Agriculture for Natural Resources and the Environment\nAnne Castle is Assistant Secretary for Water & Science at the Department of the Interior\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Climate Change\n DOI\n drought\n Forestry\n FS\n greenhouse gas emissions\n jobs\n natural resources\n pests\n President Obama\n water\n White House\n wildfires\n Wildlife", "author": "Robert Bonnie"},

Nearly a 100 years later after being decimated by logging, this photo depicts a healthy restored forest at the same location. \nThe Weeks Act, which went into effect on March 1, , has been identified as one of the most important pieces of environmental legislation in American history.\nIn the early s the public began to embrace a more proactive attitude toward conserving public lands. Just the year before, in , Gifford Pinchot started the Forest Service. Before the Weeks Act, lands set aside for conservation were all located in the West and were created from large blocks of land in the public domain. Millions of acres of bare, eroded lands dotted the Eastern states from cut-over and farmed-out lands. In the West, the epic wildfires of fueled support for the Act.\nThe most poignant element of the Act was that it gave the federal government authority to buy private lands in the East to establish publicly-owned forests. This provided both immediate and long-term benefits: the immediate protection of eastern watersheds from further development; the creation of a long-term effort to restore forests on public lands; and the beginning of new federal-state cooperative partnership responsibilities to protect these lands from intense and damaging wildfires.\nThe Act’s natural resource conservation success has been profound: it designated 52 national forests in 26 Eastern states and mandated conservation ethics on some 20 million acres of national forests and grasslands across 41 states and Puerto Rico. Today, 80% of the 155 national forests are comprised of lands acquired through the Weeks Act, sustainably managed for a wide variety of conservation purposes.\nThe impact of the Weeks Act is still strong today. America relies on the treasures their forests provide, including clean water, wildlife habitat, recreation, forest products, and a wide range of goods and services. The conservation successes of historic partnerships that created many of our beautiful national forests are an integral part of how the Forest Service continues to do business.\nThe Act has a rich legacy, and the Forest Service remains committed to the tenets of its conservation core and values. The results of the Act support local economies and communities and broad tourism and recreation business sectors, and will extend our natural resource heritage far into the next 100 years.\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack signs the centennial of the \"Week's Act Proclamation.\" Behind Secretary Vilsack from the left are: Harris Sherman, Undersecretary, National Resources and Environment, Congressman Jim Moran, Virginia and Tom Tidwell, Chief, National Forest Service.

And many children simply can’t get to school before the first bell.\nSouthwest Regional Administrator Bill Ludwig speaks to school superintendents and food service directors about expanding school breakfast at the New Mexico School Breakfast Summit in Albuquerque on Nov. 15. \nPart of the No Kid Hungry New Mexico plan includes implementation of alternate service models for school breakfast in high poverty counties.  As part of training and outreach to schools, the New Mexico Collaboration to End Hunger hosted the New Mexico School Breakfast Summit on Nov.  15. Meghann Dallin is the program manager for the New Mexico No Kid Hungry Campaign. She explained that an important goal of the summit was to connect school districts interested in expanding their breakfast programs with the right people. All the key players were there including state organizations that provide support and technical assistance to schools wanting to adopt breakfast models that increase access to the program.\nI was happy to be a part of the summit and to tell the story of how breakfast in the classroom is already increasing participation in large and small school districts in Texas and Arkansas. Summit sessions included the role of school breakfast in reducing child hunger, alternative breakfast models, tools to facilitate breakfast expansion and lessons learned from successful programs in New Mexico. As in all No Kid Hungry endeavors, key partners came together with the New Mexico Collaboration to End Hunger to plan the summit, including Dairy MAX, the Student Nutrition Bureau of the New Mexico Public Education Department, and the New Mexico School Nutrition Association. I’m proud to be a part of the New Mexico No Kid Hungry initiative which is making all the right connections to end hunger in New Mexico.\n Category/Topic:\n Food and Nutrition\n Tags:\n Albuquerque\n Bill Ludwig\n FNS\n National School Lunch Program\n New Mexico\n No Kid Hungry\n School Breakfast\n Share Our Strength\n SNAP\n Summer Meals", "author": "Bill Ludwig"},

One of the goals of CoTrails is to educate and engage a robust volunteer force to assist with trail maintenance and planning efforts. Photo credit: USDA Forest Service/Judy Toppins\nThe Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forests in Georgia receive 2.2 million visitors each year, and their primary activity is use of 850 miles of designated system trails. But it’s not only hikers that take advantage of the recreation opportunities which these trails provide. Cyclists, hunters, anglers, off-highway vehicle enthusiasts and horseback riders all recreate on national forest trails-- and they don’t always see eye-to-eye.\nOne year ago, the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest embarked on a unique collaborative effort to bring these trail users together to help identify and maintain a diverse, quality trail system on Georgia’s national forests.  By working together with all trail users, the Forest Service created an opportunity to seek new ways to deal with the ever-increasing use of trails, public demand for more trails, limited agency resources to properly maintain existing trails, and potential competition among different trail users.\nThe forests first began the Collaborative Trails Initiative, or “CoTrails,” by hosting a series of meetings in forest communities. How could all trail users work together and with the Forest Service to address shared concerns and find solutions?  More than 350 people attended those meetings. A core group of more than 40 volunteers coalesced to see the effort through the planning stage. The result is a five-part strategic plan launched in January that the Forest Service and an ever-growing number of CoTrails volunteers are beginning to implement.\nTrail users of all types take part in a Trails 101 course offered through CoTrails in January on the Anna Ruby Falls trail. One of the goals of CoTrails is to educate and engage a robust volunteer force to assist with trail maintenance and planning efforts. Photo credit: USDA Forest Service/Judy Toppins\nThe CoTrails Strategic Plan outlines five objectives. They include engaging volunteers, inventorying and assessing existing trails, creating a forest-wide interactive online map of the trail system and identifying unauthorized trails and opportunities to incorporate new system trails on the national forests. A professional assessment of 200 miles of trails is already underway, and thousands of volunteer hours have already been invested.\nThe far-reaching influence of this effort will benefit more than just trail users by offering a more satisfying recreation experience. It will also protect watersheds, improve forest health and contribute to local and regional economies that depend on forest-related recreation.\nTo volunteer with CoTrails, learn more about the initiative or read the Strategic Plan, visit the CoTrails volunteer website or the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forests’ website.

Numerous hiking, biking and off-road trails crisscross the area. (U.S. Forest Service)\nWhile some may close up tents and winterize recreational vehicles this time of year, there are others who look forward to a winter filled with adventures on forests and grasslands. The draw is yurts and historic cabins available to rent that offer a bit of solitude for camping, a dose of adventure on skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles, and a lifetime of memories.\nA yurt is a circular tent with canvas walls. There are many different styles and sizes of yurts, but generally each yurt is different in what it offers. Typically, you can expect to provide your own bedding, food, and cooking supplies. Some include beds, tables and chairs. Others have camp stoves and wood burning stoves. Check information on Recreation.gov before making your reservation and committing to a stay.\nLast year, Johanne Tuttle and her friends chose the Grizzly Ridge yurt on the Ashley National Forest in Utah. After skiing three miles to reach the yurt, they found it had a wood-burning stove to keep warm when they finished cross-country skiing or sledding down a small hill. Inside, they could relax, play cards and cook their meals.\n“We were actually really surprised to get up here and see how spacious the yurt is. It’s really spacious, big huge bunk beds, double sized, so you can easily fit two people on one bed,” Tuttle said. “It’s bigger than any yurt I've ever been in and plenty of room to move around and stretch out.”\nTuttle’s group stayed for several days, packing in everything they needed and adhering to outdoor ethics and packing out their trash and leaving the yurt ready for the next campers.\nJamie Tyson, Johanne Tuttle, Charity Parks and Chris Berry dine on a meal they cooked in the Grizzly Ridge yurt on the Ashley National Forest in Utah. The yurt comes with bare-bones cooking utensils. (U.S. Forest Service)\nStaying in a yurt or cabin is easy to do depending on the location of the cabin and whether use is seasonal or year-round. All reservations are made through Recreation.gov. However, most facilities are locked and can be accessed only after contacting the forest or grassland office.\nAnd as with any outdoor recreation adventure, preparation is key no matter which season you choose. Be sure you have the appropriate clothing, supplies and a local area map before you head out. The Forest Service offers paper maps for sale and digital maps for iOS and Android smart devices.\nStill not sure you want to stay in a yurt? To learn more about unique camping experiences on the Ashley National Forest, watch videos on the Grizzly Ridge yurt; Trout Creek Guard Station; and the Carter Military Yurt.\nJohanne Tuttle, Jamie Tyson, Charity Parks and Chris Berry head out for cross-country skiing after checking into the Grizzly Ridge Yurt on the Ashley National Forest in Utah.

You might be surprised to learn, then, just how much of my time is dedicated to listening to and talking with people. To be sure, I still use math and science daily. Two decades into my career, however, it’s those intentional, important interactions with farmers who answer my agency’s requests for information, as well with those who use my agency’s , researchers, analysts and farmers themselves that keep me busiest.\nWhy? Because NASS is the “go to” source for official government statistics on U.S. agricultural production, economics, land, water, energy, environmental management and farmer demographics. Part of my job includes making sure farmers want to respond to our surveys and censuses and that researchers choose to use our because it is the most accurate and unbiased.\nI’m the grandson of a cattle rancher so intrepid that even after my then seventy-something year-old grandfather was kicked by a horse, he continued to ranch. I like to think I’ve inherited that tenacious nature and apply it to everything I do, even building awareness of the relevance of agricultural statistics. I do this by engaging with people at expos, trade shows, and one-on-one meetings. Somewhere between admiring the butter sculpture, checking out the latest equipment, vehicles, livestock, research, technology and trends, people stop in the NASS booth and we chat.\nI have found that farmers respond to my agency’s requests for information when they understand how official government statistics help them manage risks, conserve natural resources and promote a healthy agricultural production and marketing system in which they benefit. I spend a good bit of time meeting with farmers at farm shows, agricultural conferences and even at their operations. I also serve as presenter, moderator and panelist at agricultural symposiums and meet with stakeholders at multidisciplinary meetings. I do this to better understand what is happening in American agriculture, what matters to people who rely on agriculture and how my agency can provide the needed to help make sure American agriculture remains healthy and prosperous.

USDA photo by Lance Cheung.\nWith May being World Trade Month, it is worth noting that the source of to determine the U.S. supply of crops and livestock is America’s farmers and ranchers who fill out surveys from USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). These statistics feed directly into the monthly World Supply and Demand Estimates report (WASDE), which shows how much food, feed, fuel, and fiber are available or expected to be available around the world throughout the year. These are available free of charge to anyone who wants them and are widely regarded as the gold standard.\nDid you know that during the / growing season, farmers and ranchers across the United States produced an estimated 47.4 million metric tons of the world’s estimated 758.4 million metric tons of wheat, according to the May 10, WASDE report? The same report forecasts world wheat production for the / growing season to be 747.8 million metric tons – 10.6 million metric tons less than last year, of which 49.6 million metric tons is forecast to be U.S. production. NASS collects and these U.S. , and those for dozens of other agricultural products, every month with information gathered directly from farmers and ranchers. Additional information is collected and reported every quarter.\nA series of each year – March Prospective Plantings, June Acreage, September Small Grains Summary, and the January Annual Crop Production , along with Grain Stocks – give important insights into U.S. crop supply at telling points during the year. Currently, NASS is conducting the June Agricultural and Grain Stocks surveys and asking more than 100,000 farmers, ranchers, and grain storage operators to report actual planted acreage and stocks for use in determining domestic consumption and trade. Survey , combined with information from geospatial, field level yield surveys, weather, and other sources, form the final NASS estimates.\nIn addition to producing high quality statistics about U.S. agriculture, NASS has been helping to establish and improve agricultural statistics systems in countries around the world since the end of World War II. Food insecurity, shortfalls in regional food production, and lack of reliable information on the agricultural sector are major concerns in many countries. Improved agricultural systems can provide more and better information to address these issues.\nNASS specialists provide technical assistance and training on a reimbursable basis in all aspects of statistical surveys and systems. The benefits of such assistance and resulting stronger, consistent statistical organizations extend beyond serving the interests of the various countries.

This National Ag Day, we are sharing the three things you can do now to help us in this tremendous endeavor.\nOnly conducted every five years by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), the census captures a complete count of all U.S. farms, ranches, and those who operate them.  Even small plots of land – whether rural or urban – growing fruit, vegetables or some food animals count if $1,000 or more of such products were raised and sold, or normally would have been sold, during the census year.\nThe census helps tell the whole story of U.S. agriculture. The last Census of Agriculture counted more than 2 million farms and ranches in the U.S. spanning over 914 million acres. Without the Census of Agriculture, we would not know that 3.ates – only one percent of our total population – provide food, fuel, and fiber to the nation and others around the world.\nThe Census of Agriculture remains the only source of uniform, comprehensive, and impartial agriculture for every county in the nation. Census results are valuable to those who serve farmers and rural communities, including federal, state and local governments, agribusinesses, trade associations, extension educators, researchers, and farmers and ranchers themselves. Answers to the census can help grow a farm’s future, shape farm programs, and boost services for communities and the industry.\nToday, National Ag Day, and in the months to follow, we ask you to do three things: 1. Find out more about the Census of Agriculture by visiting www.agcensus.usda.gov; 2. Sign up to be counted in the Census of Agriculture, if you are involved with agriculture and have never participated in the Census before, and 3. Help spread the word so we can get a complete picture of U.S. agriculture. Become a Census of Agriculture Partner!\nProducers will receive their Census of Agriculture questionnaires this December. They will have the option to complete their form and return it by mail or use the Online Response to Census of Agriculture. Improved this year, the online census form is convenient, dynamic and user-friendly.

For more information about red meat production in , check out the complete Annual Summary (, 1.6 ) released by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) last month.\nAccording to the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), the United States is the largest producer of beef in the world! The Census of Agriculture tells us that there are more than 913,000 U.S. farms with cattle and calves. Texas has the largest number of cattle and cattle operations in the country. What will the Census of Agriculture tell us?\nIf beef is on the menu, consider marinating the meat and/or grilling with charcoal or wood chips for added flavor. If you’re making kebabs, don’t forget to soak your wooden skewers in cold water for several minutes before using them to avoid burning. Looking for a couple of great side dishes that are waist wise? Try deviled eggs and a refreshing fruit salad.\nAccording to the Chickens and Eggs Summary (, 1.3 ) released in February, U.S. farmers produced 106 billion eggs, 92 billion of which were table eggs, with Iowa being the largest producer. According to the Census of Agriculture, the United States has 198,272 farms with laying hens. Texas has the most operations with layers .\nStrawberries are great in almost everything! From desserts and drinks to salads and sauces, the strawberry is a nutritious and versatile fruit. In , the U.S. produced more than 3 billion pounds of strawberries. California’s operations, with 38,200 total strawberry acres harvested, produced nearly all the U.S. total with 2.9 billion pounds. For more on strawberries, keep an eye out for the upcoming Noncitrus Fruit and Nuts Annual Report on June 26.\nNot a big fan of all the work or cleanup of a barbecue? Keep it simple! Organize a potluck and use recyclable or compostable plates and utensils. As for the grill, remove debris while it’s still hot for easier and quicker cleaning. Want to do something creative? Transform your backyard barbecue into a tropical luau or host an outdoor movie night.\nBeyond reminding us about these wonderful foods and occasions, May reminds us that we have only a few more weeks for census collection. If you received a census questionnaire but have not yet completed and returned it, please do so as soon as possible. Even if you don’t farm, please return the questionnaire so that everyone is counted.

Other than playing starring roles on many Alaskans’ favorite dinner menus, they also both thrive in forests with large open canopies of hardwood and conifers with thick plant undergrowth. Such characteristics exist in mature forests but not in clear-cut areas.\nHistorically rich in fish and wildlife species, the Starrigavan Creek watershed in Sitka, Alaska, was clear-cut about 40 years ago by the state of Alaska for timber production, impacting fish and wildlife habitat in this popular local recreation area.\nIn , USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) partnered with the U.S. Forest Service, the State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources, Trout Unlimited and the Sitka Conservation Society to rehabilitate the Starrigavan Creek watershed. The goal was to improve habitat for salmon and deer, two keystone species for many watersheds in southeast Alaska that are also important for subsistence and recreation. Secondary goals were to increase berry production and provide firewood for the local community.\nThe forest after thinning.\nWhile the Forest Service spearheaded in-stream work on their property, NRCS worked with Trout Unlimited on the adjacent land. We cut excess conifer trees, leaving hardwoods in place to mimic an old growth forest. The hardwoods provide canopy and leaf litter, an important nutrient input to streams and forest soils. To facilitate decomposition of the cut trees, make travel easier for wildlife and allow additional light to reach the understory, we lopped the cut trees into small pieces. Along the roadsides, community members collected the cut trees for firewood.\nMonitoring the success of the project continues, as there are both short and long-term benefits of forest conservation. The trees left uncut during the project work will grow faster now that they have better access to light, water and nutrients. So far, the newly opened forest floor is thriving with favored deer browse such as bunchberry dogwood and five-leaf bramble; salmon habitat has improved; and the berry picking looks promising.\nCheck out more conservation stories on the USDA blog.\nFollow NRCS on Twitter.\nSitka black-tailed deer munching on fireweed.\nThe Starrigavan creek flowing through the newly improved forest.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Forestry\n Tags:\n Alaska\n Conservation\n Forestry\n FS\n NRCS\n Sitka\n Sitka Conservation Society\n Starrigavan Creek\n Trout Unlimited", "author": "Samia Savell"},

{"theme": "Trade", "content": "Posted by Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack in\n Forestry\n Dec 17, \n I want to thank Avoided Deforestation Partners for holding this event and inviting me to join all of the distinguished speakers here today in urging the adoption of REDD plus as part of a global climate framework.\nWe are encouraged by the progress being made here in moving REDD forward.  The United States believes an agreed outcome in Copenhagen should include REDD.  Our negotiating team is working hard to make this happen.\nProtecting the world’s forests is not a luxury.  It is a necessity.\nTropical rainforests, in particular, are of special importance. These forests are vital to the protection and storage of water.  The forests of the Amazon alone provide 15%-20% of the water that flows from the world’s rivers into our oceans.\nTropical rainforests are also reservoirs of biodiversity, covering 2% of the world’s surface but containing half of the world’s plants and animals.\nAnd, tropical rainforests are vitally important to the livelihood of many living in the world’s rural areas. By creating well-designed policies that value those forests, local people and communities can share in the economic benefits of forest conservation and environmental stewardship.\nAs evidenced by the gathering here in Copenhagen, protecting the world’s climate is one of the greatest challenges of our lifetime.  Forests have a vital role to play in overcoming this challenge.  Rainforests store vast amounts of carbon.  That’s true across the planet, and in America, too.  Our Tongass National Forest, a temperate Alaskan rainforest comprises only 2% of America’s forest land base, but may hold as much as 8% of all the carbon contained in the forests of the United States.\nBeyond the negative consequences of deforestation, it will be very difficult to protect the world’s climate, without protecting and restoring our forests. We lose more than 13 million hectares of tropical forests annually, and as we’ve heard today, the consequences are enormous, approximately 17% of global warming emissions coming from deforestation.\nProtecting the world’s forests will require significant capital.  We believe that valuing carbon in forests through a well-designed carbon market can provide one of the best opportunities we have to dramatically slow down forest loss and degradation in developing countries.  Of course, capital alone isn’t enough.  We must develop accurate forest inventories.  We must learn to balance local development with forest conservation.  And we must build local capacity so that countries are ready to participate in REDD markets and activities.\nThe Obama Administration and United States is committed to working with our international partners to protect these forests across the globe.  Today the State Department¸ USAID, and USDA’s Forest Service are already working with the governments of Ghana, Nepal, Mexico and others to learn how REDD plus can be implemented on the ground and we expect to ramp up these programs in the near future.  This includes improvements in carbon inventories, systems for paying for ecosystem services, and assistance in helping forests adapt to a changing climate.\nWhile REDD can make it possible for developing countries to protect their forests, developed countries must also recognize their own responsibility towards their own lands.  In the United States, the Obama Administration is taking steps to protect and restore our forests in order to sustain our climate and our water resources.  This week, the US Forest Service will formally announce a process for development of a new forest planning rule to govern the way we manage our publicly-owned National Forests, all 193 million acres.  Moving forward, forest restoration, climate mitigation and adaption will be central components of how we manage our National Forests.\nThe Obama Administration has also taken steps to protect roadless areas on our National Forests – these areas not only store carbon, but are critical in conserving water and wildlife.  And, we recognize the importance of protecting our privately-owned forests many of which are threatened by suburbanization and fragmentation.\nOur domestic efforts are important, but internationally we must move quickly to make it possible for developing countries to address deforestation.  We recognize the significant role that international public finance must play in supporting developing countries efforts to slow, halt and reverse deforestation.  That’s why I’m pleased to announce that the United States is committing one billion dollars over the next three years for fast start of REDD.  We regard this as an initial investment to build the capacity in these countries and undertake efforts to slow deforestation.  These funds will be available for countries that develop ambitious REDD-plus plans addressing deforestation and forest degradation, according to their respective capabilities.  We encourage other donors to join us in supporting forest countries to ensure early action on REDD-plus becomes a reality.\nThe United States is committed to protecting and restoring its forests as well as helping our international partners do the same.  It is imperative that we sustain our forests everywhere so that they, in turn, can sustain us.\n Category/Topic:\n Forestry\n Tags:\n FS\n REDD\n Tom Vilsack\n Tongass National Forest\n USAID", "author": "Unknown"},

Read Part 1 here. Read Part 2 here.\nFor an hour or so, that’s how it went: on one side of the roof, I smoked the bees and removed capped frames, volunteers ran the capped frames over to the extractor on the other side of the roof, and the extractor team spun the honey out of the trays with the hand-cranked extractor. The centrifuged honey slid down the sides of the extractor into a sweet puddle at the bottom of the metal barrel. Everyone had a turn spinning the extractor (and maybe sneaking a taste of the fresh honey; but I can’t say for sure—I was on the other side of the roof). \nThen the extractor broke! A couple of the teeth in the gear snapped off, making it impossible to turn the hand crank. Andy and Nathan decided to carry the extractor and the remaining full frames back to their office in Beltsville, Maryland, where they had another extractor and could finish the job.\nBut first, we wanted to pour the first two jars of honey. At the bottom of the exterior of the extractor barrel was a small tap. Leslie handed me two jars and I tapped the beautiful, clear honey into the jars. It was a proud moment for all of us. \nThis is me with the first two bottles from the extractor.\nFrom now on we’ll be able to monitor the hive for when the frames are full—and thus determine a good time to harvest the honey—without disturbing the bees. That’s because, while we were in the middle of the honey harvest, we lifted the hive and placed a scale under it. The scale has a logger that will take readings of the hive every 10 minutes to evaluate weight gain and loss. So we’ll now know how much honey is in the hive without even cracking the lid. \nThis is the bottom of the hive resting on the scale, which has been set on top of cinderblocks. \nIn case you’re curious, we didn’t take all of the hive’s honey that day. We left the bees several partially full frames to build on. They feed the young that honey, and we didn’t want to make more work for them than we had to. After all, it’s hot out, and gathering nectar to make honey is hard work.\nAnd after Nathan and Andy finished putting all the honey in jars, they put the extractor, with its streaks of honey, back on the roof for the bees to harvest.

The event was organized to help farmers and landowners learn about the opportunities offered by local and regional markets, and how USDA can help communities develop local and regional food systems.  It also brought together staff from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Cooperative Extension, and other agencies to meet and learn about producers and each other.\nThe sessions for the conference moved from more topical content, like getting started with organic gardening, to more specific topics for those needing something more in-depth, like third-party verification.  You could tell by the questions asked that this conference met the aim of serving a range of people, including producers, aggregators, farmer’s market organizers, and school nutrition professionals.\nSome of the attendees were like Glynis Coleman.  She is a small scale producer originally from Denver, Colorado.  As a child, her only exposure to agriculture was through her grandmother’s small garden.  In the last few years, family obligations made it necessary for her to find some way to make money working from home.  A former nurse armed only with a small acreage and the ability to keep house plants alive, she set out in search of knowledge that would make agriculture a viable option for her.  Her first stop was a conference held by the Kerr Center.\nAt the conference, Coleman and her son placed generously filled pint-sized baskets of black berries and peppers next to Melvett Chambers’ tomatoes in a miniature farmer’s market stand set up in the foyer.  After Chambers told her the price of small and large fruits, Coleman suggested the entire crop seemed to be abundantly sized when she asked with disbelief, “Which are the small?”\nIt is one of many questions she has asked Chambers over her four years in the business.  Chris Kirby, with the Oklahoma Farm to School Program, matched them up in a sort of unofficial mentorship.  Coleman was not at the conference only to sell produce.  She also attended the plasticulture session, an agricultural system she already uses, and learned more about expanding her operation through the NRCS Environmental Quality Incentives Program Organic Initiative.\nColeman says that there have been a few set-backs for her business, but she has been successful enough that her sister has left a career in the construction industry to add chickens and possibly goats to the operation.  For beginning farmers, Coleman says conferences like this are a good place to begin gathering information.  She offers this advice, “Make sure you want to do this, it is hard work.  Be willing to make mistakes. Diversify your crops.  You become reliant on the weather and God so you have to have some faith.”\nThe conference exceeded everyone’s expectations.  Larry Wright was asked by many of the excited attendees if there will be another conference next year.  “There will be a conference for as long as it is needed.”\n(You can learn more about the Great Plains RC&D council and keep an eye out for next year’s conference and other events online at: \n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Food and Nutrition\n Farming\n Tags:\n CEQ\n Great Plains Resource Conservation and Development’s (RC&D)\n KYF2\n Natural Resources Conservation Service\n Oklahoma Farm to School Program", "author": "Crystal Young"},

Did you know that pollinators are responsible for one out of three bites of food we eat? If you'd like to learn more, we've pulled together five blogs from highlighting some surprising facts about these busy helpers and the many ways different USDA agencies, farmers, ranchers and other partners are working to keep all pollinators healthy.\n1. Cattle and Honey Bees Graze in Harmony on Wisconsin Farm\nWhen USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) launched a new coordinated effort to improve honey bee habitat in , Fitton was one of the first to participate. He works closely with NRCS to make improvements to the land that provide better forage for his cattle, improve existing hayfields and convert former corn fields into healthy pasture.\nReed Fitton has enhanced honey bee habitat on the pastures he manages near Gays Mills, Wisconsin.\n2. A Diet to Help Conserve Bees When Food Is Scarce\nIn exchange for their labor, flowers provide bees with pollen and nectar as food. But few people wonder what’s available for bees to eat when there are few plants blooming in the late fall and early winter.\nMegaBee, an artificial diet developed by ARS and S.A.F.E. R&D, LLC, helps sustain honey bees in the face of pressures such as poor nutrition, pathogens, parasites and sublethal exposure to pesticides.\n3. Using Agroforestry to Help Pollinators Help You\nOne question many people are asking is: how can we incorporate more pollinator habitat into our communities, agricultural lands, and forests? Ongoing research by the U.S. Forest Service demonstrates that the number of pollinators in our landscapes can be increased through agroforestry and other land management practices.\nBlueberry bushes provide food for both bumblebees and people.

NRCS Partners with Farmers, Ranchers to Aid Monarch Butterflies\nBecause monarch butterflies are often on the move, they need to have the right plants at the right time along their migration route, including milkweed, which is the sole food source for monarch caterpillars. We worked with butterfly experts across the United States to choose the best plant species for monarchs based on geographic location and value to monarchs.\nNRCS is working with farmers and ranchers to create and enhance habitat for monarchs.

We must make needed investments to connect our rural residents to the 21st century technology that will help them compete in a global economy.\"Today's announcement of nearly $16 million in USDA grants for distance learning and telemedicine services helps to support President Obama's ConnectED initiative. In June , President Obama announced an effort to connect 99 percent of America's students to high-speed Internet over the next five years. Since USDA has provided support for more than 3,300 educational institutions receiving distance learning services to help rural children get an education that is as good as that of their peers in cities.Today's investments are being provided through USDA's Distance Learning and Telemedicine Loan and Grant program. It provides funding to rural hospitals, clinics, schools and libraries for equipment and technical assistance for telemedicine and distance learning. Grant recipients must demonstrate that they serve rural America, prove there is an economic need and provide at least 15 percent in matching funds.For example, the South Central Ohio Computer Association in Piketon, Ohio, has been selected for a $184,000 grant to link 20 high schools. The Association will train students for high technology careers through a mentoring program using advanced communications technology. In Idaho, funds will be used by the Idaho Education Network to purchase distance learning equipment for K-8 schools in 62 of Idaho's most rural and economically challenged communities. The distance learning equipment will also be used to train emergency service personnel after school hours.Since , USDA has invested almost $150 million in the Distance Learning and Telemedicine program. These investments complement other USDA efforts to improve rural communications. In , USDA provided $305 million in loans for broadband infrastructure. These loans will result in new or upgraded broadband service for about 120,000 rural households, businesses and community institutions once the projects are completed.

Garcia was activated to serve in the National Guard during the wildfire suppression efforts near Lolo, Montana.\nFSA provides assistance to farmers and ranchers who have been impacted by natural disasters, including wildfires, by administering a suite of safety-net programs to help producers recover from eligible losses, such as the Livestock Indemnity Program, the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program, and the Tree Assistance Program. The programs can assist farmers and ranchers who lost livestock, grazing land, fences or eligible trees, bushes and vines as a result of the qualifying natural disaster.\nIn addition, the FSA Emergency Conservation Program provides funding and technical assistance for farmers and ranchers to rehabilitate farmland damaged by natural disasters. Low-interest emergency loans are available to help producers recover from production and physical losses. Compensation is also available to producers who purchased coverage through the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, which protects non-insurable crops (including native grass for grazing) against natural disasters that result in lower yields, crop losses or prevented planting.\nAs a result of the ongoing drought conditions, all Montana counties were approved for emergency haying and grazing of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres. Due to drought and fire conditions, 53 of the state’s 56 counties have been declared either primary or contiguous disaster areas.\n“The short term impact is FSA can do a lot of good for producers. Producers can get some relief, fix fences and get feed purchased,” Garcia said.\nGarcia said hay donations came into the state from other areas to help out ranchers in need. Additionally, FSA employees from other states, including Missouri and Oklahoma, have spent time helping Montana producers enroll in FSA disaster programs.\n“It is proof that the agriculture community is one big small town where you have a lot of folks that have camaraderie,” he said.\nDetailed information on all of these disaster assistance programs can be found online at: www.fsa.usda.gov/disaster.

Photo courtesy of Nick Richter.\nHabitat conservation practices make a difference for lesser prairie-chickens. That's the finding of a recent scientific study – the first part of a multi-year study – described in a new report from the Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiative (LPCI).\nLPCI, led by USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), works with partner organizations and ranchers to improve habitat and address threats to the bird. Since , more than 1 million acres of habitat have been restored on working lands.\nNRCS works with partners to monitor the outcomes, which helps determine if conservation practices are making a difference, but accurately estimating wildlife populations can be challenging with uncommon, widely dispersed species like the lesser prairie-chicken.\nA recent study identified a new model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, and it shows encouraging evidence that NRCS-recommended conservation practices through LPCI are working and that large blocks of intact prairie are important to prairie-chicken conservation.\nThe study assessed one year of from the annual aerial survey of lesser prairie-chicken lek sites conducted by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and it looked at four factors that might impact site occupancy — patch size of native vegetation, percent of land cover managed with prescribed grazing; percent of land cover enrolled in USDA’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); and density of primary roads. The research team intends to continue with a multi-year study that assesses additional variables.\nAs the amount of land enrolled in CRP or using prescribed grazing increases, the likelihood that lesser prairie-chickens will occupy that land also increases.\nLesser prairie-chickens face many threats, including habitat loss and fragmentation from row-crop agriculture, fire suppression, unmanaged grazing, development, and drought. The species currently occupies just 16 percent of its historic range.\nBut in western Kansas, lesser prairie-chickens have reoccupied portions of their historical range and have even moved into areas outside that historical range. The range expansion coincides with former croplands enrolled and maintained as grasslands through CRP as well as native grasslands managed using LPCI prescribed grazing practices.\nA team of researchers tested whether there was a quantifiable link between land where ranchers are implementing LPCI prescribed grazing plans or have enrolled their land in CRP and the likelihood of prairie-chickens occupying a landscape. Their results indicate that these habitat conservation efforts are working.\nAfter developing an expanded model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, the team found that occupancy increases as prairie patch-size increases, as well as in landscapes with ongoing conservation practices. Specifically, the results indicate that when ranchers are using prescribed grazing or enrolling land in CRP, the likelihood of lesser prairie-chickens occupying that habitat increases significantly.\nThe report’s management recommendations include:\nEnrolling acreage within the lesser prairie-chicken active range in prescribed grazing or CRP.\nMaintaining large blocks of native prairie across the range through sustainable ranching.\nIdentifying potential landscapes with willing landowners to develop conservation easements, particularly if combined with prescribed grazing and other proven habitat conservation practices.\nImplementing prescribed grazing on dispersed patches throughout large blocks of rangeland.\nCultivating diverse stands of CRP-enrolled grasslands that serve as connective tissue to larger patches of native prairie.\nRetaining CRP acreage as grasslands after contract expiration.\nNRCS outlined its three-year conservation strategy for lesser prairie-chicken conservation, which encourages adoption of many of the above recommendations on 500,000 additional acres, such as prescribed grazing, using easements to protect key habitat corridors, and providing assistance to convert expiring CRP lands to grazing.\nLearn more about these findings by downloading this new report.

{"theme": "Trade", "content": "Public Affairs Specialist, Farm Service Agency - Office of External Affairs in\n Conservation\n Feb 29, \nGail Dunlap used the USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to implement many conservation practices on her land, including restoring nearly seven acres of wetlands on one of her Ohio farms.\nSince she was a teenager some 60 years ago, Gail Dunlap has played an active role in her family’s seventh generation Ohio farming operation by focusing on ways to continually improve conservation practices and establish a natural and sustainable way of life.\n“Back then, we were not that many years past the Dust Bowl times and farmers in the area were doing a wonderful job of resting the soil with long rotations,” said Dunlap. “I remember even the weeds seemed to be as beautiful as wildflowers.”\nHowever, as the years passed, Dunlap quickly became more concerned about soil erosion issues in the area. Each time she returned home from college she noticed that more land was being tilled and islands of oak trees within the fields were disappearing.\nIn , Dunlap learned about a new Farm Bill program called the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and was excited about how the program could benefit their farms. Her parents agreed. After talking with their local USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) staff, they discovered that an entire farm could be eligible for the program.\nCRP is one of the largest private lands programs for conservation used extensively throughout the country to reduce soil erosion, improve water and air quality and provide wildlife habitat.\nToday, the original Dunlap farm fosters multiple CRP practices, including wetland restoration, timber, prairies, buffer strips, riparian buffers, grass waterways, shallow water areas, tall grass prairies and various wildlife habitat and food plots. Dunlap has dedicated more than 220 acres of her land in Pickaway and Ross counties to conservation.\nCRP is a voluntary program that allows eligible landowners to receive annual rental payments and cost-share assistance to establish long-term, resource-conserving covers on eligible farmland throughout the duration of their 10-to-15-year contracts.\n“CRP is a blessing and it has helped me save our family farm by preserving the land and establishing wildlife habitat,” said Dunlap. “This program gave me hope that I would be able to restore my land through conservation practices so I could bring back diverse wildlife and have the opportunity to plant trees again.”\nOver the years, Dunlap’s CRP practices did indeed expand. Besides improving the soil health, Dunlap noticed an increase in wildlife numbers. It restored diversity to the farm.\n“The program provided me income and the opportunity to apply restorative methods to save my land and allow wildlife species to return, reproduce and thrive,” said Dunlap. “It has brought back beauty to the landscape, improved soil fertility and created new ecosystems that will continue to improve over the years. The impact of CRP will benefit many future generations.”\nSince , CRP has helped prevent more than 9 billion tons of soil from eroding and protected more than 170,000 stream miles with riparian and grass buffers, more than 100,000 acres of bottomland hardwood trees, nearly 300,000 acres of flood-plain wetlands, and 250,000 acres each for duck nesting habitat and upland bird habitat.\n Category/Topic:\n Conservation\n Tags:\n Conservation\n Conservation Reserve Program\n Farm Bill\n Farmers\n Food Farm and Jobs Bill\n FSA\n Ohio", "author": "Cassie Bable"},
{"theme": "Trade", "content": "Natural Resources Conservation Service in\n Conservation\n Jan 06, \nA lesser prairie-chicken outfitted with a satellite telemetry harness on its back in CRP grass cover. Photo by Ashley Tanner\nThe lesser prairie-chicken and its habitat are making a comeback thanks to a USDA conservation program. The ground-dwelling bird was once abundant in the southern Great Plains, living in parts of Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. But over the past 150 years due to human migration and settlement, the lesser prairie-chicken population has declined by more than 90 percent, and its range has shrunk by over 80 percent.\nThe main threat facing the lesser prairie-chicken is the loss of habitat needed for survival caused by converting prairie to cropland, livestock overgrazing, oil and gas development, and building roads and power lines.\nAn Oklahoma State University study recently found that land enrolled in the Farm Service Agency’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) improves and increases lesser prairie-chicken habitat by providing large areas of grasslands and grassland connectivity. The birds were found to rarely move more than 0.3 miles to or from roost sites, and at the county scale, the presence of CRP appears to increase habitat suitability and roost-site accessibility. The study was summarized in a recent Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Conservation Insight (, 1.2 ).\nFunded by the NRCS Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) Wildlife Component, the study investigated how CRP acreage influences lesser prairie-chicken habitat suitability and the birds’ use of the land. The researchers placed satellite telemetry harnesses on the backs of 104 lesser prairie-chickens from to throughout Beaver County, Oklahoma, to track how the birds used space and moved about in areas with varying amounts of CRP land. Bird movements were evaluated at the individual pasture, county, and distribution-wide scales. Bird locations were gathered from GPS and citizen science (such as the eBird database) and used to determine habitat suitability at both the distribution-wide and county levels, while GPS locations and bird movement patterns (i.e., movements between consecutive locations) were used to assess space-use in relation to CRP land at the county and pasture levels.\nThe study showed that given the bird’s limited movements, habitat benefits vary according to the spatial arrangement of CRP across the landscape, so a patchwork of CRP, native range, and cropland areas may best provide for the needs of the lesser-prairie chicken. Another encouraging finding is that at the pasture scale, managed grazing of CRP land does not negatively influence the birds’ movements or habitat selection and appears compatible with the conservation objective of providing lesser prairie-chicken habitat.\nIn many ways, ground-dwelling birds are no different than their counterparts that nest in trees, safely above many predators. Like their high-flying relatives, birds that live on the ground need food, water, and shelter for survival. The Oklahoma State University study shows that CRP can help preserve and restore what the lesser prairie-chicken needs to survive and thrive.\nCRP is one of several USDA programs that USDA offers that can help producers manage for prairie chicken habitat. Producers can learn more by contacting their local Service Center.\nSigned into law in , CRP is one of the largest private-lands conservation programs in the United States. It was originally intended primarily to control soil erosion and potentially stabilize commodity prices by taking marginal lands out of production. The program has evolved over the years, providing many conservation and economic benefits. The program marks its 35-year anniversary this month.\nBob Sowers is an Information Management Specialist with NRCS in Beltsville, MD.

One-third of the food we eat requires pollinators, and commercial beekeepers transport honey bees hundreds of miles each year to pollinate almond trees and other crops.\nA scientist with USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and his colleagues have found that honey bee colonies foraging on land with a strong cover of clover species and alfalfa do more than three times better than colonies put next to crop fields of sunflowers or canola. The study was recently published in Scientific .\nThe scientists placed managed honey bee colonies next to land in the USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in North Dakota and let the bees forage from May to October. CRP lands are reserved for long-term conservation efforts and are often home to a wide variety of flowering plants that bees find appealing.\nThe CRP colonies had better health, more bees and greater ability to turn nectar and pollen into vitellogenin—a compound that serves as the base for producing royal jelly, which bees use to nurture larvae and turn larvae into queens. Vitellogenin is also a critical food storage reservoir for honey bees.\nAfter spending six months foraging on CRP land and then overwintering, more than 78 percent of the colonies in the study were graded A, the level commanding the highest price for pollination services in January.\nOf the colonies kept near intensely cultivated fields and then overwintered under the same circumstances as the CRP colonies, only 20 percent could be rated Grade A.\n“With California almond growers having paid an average of $190 per Grade A colony in the almond pollination season, the need for beekeepers to have access to land that has diverse and substantial nectar and pollen sources is obvious,” explained ARS research microbiologist Kirk E. Anderson. Anderson is with the ARS Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in Tucson, Arizona.\nAnderson and his team, including ARS molecular biologist Vincent Ricigliano, found that greater stores of vitellogenin were the best predictor of colony size after winter. The protein-rich compound prolongs the lifespans of queens and forager bees and strongly influences key behaviors that increase colony survival.\nThis study highlights the value of high-quality forage, such as that provided by CRP land, to honey bee production in the Northern Great Plains region, which hosts close to half the U.S. managed bee population (about 1 million colonies) from May through October.\n Category/Topic:\n Research and Science\n Tags:\n Agricultural Research Service\n ARS\n Honeybees\n Bees\n Conservation Reserve Program\n North Dakota", "author": "Sue Kendall"},

The National Organic Program – part of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service – enforces the organic regulations, ensuring the integrity of the USDA Organic Seal.\nIn order to make an organic claim or use the USDA Organic Seal, the final product must follow strict production, handling and labeling standards and go through the organic certification process.  The standards address a variety of factors such as soil quality, animal raising practices, and pest and weed control.  Synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, irradiation, and genetic engineering may not be used.  \nOrganic producers rely on natural substances and physical, mechanical, or biologically based farming methods to the fullest extent possible.  Organic produce must be grown on soil that had no prohibited substances (most synthetic fertilizers and pesticides) applied for three years prior to harvest.  As for organic meat, the standards require that animals are raised in living conditions accommodating their natural behaviors, fed organic feed, and not administered antibiotics or hormones. \nThere are four distinct labeling categories for organic products – 100 percent organic, organic, “made with” organic ingredients, and specific organic ingredients.  \nIn the “100 Percent Organic” category, products must be made up of 100 percent certified organic ingredients.  The label must include the name of the certifying agent and may include the USDA Organic Seal and/or the 100 percent organic claim.  \nIn the “Organic” category, the product and ingredients must be certified organic, except where specified on National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances.  Non-organic ingredients allowed per the National List may be used, but no more than five percent of the combined total ingredients may contain non-organic content.  Additionally, the label must include the name of the certifying agent, and may include the USDA Organic Seal and/or the organic claim.\nFor multi-ingredient products in the “made with” organic category, at least 70 percent of the product must be certified organic ingredients.  The organic seal cannot be used on the product, and the final product cannot be represented as organic – only up to three ingredients or ingredient categories can be represented as organic.  Any remaining ingredients are not to be organically produced but must be produced without excluded methods (genetic engineering). All non-agricultural products must be allowed on the National List.  For example, processed organic foods may contain some approved non-agricultural ingredients, like enzymes in yogurt, pectin in fruit jams, or baking soda in baked goods.\nMulti-ingredient products with less than 70 percent certified organic content would fall under the “specific organic ingredients,” and don’t need to be certified. These products cannot display the USDA Organic Seal or use the word organic on the principal display panel.  They can list certified organic ingredients in the ingredient list and the percentage of organic ingredients. \nBecoming familiar with organic labeling allows consumers to make informed decisions about the products they purchase.  Consumers can be assured that the integrity of USDA organic products are verified from farm to market.
