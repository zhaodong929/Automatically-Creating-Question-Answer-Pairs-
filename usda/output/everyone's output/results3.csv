"National School Lunch Week: Reasons to Celebrate  National School Lunch Week is underway this week. It’s an annual event, of course, but this year I think we have a lot to celebrate because more and more people are coming to understand how important it is to provide America’s school children with a healthy nutrition environment at school.   In fact, as I look around, I see encouraging developments in many areas, but none more so than the growing number of schools that have decided to take on USDA’s HealthierUS School Challenge.

"USDA Program Helps High School Students Realize Ag Jobs are Everywhere  Here at the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), one of the many benefits of creating marketing opportunities for ag businesses is seeing first-hand how the industry supports 1 in 12 jobs all over the country. In addition to feeding the world, the ag industry continues to be the strong backbone in our nation’s economy – in both rural and urban areas. To help continue this trend, we set out to groom the next generation of ag leaders. Our Fruit and Vegetable Program developed a strong relationship with high schools in a couple of the country’s largest cities, allowing students to work with the agency while still enrolled in high school. We started in New York City, home of the Hunt’s Point Terminal Market – the nation’s largest wholesale produce market – so that students at John Bowne High School could get their feet wet in the agriculture industry. We did this by offering the students the opportunity to come on board as interns for our Specialty Crops Inspection Division (SCI). Employees in this division inspect produce entering and leaving Hunt’s Point, which employs more than 10,000 people and generates $2 billion in sales annually. Thanks to a budding relationship with this school featuring a strong ag curriculum, students can now get practical work experience while in school.  Lorenzo A.

"AMS Fruit and Vegetable Programs Deputy Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Jul 19,   USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) recently became a participant in the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) Internship Program, which brings students to Washington, DC, to gain valuable working experience.  This is the first year that our agency has participated in this program. AMS is utilizing our relationship with AAPD to create a more diverse workforce, one that includes more employees with disabilities.  We understand the importance of designing employment practices that consider the needs of all employees.  A diverse workforce introduces everyone to unique perspectives that ultimately help us find innovative approaches to solving problems and solidifying our business model.  This is one of the ways AMS can continue to provide services that benefit everyone in the greater public. This summer, Maya Ariel, an undergraduate student studying business administration at Rochester Institute of Technology, joined AMS as an intern for the agency’s Fruit and Vegetable Programs.  In her position, Maya, who is Deaf, helps Christopher Purdy, the program’s business development specialist, identify ways for AMS to partner with other organizations and market the program’s services.  By providing Maya with the accommodations she needs to be successful, AMS has gained a truly valuable team member. AMS values its partnerships with diverse organizations, such as AAPD, that enable us to identify, attract and recruit top-tier talent.  We encourage students to take advantage of the internship program so that they can become familiar with the agency and learn about other career opportunities. We support AAPD’s belief that people with disabilities are an important and intricate part of diversity in the workforce. AAPD recently came to USDA Headquarters to chronicle a day in the life of an intern.  Video footage of Ariel and the rest of the AAPD interns’ summer experiences will be available by visiting the AAPD Internship Program Web site in the early fall.

"Make a Cafeteria Date to Eat a Healthy Lunch with Your Child at School  More than 50 million children around the country attend schools that participate in USDA’s National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Programs.  And not only are their meals full of nutritious ingredients – with 99 percent of schools nationwide reporting that they are successfully meeting the updated nutrition standards – their entire learning environment fosters healthy habits now and throughout the rest of their lives.  During National School Lunch Week , USDA and partners like the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, are celebrating this progress.  It’s National School Lunch Week and this year we have more to celebrate than ever before! Over the past decade, significant policy changes have sparked a national movement that has transformed the school nutrition landscape and created a new healthier era for school foods. Many of these policies were initiated by USDA, including updated nutrition standards for the meals and snacks schools offer, as well as updated requirements for local wellness policies. Thanks to these developments and incredible efforts by schools to put them in place, millions of students across America not only have healthier meals, snacks, and drinks at school – they’re also learning healthy habits that will last a lifetime.

"USDA Food and Nutrition Service Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 07,  The USDA Farm to School Planning Toolkit provides school districts helpful questions to consider and resources to reference when building their programs. Healthy habits are taking root in our nation’s schools.  Thanks to an important commitment made possible by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of , more of our nation’s kids are being exposed to lessons about healthy eating and learning where their food comes from.  Established as part of that legislation, USDA’s Farm to School Program plays a vital role in improving health outcomes for our schoolchildren. This October, during National Farm to School Month, it’s important to acknowledge farm to school programs’ contributions to fostering a healthier next generation.  These programs support the work of parents, teachers, school nutrition professionals, and communities to make sure the healthy choice is the easy choice for America’s children. Farm to school brings local or regionally produced foods into school cafeterias; hands-on learning activities such as school gardening, farm visits, and culinary classes; and the integration of food-related education into the classroom curriculum.  To help schools create or strengthen an existing program, we recently launched the Farm to School Planning Toolkit to provide tips and examples, insights, and research-based resources.  The accessible guide enables schools, school districts and community partners to map out and build on their program’s vision. In USDA’s vision, school cafeterias championing U.S. agriculture and promoting local foods are the norm, not the exception.  Local foods span the school meal tray and include everything from the salad bar and fresh fruit and vegetable servings to the wheat in the pizza crust, beans in the chili, rice in the stir fry, turkey in the sandwiches, and cheese in the quesadillas. Research shows that children in schools with farm to school programs eat more fruits and vegetables and are more willing to try new, healthy foods—positive steps in the right direction in the battle against childhood obesity.   By instilling smarter, more nutritious behaviors, we make it easier for our future leaders to grow, thrive and reach their highest potential.  USDA understands that schools have unique circumstances and needs and have constructed a roadmap to ensure long-term success for any type of farm to school program.  We’re proud to say that farm to school programs now exist in every state and in every type of district – large and small, rural and urban alike.  Designed with this in mind, the toolkit offers eleven focus areas including sections on building your program, buying local, menu planning and promoting your program. The toolkit is just one way USDA is there to help schools dig in with their farm to school programs. A new video will be featured throughout October. To view the videos, take a look at the complete series. And to receive information and updates about USDA’s Farm to School Program, please sign up for our Farm to School E-letter.

"Animals  Plants  Jun 17,   Written by Bill Wood, State Biologist, AlaskaLet’s say you’ve just awakened from a restless 6-month nap. You check on the kids and it seems like everyone is really hungry. On your way to the grocery store you pass a chicken take-out joint and the smell of those fryers is irresistible. With kids in tow, you perambulate into the unattended shop; by all appearances, it seems you may have discovered the proverbial “free lunch.” Who could say no? This happens for scores of mammas and pappas all over the Kenai Peninsula every spring—mamma and pappa bears, that is. And it’s not just chicken on the menu. Equally delectable items like dog food, honey and fish, not to mention livestock feed, a wide variety of human foods and other attractive items draw hungry bears that are just following their natural instincts. Bears spend as much as 80 percent of their waking day feeding or foraging for food. So when they’re rewarded for their efforts with a fairly easy meal and experience no negative repurcussions, they can quickly become habituated to that attraction. Bears can be destructive and these situations can potentially be dangerous for all involved. Chicken coops, beehives, smokehouses and the like can quickly become demolition sites with lost equipment, money, time and effort. Sometimes encounters between humans and bears don’t turn out so well for the people, but they never turn out well for the bear. People can be proactive in reducing the potential for these kinds of human-bear encounters in a few important and sensible ways. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program (WHIP) helps provide solutions for issues like this one. WHIP’s cost-share funding assistance is used to improve a wide variety of wildlife habitat conditions and help reduce negative impacts to wildlife species on private land. For the fiscal year, NRCS has developed a new initiative available to landowners only on the Kenai Peninsula. The new project idea seeks to reduce potential up-close-and-personal interactions between people and bears at sites of human-induced bear attractants and provides matching funding to landowners to install permanent electric bear fencing. This type of fencing is an effective technique to exclude bears from areas where they should not seek food. After receiving their first shock, many bears seem to sense the electrical charge in the fence lines and avoid those fences. When the fences are properly designed, even their appearance can remind bears of their previous unpleasant encounter. NRCS, in cooperation with Alaska Department of Fish and Game, will also provide fence designs and site management plans and recommendations for the installation of the fences. Site inventory and assessment is part of the technical assistance landowners will receive, in addition to help with purchase and installation costs. To find out more about the program contact the NRCS Kenai Field Office at 283-, the NRCS Homer Field Office at 235-, or the office of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in Kenai at 262-.

"Acting Deputy Under Secretary, USDA Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Mar 01,  Visit DietaryGuidelines.gov to learn more about the process of developing the DGA. Interested in being part of our process as we develop the - Dietary for Americans (DGA)? Start today at DietaryGuidelines.gov. Coinciding with the beginning of National Nutrition Month®, we are excited to announce, along with our partners at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), a new step early in the process to develop the - DGA. For the first time, USDA and HHS are posting for public comment the topics and supporting scientific questions to be examined at the start of the DGA development process. The public comment period will be open until March 30, . This important, new step reflects our continued commitment to ensure that the DGA development process is transparent, inclusive, and science-driven – and to incorporate recommendations and feedback on the process received from stakeholders. Transparency and customer service are among the key tenets that guide our decisions at USDA. The American taxpayer is an essential customer – indeed, a shareholder. We are proud to take this important step forward toward greater transparency and ensure that the American public’s voice is heard throughout this process. As you review the topics and supporting scientific questions posted for public consideration and comment, it’s important to note the following:  Life stage approach: USDA and HHS are proposing a life stage approach for this edition of the DGA, focusing on priority scientific questions from birth through older adulthood. This approach is a new opportunity due in part to audience expansion, per the Farm Bill, which mandated that starting with the - edition, the DGA provide guidance for women who are pregnant, as well as infants and toddlers from birth to 24 months.  Criteria: The topics USDA and HHS are posting for public comment for the - DGA are based on four criteria: relevance (topic is within scope of the DGA and its focus on food-based recommendations, not clinical for medical treatment); importance (topic for which there is new, relevant and represents an area of substantial public health concern, uncertainty, and/or knowledge gap); potential federal impact (probability that guidance on the topic would inform federal food and nutrition policies and programs); and avoiding duplication (topic is not currently addressed through existing evidence-based federal guidance, other than the Dietary ). As we go through this multiyear process to update and publish the - DGA, it’s also important to note that as the Dietary has evolved over the decades, it isn’t about focusing on individual foods or food groups. We are looking at what we eat and drink as a whole, and how that can help prevent diseases and keep people healthy. As you will see in the months and years leading up to the release of the - DGA, our process will include new approaches to provide the public with more transparency and opportunities to participate. We welcome your voice as we work hard to deliver on our continued commitment to our customers – you. You can find additional information on the DGA process at DietaryGuidelines.gov.

"Small Investment Leads to Increased Fruit and Vegetable Consumption among SNAP Recipients  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .13  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  AudioWASHINGTON, July 24, – Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced the results of USDA's Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP) and discussed additional steps USDA and its partners are taking to encourage recipients to purchase healthy foods using SNAP benefits.Authorized by Congress through the Farm Bill, HIP tested the impact of incentivizing fruit and vegetable purchases among a small group of SNAP recipients in Hampden, Mass. The pilot determined that an ongoing investment of less than 15 cents per person per day may result in a 25 percent increase in fruit and vegetable consumption among adults. Adults receiving the HIP incentive consumed, on average, an ounce more fruits and vegetables per day than non-participants.""Although healthy foods aren't necessarily more expensive, many low income people face time and resource challenges when it comes to putting healthy food on the table that can make less healthy options seem more appealing,"" said Vilsack. ""The results of the Healthy Incentives Pilot demonstrate the clear impact that promoting nutritious food choices can have on improving the healthfulness of SNAP purchases.""Vilsack also highlighted ongoing public-private efforts that provide support and incentives to SNAP participants to purchase more healthy foods. He cited a pilot project in Minnesota that offers $5 coupons to SNAP households for the purchase of fresh fruits and vegetables and a pilot project in Michigan to make locally sourced produce available in corner grocery stores in metropolitan Detroit.""Research to date shows that incentives can work, but we know that no single solution can solve the problems of poor diet and obesity among American children and families,"" said Vilsack. ""That is why we are supporting a broad spectrum of SNAP-focused strategies that empower low-income families to purchase more healthy foods.""Providing science-based nutrition advice and expanding the availability of healthy food to all Americans is a major goal of USDA's nutrition assistance programs and this Administration. The strategies highlighted today complement other initiatives underway at USDA to promote healthy eating by all Americans, including:USDA's Food and Nutrition Service oversees the administration of 15 nutrition assistance programs, including SNAP, that touch the lives of one in four Americans over the course of a year.

"What is composting? Composting is the process of recycling organic materials into an amendment that can be used to enrich soil and plants. Types of Compost Bins Typical Compost Bin Tumbler Compost Bin Worm Compost Bin Why Compost? Food scraps and yard waste currently make up 20 to 30 percent of what we throw away. USDA is fighting food waste and you can too. Composting is nature’s way of recycling! Here are a few reasons to get started today:  Feed the soil without using chemical fertilizers.  Keep food waste out of the landfills and prevent greenhouse gas emissions.  Conserve water by building healthy soils. Get Started There are different ways to get started composting today. You can start a backyard composting bin or use worms to do the work. Backyard composting in three easy steps:  Choose a location. A good site is dry in either the sun or partial shade.  Set-up your compost bin. Purchase a compost bin or create an inexpensive bin with wire mesh and 3-4 poles for support.  Get composting. Include 2-3 parts “brown material” (fall leaves, twigs, shredded newspaper, straw, wood chips, and shredded wood) and 1 part “green material” (vegetable and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, crushed eggshells, garden and grass clippings, tea bags without staples) by volume then add water to keep moist. Don’t forget to turn your pile! A monthly rotation is a good rule of thumb. Worm Composting Setup:  Select Container. Purchase a worm bin or make your own from a plastic or wood storage container. Worm bins require holes drilled for aeration and drainage. There are several online sources with instructions to create a worm bin.  Locate bin. The ideal temperature for worm composting is 59-77 degrees F. The bin can be kept indoors or outdoors in the shade. During colder months, insulate the worm bin with blankets, straw, or other material to keep it warm.  Worm Bin Setup:  Worms need bedding such as a mixture of non-glossy paper, cardboard, or leaves. Soak the material for 10 minutes, wring out the water so it is moist but not saturated, and place it in the bin with a handful of soil.  Now you are ready to add your worms. There are over 9,000 species of earthworms, but only 7 are suitable for vermicomposting. The most widely used species is the “red wiggler” which you can buy from a worm grower. Do not use worms from a bait shop or your garden since they will not be able to thrive in your worm bin.  Feed your worms veggie and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, eggshells, and moistened bread. Avoid meat, fish, dairy products, citrus fruits, twigs and branches.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Farm Production and Conservation Business Center in  Conservation  Jun 23,  FWC Photo by Andy Wraithmell, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Did you know the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil scientists are playing an important role in saving Florida’s manatees? These giant, but gentle, creatures are adored by residents and visitors to Florida. Unfortunately, though, their numbers have been threatened in recent years throughout the state. Manatees in Florida’s Indian River Lagoon (IRL), which stretches 156 miles along Florida’s eastern coast, have been starving to death at an alarming rate over the last two years. These deaths can be attributed to a lack of seagrass, their main source of food, which is being affected by algal blooms. As the algae blooms destroy seagrass beds, it causes sediment to float to the water’s surface. The water goes from clear to murky, making it harder for light to penetrate the water and provide sustenance to the seagrass. This creates a vicious cycle where more seagrass dies, more sunlight is blocked, and the manatees are left with less food to eat. NRCS is part of a team working to address the challenge, along with St. Johns River Water Management District, the University of Florida, among many other national and state agencies. The scientists go out on the IRL in pontoon boats and use sonar to conduct underwater soil surveys to gather information on the healthiest areas and the most degraded areas of the lagoon. The information is used to decide where to concentrate restoration efforts. This information has helped improve lagoons through actions like clams, oysters, and seagrass being deployed to aid in filtering and clearing the water. Scientists hope that continued improvement will eventually lead to the full restoration of manatees in the IRL.

"AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Dec 20,  Years ago, I spent my days watching pecan roots change the color of solutions from clear to red as they reduced iron for uptake. It may not sound exciting, but that was the topic of my undergraduate research internship at USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Children’s Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) in Houston, TX, under the direction of my mentor, ARS scientist Dr. Michael Grusak. Dr. Grusak taught me to consider the link between the laboratory and society. His lab focused on improving crop mineral uptake, which could benefit society by increasing the nutritional value of crops for humans. The emphasis on this connection between plant biology and society stimulated my interest in plant biology and, eventually, led me to pursue my own Ph.D. in plant physiology and genetics. Now, that summer job has led me back to USDA as a Science and Technology Policy Fellow through the American Association of the Advancement of Science in the USDA Office of the Chief Scientist, where I work directly to connect science to society. In my new role, I’m able to use science to inform agricultural policy making decisions by collaborating with others in USDA to develop science-based solutions to emerging issues, especially those related to improving agricultural resilience in response to climate change. As an undergraduate intern, I was excited to contribute to ARS research, but never imagined that the roots I put down at CNRC would lead me back to USDA, supporting priorities that help advance American agriculture and aid in an all-of-government approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change. ARS internship opportunities support future generations of the agricultural workforce. My internship introduced me to the importance of agricultural research and attracted me to a career where I could use science to inform agricultural policy.

"Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19?  Last year, as COVID-19 rattled the world economy and disrupted trade flows, agricultural trade remained mostly stable, falling only two percent during the initial wave of infections and lockdowns, before bouncing back and ending the year up 3.5 percent. But the growth in agricultural trade doesn’t mean that trade flows were insulated from the effects of the pandemic. Much of was in fact shaped by other factors. For instance, 95% of global agricultural trade growth came from China and was driven in part by non-pandemic related factors of increased feed demand, efforts to restock grain reserves, and policy factors. A recent paper by USDA’s Office of the Chief Economist, Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19? Findings from an Econometric Assessment (, 1.4 ) (Arita et al.), suggests that while agricultural trade remained stable at the aggregate level, a deeper empirical analysis reveals there were still significant disruptions due to the pandemic.

"USDA state-by-state show top states for Federal local food investments include Kentucky, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Texas and Alabama  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .15  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  WASHINGTON, June 30, — Today, the Obama Administration invited communities to participate in Local Foods, Local Places, a federal initiative providing direct technical support to build strong local food systems as part of a community's emerging economic action plans. Under this effort, a team of agricultural, transportation, public health, environmental, and regional economic experts will work directly with local communities to spur local economic growth and improve the quality of life for all residents.Local food sales topped $11.7 billion in according to industry estimates, underscoring the economic benefit that a local food system can offer a community. As part of today's announcement, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) released an updated state-by-state ""Made in Rural America"" report illustrating the impact of USDA's investments in rural communities, including local food. USDA has invested more than $800 million in more than 29,100 local and regional food businesses and infrastructure projects over the past six years.""These state by state analyses reaffirm that local food is rapidly growing from a niche market to an integrated system recognized for its economic boost to communities across the country,"" said Secretary Vilsack. ""Local food creates new market opportunities for farmers, brings fresh meals into schools and other institutions, expands healthy food access to underserved communities, and builds infrastructure needed to support ranchers and other meat processors. By investing in projects at the local level, this Administration is encouraging growth in this sector and creating new opportunities for families who live in rural America.""This is the second year of the Local Foods, Local Places program. In , 26 rural and urban communities participated in the program to create year-round, downtown markets featuring foods from local farmers; establish retail outlets to help revitalize small-town main streets; build centrally located community kitchens or food hubs to aggregate and market local foods; support business incubators to help entrepreneurs start food-related businesses on main streets; enhance public spaces for people to walk or bicycle to farmers markets and local restaurants; assist schoolchildren to grow their own food and make healthy local food accessible to families, including via SNAP benefits; and develop community gardens in walkable, transit-accessible places.Technical support teams through Local Foods, Local Places helped Osceola, Arkansas (pop 7,700) develop a new health foods cooking curriculum for the local school district, create a plan for a new downtown farmers market and implement infrastructure improvement efforts; guided North Little Rock, Arkansas (population 62,000) to enhance the livability of an emerging neighborhood though a new food hub; and worked with Wheeling, West Virginia (pop 28,000) to revitalize underused property into a community orchard, multi-use food facility, and a mobile market.Local Foods, Local Places is a partnership between USDA, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Transportation (DoT), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Delta Regional Authority (DRA). The effort is part of the White House Rural Council's ""Rural Impact"" effort to improve quality of life and upward mobility for kids and families in rural and tribal communities. Together, the agencies are investing $800,000 to support this round of assistance. Application and deadlines are available on line.Since , USDA has invested in 29,100 food hubs, small scale processing, farmers market and other opportunities in local food across all 50 states and the US territories. This includes USDA investments in the local food sector through over 12,000 microloans, smaller loans of up to $50,000 for small-scale producers who often sell products locally; and over 13,000 high tunnels, low-cost covered structures that extend the growing season and make locally-grown products available later into the year.Among the top ten states with federally funded local food projects are Kentucky, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Minnesota, West Virginia, Iowa, and Michigan. Five of these states (Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and West Virginia) are part USDA's StrikeForce Initiative for Rural Growth and Opportunity which coordinates USDA assistance in the Nation's most economically challenged rural areas.Many of these projects can be found on the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass. Searchable by state, zip code, project type and funding program, the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass maps federal local food investments made by USDA and 10 other federal agencies between fiscal years -. The Compass is part of the USDA's Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative.

"Foreign Agricultural Service Administrator in  Trade  Oct 22,  Trade visitors sample a variety of cheeses at the Rogue Creamery stand in the USA Pavilion. Rogue Creamery, an artisan cheese company, is dedicated to sustainability and the art and tradition of making the world's finest handmade cheese. Earlier this week I traveled to Paris to attend the 24th edition of the Salon International d’Alimentation (SIAL). This 5-day event is one of the largest international food and beverage trade exhibitions in the world, attracting 5,500 exhibitors and over 147,000 trade-only visitors representing 188 countries. I was very impressed by the wide variety of U.S. products on display and by the number of participating countries. For nearly 20 years, the United States has participated in SIAL Paris. This year’s USA Pavilion at SIAL was the largest to date, with some 140 exhibitors occupying over 2,700 square meters. SIAL offers U.S. food exporters the opportunity to test products and meet with European as well as other international traders and industry professionals. Clearly, this is a major factor for the large U.S. presence. One of my primary reasons for attending the show was to meet face to face with U.S. Cooperators, exhibitors, and importers from Europe and other regions, as well as industry leaders. I had the pleasure of talking with many small- and medium-sized companies and Cooperator groups who expressed their appreciation of our programs and services, including American Food Service, Head Country Food Products, Rogue Creamery, U.S. Meat Export Federation, USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, and representatives from the state regional trade groups (SRTG), just to name a few. Tuesday night’s SRTG-hosted trade reception, as well as an industry reception, was yet another wonderful opportunity to talk with Pavilion exhibitors and trade visitors. Reception guests included buyer groups from North Africa and the Middle East recruited by our FAS Field offices. The European Union (EU) is a major trading partner for the United States. The EU is America’s fifth largest market for agricultural and food products. France alone imports nearly $1 billion of U.S. farm goods annually. However, the scope of SIAL extended beyond the EU, reaching importers from all corners of the world. Building a market presence is sometimes a long process, and participation in these types of trade shows introduces foreign buyers and consumers more quickly and effectively to the attributes and advantages of American products. Looking back on the response of visitors to the wide variety of U.S. food and beverage products showcased in the Pavilion, I am optimistic that the demand for U.S. agricultural products is strong, and our reputation as a reliable supplier of safe, wholesome, and innovative products is excellent.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  Sep 11,   Evelyn Eagleman, 63, remembers driving the long distance off Rocky Boy’s Indian Reservation, Mont., to rescue her grandson when he was two. His father was serving in the military and his mother had been arrested on drug charges.  The boy needed a new start. She brought the child home to Rocky Boy, where she and her husband, Francis, became the child’s foster parents.  Her grandson, now a teenager, will soon graduate from high school and plans to major in forestry in college.  Eagleman said she and her husband are proud of the man he has become and gives much credit to the Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program at Stone Child College, in Box Elder, Mont. “There are a lot of legal issues involved with foster parenting, and I can’t remember them all, but with this program, I know where to go for help,” she said.   “We learned about our rights as foster grandparents.” The Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) through its Tribal College Extension Grant program. This grant allows land-grants institutions, also known as tribal colleges, to provide education to reservation communities. The 32 colleges and universities that receive this funding provide a host of services, depending on the community needs. Stone Child College uses its grant for many youth-focused outreach efforts, as well as the Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program.  According to Mary St. Pierre, the Extension project director and leader of the grandparent program, about 10 percent of the community’s children are being raised by grandparents. The U.S. Census that, nationally, 7 million grandparents had grandchildren living with them, a 64 percent increase since . In about one-third of these cases grandparents had assumed a custodial role. The Census that for American Indians, 97,278 grandparents live with their grandchildren and more than half have primary custodial responsibility.  Many times, the parent lives with the family, too, as it is with the Eagleman’s. St. Pierre’s next goal for NIFA’s Tribal College Extension Grant program is to develop a Positive Indian Parenting program that will accompany the Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Obama Administration Launches Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture  From record droughts in Kansas to deadly wildfires in California, the United States is feeling the effects of climate change. These same conditions have a dire impact across the developing world, especially for poor, rural smallholder farmers whose very lives are threatened every time the rains arrive late, the floods rush in, or the temperature soars. By , the world’s population is expected to reach nine billion people. Feeding them will require at least a 60 percent increase in agricultural production. There is no greater challenge to meeting this need than climate change.

"Oh Maple Syrup, How I Love Thee. Let me Count the Ways.  Okay, yes it’s Maple Syrup Day, an unofficial holiday, but the day allows us to celebrate and recognize this often underrated commodity. So in honor of this lovely product, here are some interesting tidbits that you may not know. I use maple syrup on many things; not just pancakes, waffles and French toast, but also in recipes like soups and casseroles, to sweeten granola or oatmeal, even coffee. I’ve used it on ice cream and even snow, on salads and in salad dressings. My own step-father is known to take a shot of maple syrup every now-and-then. It is delightful on its own. Maple syrup can also be used to make maple cream, maple sugar, and maple candy.

"Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  Health and Safety  Animals  Plants  May 09,  USDA is taking a multi-faceted approach to supporting the American sheep and lamb industry, working with researchers and market analysts to identify strategies and goals. The U.S. sheep and lamb industry has been shrinking for decades as the numbers of sheep and producers have declined since World War II.  Consolidation of the sheep packing industry, higher feed and energy costs, continuous loses to predation, and lower consumption, coupled with competition from imports of lamb cuts, have taken their toll on U.S. producers.  In response to industry needs, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has been working with the American Lamb Board (ALB) and the American Sheep Industry Association (ASI) on initiatives aimed at ensuring the long-term viability of the industry. The ALB recently initiated a study to identify the challenges, propose solutions, and develop strategies to strengthen the industry’s competitive advantage.  By working with a marketing firm and using and services offered by USDA, ALB hopes this study’s findings will help return the industry to profitability.  AMS is ready to assist ALB as they lay the groundwork and identify goals and benchmarks. Another way AMS is assisting the industry is in identifying opportunities to improve Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) for lamb.  LMR was established to collect and publish price and volume information to encourage competition in the marketplace.  However, given the consolidation of the industry, it has become difficult to publish lamb market information on a consistent basis due to the LMR confidentiality requirements.  Last fall, ASI commissioned the Livestock Marketing Information Center (LMIC) to conduct a study of the LMR program, and over the course of 5 months, met with AMS to learn more about how USDA administers the lamb reporting program. The final report proposed improvement recommendations to lamb reporting.  Some of the recommendations included lowering the reporting thresholds for packers and importers, evaluating the confidentiality policy for LMR, and eliminating categories and that do not have utility. AMS has reviewed the report and is engaged with ASI to determine the best solutions for the recommendations.  While some of the recommendations will require regulatory changes, many of the proposals can be addressed easily.  In fact, AMS has already eliminated the western regional lamb , changed the National daily lamb report to a weekly report, modified the reported weight categories, and removed unused purchase type categories. AMS is working with ASI on other projects, such as determining ways in which slaughter lambs are bought to ensure that the LMR purchase types are still relevant.  AMS is also working to develop strategies to more accurately define the lamb maturity window for the grade standards and will work with FSIS on a more agreeable term for “yearling mutton” such as “yearling lamb.” AMS and ASI are cooperating on the potential development of a lamb tenderness standard, and the potential development of a non-hormone treated lamb export certification protocol with the European Union. The ALB and ASI recently received USDA approval to explore lamb instrument grading, through funding received from the National Sheep Industry Improvement Center.  The project will be a two phased approach to finalizing USDA’s standardization of the concept and evaluating the benefits and return on the investment to garner industry acceptance. The USDA is committed to working with our partners in the industry to not only meet these challenges but to succeed in creating an industry that provides quality products to consumers and increased producer returns here at home.

Photo by A. Jay, Chun-Li Integrated Marketing and Communications Co., Ltd Thanks to Foreign Agricultural Service employees serving at USDA’s 98 international posts, American Thanksgiving traditions – and food – are being enjoyed around the world this November.  This is certainly the case in Taiwan, where the Agricultural Trade Office (ATO) in Taipei teamed with China TV to highlight the holiday on an episode of the popular TV show “King of the Happy Life” this week. Valerie Brown from ATO Taipei was joined by Daisy Hong, who represents the grower-owned cooperative Ocean Spray, and chef C.K. Chen from Taipei’s Sherwood Hotel. In addition to Thanksgiving staples like turkey and pumpkin pie, they featured new recipes, including stuffing and hot cranberry-apple cider made with Ocean Spray products. After taping the show, Chen began taking orders for traditional American Thanksgiving baskets, which the Sherwood Hotel sells every year. Not only do these baskets feature traditional American dishes, many of the ingredients are exported by the United States, including turkey, cranberries, broccoli, potatoes, beets, lettuce and California wine. Following the Thanksgiving episode of “King of the Happy Life” last year, Chen was so overwhelmed with orders that he had to limit the number of baskets available this year. The popularity of these Thanksgiving baskets is reflective of increased demand for U.S. food and agriculture around the world.  Earlier this month, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that U.S. agricultural exports reached a record $137.4 billion in fiscal year , which exceeds the previous record by $22.5 billion. The agricultural trade surplus soared to a record $42.7 billion in FY. This rise in exports is good news for all Americans, especially considering every $1 billion of U.S. agricultural exports supports 8,400 American jobs. Last year alone, agricultural exports helped support 1.15 million jobs. And that gives us all a reason to be thankful.

"Director, USDA Agricultural Trade Office, Tokyo in  Trade  Mar 27,   Helping U.S. exporters tap into Japan’s $670 billion food market is a top priority for the Foreign Agricultural Service’s Agricultural Trade Office (ATO) in Japan. One way we do this is by organizing the USA Pavilion at FOODEX Japan, the largest food and beverage trade show in Asia. This year’s show, which was held March 6-9, drew 74,000-plus attendees, not just from Japan but also from other Asian markets including Korea, Taiwan, China, Thailand and Hong Kong. U.S. Ambassador to Japan John V. Roos (right) visits a U.S. organic onion exhibit at the USDA-endorsed FOODEX Japan. The food and beverage show took place March 6-9 and is the largest show of its kind in Asia. The U.S. Pavilion was one of the largest at the show and featured more than 70 companies. (Photo Courtesy of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo) The USA Pavilion was one of the largest at the show, featuring more than 70 U.S. companies and a wide range of “Made in America” products, including meat and seafood, fresh produce, wine and specialty snack foods. Participants had an opportunity to showcase their wares to key decision-makers from restaurants, supermarkets, wholesalers, grocery stores, foodservice and hospitality companies, fast food chains and convenience stores, as well as distributors, agents and brokers. Japan is the world’s third-largest economy and the United States’ fourth-largest agricultural export customer, purchasing a record $15.6 billion of U.S. agricultural, forestry and fishery goods in . For U.S. companies, entry into the lucrative Japanese market is often the first step towards expansion to the rest of Asia. That’s why our ATO strives to help U.S. companies shine at the FOODEX show, providing logistical support and briefings, offering samples of U.S. products at a “Gateway to American Food” demonstration area, and helping match U.S. exhibitors with potential business contacts. While final results from the show are not yet in, a preliminary survey indicates U.S. exhibitors made more than $13 million in projected sales. Over three years, more than 1,000 U.S. companies and organizations—about 70 percent of them small and medium sized businesses—participated in 87 USDA-endorsed trade shows in 20 countries. On-site sales totaled more than $350 million and 12-month projected sales reported by exhibitors were estimated more than $2.7 billion. The companies made over 42,000 business contacts and displayed nearly 20,000 new products in various markets on all continents.  Trade shows give companies even more opportunities to make business contacts and share their products with potential buyers and consumers. Currently, the American brand of agriculture is surging in popularity worldwide. Farm exports in fiscal year reached a record high of $137.4 billion—exceeding past highs by $22.5 billion—and supported 1.15 million jobs here at home.

"Taking Charge: How Rural Residents Are Switching from Employees to Business Owners  The retirement of the baby boom generation of business proprietors is predicted to result in a major turnover in ownership. Developing an ownership succession plan is especially challenging in rural areas where many small businesses are at risk of closing from the lack of locally available financing to keep them in operation. Rural Development’s Business and Industry (B&I) Guaranteed Loan Program now has new capabilities as of this August that specifically accommodate the needs of financing ownership succession. B&I guarantee borrowers can now apply to loans for financing the transfer of business ownership within a family, usually involving a sale from parents to children. Prior to recent changes in the rules it was assumed that within families the transfer of ownership was always a seller-financed transaction. Yet, some retiring business owners may need to immediately take the sales revenue out to finance their retirement.

"Posted by USDA in  USDA Results  Oct 22,   October 20 marked the official launch of the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) at USDA for the Washington, D.C. metro area. Administered by the government’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM), CFC is the world’s largest workplace giving program. Since its inception in , federal employees have contributed more than $6 billion to the non-profit community. This year, USDA has set a goal of raising just under $2 million from its approximately 10,000 employees in the national capital area. The official kickoff on Tuesday morning was an exciting event in the Whitten Building patio featuring top USDA leadership and more than 20 CFC registered non-profit organizations. Secretary Tom Vilsack and Undersecretary for Research, Education, and Economics, Dr. Raj Shah, led off the event by speaking movingly about the ways that non-profit organizations touch all of our lives in critical and transformative ways. Dr. Shah spoke about incredible array of non-profits that participate in CFC, from groups doing lifesaving work fighting malaria in Africa to charities feeding hungry people right here in Washington, D.C. Secretary Vilsack spoke about his own birth in a Catholic orphanage, saying that he probably would not be here today if not for the nuns who took care of him and his birth mother. Both stressed the importance of giving generously this year more than ever, as the worldwide economic crisis has dramatically increased the needs of the non-profit community even as donations to the sector have fallen off. Secretary Vilsack emphasized that as federal workers, we have all been blessed with good jobs, and that CFC is a wonderful opportunity to share that blessing with people in need. After Secretary Vilsack’s remarks, he officially opened the campaign by handing in his own completed pledge form. Dr. Shah and much of USDA’s senior leadership followed suit, as the assembled USDA employees watched a video message from President Obama. The President encouraged all federal employees to give generously to CFC this year, as part of the same spirit of service and community that he has worked to strengthen across the country through United We Serve. As the first phase of the kickoff drew to a close, Bernadine Prince of FARMFRESH Markets spoke about her organization’s work to promote locally grown food throughout the DC Metro area. When Ms. Prince finished her remarks, it was time for the attendees to sample some of the fresh, locally grown food from USDA’s very own Farmers Market, such as apple cider and banana bread. Before attendees enjoyed the delicious and healthy refreshments, Dr. Susan McCarthy from the Agricultural Research Service, USDA’s CFC Campaign Manager, launched the charity fair. This fair was an excellent opportunity for USDA employees to talk to representatives of a few of the thousands of non-profits represented in the CFC catalog. Employees who attended reported having a wonderful time and learning a great deal about non-profits doing great work in a wide variety of ways. The Secretary is hoping that all employees will join him in giving to the non-profit organizations of their choice. The size of the gift matters much less than the fact that each employee participates on some level. DC Metro area federal employees can find out everything they need to know to get involved in CFC by visiting www.cfcnca.org. Federal employees outside of Washington can locate their local campaign’s website by following this link.

"Assistant to the Director, USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in  Initiatives  May 24,   Cross posted from the Let's Move! blog:  There’s a lot going on in the Church Hill North neighborhood of Richmond, Virginia! For three years, the congregation at 31st Street Baptist Church has been growing fresh vegetables in an urban garden behind their church. More recently, they launched a healthy living campaign to encourage the congregation and the surrounding community to get active and eat more nutritious foods. Led by Rev. Dr. Henderson, who serves as senior pastor, 31st Street Baptist Church has acquired three city lots behind their church. The congregants have a large community garden with 24 cultivated raised beds in one of the lots. The garden provides healthy, fresh produce to a community without close access to a grocery store. The majority of the produce from the garden is used in the church’s nutrition center, which has served members of the local community for 21 years and receives some of its food via USDA’s Emergency Food Assistance (TEFAP) program. The 31st Street Baptist Church garden is already growing peas, radishes, beets, and greens this season. Photo courtesy of Master Gardener Linda Marshall and Jacquelin Henderson 31st Street Baptist Church provides a great example of how to partner with the U.S. Department of Agriculture on multiple fronts. The church has partnered with Virginia Cooperative Extension and local master gardeners for technical assistance in growing food and teaching about nutrition. They will be starting a 4-H youth development club with two neighboring churches and teenagers from the Mayor’s Youth Conservation Corps also help tend part of the garden. The church has plans to launch a large farmers market this summer with produce from the garden and area farmers, and they will be holding a youth summer camp focused on healthy living in August. And there’s more: this spring marked the planting of a new flower garden in one of their other lots. The plan is to sell the cut flowers to other churches in the area to raise revenue and teach youth about entrepreneurship. The third open lot will be developed as a Zen garden, providing a space for tranquility in the neighborhood. Pastor Henderson’s goal is to “rally congregants around changing their lifestyles” while “respecting the dignity of the people who come to garden.” To learn more about increasing access to healthy affordable food in your community, please visit Let’s Move!

"U.S. Navy, Department of Agriculture and Department of Energy Announce Funding Available for Commercial Scale Advanced Drop-In Biofuels; Energy Department Also Announces Additional Biofuel Investments to Drive Cost Reductions and Technological Breakthroughs  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .12  Contact:USDA Office of Communications   720-  AudioWASHINGTON. D.C., July 2, – As part of the Obama Administration's commitment to deploying every available source of American energy and reducing our reliance on imported oil, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and Secretary of Energy Steven Chu announced new funding available to pursue new innovations in biofuels technologies, increase production of U.S. biofuels, and strengthen American energy security. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Navy and Department of Energy are announcing $30 million in federal funding to match private investments in commercial-scale advanced drop-in biofuels. The Energy Department is also announcing a total of $32 million in new investments for earlier stage research that will continue to drive technological breakthroughs and additional cost reductions in the industry.Advancing Commercial-Scale Drop-In Biofuel Substitutes for Diesel and Jet FuelIn his Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future released in March , President Obama set a goal of reducing oil imports by one-third by and laid out an all-of-the-above energy plan to achieve that goal by developing domestic oil and gas energy resources, increasing energy efficiency, and speeding development of biofuels and other alternatives. Domestic oil and gas production has increased each year the President has been in office. At the same time we continue to take additional steps to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. As part of that effort, the Blueprint directed the Navy, USDA and DOE to collaborate to support commercialization of ""drop-in"" biofuel substitutes for diesel and jet fuel. Competitively-priced drop-in biofuels will help improve America's energy security, meeting the fuel needs of U.S. armed forces, as well as the commercial aviation and shipping sectors. Today's announcement of an available $30 million in funding builds on that commitment, helping to speed the development of biofuels for military and commercial transportation that will reduce the need for foreign oil and strengthen rural America. The Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is available HERE.Made possible through the Defense Production Act (DPA), this funding opportunity enhances national security by supporting the creation and commercial viability of a defense-critical domestic biofuels industry to advance alternatives to petroleum. DPA is an authority that dates back to and has been used to boost industries such as steel, aluminum, titanium, semiconductors, beryllium, and radiation-hardened electronics.""DPA is a critical component of strengthening our national security, and energy is a national security issue,"" stated Secretary Mabus. ""Our reliance on foreign oil is a significant military vulnerability and it would be irresponsible not to address it. Pursuing a viable, domestic alternative is the best way to preserve the budget for operational necessities like training and shipbuilding, and this funding opportunity is an important step in accelerating an economically self-sufficient alternative fuels market.""The FOA comprises a two-phased approach, with government and industry sharing in the cost. In Phase 1, applicants will submit a design package and comprehensive business plan for a commercial-scale biorefinery, identify and secure project sites and take additional steps spelled out in the announcement. Awardees selected to continue into Phase 2 will submit additional information for the construction or retrofit of a biorefinery.Agencies participating in this initiative will make additional funding requests to Congress to support the initiative, including President Obama's budget request of $110 million.""This is an important time for the biofuels industry to step up and show the Department of the Navy how they have developed biofuels that are certified and certifiable for military use,"" stated Secretary Vilsack. ""The ability for U.S. industry to make, create and innovate has never been more important to our national and energy security. I know that through this DPA effort the nation will be able to harvest an aviation biofuels industry to satisfy the world's needs, not just our U.S. military.""Investments in Biofuels Research, Development and Demonstration to Drive Cost Reductions, Technological BreakthroughsToday, the Energy Department is also announcing new investments in earlier stage biofuels research that complement the commercial-scale efforts announced today by the Navy and USDA. Totaling $32 million, these early-stage, pre-commercial investments are the latest steps in the Obama Administration's efforts to advance biofuels technologies to continue to bring down costs, improve performance, and identify new effective, non-food feedstocks and processing technologies.""Advanced biofuels are an important part of President Obama's all-of-the-above strategy to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil and support American industries and American jobs,"" said Secretary Chu. ""By pursuing new processes and technologies for producing next-generation biofuels, we are working to accelerate innovation in a critical and growing sector that will help to improve U.S. energy security and protect our air and water.""The funding announced by DOE today includes $20 million to support innovative pilot-scale and demonstration-scale biorefineries that could produce renewable biofuels that meet military specifications for jet fuel and shipboard diesel using a variety of non-food biomass feedstocks, waste-based materials and algae. These projects may support new plant construction, retrofits on existing U.S. biorefineries or operation at plants ready to begin production at the pilot- or pre-commercial scale. This investment will also help federal and local governments, private developers and industry collect accurate on the cost of producing fuels made from biomass and waste feedstocks. The full funding solicitation is available HERE.In addition, the Energy Department also announced $12 million to support up to eight projects focused on researching ways to develop biobased transportation fuels and products using synthetic biological processing. Synthetic biological processing offers an innovative technique to enable efficient, cost-saving conversion of non-food biomass to biofuels. These projects will develop novel biological systems that can enhance the breakdown of raw biomass feedstocks and assist in converting feedstocks into transportation fuels.The projects will be led by small businesses, universities, national laboratories and industry and will seek to overcome various technical and scientific barriers to cost-competitive advanced biofuels and bioproducts. The full funding opportunity announcement is available HERE.The new investments announced today build on the steps the Energy Department is already taking to push the boundaries of biofuel technologies and move towards commercial-scale production at refineries across the country.

"USDA Deputy Administrator of Special Nutrition Programs in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 23,  Audrey Rowe, USDA Deputy Administrator of Special Nutrition Programs, chats with the Shenandoah Valley Community Breastfeeding support group August 6 in Martinsburg, West Virginia.  I recently had the pleasure to spend a little time with some expecting and nursing mothers in Martinsburg, West Virginia.  It was the first meeting of a newly formed community breastfeeding support group planned to coincide with World Breastfeeding Week.  My friend Mitch Greenbaum, Director of Shenandoah Valley WIC and Nutrition Services, and his team of trained WIC nutritionists, board-certified lactation consultants and breastfeeding peer counselors, hosted nearly two dozen pregnant and nursing mothers to talk about how important breastfeeding is for both mother and child and how to have a satisfying and healthy breastfeeding experience. The women shared stories and got answers to questions new mothers often ask such as: “Does it hurt?”  “What should I do when I’m out in public and need to feed my baby?”  And, “How can I keep feeding my baby after I return to work?”  I shared my personal experiences too; knowing the trepidation and uncertainty a nursing mother experiences.  But Mitch’s team of experts calmed the fear and helped the women feel comfortable about the choice to breastfeed.  The messages helped the women understand how to cope with a busy schedule and perhaps a job, how to involve family and friends, and most importantly, helped the women understand just how nutritionally important breast milk is. Research proves that feeding human milk to young children and the practice of breastfeeding improves the health, immune system, and the development of children. It protects against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), ear infections, upper and lower respiratory infections, allergies, intestinal disorders, colds and viruses.  Breastfeeding also protects mothers against osteoporosis and breast and ovarian cancer.  These nutritional benefits, both for children and for women, last long after breastfeeding has ended. I applaud local WIC and Nutrition Service programs like the one in Shenandoah Valley for their efforts to promote and encourage this vital part of human development.  Through innovative community support groups and local community partnerships; through health provider outreach and public awareness; and through on-line USDA resources such as Loving Support and WIC Works, women, families, and whole communities are more aware of the profound benefits of breastfeeding.

Ya sea en escuelas, centros comunitarios o en casas de todo el país, estos programas trabajan en conjunto como una red de seguridad nutritiva para asegurar que ningún americano que cualifique pase hambre. Considero que la nutrición suplementar para mujeres, infantes y niños, mejor conocida como WIC (por sus siglas en inglés)  es un programa especial. Dicho programa provee alimentos suplementarios a los más vulnerables—infantes, embarazadas, mujeres lactando y luego del parto y a niños hasta la edad de 5 años que enfrentan un riesgo nutricional. WIC también provee referencias para atención médica y social, y para educación nutritiva, incluyendo la promoción y el soporte a la lactancia materna. Un nuevo reporte del USDA del programa y características de WIC (disponible en ingles) confirma el éxito de estos esfuerzos. Por ejemplo, al revisar la información recopilada se registró un aumento del 4 por ciento en dos años en la participación de madres del programa WIC que lactan sus niños con leche materna. De las agencias estatales que reportaron madres que lactaron a sus hijos en el , se reportó que 67 por ciento de los infantes entre los 6 y 13 meses estaban siendo amamantados o lo estuvieron durante un tiempo en comparación con un 63 por ciento registrado en un estudio anterior que se realizo en el . Es más, la lactancia materna entre participantes de WIC ha estado en continuo aumento desde , y este año por primera vez, el porcentaje de mamas lactantes fue mayor que el número de nuevas madres no lactantes. Los hallazgos son una buena noticia, ya que la lactancia materna es el método ideal de alimentación para infantes, ya que provee beneficios para la mama y el niño. Las ayudas del programa WIC están llegando a madres y niños de escasos recursos. Cerca de tres cuartas partes de los 9 millones de participantes en WIC que reportaron sus ingresos se encuentran por debajo de lo que se considera como pobreza, a comparación del 15 por ciento entre la población general de los Estados Unidos. La mayoría de los que reciben las ayudas de WIC tienen menos de 5 años y más de la mitad de los participantes eran menores de 3 años. Entre otras buenas noticias es importante señalar que la obesidad infantil ha disminuido entre los participantes de WIC(disponible en ingles). En el , el 15.3 por ciento de los niños en WIC de un año confrontaban problemas de obesidad comparado con los hallazgos registrados el 16.8 por ciento en el . De manera similar, en el se reportó que 14.7 por ciento de los niños entre las edades de 2 y 4 experimentaba obesidad mientras que en el la cantidad disminuyo a 14.0 por ciento. El centro para el control de enfermedades profundizo en el estudio usando datos del WIC de 43 estados y territorios de niños entre las edades de 2 y 4 años. Descubrieron que al revés de la tendencia anterior, en 19 de los estados/territorios hubo  reducciones significativas y que 21 de ellos no reportaron problemas de obesidad infantil, con solo 3 mostrando aumentos. WIC ayuda a trazar el futuro de nuestro país de una manera vital al proveer a madres e hijos la nutrición que necesitan para tener embarazos exitosos y en el caso de los niños, un crecimiento saludable. De hecho, investigaciones anteriores han demostrado que las ayudas que ofrece WIC ejercen un papel importante en embarazos ya que ayudan a evitar complicaciones como fiebre, embarazos prematuros o incluso las costosas tarifas de los cuidados de salud. Este es un programa que no solo está proporcionando nutrición a familias de bajos ingresos, pero también reduciendo la mortalidad infantil y en verdad creando una generación futura más saludable.

"Racing for alternatives in the age of antibiotic resistance  “This week is World Antibiotic Awareness week and ‘Get Smart About Antibiotics’ week. Learn more about how USDA works to ensure antibiotics remain effective to treat both people and animals when necessary and the alternatives available to traditional antibiotics.” For billions of years, microbes such as bacteria and viruses have been in a struggle for survival in the face of naturally occurring antimicrobial substances. This struggle has continued in nature and into human society, where humans, plants, animals, and microbes themselves constantly ward off disease-causing microbes. The plight for adaptation and survival is not unlike the Red Queen’s race in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass, where it takes all of the running one can do to remain in the same place.   Dr. Stephanie Pearl, Science Communicator, USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture  Posted in  Research and Science  Nov 18,   Respond to this story",What are some alternatives being explored by the USDA to traditional antibiotics in order to maintain their effectiveness for both human and animal treatments?,"The USDA is exploring alternatives to traditional antibiotics, including microbes that naturally ward off disease-causing microbes."
"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 02,  Incorporating local produce into summer meals programs benefits the entire community. Fields of asparagus and peas are in full bounty, soon to make way for sweet, juicy strawberries; towering stalks of corn; and more tomatoes than you’d ever know what to do with!  In many parts of the country, as we approach summer, the warm weather means that local harvests are at their peak, and fresh fruits and vegetables abound.  That’s what makes summer the perfect time of year for incorporating local foods into your meals.  And according to the most recently released from the Farm to School Census , more than 1,000 school districts nationwide are doing just that:  They’re bringing the farm to summer! When school lets out for summer, there’s still a need to ensure the millions of children who receive free and reduced-price school meals during the school year have consistent access to healthy meals.  USDA’s summer meals programs help fill that gap, serving over 191 million meals to children last summer alone!  Community centers, libraries, day camps, churches, and more can all sign up to host a summer meals site through the summer meals programs, but schools make for a particularly good site since they already have food production facilities in place for serving meals throughout the school year.  The Farm to School Census found that more than one in five school districts that participate in farm to school programs report including local foods in meals served through their summer meals programs. Schools serving as summer meals sites often also offer fun, hands-on activities related to local foods that attract and engage kids in their programming.  Farm to summer activities include growing community gardens, taking a field trip to the farm, and conducting taste tests of local produce. But it’s not just the kids that are benefiting; incorporating local produce into the summer meals programs helps the entire community. Farm to summer arrangements can help increase participation for summer meals, provide a source of income for local growers and producers, and reinforce healthy habits promoted during the school year. To find out more about summer meals sites in your area, visit the Summer Site Finder.  Or to get involved yourself, consider becoming a site sponsor or helping raise awareness in your area.  To learn more about farm to summer and farm to school programs, check out the Community Food System’s webpage.

"Posted by Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack in  USDA Results  Rural  Dec 17,   This week, at my request, USDA Rural Development and Farm Service Agency staff kicked off a series of meetings intended to gather ideas about ways to spark job creation and economic growth in rural America. This request is a direct result of the Forum on Jobs and Economic Growth that President Obama hosted at the White House earlier this month. Because of the importance of this effort, I have asked that these meetings be held in every state, and in territories including Guam and Puerto Rico. We intend to complete all of them by February 1 and provide meeting directly to the White House.  Rural Development State Directors along with Farm Service Agency State Executive Directors, are the hosts and those invited to participate include business owners, members of the community, state and local officials, union representatives, non-profit service providers and economists.  The objective is clear:  discuss steps that can be taken to make the economy grow and put Americans back to work. All of these meetings are public events and anyone with an interest in boosting the economy is welcome to attend. Each State and Executive Director will prepare a report on the meeting in their state and the will be provided to the White House. As I travel across the country, I continue to meet Americans who face great challenges.  It’s important to not only find a way to provide them with opportunities, it is necessary to restore their hope.  President Obama believes in nurturing strong, robust, and vibrant rural communities, but the best way to do that is to find a way to provide those living in rural towns with meaningful, financially rewarding jobs. As a former governor and mayor I know how important this effort is. I hope you’ll participate. To learn more, go to the Rural Development Job Roundtables Schedule and the News Release “USDA to Host Roundtables on Jobs, Economic Growth.” More meetings are being scheduled so if you don’t see your state listed, check back or contact your State Rural Development or FSA office for more information.

"USDA One Health Joint Working Group Co-Chair and Deputy Administrator, Animal Production and Protection, USDA Agricultural Research Service in  Animals  Plants  Nov 18,  ARS scientists identifying bacterial pathogens in the lab. Photo by Peggy Greb. Antibiotics are lifesavers. We depend on them to treat bacterial infections and diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis and strep throat, as well as ear infections and infected wounds. In response to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance, veterinarians and producers are moving toward more judicious antibiotic use in food animals, while keeping them healthy and ensuring that our food supply remains safe. This is especially important because certain bacterial strains have become resistant to some of the current antibiotics used to treat infections in humans and animals, escalating the need worldwide to find and develop alternatives to antibiotics. The USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is developing new technologies to address antibiotic resistance and reduce the use of antibiotics through agricultural management, which includes food, animals, crops and the environment—water, soil and climate. This research falls into USDA’s One Health approach when mitigating the problems associated with antibiotic resistance.  One Health is the concept that the health of animals, the health of people, and the viability of ecosystems are intricately linked. A One Health approach embraces the idea that a disease problem impacting the health of humans, animals, and the environment can only be solved through improved communication, cooperation, and collaboration across disciplines and institutions. With its partners, USDA’s objective through this multidisciplinary approach is to preserve, maintain or reduce health risks to animals, humans, the environment and society. USDA has gained in-depth knowledge about antimicrobial resistance through its work on the agricultural environment, animal health and food safety. Over the years, scientists have developed and patented new technologies that could help reduce the use of antibiotics. Discoveries include using natural supplements like vitamin D to treat a condition of dairy cows called “mastitis,” which affects milk quality and production of cattle. Vitamin D, as well as yeast, also has the potential to treat turkey diseases. In addition, scientists have shown that non-antibiotic methods, such as essential oils in citrus, reduce foodborne pathogens found in the gut of animals; that phytochemicals—natural chemicals found in such plants as safflower, plums and peppers—enhance the immune system of chickens; and that certain natural compounds kill foodborne pathogens like Salmonella or Escherichia coli O157:H7. Other research breakthroughs include creating new, effective antimicrobials and vaccines to fight such pathogens as Salmonella and Campylobacter to lower their incidence in chickens and turkeys and help keep consumers healthy. Finding alternatives to antibiotics has become a global issue as the demand for animal food products increases to meet the nutritional needs of a growing population. ARS scientists continue to seek solutions by developing new methods to control and prevent animal diseases and reduce bacterial pathogens in our food supply. ARS scientists are studying a variety of techniques to ensure our food supply remains safe. Photo by Peggy Greb.

"Montana Range Riding Aids Ranchers, Mitigates Conflicts  As silvery moonlight washed across the Montana meadow, it sent long shadows over the grass. Tonight, I didn’t need the gentle clang of the grazing bell to tell me where the horses were feeding. My leggy quarter horse was as brightly silver-white as the full moon. The distant lowing of cows across the meadow confirmed that all was well. Somewhere in the distance, a wolf pack was probably making evening rounds, but tonight they likely wouldn’t visit this meadow.

"NRCS Mississippi in  Initiatives  May 14,   Many children believe their food comes from the grocery store. But a class of 23 Mississippi second-graders knows better than that – the delicious food they love starts with a seed. Students from Madison Avenue Elementary plant a People’s Garden in Mississippi in honor of the upcoming 150th anniversary of USDA. Students from Madison Avenue Elementary visited a new People’s Garden at an office of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and planted seeds of squash, watermelon, pumpkin, cucumber and, of course, the “Abraham Lincoln” tomato. Earth Team volunteers joined employees from NRCS’ Science and Technology Center to teach the youngsters about growing fruits and vegetables and the history of USDA. They learned of USDA’s upcoming 150th anniversary and its origins with President Lincoln. The People’s Garden effort started three years ago, and this central Mississippi garden is one of more than 1,500 People’s Gardens across the nation. The garden’s star plant is the “Abraham Lincoln” tomato, an heirloom variety first introduced in by the W.H. Buckbee seed company. Not only did they have a chance to get their hands dirty, but they had a party and sang “Happy Birthday” to USDA while enjoying a pumpkin cupcake. Students from Madison Avenue Elementary plant a People’s Garden in Mississippi in honor of the upcoming 150th anniversary of USDA. It would not be a party without conservation mascot Sammy Soil, who made a special appearance. Students also enjoyed meeting the garden’s guard – a scarecrow made from farmers’ clothes and recycled grocery bags. Nancy Magee, an NRCS program expert, organized the event and sees the plantings as a great way to connect students to the origin of food and explain the role farmers play in their lives. The garden is nearby Strawberry Park, a city green space with a busy walking trail. Magee said the garden’s location informs passersby about USDA and the People’s Garden. Plus, it is a beautiful asset to the office, she said. As children were boarding the school bus, after their visit to the new garden, she heard one student tell another, “I’m going to come back in a week and see how they’re growing.” That is exactly what Magee wanted to hear.

"Research Microbiologist, Agricultural Research Service, National Animal Disease Center in  Animals  Health and Safety  Research and Science  Nov 20,  ARS remains committed to conducting research to our overall understanding of antimicrobial resistance in swine pathogens. This week is World Antibiotic Awareness Week and USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) remains committed to using a “One Health” approach in conducting research that will identify solutions to help prolong the usefulness of a very precious resource—antibiotics. For example, ARS research includes understanding how common production practices might impact antimicrobial resistance and understanding whether certain animal pathogens may be a public health concern. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one bacteria type that is a public health concern because of its resistance to some antibiotics which can make it difficult to treat. MRSA has been found in livestock – mainly in swine. One particular MRSA strain, called ST5, has raised additional public health concerns because it is a major cause of human infections globally. To address these public health concerns, ARS conducted research to determine whether production practices like using in-feed zinc as an antidiarrheal agent contribute to the emergence and spread of MRSA in U.S. swine populations, and if ST5 bacterial isolates from swine and from humans are genetically related. ARS demonstrated that applying zinc in feed does not play a role in the prevalence of livestock-associated MRSA ST5 in the U.S. swine population. More importantly, ARS found that ST5 isolates from agricultural sources are genetically distinct and separate from clinical MRSA ST5 isolates obtained from human clinical settings. Specifically, isolates from agricultural sources were found to be extremely similar to each other within farms and lacked genes typically carried by human isolates. Collectively, ARS indicate that livestock-associated MRSA and clinical MRSA ST5 isolates are genetically distinct and transmission and/or genetic exchange between them is not currently occurring based on the findings in this study. ARS researchers are continuing to build on these results to further determine the distribution and impact of livestock-associated-MRSA ST5 outside of the livestock setting. As we celebrate World Antibiotic Awareness Week, we remain committed to a “One-Health” approach to prevent, not just react to, complex public and animal health issues. The information gained from these studies is important to our overall understanding of animal pathogens, and any potential risks to public health.

"Media Relations Officer, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Oct 17,  According to the World Wildlife Fund, the American Pika (Ochotona princeps) could be the first mammal victim of climate change (US Forest Service Photo). In Scanning the Conservation Horizon, a report published by the National Wildlife Federation, with support from the U.S. Forest Service and other partners, scientists describe climate change as an increasing threat to species and ecosystems.  Addressing this threat requires the right answers, which can only come from asking the right questions. Through extensive research, U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station scientists have developed a 22-question measurement tool called a System for Assessing Vulnerability of Species.  The tool will help land managers gauge the impact of climate change on land animals and make decisions about protecting threatened species.  Questions evaluate projected changes to animal habitats, physical functions, major life cycle events and interactions with other animal species, and their potential to cope with those changes. Users must chose from three answers associated with each question, which will identify traits and issues related to animal vulnerabilities. One question, for example, asks, “Are specific habitat components for breeding expected to change within the associated vegetation type?”  To determine vulnerability, users of the tool must answer if the breeding habitat components are expected to increase, decrease or be unchanged. Assuming climate change projections are correct, users then will note whether the information available is “adequate” or “inadequate” to assign a score for each question.  If the information is sufficient, an overall score will be assigned, representing the species’ relative vulnerability to climate change. The tool focuses solely on the effects of climate change on land animals. Scores can be used to rank at-risk animal species and identify vulnerability “hot spots” within large landscapes, such as national forests. “This tool doesn’t provide a definitive answer about the extent climate change will affect animal species,” said Deborah Finch, program manager of the Grassland, Shrubland and Desert Ecosystems Science unit of the Rocky Mountain Research Station, “but information is power, and we’re empowering land managers to start assessing vulnerabilities and making decisions about where to direct their limited resources.” Finch, along with Megan Friggens and Karen Bagne, both Rocky Mountain Research Station researchers, developed the questions. They say that users should rely on information gathered from published materials, expert consultation and personal knowledge to complete the questionnaire.

"USDA Farm to School Regional Lead for the Mountain Plains Region and Helen Dombalis, Programs Director and Interim Policy Director for the National Farm to School Network in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Nov 18,  Lunch at a Weld County School District 6 elementary school featuring local products: grass-finished beef, pinto beans, local certified organic apples and greenhouse tomatoes & cucumbers A bin of acorn squash sits on a pallet at the Weld County School District 6 central kitchen, right next to a bin of yellow onions and a 1,000 pound tote of russet potatoes – all locally-grown. A walk through the facility is enough to convince anyone that Weld County School District 6 is committed to scratch-cooked, locally-grown food for its 22,000 students at 35 schools.  In this rural Colorado school district, where over 40 languages are spoken at home and 66 percent of students are eligible for free or reduced price meals, fresh, tasty food is the norm – even down to the green chili, a southwestern favorite roasted in-house, using three varieties of local peppers. About a quarter of the central kitchen is dedicated to processing fresh fruits and vegetables.  Mushrooms are sliced, carrots are shredded and onions are diced. With funding from a USDA Farm to School Grant in , this food hub portion of the kitchen was furnished with tables, wash stations and equipment to process local food for Weld County’s own meals and for other districts in the area. Locally-grown acorn squash and onions stored in the central kitchen for a harvest lunch in November Natalie Leffler is the Food Hub Manager at Weld County School District 6. Her job is to coordinate partnerships with farmers, ranchers and local businesses to source as much local food as possible, defined as grown or produced within a 400 mile radius. Leffler manages an annual procurement to establish relationships and contracts. Growers must submit a food safety checklist with their bid documents, which she confirms with an in-person site visit, so the district can rest-assured that the local products are safe.  Matt Poling, the school district’s Executive Chef, ensures that menu planning, recipe development and production processes maximize the use of local products. The freezer is full of shredded local zucchini (for blending into tomato sauce), mirepoix (the age-old combination of onion, celery, and carrots used as a base for soups) and other local ingredients to incorporate into meals in the off-season.  The team even prepares mashed potatoes made with local red potatoes and home-made gravy. Locally-grown and dried pinto beans are sorted and cooked into refried beans or chili.  Just outside the facility are four giant compost bins designed to turn food scraps from the kitchen into compost for the district’s school gardens, funded through an innovative partnership with the West Greeley Conservation District.  Sometimes El Fuego, the district’s flashy food truck, is parked outside, too. But typically the truck is out roaming the district, serving up favorites like barbacoa street tacos and yakisoba noodle bowls to students and school staff. Four compost bins, funded through a creative partnership with the West Greeley Conservation District, turn food scraps from the central kitchen into compost for school gardens The district goes beyond buying local food – school gardens, student wellness and food education are three major areas of focus. Plans are underway to transform a sandy, unused portion of a nearby schoolyard into an educational farm focused on student engagement and employment.  Called “Growing Grounds,” the project vision includes raised beds, an orchard, a teaching kitchen, hoop houses and a greenhouse. Inspired by Weld County School District 6 and their innovative farm to school programs?  USDA is currently accepting applications for the Farm to School Grant Program, which assists eligible entities in implementing farm to school programs that improve access to local foods in eligible schools. Consider applying for a grant to bring more local food into school meals, promote healthy eating habits and expand markets for American farmers and producers.

USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) grants are helping farmers markets implement creative programs to support local food producers and build healthy communities. Photo courtesy Mr T in DC. Nutritional classes, purple beets, basil pesto and dark roast coffee - it’s not your father’s farmers market.  The entire local food system is maturing and farmers markets are offering more and more community-focused services. Many farmers markets now give their customers a chance to learn about locally-produced foods, in addition to buying and consuming them. USDA is a proud partner and supporter of local and regional food systems through our programs, grants and technical services. USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) grants are helping farmers markets implement creative programs to support local food producers and build healthy communities. One example of an AMS grant success story is Community Foodworks, which manages the Columbia Heights Farmers Market and six other markets across Washington, DC, and Northern Virginia. Leveraging a Farmers Market Promotion Program grant, Foodworks established a new Wednesday evening farmers market to increase access to locally produced food in the Columbia Heights neighborhood. The program included “Bonus Bucks” to give shoppers who use Federal food benefits (SNAP, WIC, Senior FMNP) more purchasing power. The grant also helped Foodworks to develop a mixed-income CSA program – a weekly share from the market’s producers with options for individual or family-sized shares or a subsidized family-sized share for SNAP customers. The new market had a real impact on the community: Over half of the customers reported eating more vegetables since the market opened  A majority of market visitors reported the Bonus Bucks program was the main reason they shopped at the market  Most customers agreed that spending their benefits at the market was easy  In addition to their farmers market efforts, Foodworks offers other creative programs to help support the community.  In partnership with another local social service organization, Foodworks is able to provide fresh, local food home delivery services for seniors. They serve as a site for USDA summer meals, distributing 3-4 dozen snacks to hungry children at their two weekday markets. They also offer community educational classes on nutrition, obesity, and diabetes intervention. In the fall of , Foodworks piloted a new Veterans Vegetable Prescription Program to distribute weekly fruit and vegetable vouchers to eligible Veterans, seeing a redemption rate of 42 percent. These are great innovations and partnerships leveraged by Foodworks.  As we continue to support the marketing and distribution of locally produced foods for U.S. farmers and ranchers, we look to see more impacts resulting from our investments.  Under this Administration, USDA has invested more than $1 billion in over 40,000 local and regional food businesses and infrastructure projects. These activities contribute to USDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food (KYF2) initiative, which coordinates efforts across USDA. Our recently-revamped website provides USDA resources for every point in the local food supply chain, including grants, loans, and other instructional guides.  Additionally, the KYF2 Compass maps local and regional food system investments across the country. More information on how USDA investments are connecting producers with consumers and expanding rural economic opportunities is available in Chapter IV of USDA Results on Medium. “The growth of Community Foodworks and our essential programs couldn't be possible without opportunities like the Farmers Market Promotion Program from AMS,” said Nick Stavely, Community Foodworks Farmers Market & Incentives Program Manager. “We're thankful for the role that the AMS grants played in the organization's expansion and program development.” Photo of Columbia Heights Farmers Market courtesy Mr T in DC.

"Forest Service Research & Development in  Conservation  Forestry  Research and Science  Mar 03,  Kellie Carim, eDNA coordinator for the Genomics Center, collects and processes samples. (Photos by Michael Schwartz (left) and Katie Zarn, U.S. Forest Service) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research profile. The U.S. Forest Service has a long history as a leader in conservation genetics, and this recently took an exciting step forward with the launch of the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation. The Forest Service’s wildlife genetics lab, which has been central to the Rocky Mountain Research Station’s conservation genetics program since , has been reorganized and renamed to better reflect the scope of its work nationwide. The Center is a leading edge facility for advanced genomics research, nationally recognized, and works extensively with states, tribes, universities and private groups to address the management issues of over 60 fish and wildlife species.  collected by the Center will support the new Forest Service Forest Planning Rule with timely and cost-effective information on wildlife and fish species. Information developed by the Center will be made available through the network of USDA Climate Hubs to assist private forestland managers, farmers and ranchers in reaching their conservation goals. With state-of-the-art technology and the development of new tools and techniques, the main objective of the Center is to provide cost-effective and reliable genomic for improved species monitoring. By having more robust information, state and federal managers are better able to evaluate the genetic health and population viability of fish and wildlife species across the landscape. The discovery of a new fish species and the detection of invasive species are among the Center’s many contributions to the advancement of science and management. Imagine an expansive landscape, filled with different and remote terrain, and being asked to determine if the area has been impacted by a new invasive species. This is a daunting challenge that land managers face on a regular basis. One of the Center’s specialties, analyzing samples of environmental DNA, or eDNA, shows great promise in addressing this challenge. This type of DNA has been separated from organisms into the surrounding environment and can be found in soil, water and air. Forest Service scientists are developing ways to determine what species are present by simply sampling a cup of water from locations across the landscape. “eDNA is a highly sensitive method for detecting organisms in low abundance and is generally faster and extremely cost effective compared to traditional methods used to detect exotic or endangered species,” said Dr. Michael Schwartz, director of the center. The use of eDNA is an innovative approach to inventorying and monitoring fish and wildlife species. eDNA is particularly effective for detecting rare species that can be difficult to sample using traditional methods. For example, researchers at the Rocky Mountain Research Station have been working with partners and collaborators on the threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) since . Bull trout is a culturally significant species to several Tribes in the Northwest and Columbia River Basin. It is also a prized game fish, and land management and recreational angling are significantly influenced by whether or not this species is present in a given watershed. This species is particularly sensitive to changes in habitat and is also threatened by the introduction of the nonnative brook trout (S. fontinalis). Forest Service scientists have developed sampling methods to make eDNA surveys a reliable and accessible option for managers to detect the presence of bull trout and their invasive competitor, brook trout. Forest Service scientists continue to develop eDNA techniques for detecting priority fish and wildlife.  eDNA is just one method of non-invasive genetic sampling, which uses forensic-style DNA samples to monitor rare and sensitive species, employed by the Center.

"Research and Development, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Apr 01,  Cedar sculpin (Cottus schitsuumsh). (Emily Harrington/E.H. Illustration) U.S. Forest Service scientists at the Rocky Mountain Research Station in Missoula, Mont., have identified a new species of fish—the cedar sculpin (Cottus schitsuumsh). Although thousands of new species are described by scientists each year, only a small percentage of them are animal species, and even fewer are found in the United States, underscoring the importance of this discovery. Freshwater sculpins, with their characteristic large heads and fins, are bottom dwellers that can be found in cold, fast-moving streams throughout North America. Biologists have long suspected that there were undescribed species of sculpins in the Upper Columbia River Basin, but lacked the tools to recognize them. Cedar sculpin populations were previously thought to be shorthead sculpin (Cottus confusus), an understandable misidentification given that sculpins are notoriously difficult to identify based on their physical features. “Through our collaboration with the University of Montana, we uncovered morphological and genetic evidence demonstrating that two species have been masquerading under a single name for over 50 years,” said Michael Young, a Forest Service research fisheries biologist. The new species of sculpin was discovered in the Coeur d’Alene and St. Joe River basins in Idaho and part of the Clark Fork River Basin in Montana. In naming the species, the scientists consulted with elders of the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, whose historical homeland overlaps with the current range of this fish.  The scientific name for the species, Cottus schitsuumsh, is derived from the name for the Tribe, Schitsu’umsh, which means “those who were found here.” The common name refers to the western redcedar, a tree often found along streams in this region. While not commercially valuable in and of themselves, sculpins are well-known to anglers as a food source for big trout—a famous fly pattern, the muddler minnow, is designed to resemble a sculpin—and as indicators of water quality. The cedar sculpin is abundant in tributaries that also support westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. Forest Service scientists and their partners believe that much hidden diversity remains among sculpin populations throughout the Western U.S., with additional species waiting to be identified. They are dedicated to helping unravel these mysteries in order to conserve and sustainably manage our natural resources. Top, side and bottom view of a male cedar sculpin.

"Tree Rings Tell the History of Fire and Forest Health  Why are Rocky Mountain Research Station scientists sampling tree rings in the Pinaleño Mountains of southeast Arizona? Because tree ring samples reveal the history of fire. When fire scorches a tree, the tree floods its wound with sap, which protects the wound from wood rot decay for hundreds of years, as long as fires keep burning at a low intensity.

"NRCS Mississippi in  Conservation  Nov 18,  NRCS provided technical assistance to the Choctaws in the creation of Lake Pushmataha, a 285-acre lake in Neshoba County. November is American Indian Heritage Month and offers a great time to recognize the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians for their stellar record as stewards of the environment. The tribe knows the value of land. That’s why it is working with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to improve wildlife habitat in its communities across the state. The Choctaws have used NRCS’ Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) to improve 860 acres in Carroll County on their property Malmasion this year. Malmasion is the site of a plantation that was built among Choctaw hunting grounds. The plantation burned in the s, and the Choctaws purchased the land in . The tribe, through its director of natural resources, Jason Grisham, is implementing wildlife conservation practices that enhance and restore habitat for wildlife. While habitat has improved for deer, this land also provides refuge for other native animals, including turkeys, squirrels and songbirds. Since the tribe started working with NRCS, oak trees are dropping ample acorns, a favorite food of deer and other wildlife. Tribal members are also taking down bigger bucks—many with traditional bows. A big part of wildlife management is the use of prescribed burning for habitat diversity. This practice is not only used by NRCS conservationists, but is also a method the Choctaws have used for hundreds of years and are currently using to enhance this land. Forest management is a big part of Jason Grisham’s (right) duties. Choctaws use the firewood for heat during the winter, but the bulk of it is used during funeral services, where a perpetual fire must be maintained for three days. NRCS tribal liaison Tim Oakes has worked with the tribe’s forestry department on managing the forests, providing technical assistance on thinning. As the habitat matures, the Choctaws cut trees to provide firewood. It is tribal custom to use firewood during funeral services, where a fire is kept burning for three days. The Choctaws are able to meet the demand through proper forest management. NRCS has also teamed up with the Choctaws in an educational project called “Wetland Discovery.” This 600-foot boardwalk meanders through a wetland constructed with WHIP funds. The elevated walkway has signs in written in English and Choctaw describing the native species of plants and animals. Grisham said Tribal leaders have recognized the benefits of working with NRCS in recent years, and that future partnerships are on the horizon. The Choctaws use this area to hold cultural education events to teach children about their traditions and history.

"Posted by Fátima Terry, Deputy Director, USDA Digital Service in  Technology  Aug 12,  The seeds of digital transformation are taking root as application reviews for our agency’s first Digital Service (DS) Fellows cohort are in progress. By establishing a dedicated fellow team at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), we will be able to improve access to USDA resources and programs across the country. Once onboarded this fall, our USDA Digital Service (DS) Fellows will work to accelerate the design, development, and delivery of customer-centric services. To gain insight on digital service best practices, we hosted the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) team at our headquarters in Washington, D.C. last month. Digital Service staff from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and other agencies shared their experience with USDS, how they are addressing current challenges, and what the future of digital services at their agencies looks like. “We are so appreciative of the great collaboration and partnership with USDS as we work to shape a Digital Service team here at USDA, and we learned a lot about how we can continue to drive this great work here across the many mission areas and missions of USDA,” said Arianne Gallagher-Welcher, Executive Director of the USDA Digital Service and Co-Founder of the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program. USDA has seen firsthand the difference digital service can make. As the People’s Department, one of our most important missions is ensuring access to nutritious and safe food. Many of our nation’s youngest children were affected when a manufacturer product recall and weakened supply chains caused an infant formula shortage in . This particularly impacted USDA customers, as families who use our Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC program) buy 56% of all the formula sold in America. With other federal partners, USDA teamed up with the USDS to develop and analyze real-time about the amount of formula available in any given U.S. location. As a result, 388 million bottles of infant formula were imported and deployed to the places that needed it most based on new and analytics. This is just one example of how digital service can deliver solutions for the federal government’s most challenging technology implementation problems. You can learn more about this and other USDS solutions in their Impact Report. Our collaborative partnership with USDS is essential as our new Digital Service team launches. Together, we will build a stronger technology organization at USDA than can more efficiently support our employees and customers in the future.

Climate Hubs were able to enhance engagements among land managers and scientists to co-develop science and technology. To mark the 10-year anniversary of Secretary Vilsack sharing his vision for the Climate Hubs, we share two highlights. Dr. Julian Reyes was a Climate Hub Fellow with the Southwest Climate Hub. During his fellowship, he developed, AgRisk Viewer, which empowers decision makers to assess their climate risks by commodity type at the county scale using long-term crop insurance from Risk Management Agency. This tool identifies areas of agricultural production risk due to extreme events to help target locations for adaptation actions. Haley Case-Scott was a Resource Assistance Program intern with the Northwest Climate Hub. During Haley’s internship, she engaged with Tribal Nations supporting government-to-government consultation for the 25th update to the Northwest Forest Plan. Haley also developed communication materials to share information about USDA programs that could support climate adaptation and mitigation. Both Reyes and Case-Scott have also worked with the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy (OSTP) to provide clear, useful, and useable science and knowledge to inform the Administration’s climate, environment, and nature actions and initiatives. “Communities and decision makers need actionable and usable climate information and services. My time with the USDA Climate Hubs has shown the power of co-production ensuring community voices are embedded in our place-based, people-centered work. These perspectives have also helped me in my work at OSTP,” Reyes said. “Serving as a Resource Assistant Program intern with the USDA Northwest Climate Hub was a great experience. It allowed me to take a deep dive into how the federal government works, and provided me the tools needed to build my professional career,” Case-Scott said. The Climate Hubs continue to build capacity to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Midwest Regional Office with guest author Olivia Rodriguez, Outreach and Communications Manager, Top Box Foods in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 07,  Top Box Foods is not a grocery store, farmers market, or food bank. Top Box Foods is a community-driven non-profit, founded in Chicago in , that creates access to healthy and affordable food for the communities they serve. Customers place orders online or via phone for nutritious food which is offered at prices up to 40% lower than grocery stores. Prior to March , Top Box Foods shoppers would pick up their orders at community distribution sites such as churches. However, when the pandemic hit, Top Box Foods replaced the pick-up model with their free home delivery program. Top Box Foods accepts SNAP benefits as payment for orders, making it an essential resource for households looking to make the most of their SNAP dollars to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins and more. “When I was a kid, I could walk to the grocery store. One of the things I remember the most is that I was always inundated with the different smells of fruits and vegetables. You don’t get that anymore. The deli across the alley doesn’t have fruits or vegetables, and the nearest grocery store closed,” explained Top Box Foods customer Cassandra while receiving a delivery at her home in the summer of . Cassandra, a Top Box Foods shopper since , previously picked up her boxes at her local church, but leg injuries made getting to and from home with a load of groceries difficult. “I was praying for home delivery, and these deliveries help me out a lot. I get all my produce from Top Box,” she shared. In order to provide nutritious food for all, we need to think creatively and work with one another – just like Top Box Foods did when they started delivering groceries right to Cassandra’s door. The work of Top Box Foods aligns with pillar 1 of the national strategy by improving food access and affordability in support of the Biden-Harris Administration’s vision of a country where no one wonders whether they will have enough money to put food on the table, and where the healthy food choice is the easier choice.

"Deputy Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service’s Livestock and Poultry Program in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Dec 15,  USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and Purdue University have developed a series of training videos that illustrate proper sanitation assessment techniques to evaluate shell egg processing equipment. While the practices in these videos are in facilities that have USDA grading, they are valuable for any shell egg facility wishing to learn more about good sanitation techniques. To support emerging needs across the egg industry in recent years, AMS reviewed its internal procedures to assess equipment sanitation in shell egg processing plants. The agency visited over 30 shell egg processing facilities across the country to assess equipment sanitation and consistency. In order to document and share findings, AMS partnered with Purdue and ARS to develop this educational video series. The videos take the viewer through each phase of shell egg processing and explain how to inspect each component of the facility for sanitation effectiveness. The 18 videos are a great resource for shell egg processing facilities by illustrating what clean machines and facilities should look like prior to daily verification by USDA grading personnel. Originally released in English, these videos have now been translated into Spanish due to industry demand. The full series of videos can be found on Purdue University Extension’s YouTube channel at: Egg Processing & Production Videos - YouTube.

"USDA Food Loss and Waste Liaison in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Jun 15,  In the United States, more than one-third of all available food goes uneaten through loss or waste and when landfilled it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. On May 26, , the U.S. Department of Agriculture hosted our first ever USDA Food Loss and Waste Innovation Fair. This free, virtual fair highlighted businesses that are creating or implementing state-of-the-art technical solutions to reduce food loss and waste throughout the food system – from farm to table – and highlighted USDA activities in this space. Three categories of booth holders showcased their food loss and waste activities, products, and innovations. First, the fair highlighted U.S. Food Loss and Waste Champions. In addition to reducing food waste in their operations, several of these food industry leaders — e.g., Sprouts Farmers Market, Sodexo, and MGM Resorts International — committed to fighting hunger by donating safe, excess food to charitable organizations. Secondly, the fair also gave a platform for USDA agencies to share their work on food loss and waste (e.g., research, funding, measurement, outreach). As one example, the joint booth by USDA Foreign Agriculture Service and Feed the Future has information on the U.S. Government’s initiative to simultaneously combat global hunger and food loss and waste. Third, the fair featured USDA-funded organizations that are developing or marketing food loss and waste reducing technologies. Among the innovations was Full Cycle Bioplastics’ patented technology, which makes a compostable bioplastic from organic waste that can help address three global problems at once — reducing food waste, climate change, and plastic pollution. Nearly 850 people attended the live event.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food Safety Education Staff in  Health and Safety  Jul 01,  This Fourth of July, join the revolution against foodborne illness. Summer’s rising temperatures make picnics a playground for bacteria as families prepare, cook, and eat food outside. Here are some tips to keep you safe: Pledge Allegiance to Cleanliness Wash your hands before and after you handle food:  Wet your hands with clean, running water, turn off the tap and apply soap.  Lather your hands by rubbing them together with soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.  Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds.  Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.  Dry your hands using a clean towel. Don’t have access to a faucet? Carry bottled water, soap, paper towels, hand sanitizer or disposable moist towelettes that contain at least 60 percent alcohol. Use Red, White and Blue Cutting Boards Avoid cross contamination by using separate, different colored cutting boards — one for fresh fruits and vegetables, one for cheeses, and another for raw meats. Spark Up that Grill If you’re grilling at your picnic, remember to cook raw meat and poultry to a safe minimum internal temperature: ground meats at 160 F, whole cuts of meat at 145 F with a three-minute rest time, and poultry at 165 F. Land of the Free-zer Pack coolers with bags of ice, gel packs or even frozen water bottles to store your food. Use an appliance thermometer in your cooler to monitor that your food stays chilled at 40 F or below. For more information about food safety, contact the USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline to talk to a food safety expert or chat live at ask.usda.gov from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.

"University of Georgia, Associate Professor in  Research and Science  Dec 09,  Carbon dioxide emissions from the aviation sector constitute 2.5 percent of global emissions. One way to reduce this carbon footprint is to replace conventional aviation fuel (obtained by refining crude oil) with aviation fuel derived from sustainably produced biomass feedstocks. Carinata (Brassica Carinata), also known as Ethiopian mustard, is an oilseed crop that can be grown across the southern U.S. during winter months. The oil obtained from crushed carinata seeds can be refined to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This could reduce up to 68 percent of carbon emissions compared to a unit of conventional aviation fuel in the U.S. based on the findings of a USDA-National Institute of Fooda and Agriculture funded study recently published in the journal Global Change Biology Bioenergy by Dr. Puneet Dwivedi, Asiful Alam and Farhad Masum. Carinata does not compete with traditional summer crops grown in the region and could potentially provide additional income opportunities to farmers. It improves water quality, prevents soil erosion, and supports soil health. Since it is a non-food crop, carinata-based SAF also avoids the food-versus-fuel debate. The residues after crushing carinata are high in protein and can be used as animal feed. Refining carinata oil produces other valuable bioproducts such as renewable diesel and naphtha. Currently, producing carinata-based SAF costs more than conventional aviation fuel. As part of coordinated efforts to advance sustainable avial fuel, the Biden Administration proposed tax credits for SAF production meet 100 percent of aviation fuel demand by . This incentive could potentially attract investors to establish the necessary supply chain for carinata-based SAF in the southern United States, which could drive demand for the crop and inspire farmers to grow carinata in the region.

"Strategic Communications Coordinator, FPAC Business Center in  Conservation  Jan 05,  USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) provides extensive on the Nation’s conservation program activities through its RCA Viewer. And now, visualizations have been added to the tool, making the easier to interpret, sort, and download. Users can now graph, map, and download customized datasets that include information on acres receiving conservation, practices applied, land use, cropland soil erosion, and prime farmland. The tool also links to the full set of standard (tabular) RCA , which will continue to be available. Users can also link to research on the effect of conservation practices, including those from the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP), a multi-agency effort to quantify the environmental effects of conservation practices and programs and show the results of our conservation dollars spent. The RCA Viewer is named after the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act (RCA) of that gives the USDA the authority, among other things, to appraise the status and trends of soil, water, and related resources on non-Federal land. Other recent updates include on practice enhancements and bundles supported by the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and soil health performance measures. Two cropland soil health performance measures were added. The Cropland Soil Health and Sustainability measure identifies land units where at least two practices are applied to improve soil health during a single year. Practices include crop rotation, no-till, reduced till, cover crops, and CSP enhancements and bundles. The Cropland Soil Health Management System measure identifies areas where a group of conservation practices and enhancements (or bundles) are applied that address four basic soil health principles: minimize disturbance, maximize soil cover, maximize biodiversity, and maximize the presence of living roots. These updates, and now the addition of visualizations, show how NRCS is continually striving to improve the RCA Viewer to make it more valuable and easier to use.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service with guest author Alynn Sampson, Vice President, Operations & Impact, Food Bank of Lincoln in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Nutrition Security  Feb 08,  The Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP, Reach and Resiliency – Round 1 grants are making an impact in communities across the nation. At the Food Bank of Lincoln, we have been able to leverage Reach and Resiliency sub-grant funding awarded by our Nebraska TEFAP agency to identify underserved areas and to implement strategies to increase TEFAP access in those areas. In some cases, the strategies were as simple as increasing the frequency of deliveries to specific communities to ensure that existing TEFAP resources were being equitably distributed. During the first quarter of the grant, we implemented a 21% increase in deliveries to four identified underserved counties, which resulted in a 55% increase in TEFAP pounds of food distributed to those areas when compared to the previous year. As a result, TEFAP is now reaching more than 4,000 households in Butler, Fillmore, Otoe, and York counties. We also now have 12 food access points in those counties and three additional non-profit partners involved in TEFAP operations. A recent pantry partner gave their input regarding food access: “As food prices continue to rise, having the ability for increased deliveries to both of my rural food pantries is critical. The number of food pantry clients has doubled in the past few months, and I expect a steady increase. It is very difficult for clients to receive fresh produce in rural areas, and that is something that is always in need. To buy one head of lettuce now is almost $5 at our rural grocery stores, and 99% of our clients cannot afford something as simple as a head of lettuce with the price increases.” The TEFAP Reach and Resiliency Grant has provided support to the Food Bank of Lincoln as they deliver USDA TEFAP products more broadly to our neighbors in need. The grant has also expanded the use of to identify convenient delivery areas as well as ensure an increased focus on consistent access to USDA TEFAP products for communities. We are well on our way to closing this inequity gap in our targeted four counties. States are encouraged to apply for TEFAP Round 2 grant funding at TEFAP Reach and Resiliency | Food and Nutrition Service (usda.gov).

"USDA-FSIS in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Feb 07,  The Super Bowl is the biggest and most anticipated sporting event of the year. Friends and families “huddle” and consume foods and snacks for the duration of the game while cheering for their favorite team. This iconic annual event is often celebrated by ordering takeout and delivered foods, which if left out too long, can cause foodborne illness. Leaving food out at room temperature is a big food safety penalty. Bacteria that can cause foodborne illness will start to grow to dangerous levels in the range of temperatures between 40 F and 140 F when left out for over two hours or one hour if above 90 F. This range of temperatures is called the Danger Zone. To avoid foodborne illness during the big game, follow this game plan:  Keep cold foods cold and hot foods hot. Cold foods should be kept under 40 F on the buffet table by nesting serving dishes of food in bowls of ice. Hot foods should be kept above 140 F. A preheated oven, chafing dishes, preheated warming trays or slow cookers can be used to keep food hot.  Don’t serve all food at once. Use small platters and replace them often with fresh refrigerated platters of food, rather than adding fresh food to a serving dish already on the table. Hot foods should be reheated to 165 F as measured with a food thermometer. When reheating in the microwave, cover the food for even heating. Check the temperature of the food in several places with a food thermometer, as some microwaved foods can have cold spots. For more information, call the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline or email MPHotline@usda.gov to reach a food safety expert or chat live at ask.usda.gov from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.

"Posted by Farm to School Specialist Allison Bell, Mountain Plains Regional Office, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  May 31,  Bringing together local producers and schools was the objective of the “Bringing the Farm to School” producer training in Hardin, Montana. The training sought to build relationships between schools and producers to increase the availability of local foods served to children. USDA Farm to School Specialists Andrea Alma and Alli Bell were on hand to demonstrate the many ways USDA’s Farm to School Program is connecting with schools and communities. Partners from Montana Team Nutrition and the Mission Mountain Food Enterprise Center brought the training curriculum to life, showing agricultural producers how to approach schools to sell their products and offering insight into procurement considerations, including the budgets, timing, and regulations faced by school food directors. Participants shared ideas on how to connect kids to more local foods. For example, two local ranchers drove more than five hours to the training, looking for strategies on approaching schools with their excess ground beef. Another attendee, trying to start a food hub, wanted to orient her business to sell food to schools. Another participant planned to start a mixed vegetable operation and wanted to incorporate farm to school in her business plan. The training included a tour of the Hardin School kitchen with Food Service Director Marlo Spreng and Hardin Farm to School Coordinator Elle Ross. They described the district’s journey to more scratch cooking and meals featuring traditional Crow dishes, since the school serves children from the Crow Reservation. The training also hosted a “Montana Foods for Montana Schools” connection event for school food service professionals to learn more about Farm to School and to meet farmers in their area. This innovative event covered it all - knowledge sharing, relationship building, and coming together over a meal. It was an outstanding networking and program improvement opportunity Mountain Plains Regional staff were proud to attend.

There is a wealth of historical that’s inaccessible because today’s crop model software applications cannot easily interpret it. USDA’s National Agricultural Library (NAL) is working with the University of Florida and the Agricultural Research Network (ARDN) to solve this problem. ARDN is dedicated to making high value datasets from past research and experiments compatible with crop models and other analytical tools. With support from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), NAL and the University of Florida are piloting a “hackathon” approach to make this old useful. Experts gather several times a year to create standardized vocabulary and extract relevant information to use in the AgMIP Crop Experiment schema (ACE) – a widely used format for agricultural models. As part of the NIFA grant, the team will annotate four datasets using ARDN protocols. The initial datasets include research from projects at Iowa State University, University of Georgia, the University of Arizona, and the Kellogg Biological Station. These annotated datasets will be available on NAL’s Ag Commons website. NAL also supports ARDN by hosting VMapper software on the Ag Commons website. VMapper creates a file which contains the “road map” for translating the original into the ACE format. ARDN’s collaborative efforts will save crop modelers time and give them access to much more historical , accelerating research and new discoveries.

"Public Affairs Specialist, FSIS, USDA in  Health and Safety  May 24,  At your next picnic, let the spotlight shine on your food — not on party crashers like Salmonella or Listeria. When temperatures rise and food safety steps aren’t followed, cold dishes at a cookout are at risk for unsafe bacteria levels. Avoid foodborne illness by following these steps: Clean: Remember to clean and sanitize all dishes and utensils used to make your salad and wash your hands before and after food prep. Separate: Use different cutting boards, plates and utensils to avoid spreading bacteria when preparing your raw foods and ready-to-eat cold dishes. Cook: Make sure the main meat or poultry ingredients used in cold salads (egg salad, chicken salad, etc.) are cooked to safe internal temperatures before mixing:  Cook eggs to 160 F.  Cook chicken to 165 F. Although most cold salads use mayonnaise, the danger of foodborne illness lies with the main ingredient, such as eggs or chicken. Make sure they are cooked and chilled at the proper temperature. If you use homemade mayonnaise, follow these . Chill: Avoid the Danger Zone (temperatures between 40 F and 140 F) by refrigerating perishable food within two hours — one hour if it’s a hot day (above 90 F). Keep cold foods at an internal temperature of 40 F or below by nestling food in ice or keeping food in a cooler.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Farm Production and Conservation Business Center in  Conservation  Jun 23,  FWC Photo by Andy Wraithmell, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Did you know the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil scientists are playing an important role in saving Florida’s manatees? These giant, but gentle, creatures are adored by residents and visitors to Florida. Unfortunately, though, their numbers have been threatened in recent years throughout the state. Manatees in Florida’s Indian River Lagoon (IRL), which stretches 156 miles along Florida’s eastern coast, have been starving to death at an alarming rate over the last two years. These deaths can be attributed to a lack of seagrass, their main source of food, which is being affected by algal blooms. As the algae blooms destroy seagrass beds, it causes sediment to float to the water’s surface. The water goes from clear to murky, making it harder for light to penetrate the water and provide sustenance to the seagrass. This creates a vicious cycle where more seagrass dies, more sunlight is blocked, and the manatees are left with less food to eat. NRCS is part of a team working to address the challenge, along with St. Johns River Water Management District, the University of Florida, among many other national and state agencies. The scientists go out on the IRL in pontoon boats and use sonar to conduct underwater soil surveys to gather information on the healthiest areas and the most degraded areas of the lagoon. The information is used to decide where to concentrate restoration efforts. This information has helped improve lagoons through actions like clams, oysters, and seagrass being deployed to aid in filtering and clearing the water. Scientists hope that continued improvement will eventually lead to the full restoration of manatees in the IRL.

"Northern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Research and Science  Trade  Jun 10,  Several hundred non-native forest insect species have become established in the U.S. Recent arrivals, such as this adult Asian longhorned beetle, have killed millions of trees and altered urban landscapes in the Northeast and Midwest. (U.S. Department of Agriculture/Kenneth R. Law, courtesy of Bugwood.org)  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Wood makes great packaging material—it’s inexpensive, abundant and versatile—but there’s one drawback: destructive forest pests stowaway in the pallets, crates and dunnage (wood used to brace cargo) used in international shipping. Over many years, international trade has resulted in the inadvertent introduction of many non-native wood-feeding pests and plant pathogens in the U.S. and throughout the world. Some of these non-native insects, including the emerald ash borer and the Asian longhorned beetle, have become highly invasive and caused serious environmental and economic impacts. But an international standard for wood packaging material is slowing the inadvertent export of invasive bark- and wood-boring insects, according to a study conducted by Robert Haack, a research entomologist with the Forest Service’s Northern Research Station in Lansing, Mich., and a team of scientists. Researchers found as much as a 52 percent drop in infestation rates in the U.S., where the standard was implemented in three phases between and . The study was published May 14 in the journal PLOS ONE. The International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15, or ISPM 15, is a set of standards developed by the International Plant Protection Convention stipulating how wood packaging material used in international trade should be treated before export. Treatments for eliminating live insects that may be contained in wood include heating wood, fumigating it and requiring the removal of bark from wood used for wood packaging material. As of October , more than 78 countries had implemented ISPM 15. Haack and co-authors of the study, including U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists Kerry Britton (now retired), Joseph F. Cavey and Lynn J. Garrett, believe that the drop in infestation rates would be even more dramatic if more had been collected prior to implementation of the standard. The best available in the U.S. only allowed researchers to compare wood packaging infestation rates from two years prior to U.S. implementation of the new international standard to infestation rates during the first four years after the standards were implemented. “The reduction in infestation rate would likely have been even higher if we had more years of that predated U.S. implementation of these international standards,” Haack said. “For example, based on infestation of wood packaging material entering New Zealand from the early s, when infestation rates were higher, ISPM 15 has achieved closer to a 97 percent reduction in the number of insect stowaways.” International wood packaging material is now treated to prevent stowaways like this Asian longhorned beetle larvae.

"Director, Grading and Standards Division of the Agricultural Marketing Service's Dairy Program in  Trade  Dec 01,  USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and its sister agencies work to keep markets open to U.S. products. Recently, an interagency team resolved an issue with Morocco, keeping a $126 million market open for American butter, cheese and other dairy products. U.S. agricultural exports continue to be a bright spot for America’s economy, worth a record $152.5 billion in fiscal year .  That’s why USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and its sister agencies work so hard to keep these export markets open.  So in , when Morocco requested that USDA use a new dairy export certificate that we could not endorse, we launched into action.  Our goal was to protect an export market worth $126 million annually while preserving our close relationship with a valued trading partner. Morocco is the 13th largest export market for our dairy products, and U.S. dairy exports are the fastest growing export category to that country.  U.S. companies export many dairy commodities to Morocco, such as butter, cheese and skim milk powder, as well as dairy ingredients such as milk protein and whey protein products. However, in Morocco’s agricultural officials requested changes to the information provided on the dairy export certificates issued by the unit I direct, the Grading and Standards Division of within the AMS Dairy Program.  Most countries importing U.S. dairy products require these certificates, and issuing them is one of many services my Division provides to exporters to maintain and expand market access. As a stopgap measure, we began using a general dairy certificate to keep that market open.  But then, in April , following numerous detainments of U.S. dairy shipments, we learned that Morocco was considering stopping all U.S. dairy trade if we did not submit a specifically negotiated export certificate. Beginning in , the AMS Dairy Program worked closely with an existing interagency team of technical experts from AMS, USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address the issue.  The team submitted a response to Morocco that addressed additives, animal health issues, microbiological criteria and thermal treatment processes, as well as a proposed AMS Sanitary Certificate for Exports for Milk and Milk Products for Human Consumption to Morocco that reflected all the suggested changes. On November 12, , we received the good news that the government of Morocco had accepted the proposed certificate—without further revision, concluding more than three years of negotiations.  The certificate’s acceptance means this important market will remain open to U.S. exports, paving the way for an even better year for the U.S. dairy industry. USDA and AMS are no strangers to keeping U.S. export markets open.  In , the same interagency team responded quickly to changes in China’s regulatory requirements for U.S. dairy exports.  Their work helped to secure a market worth $1 billion annually. We’re committed to keeping dairy and all other U.S. agricultural exports flowing.  By maintaining and expanding export markets, we help to strengthen our rural communities that produce the high-quality, American-grown products consumers worldwide desire.  And that’s good for everyone.

"Senior Trade Advisor, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Jun 20,  Driscoll’s berries being sold in a store (Photograph courtesy of Driscoll’s. Copyright . All rights reserved.) Two years ago this month, the United States and the European Union (EU) implemented an organic equivalence arrangement, meaning products that are certified as organic in the U.S. can also be sold as organic in the EU, and vice versa. This arrangement broke down many of the barriers that organic producers, especially small and medium-sized farmers, were facing in exporting their goods to one of their largest markets. It has also proved to be a good example of how we can recognize each others' systems and work together across borders to arrive at beneficial agreements. The U.S. and EU have some of the strongest regulatory protections in the world, and the organic equivalence arrangement recognizes these standards and uses them for everyone’s benefit. Before the agreement, growers and companies wanting to trade products on both sides of the Atlantic had to obtain separate certifications to two different standards, which meant a double set of fees, inspections, and paperwork. Now, if a product is certified organic by one party, it can bear both the USDA organic seal and the EU organic logo, without going through that second certification process. This is possible because the EU and the U.S. have recognized that though our regulatory systems are different, they both produce high quality organic food and agricultural products under rigorous programs. Secretary Vilsack, while addressing the EU agricultural ministers earlier this week, had the same message of cooperation in regards to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). “We also need to focus on reducing the impact of the differences in our regulatory and standard-setting systems. For companies on both sides of the Atlantic, this is perhaps the most promising – and challenging – area for cooperation in T-TIP,” Vilsack said. “The U.S. and the EU have the strongest regulatory protections in the world, and nothing we do through T-TIP will undermine this. But there are steps that can be taken to better align our regulatory and standard-setting processes by improving transparency, participation and accountability. The U.S.-EU organic equivalency agreement, which took effect two years ago this month, is a good example of how we can recognize each other’s systems and facilitate trade to the benefit of both sides.” The organic arrangement expands market access, reduces duplicative requirements and reduces certification costs while protecting organic integrity.  The U.S. and EU work together to promote organic production and share technical information and best practices in an effort to further enhance the integrity of organic crops and livestock production systems. Carmela Beck, the National Organic Program Manager for Driscoll’s, an exporter of fresh berries, said the equivalency agreement has greatly simplified the export process, reduced confusion and redundancy and provided an opportunity for organic farmers. “The passage of the U.S.-EU equivalency agreement is a great success story and is a testament to the rigor of both the U.S. and EU organic standards,” Beck said.” Not only has the flow of trade been increased but the National Organic Program and the European Commission continue to work diligently to protect organic integrity in a global economy. Organic farmers now have even more opportunity to grow their businesses to meet this growing, global demand for organic products.” Amy’s Kitchen is one American company that has seen the benefit of the organic equivalence arrangement. Amy’s has seen a tenfold increase in its UK and EU business. “Since the U.S.-EU equivalency agreement took effect, Amy’s Kitchen is now able to export products directly from its U.S. manufacturing facilities,” said Andy Berliner, CEO and Co-founder of Amy’s Kitchen. ""This has led to a tremendous increase in business for Amy’s across the board, including the ability to share information about Amy’s foods being organic in the UK and EU on our packaging, a rise from 15 to more than 60 products now offered in the UK and EU over the last five years.” The partnership, while providing a strong foundation to globally promote organic agriculture, is also a win for the American economy. Industry estimates show that the market for U.S. organics sales to the EU could grow more than 300 percent, from $70 million to $300 million, a huge boost for a growing sector of our agricultural economy. It also means higher incomes for organic farmers and ranchers, more opportunities for small businesses, and jobs for people who package, ship, and market organic products. USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service and Foreign Agricultural Service, along with the Office of the United States Trade Representative, were instrumental in developing the organic equivalency agreement between the EU and U.S. and have also worked to develop similar agreements with Canada and Japan.

"Deputy Administrator, AMS Dairy Programs in  Trade  Jun 19,  U.S. dairy exports are currently valued at $6 billion and the country is the world’s leading exporter of skim milk powder, cheese, whey, and lactose products. USDA Photo Courtesy of Scott Bauer. Every June, USDA joins the rest of the country to celebrate Dairy Month. It is a time to thank our nation’s dairy producers and processors for their tireless work to produce quality dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt. Here at USDA, besides getting our fill of our favorite dairy products, we celebrate our nation’s dairy industry every day by finding new markets where people can enjoy their products. This often entails working with other countries’ governments to negotiate export and import requirements as well as helping businesses meet these requirements. Our nation’s dairy exporters reach new markets with the help of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). Export certificates are often the critical piece in the trade puzzle. On this front, AMS offers certificates for more than 80% of the countries that accept U.S. dairy exports. Our Dairy Programs can verify that businesses’ dairy products meet export requirements. The AMS Dairy Grading Branch provides export certificates for products or conditions for which they have documentation for or from plants they inspect. Certificates are paper or electronic documents which describe and attest to attributes of consignments of food destined for international trade. Certification of food may be based on a range of inspection activities including continuous online inspection, auditing of the quality assurance system, and examination of finished products. With the help of export certificates, importers can confidently receive products that meet requirements agreed upon by the U.S. and the importing country. As a result, people all over the world enjoy U.S. dairy products. In recent years, AMS helped open up U.S produced products to several major importing nations. In March , our agency enhanced its system, enabling the availability of electronic sanitary export certificates to China. Now exporters can request their China sanitary export certificates using the Electronic Document Creation System (eDocs). China is the world’s largest importer and is currently the second largest export destination for U.S. dairy products. Working with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), AMS helped 240 U.S. dairy and infant formula firms get audited and registered to export products to China using our eDocs system. Another example of AMS connecting exporters to new markets happened in when the Customs Union (CU) trade bloc -- composed of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia -- came into existence. A new U.S. – CU dairy veterinary certificate was to resume trade in those countries. Trade was halted in when the CU demanded changes to the current U.S. export health certificate. Negotiations continued until March when AMS was notified that all members of the CU accepted a U.S. proposed export certificate for pasteurized milk products.  The U.S. government interagency team is discussing additional administrative steps before issuing certificates. In addition to negotiating export certificate agreements with other countries, AMS has created a number of resources that will help dairy exporters. We encourage you to check out our Dairy Exports website. We recently held 20 webinar trainings that helped exporters become familiar with our systems. Our sites are equipped with important documents, frequently asked questions, and key contacts. The effort to increase the number of export destinations for U.S. dairy businesses will help continue a positive trend for the industry. In the last 10 years, dairy exports have averaged a 21% increase per year. Currently, U.S. dairy exports are valued at $6 billion and the country is the world’s leading single country exporter of skim milk powder, cheese, whey, and lactose products. AMS is proud to be a leader when it comes to increasing demand for U.S. dairy exports. Whether it’s June or any other time of the year, we are committed to supporting our nation’s dairy producers and processors. We want to make sure that people all over the world can enjoy their quality products. AMS offers a number of services to help U.S. dairy exporters reach new markets. Offering certificates for more than 80% of the countries that accept U.S. dairy exports, AMS has helped the export industry average a 21% increase per year over the last 10 years. USDA Photo.

"Announces Organic Crop Insurance, Other Measure  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .13  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  Washington, May 14, ― Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today discussed his vision for U.S. organic agriculture and USDA efforts to ensure its continued success during remarks to the Organic Trade Association. Vilsack announced a number of changes and new initiatives to support the continued growth of organic agriculture, including that the USDA's Risk Management Agency's (RMA) federal crop insurance program will increase coverage options for organic producers this year and provide even more options in , including a contract price addendum as well as new premium price elections for organic crops. Additionally, RMA will remove the current five-percent organic rate surcharge on all future crop insurance policies beginning in .Vilsack also said USDA will be providing new guidance and direction on organic production to all USDA agencies in support of organic agriculture and markets. USDA is now asking each agency to routinely address the needs of the organic sector in their programs and services where appropriate. The National Organic Program has supported the continued growth of America's organic sector, which has been increasing market share each year and now is a more than $30 billion industry. Vilsack noted that accurate is the biggest obstacle for developing better crop insurance options for organic farmers and expressed his desire that Congress help USDA make further progress by renewing the Organic Initiative as part of a new Food, Farms and Jobs bill.""Organic agriculture is one of the fastest growing segments of American agriculture and helps farmers receive a higher price for their product as they strive to meet growing consumer demand,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""These new options will extend the safety net provided by crop insurance and provide fair and flexible solutions to organic producers. Coupled with the new guidance for agencies to support this growing sector, USDA recognizes that organics are gaining market share and is helping boost this emerging segment.""New crop-insurance pricing options will be available to organic producers who grow crops under guaranteed contracts beginning with the crop year. This contract price option allows organic producers who receive a contract price for their crop to get a crop insurance guarantee that is more reflective of the actual value of their crop. They will have the ability, where available and at their choice, to use their personal contract price as their price election or to choose existing crop insurance price elections. This contract price option will be available for between 60 and 70 crops in the crop year and this contract price feature will be available to the majority of insured organic crops. RMA is also changing organic transitional yields (t-yields) so they will be more reflective of actual organic farming experience, starting with the crop year.All crops are being evaluated for establishing organic prices for the crop year. Current pricing options only allow farmers to insure organic crops at the conventional prices, with the exception of eight crops (corn, soybeans, cotton, processing tomatoes, avocados, and several fresh stone fruit crops) that already have premium organic price elections. RMA is working to provide organic price elections for six to ten crops in . Oats and mint are two crops that have already been selected for organic price elections in , and apricots, apples, blueberries, millet, and others are still under consideration.USDA's Agriculture Marketing Service last year announced the Organic Literacy Initiative, a public outreach and employee training program to help connect current and prospective organic operations with appropriate USDA resources. To date, over 14,000 USDA employees have taken the basic training on USDA's role in organic agriculture. The new guidance will further improve USDA agencies' ability to incorporate the needs of the growing organic sector into their programs and services. These combined actions should result in staff better equipped to help organic farmers obtain technical and financial assistance, insure crops and livestock, access research findings, secure loans, develop conservation practices, find current organic price information, and access local, regional, and international markets. Through this effort, agencies will also better understand the scope and rigor of the certification process and how it complements their own programs.Organic certification allows farmers and ranchers to receive premium prices for their value-added products. Over the past 10 years, the number of certified organic farms and businesses in the United States has expanded to approximately 17,750, representing a 240 percent increase since USDA first began collecting this . Similarly, the retail value of the organic industry grew almost 9.5 percent in to $31.4 billion. Organic foods continue to gain market share in the food industry, climbing to 4.2 percent of U.S. retail food sales in .USDA has already made several changes to better serve organic customers, including offering more flexible microloans and improving Federal crop insurance programs. To help open new markets for U.S. farmers and ranchers, USDA has streamlined trade with multiple foreign governments. These trade partnerships allow U.S. organic products to be sold as organic in Canada, the European Union, Taiwan, and Japan without maintaining certification to multiple standards. Expanding the reach of U.S. organic products creates opportunities for small businesses and increases jobs for Americans who grow, package, ship and market organic products.USDA is responsible, under the Organic Foods Production Act of (OFPA), for establishing national standards for organically-produced agricultural products. The National Organic Program has been critical for the development of clear standards and enforcing a level playing-field for organic businesses, which has lead to expanded trade opportunities to create new markets for U.S. organic businesses. These standards assure consumers that products with the USDA organic seal meet consistent, uniform standards.

"At the Agricultural Outlook Forum: Outlook for Farm Income and Food Prices  Policy makers, economists, the farm and food industry, consumer advocates, and others rely on USDA’s food price outlook and farm sector income and finances in their decision making and planning.  At this year’s Forum, two sessions focus on these closely watched USDA forecasts and present the latest analysis and projections. A session on the Farm Income Outlook for focuses on general measures of the financial well-being of the farm economy. The analyses and released by the Economic Research Service (ERS) and used by USDA and others in both the public and private sector provide insights about the financial health of the U.S. agricultural economy. Financial performance measures assess the farm sector's receipts and expenses; net income; variations in farm income by farm size and other categorizations; and changes in the sector's wealth holdings. ERS estimates and forecasts of farm income and wealth are based on information collected across USDA and other parts of government, as well as responses to USDA's annual Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) and other sector-level information.

"Family Farm Co-op in Missouri Shows Commitment to Food Safety  For more than four generations, Amish farmers in the Kansas City area have abided by a simple tenet:  farm sustainably and care for the earth to preserve their way of life for future generations.  Good Natured Family Farms (GNFF), a cooperative of 18 Amish family farms in Missouri, is using GroupGAP, a new USDA audit program, to help them safeguard their future by building strong markets for the high-quality, local foods they produce. In August, the group made USDA history as the first to receive an official USDA Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) certification through our new GroupGAP program. Since , the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has provided the traditional USDA GAP audit program to the fruit and vegetable industry. GAP is a voluntary program that verifies its participants follow U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and industry best practices to minimize risks of food safety hazards when producing, handling, and storing fruits, vegetables, and other specialty crops.

"National Hunger Fellow, and Julie Curti, Acting Deputy Director, USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 30,   What better way to end the day than by uncovering local food powerhouses in the Nation’s Capital! On Wednesday, April 21, , the USDA and HHS Centers for Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships convened to visit two jewels located in Washington, DC: Common Good City Farm of Ledroit Park and Healthy Solutions of Anacostia. Common Good City Farm is an urban farm and education center growing food for low-income residents in the city and providing educational opportunities for all people to increase food security, and improve human health and environmental sustainability.  Common Good City Farm was funded in part by a National Institute for Food and Agriculture Community Food Project Grant. The University of the District of Columbia’s 4-H Club has just partnered with the farm to help their kids learn to grow and eat healthy food.  Supported by USDA, the goal of the 4-H program is to assist young people in developing knowledge, skills, and attitudes that will enable them to become self-directing, responsible, productive citizens.  Common Good City Farm has been successful in part due to strong partnerships with organizations like the 4-H Club, as well as community support from organizations like the Advisory Neighborhood Commission and Mount Bethel Baptist Church. Next, we journeyed across the river to visit a Healthy Solutions youth cooking class. Started by Tanikka Cunningham, Healthy Solutions’ mission is to promote healthy lifestyles in underserved communities.  The students cooked up and ate four delicious dishes that included a fruit salad, a mesclun spring salad, an eggplant pasta sauce, and a tri-colored pasta dish. Healthy Solutions works in Alabama, North Carolina, and Washington, DC to create community-based food systems that allow access to healthy affordable foods.  The organization also focuses on agricultural job creation and training, healthy living education, and youth development.  Healthy Solutions operates a produce coop in DC and sells food to local corner shops in the neighborhood. There are only three major chain grocery stores east of the Anacostia River, so the impact of Healthy Solutions, which brings 10,000 pounds of fresh produce into these communities each month, is critical.  The Obama Administration’s proposed Healthy Food Financing Initiative would send more resources to help bring access to affordable, fresh, and healthy food to communities like Anacostia. The Healthy Solutions kids enjoy their meal.   Healthy Solutions students cooked up and ate four delicious dishes that included a fruit salad, a mesclun spring salad.

"Partnerships Help Accelerate Forest Restoration, Increasing Benefits, Decreasing Threats  We cannot care for public forests and grasslands alone—the land benefits the most when communities join us and provide input to help shape forest plans. The U.S. Forest Service takes pride in being part of the communities we serve, whether by managing the land to be resilient to disturbance or as members of the public participating as citizens in the towns where we live and work. Spurred by Secretary Tom Vilsack’s vision that emphasizes collaboration with stakeholders and restoration of the Nation’s forests, the Forest Service published the report Increasing the Pace of Restoration and Job Creation on Our National Forests in .

"Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Mar 02,  International School Meals Day raises awareness of the importance of food and nutrition in education and offers an opportunity for students to share school feeding experiences from across the globe. March is National Nutrition Month. Throughout the month, USDA will be highlighting results of our efforts to improve access to safe, healthy food for all Americans and supporting the health of our next generation.  The upsurge in healthy eating and food security campaigns is really resonating with schoolchildren, so much so, that a day has been set aside for youth around the world to share their experiences.  The celebration of this movement – International School Meals Day – draws our attention to the importance of good nutrition for all children. March 3 marks the fourth consecutive year that USDA will partner with the United Kingdom to invite children from across the globe to promote nutrition and school meals, this year focusing on introducing fresh and healthy local fare into their diets. On that day children will connect through social media to share their food experiences and healthy eating habits. I’m looking forward to witnessing the fun first-hand at Glen Forest Elementary School in Fairfax County, Va., where students will Skype with their peers at Washingborough Academy in the UK. I’m sure it will be a great learning experience for the students and me alike. In the last decade the momentum for healthier eating has found a place in the world’s conscience.  The International School Meals Day initiative literally brings together the world’s children to elevate awareness on the importance of nutritional quality in school meal programs while raising universal consciousness of hunger and poverty. As a lifelong school nutrition advocate I am delighted by the progress that’s been made both domestically and internationally to improve the nutrition and well-being of our youth. To see children the world over embrace this health movement is inspiring. So on behalf of USDA I offer a heartfelt “thank you” to the organizers of International School Meals Day and all those who participate. You are helping ensure a brighter and healthier future for our world!

"Director, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Oct 25,  American Indian students at Navajo Technical College, in Crownpoint, New Mexico, are using new lab and equipment to develop the veterinary skills they need to work with large animals. (Photo courtesy of Navajo Technical College) Oct. 20, , is an important milestone in our nation’s history in regards to equity in research, education, and extension. On that date, 29 tribal colleges, representing different histories, cultural orientations, and organizational structures, received land-grant university (LGU) status. Such LGU status gave these institutions—referred to as LGUs—access to federal resources to help improve the lives of tribal students, while respecting sovereignty and promoting self-sufficiency in American Indian communities. In the ensuing 23 years, significant progress has occurred in building capacity at the land-grant system to better serve Native American students and communities. The s are part of the family of land-grants that the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supports through research, education, and extension programs. These programs recruit and retain students in the food and agricultural sciences, enhance economic opportunities and quality of life, improve nutrition and health, and protect natural resources and the environment. The tribal colleges and universities, now numbering 34, are located in 13 states and provide access to higher education to over 80 percent of Indian Country. Collectively, they enroll approximately 20,000 students and provide vital services to some 50,000 tribal community members. Unlike most institutions of higher education, the s teach in a cultural context that empowers students by drawing on the strength of their people’s histories, indigenous knowledge, and traditions. The s provide much-needed high school completion (GED), basic remediation, job training, college preparatory courses, and adult basic education programs. They serve as community libraries and centers, tribal archives, career and business centers, economic development centers, public meeting places, and elder and child care centers. Examples of the strength of community, education, pride, and opportunity abound in Indian Country. Here are just a few: Chief Dull Knife College, in Lame Deer, Montana, developed welding courses to train apprentice welders to find jobs that could eventually triple the average salary of their Cheyenne reservation. At Fort Totten, North Dakota, Cankdeska Cikana Community College provided the Spirit Lake Tribe citizens new extension education that helped reduce diabetes and improved health. The Institute of American Indian Arts, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, is integrating agricultural science into every curriculum, linking them to American Indian worldviews, stories, and tradition. Join me in congratulating our institutions on their 23rd Anniversary. As we look into the future, there is much more work to be done, and the partnership between NIFA and s will continue to grow and be healthy, reflecting the rich history and culture of the American Indian peoples. While respecting sovereignty, we hope all of us succeed in our efforts to serve the people and the land. NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

"Powerful Partnerships Feed Hungry Milwaukee Kids in the Summertime   An African proverb holds that it takes a village to raise a child. And what’s a village? Well, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, it’s the Milwaukee Hunger Task Force (the State’s largest food bank and anti-hunger advocacy organization), Kohl’s Department Stores, Milwaukee Public Schools, the Salvation Army, Boys and Girls Clubs, the Social Development Commission and the Milwaukee Park System. When the school year ends, many children and teens who rely on USDA school meals are at a higher risk of going hungry during the summer when school is not in session. USDA’s Summer Food Service Program can make sure that kids don’t go hungry summer, but the program can’t work without sponsors and supportive communities.  Ollice C.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  May 11,   The United Kingdom (UK) has long played an important role in U.S. agricultural exports. This history dates back to the completion of the Erie Canal in the early s, which linked the Great Lakes to the Atlantic seaboard, significantly increasing the export of food, particularly Midwestern wheat, to England. To this day, the United Kingdom offers tremendous opportunities for U.S. agriculture and the United States exports more than $1.6 billion annually in agricultural, fish and forestry products to the UK. Many of these products are showcased each year during USDA-endorsed trade shows, such as the International Food Exhibition (IFE), which took place in London in March. Nineteen U.S. companies participated in the U.S. Pavilion, including 11 new-to-market and new-to-export companies. Several U.S. companies were lucky enough to meet with the Olympic Organizing Committee that had a team looking for products to be used at the Summer Olympics in London in . The exhibition produced $469,000 in on-site sales and $1.9 million in projected 12-month sales. Robin Rhea, owner of Slather Brand Foods, Inc., is pictured here during the International Food Exhibition (IFE) in London. During the show, U.S. exhibitors introduced more than 100 new products, ranging from sauces to baby food to ice cream. Delicious sauces are the name of the game for Slather Brand Foods Inc., a new-to-export company who explored export opportunities as part of the U.S. pavilion. Robin Rhea is the owner of Slather Brand Foods, Inc., based in Charleston, South Carolina. As a Southern U.S. Trade Association (SUSTA) member, she learned about the assistance USDA’s market development programs provide to companies like hers. Ms. Rhea used Market Access Program (MAP) funding in order to participate in this year’s show in London, a first for her company. She credits her attendance at the show with helping her connect with potential exporters and assess the opportunity to sell her product outside of the United States. “The UK market is definitely ready for Slather Brand Slatherin' Sauce,” said Ms. Rhea. “There is very little competition to speak of in the sauce category.  Moreover, the UK is just coming into its own in terms of BBQ and they are hungry for diversified products. In addition to retail markets there was an overwhelming interest in the food service industry and it will top our targeted list when we are ready to export.” The company plans to continue to expand its domestic reach in the coming year and explore exports as part of its business plan in . The knowledge and contacts Slather Brand Foods gained from attendance at IFE have prepared the company for this venture. To learn more about market development programs, visit the FAS website.

"USDA Tribal Collaboration Strengthens Food Security on Nevada's Indian Reservations  Today in Nevada more than one in four children live in households that cannot reliably provide nutritious meals every day.  This dubious distinction makes it the state with the nation’s fourth highest rate of child hunger.  And for children living on Indian reservations, the incidence of hunger may be even higher. What does food insecurity look like on Nevada reservations?  With few places to shop, reservation residents have very limited access to fresh produce.  Food insecurity not only equates to a lack of nutritious foods available, but also means families must drive great distances to a grocery store.  To cope, families choose more canned and frozen foods that will last until the next weekly or monthly shopping trip, which often means less consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Melissa Baker, Program Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service, Western Region Special Nutrition Programs  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 18,   Respond to this story","What are some consequences of food insecurity for families living on Nevada Indian reservations, particularly when it comes to accessing nutritious foods?","For families living on Nevada Indian reservations, food insecurity leads to limited access to fresh produce, reliance on canned and frozen foods that last longer, resulting in reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables."

"Boston Beats the Asian Longhorned Beetle  One of the things I consider a highlight of my career and that I will always remember is our successful response to the July detection of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) in Boston, Massachusetts.  As I attended the May 12 ceremony commemorating the eradication of the ALB infestation in Boston and listened to the speakers share their thoughts about what it took to get us there, I had a deep sense of appreciation for the partnership among the state and federal cooperators who worked together to bring us to that day.  It was swift action and continued diligence that protected Boston’s trees from further destruction. APHIS and its cooperators were able to accomplish the goal of eradicating ALB in Boston in less than 4 years.  Thanks also go to a community member who reported the infestation early.  That early detection and report resulted in the loss of only 6 infested trees. But as I celebrate our first victory over the invasive pest in Massachusetts, I am compelled to ask you to remain vigilant in inspecting your trees regularly for signs of the beetle and report any suspicious damage to your State Plant Health Director.

"Child Nutrition Programs, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 21,   If you haven’t heard the buzz, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service’s expansion of the Team Up for School Nutrition Success  initiative is in full swing, with 20 completed trainings and 14 more scheduled for . Team Up offers a unique learning experience that enhances schools’ food service operations through training and peer-to-peer mentorship to school nutrition professionals looking to maintain a healthy environment and encourage strong student meal program participation. What exactly happens at a Team Up training? Ever had an “a-ha” or a “why didn’t I think of that” moment when a friend shares a really great idea? Team Up is where “a-ha” moments are shared among school nutrition professionals and turned into action back via their school meals programs. Let’s break down a Team Up workshop to see how these “a-ha” moments transpire. A peer mentor shares her best practices for menu planning during the Wisconsin Team Up training. Best Practice Panel Presentations  Great ideas are meant for sharing. Team Up workshops kick off with panels where participants hear school nutrition peer mentors share their best practices and strategies for issues like increasing school meal program participation, menu planning and financial management. At the Georgia Team Up training, participants share ideas and questions for menu planning and increasing program participation. Breakout Sessions  This is where the magic happens! After listening to best practice presentations, participants break out into small groups for a round of brainstorming and problem-solving around each specific topic, all with best practice ideas in mind. Using the Egan Skilled Helper Model, which uses an opportunity-development approach, school nutrition peer mentors guide and facilitate discussions as participants identify their program challenges and develop solutions with their peers.  During the breakout sessions, participants examine: What is going on in my school nutrition program? What does a better outcome look like? How do I get to the better outcome? How do I make it all happen?  The Action Plan  Participants examined their challenges and solutions and excitement is building around progress and potential opportunities identified during the breakout sessions. What do participants do with all of these great ideas? Peer mentors help participants put their specific strategies and solutions into an action plan using SMART goals, which are defined as goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time‐bound. Participants take their action plan home as a guide to implement their Team Up strategies and solutions in their school nutrition programs.  Resources  Operating a school meals program can be challenging, but school nutrition directors don’t have to do it alone. Team Up workshops invite allied organizations to share their free school nutrition resources that support school food service operations and help create a healthy school environment. Participants can use these resources as they move forward with implementing their action plan in their school nutrition programs.  Networking is another valuable resource Team Up workshops provide, giving school nutrition directors opportunities to develop working relationships with their peer mentors and other school nutrition directors in their state. Many directors who have attended a Team Up training have expressed that they’re not alone and can turn to their fellow director. “I can now see what areas I need to work and improve on in my program. I see that I am not alone in my journey. I have many helpful people that I can rely on for help and guidance. The Team Up training was valuable to me because I am more comfortable talking to my peers. I see I am not alone and I can ask for help.” – Rebecca Lusk, Manager/Supervisor, Towns County Schools, Hiawassee, Ga.  After the Workshop  The Team Up workshop may be complete, but the Team Up spirit lives on. After returning home, participants roll up their sleeves, take a deep breath, and take the first steps outlined in their Team Up action plan - and then real life happens. Barriers pop up as action plans are implemented, but there’s no reason to get discouraged. Team Up peer mentors and state agencies are still available should participants have questions or get stuck with their action plan. In addition, USDA together with the Institute of Child Nutrition hosts monthly webinars for school nutrition professionals to expand their knowledge and tools on a wide variety of topics; webinars recordings are made available online for later viewing.  And this is why Team Up workshops are so effective – Team Up encourages school nutrition professionals to continue to network with their peers and problem-solve school nutrition program barriers long after the workshop is completed. No one is an island, and we must team up to make school meals accessible, nutritious and delicious!  For more information about the Team Up for School Nutrition Success initiative, check out the Team Up Web site and these guest blogs authored by former participants in the Team Up workshops.  For more information on other training and resources available to school nutrition professionals, visit our Healthier School Day web site.

"Amy Mazerall and Mydina Thabet, Child Nutrition Programs, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 14,  Food service staff serves barbeque chicken to students. (Photo courtesy of Right Light Photography, LLC) The school nutrition community is celebrating National School Lunch Week from October 10-14. This year’s theme “Show Your Spirit” is all about encouraging parents, students and school officials to show their spirit for school lunch. Through the Team Up for School Nutrition Success (Team Up) initiative, school nutrition professionals have teamed up to provide nutritious and appealing meals to students, offering plenty of reasons for all of us to show spirit for awesome school meals! The Team Up initiative, created through a partnership between the United States Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and the Institute of Child Nutrition (ICN), provides school nutrition professionals a unique learning experience.  The initiative is designed to enhance schools’ food service operations by providing training and peer-to-peer mentorship to school nutrition professionals who want to maintain a healthy environment and strong student meal program participation. The goal of this training is to help schools find simple ways to meet the updated USDA nutrition standards from the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act (HHFKA), while increasing the number of students enjoying healthy and flavorful school meals. Donna Harris, the former Child Nutrition Director for Perquimans County Schools in North Carolina, attended the first Team Up pilot training in in the Southeast Region. Harris was seeking better way to engage students in school meals. During this Team Up training, she learned best practices, tips and tricks for increasing participation in school meals through panel presentations by school nutrition peer mentors. After the presentations, Harris joined other school nutrition directors to network and brainstorm on creative solutions for common topics such as menu planning and financial management.  Directors turned their ideas into achievable goals as they created action plans using SMART goals with the help of their peer mentors. SMART goals are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely. In her action plan, Harris wanted to tackle increasing school meal program participation in the district’s middle and high schools, so she set SMART goals to obtain student feedback and create student-approved menus. Back at her district, she conducted two student surveys and group discussions to gauge student preference.  As a result, several new student-approved recipes were added to the menu: barbeque chicken, buffalo chicken wraps, chicken salad wraps and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Although students had not responded well to meals that align with these updated nutrition standards in the past, Harris received positive feedback on the additions once she engaged students in nutrition education, explaining the USDA nutrition standards that schools must follow. In fact, the school’s student government association assisted in explaining the nutrition standards to students.  Harris demonstrated that when students have a voice in school menus and understand the USDA nutrition standards, they are more satisfied and more likely to purchase school meals.  This was evidenced by a notable increase in student meal counts on the days that new menu items were offered. Even school staff provided positive feedback: “the lunches taste good!” and “it was delicious!” Harris has since retired from Perquimans County Schools, but before her departure, she shared her action plan and best practices learned from the Team Up training with the new director. Harris wanted to see the Team Up spirit live on and encouraged the child nutrition department to utilize the Team Up peer mentorship model to train school nutrition staff. FNS also wanted to see the Team Up initiative live on after the Team Up training pilot received rave reviews from attendees. In , FNS hosted an additional six regional trainings to school nutrition professionals nationwide. The regional trainings were equally successful, and now the Team Up initiative has been expanding to state agencies in . So far, 26 trainings have been completed in 25 states, with 11 more scheduled for the remainder of this year. To read about the success of completed State Team Up trainings, visit ICN’s website. Harris is one of many school nutrition professionals who inspire us to show spirit for school meals. FNS thanks all school nutrition staff who work tirelessly to provide our students a nutritious start to a bright future! During National School Lunch Week, we continue to celebrate the progress that has been made in school meals, child nutrition and the overall school environment over the last seven and a half years. USDA is committed to providing school nutrition professionals with the resources they need to help today’s children grow into tomorrow’s healthy leaders. FNS’ Team Nutrition is also celebrating National School Lunch Week by announcing the availability of a number of newly modernized and standardized recipes on the What’s Cooking? USDA Mixing Bowl website for use in schools and childcare centers. These recipes are developed to assist child nutrition professionals in meeting the meal pattern requirements by providing appealing, kid-approved meals that incorporate whole grains and a wide variety of vegetables and legumes.

(Click to enlarge) What’s shaking in USDA’s school meals programs?  Delicious and nutritious food, that’s what!  Healthy food does not have to be bland or boring.  There’s more to creating a tasty meal than just dousing food in dressing or layering on salty sauces.  It’s easy to make your dish pop without adding excess sodium.  Many schools around the country have figured out creative ways to serve low-sodium meals that maximize taste.  So what can you do this school year to “spice” things up and take school meals to the next level? Add flavor, not salt – Condiments like soy sauce, ketchup, barbecue sauce, and hot sauce may contain high amounts of sodium.  Fresh or dried herbs, spices, lemon or orange zest, or 100 percent fruit juices can enhance flavors in foods naturally. Cook with fresh food – When possible, cook with fresh produce or minimally processed foods like no-salt-added frozen or canned vegetables. Setting up farm to school arrangements help make this a cinch!  USDA Foods also offers a variety of options. Set up “Flavor Stations” – Create “flavor stations” in the cafeteria where students can add sodium-free herbs and spices such as basil, curry, black and red pepper, garlic, ginger, or rosemary to customize meals to their taste buds.  Flavor stations give students a chance to be the chef and create one-of-a-kind dishes! Check out “What’s Cooking?” – This USDA site features hundreds of low sodium, large quantity recipes for inspiration.  How about some “Rainbow Rice” or “Honey-Lemon Chicken”?  Yes, please!   Shop around – Pay attention to sodium levels when you’re purchasing food.  The amount can vary widely from brand to brand.  Be sure to write bids that specifically request lower sodium options. Does your school have any other creative ways to boost flavor while still promoting healthy, low-sodium diets?  Share them with us in the comments section below!  To find more USDA resources for schools to maximize taste without maximizing sodium, check out our What’s Shaking? site.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Agricultural Research Service, Information Staff in  Research and Science  Oct 26,  Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) employees at the unveiling of the sign for the BARC Student Discovery Garden. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research portfolio.  When George Washington Carver laid out key elements of his blueprint for education, he could never have guessed that the cutting-edge work of 21st century agricultural science would find a 7,000-acre rural home—right in the middle of the maze of highways and high-rises, homes and businesses that make up the Washington metropolitan region. One hundred years after the federal government first began buying huge tracts of farmland, meadows and woods outside the District of Columbia, a group of scientists, researchers, students and other volunteers who work at the sprawling Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) are taking a page out of the renowned scientist’s book—literally, a textbook. The whole idea, as laid out in Carver’s “Nature Study and Gardening For Rural Schools,” is making sure school kids get their hands dirty. In that spirit, volunteers from the Beltsville Area Diversity Task Force and its technology, education and outreach group started planning about a year ago for an unassuming project for students that would echo Carver’s “learning by doing” educational philosophy. The idea of establishing an old-fashioned victory garden that would continue outreach efforts to students in local schools seemed to be a perfect match. The Student Discovery Garden, as it has come to be known, has been up and growing since last spring, fueled by the energy of volunteers and students. The garden, all organic with raised beds, includes seven sections, each focusing on one of the research programs at BARC, including breeding native crops to keeping non-native species from pushing their way in.  Another learning experience for an all-organic garden was an infestation of Colorado potato bugs that were laboriously smashed one at a time.  Another addition to the urban students’ knowledge base: They found out that stink bugs really live up to their name!

"Field Ecologist in  Forestry  Research and Science  Aug 30,  Forest Service field ecologist Jimmy Grogan at the Marajoara field site in southeast Pará, Brazil. The ‘sororoca’ plant with the wide leaves is a relative of the banana. Although the photo was taken in the daytime, the light is low because the researchers are in the forest understory. Photo by M. Loveless I have lived and worked abroad for most of my adult life, including many years in Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, so it was not too difficult adjusting to life in the Brazilian Amazon. I learned to speak Portuguese in the field; my tutors were the field assistants that I hired locally. The politics of doing research on this species are challenging and complicated. That side of my research has been almost as educational and fascinating as the actual fieldwork.  I’ve been fortunate to live and work in remote forests where there are no villages or towns nearby, no noise or light pollution, no electricity, and no running water when the streams dry up during the dry season. Under those conditions, it’s possible to experience forest life on a very satisfying level. As a plant ecologist, I can observe the daily and seasonal rhythms of growth and dormancy at the level of the forest community — by that I mean the growth and flowering and fruiting schedules that trees and other plants keep through the year and from year to year. When you are there every day in the middle of it, these rhythms gradually come into focus, and the forest comes alive in a way that feels completely integrated. Many people find it surprising to learn that the Brazilian rain forest and the other tropical forests I’ve worked in are not perpetually wet and steaming. Mahogany only grows naturally in tropical forests that have a pronounced dry season for one-third to one-half of the year. When that happens, the streams dry up, the trees drop their leaves, the understory goes brown, the ticks and deerflies come out, and everything gets wilted in the heat until the rains come back. The most important thing people should know about mahogany is the same thing they should know about other living species that we humans consume – if consumption exceeds supply indefinitely, supply will vanish.

"Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 01,  The adult periodical cicada emerges from its 17-year nymph stage, molts and arises as a winged adult. This spring will see the return of the large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. (U.S. Forest Service photo/ Bob Rabaglia) The buzz this spring has started, and some people may think it’s fodder for a new sci-fi movie. But this year’s spring brings a drama closer to home than you think - the pending emergence of brood II of the periodical cicada. Cicadas are large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. As the male cicadas sing their intense mating songs, some brand it as the sound of summer. “Annual cicadas, known as dog-day cicadas in the U.S., are found throughout the world,” said Sandy Liebhold, a research entomologist with the U.S Forest Service’s Northern Research Station. “But the periodical cicadas emerge in massive groups known as “broods” once every 13 or 17 years and are completely unique to North America.” There are 15 brood cycles, each designated by roman numerals. In the U.S., brood II is on track to crawl out of the ground very soon after a 17-year hiatus. They’ll emerge into one of the most densely populated urban/suburban forests in the world. The mass emergence of brood II into the state and private forests of the tri-state area of eastern Connecticut, upstate New York, and northern New Jersey will sound a bit different than the familiar dog-day cicadas. Male cicadas use a special membrane to echo a series of clicks through its abdomen to attract females for reproduction. In chorus, the brood may sound like an insect-sized fleet of jets preparing for lift off, but the sound should be enjoyed as a wonderful spectacle of the mating ritual in the animal world. Once mated, females will lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind, known in the scientific world as oviposition injury, can be quite striking and lead to “flagging” -- the dieback of small limbs. Forest health aerial surveys conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation reported more than 8,700 acres with flagging left behind from the brood XIV emergence on Cape Cod in . The scarring is mostly superficial but can have a mild impact on the growth of individual host trees. However, the mass emergence can benefit the longer, overall health of eastern forests. After mating and laying eggs, adult cicadas die and fall to the forest floor. The nutrients released from the mass decay of the brood create a jolt of healthy nutrients available to forest organisms. Researchers have shown that this pulse of nutrition leads to an increase of beneficial microbes and nitrogen in soil, increased tree growth and more robust wildflowers. Finally, after three to four weeks, the eggs hatch, the larvae wander under the forest floor where they feed on roots and start the process over again. So, why every 13 to 17 years? Scientists have been pondering this ecological phenomenon for centuries. “There is no doubt that by simultaneously emerging at those long intervals, periodical cicadas are able to saturate predators thereby maintaining high population levels,” said Liebhold. Recent research also hypothesizes that periodical cicadas emerge when predator birds are at a lower density, suggesting that these amazing insects have queued into a larger ecological cycle – wow! This is what we know but there is still a lot of mystery surrounding these time-travelling bugs. So if you find yourself one of the lucky ones to experience their visit, just sit back and enjoy this remarkable wonder of eastern forests. Michael Bohne is an entomologist and forest health group leader with the U.S. Forest Service in Durham, N.H. After mating, female cicadas lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind can lead to the dieback of small limbs called flagging. Such was the case for these bur oak trees in central Iowa in after a brood emergence of the 17-year cicada.

"and Lindsay K. Campbell, Northern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Sep 11,  G.R.A.C.E Memorial in Glen Rock, New Jersey, is in Veterans Park directly across from the town's commuter train station. The site was chosen by the Glen Rock Assistance Council and Endowment after input of family members in the community directly affected by 9/11. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry) Living memorials serve as a reminder of fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, neighbors and friends—but also of the power of community to reflect, rebuild and renew. Our research suggests that living memorials demonstrate the role of nature in contemporary times not only as a symbol, but as an innate and purposeful response to loss that calls forth a common humanity and compassion for others. In other words, they demonstrate how people use nature to be resilient to loss. For 13 years, the U.S. Forest Service has built upon a unique partnership called the Living Memorials Project centered on one of the most significant events in recent history: Sept. 11, , also referred to as 9/11, the day four carefully coordinated terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. That day, two passenger planes hit the World Trade Center’s twin towers in New York City, another flew into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and a fourth originally targeting Washington crashed in a Shanksville, Pennsylvania, field after passengers tried to stop the hijackers. Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, New York, created a memorial grove on the hospital campus. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry) The living memorials project began in when Congress asked the Forest Service to create a program that draws upon the resonating power of trees to bring people together and help foster healing in communities across the nation in response to 9/11. The project includes a grant program to support community-based greening efforts and a research component that developed a National Registry of living memorials across the country. This year, as communities gather to mark the 14th anniversary of 9/11, some will do so at local town memorial parks and gardens – living memorials that pay respect to those who lost their lives and thank thousands more who ran toward the chaos to help. This summer, a team from the agency’s Northern Research Station set out to revisit some of the sites listed on the Living Memorials Registry. Joined by Heather McMillen, an anthropologist and postdoctoral social scientist with the research station, the teams were curious to learn if the sites were maintained. If so, who takes care of them? Did circumstances and other events change the nature of the memorials or had they, over time, stood still? What story could the trees and the landscape itself tell us? From Connecticut's state memorial in Sherwood Island State Park on the Long Island Sound visitors have a panoramic view of lower Manhattan where the World Trade Center once stood. Victims’ families requested a memorial where they could experience the healing effects of water. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry) The sites range from forests such as Sterling Forest State Park in Tuxedo, New York. To beaches, like the Hometown Memorial in the Town of Babylon, New York, as well as city parks, community gardens, traffic islands, waterfront piers, street trees and arboretums. Many of the living memorial sites we visited 14 years ago still remain and continue to serve an important role for their local constituents. When asked, ‘What are you most proud of here?” nearly all of the site stewards responded, “That we did it.  And it’s still here.”  Many of the living memorials along the New York/New Jersey/Connecticut coast sustained heavy damage during Hurricane Sandy and were rebuilt and replanted. Some signs at the sites not only recognize a diverse list of supporters but also tell the story of that day from the perspective of local towns and communities, including personal sentiments regarding loved ones lost and for those who survived. In each case, local residents draw upon the landscape to create a place of comfort, reflection and a sense of beauty. As these places age, some areas do struggle with care and maintenance but are not giving up. Many families have planted survivor trees on sites and are eager to find ways to protect them as long as possible.      Updates from the field will be available on the Living Memorials Project website. Memorials created from - are displayed on a National Map that formed the basis of the public multi-media exhibition Land-Markings: 12 Journeys through 9/11 Living Memorials, created in collaboration with Parsons The New School for Design. The exhibit was on display in at the National Park Service’s Federal Hall National Memorial on Wall Street. The exhibit catalog and DVD are available free for public use. Videos can be viewed online. The Hometown Memorial in the Town of Babylon, New York, is situated on the coastal dunes of Long Island. The barrier beaches are considered the town’s greatest natural assets. “It was felt that this area possessed scenic beauty and views yet has sufficient open space to provide a quiet environment for remembrance and reflection.” (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry)  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Tags:  Connecticut  Forestry  FS  Hurricane Sandy  Long Island  memorial  mourning  New Jersey  New York  New York City  Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry  Northern Research Station  Pennsylvania  remembrances  Research  September 11  trees  veterans  Washington DC","What role do living memorials, which utilize nature as an innate response to loss, play in fostering community resilience and reflecting collective humanity after significant events such as 9/11?","Living memorials serve as a reminder of the power of community to reflect, rebuild, and renew, demonstrating how people use nature to be resilient to loss and call forth common humanity and compassion for others."

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA's rich science and research portfolio. The world is not merely facing a challenge of sustainably producing enough food to feed a world whose population will exceed 9 billion by , but also confronting the continuous challenge of ensuring that nutritious and safe food reaches needy families, so that every child can have a safe and healthy childhood.  Combating this urgent crisis requires a global collaborative effort.  According to experts, by agricultural production will need to increase by 70% to meet increased demand for food, diet changes and additional demand for industrial uses for plants.  To help meet this goal, USDA has developed a Global Food Security strategy, focused on research, development, education and extension.  As part of USDA’s Office of the Chief Scientist series of white papers on USDA’s research portfolio, this plan aligns USDA’s food security research with the goals of President Obama’s Global Food Security Initiative, Feed the Future. In implementing the strategy, USDA will seek and build upon existing partnerships with research institutions at home and abroad, as well as in the private sector.  We are very heartened that our colleagues in other countries and donor organizations share our interest.  This May, the G8 Leaders announced the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition to improve food security in Africa.  The G8 Leaders also endorsed the establishment of global platforms to facilitate sharing of reliable agricultural and information, which is crucial for research, for decision making by farmers and to help connect them to the marketplace.   Similarly, the June Rio+20 Summit resolved to enhance agricultural science and improve productivity and sustainability through voluntary sharing of knowledge and good practices and by strengthening international cooperation on agricultural research.  These commitments made by USDA, the G8 and Rio+20 have been taken to the next level by the G20 whose leaders recently announced their support for a series of recommendations to sustainably increase agricultural productivity.  These steps include strengthening global collaboration and cooperation on agricultural science through a regular meeting of agricultural Chief Scientists (MACS) with the goal of identifying global research priorities and targets and facilitating collaboration between public and private sector organizations in the key areas most likely to drive sustainable agricultural productivity gains. These developments have a lot of promise for helping coordinate the fight against global hunger.  I encourage you to read more about USDA’s food security research and find out about the important role science plays in improving lives around the world.

"Moving Back to Rural America: Why Some Return Home and What Difference It Makes  Population loss persists in rural America, especially in more remote areas with limited scenic amenities. Communities in these areas are attuned to the annual out-migration of their “best and brightest” high school graduates, typically a third or more of each class. But stemming rural population loss--and spurring economic development--may depend less on retaining young adults after high school and more on attracting former residents some years later. Researchers at the University of Montana and USDA’s Economic Research Service visited 21 rural communities during and and conducted 300 interviews at high school reunions.

USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the premier food research agency in the world, and it wouldn’t be nearly as successful or impactful if not for its rich, diverse history of scientists.

"Chief, National Agricultural Statistics Service, Survey Administration Branch in  Equity  Research and Science  Jun 23,  Last month, I had the honor to serve as keynote speaker for The Mule Train’s 54th anniversary. The Mule Train left Marks, Mississippi and traveled to Washington, D.C., on May 13, , as part of Dr. Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.’s Poor People’s Campaign to demand economic justice since Marks resided in the poorest U.S. county at the time. However, Dr. King did not witness the Mule Train because he was assassinated the month before the demonstration. I learned the Mule Train created a legacy of community organizing, while meeting with the Quitman county’s mayors, farmers, farmworker organizations, high school scholars and others. For example, even though Marks is an agriculture community, the town did not have a grocery store for a few years. The community mobilized and they now have two grocery stores in Marks. I spoke to the community about information as power and subsequently shared USDA’s definition of a farm, which is any place from which $1,000 of more of agricultural products were produced and sold, or normally would have been sold, during the year. Many in the community found the definition helpful and significant. This information is critical for those in attendance (and for readers of this blog) who are small farmers and think they’re too small to share their voices in USDA’s NASS surveys and censuses. Every voice matters as these are used by decision makers from federal to local levels. These directly impact producers, their operations, families, communities, and industries. That’s why it’s so important for farms of all sizes, in all states and counties, urban or rural, to respond to NASS’s Census of Agriculture. June 30 is the last day to sign up to be counted in this year’s Census of Agriculture.

They shared their insights on the event, their studies, and their future careers. Trey Blackhawk majors in Indigenous Science at Little Priest Tribal College in Winnebago, Nebraska. “A lot of rural communities are already in food deserts with limited access to fresh and nutritious foods,” Blackhawk said. “I believe as I get further into my studies, I can be that person that makes a change in rural communities, helping them establish sustainable food systems. Ines Frazier is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture at Prairie View A&M University in Prairie View, Texas. “I grew up in food insecure area, had watched people close to me die of chronic illness, and researched how the food system was exploitative in certain areas, thus my life’s mission was to help build up Black and Indigenous communities through their agriculture and food systems.” Ernest J. Dixon III is a junior studying Agribusiness at Alcorn State University in Lorman, Mississippi. “ I did not know about the different agencies in USDA; there are so many different opportunities out there for everyone to find their niche within agriculture.” “USDA Agricultural Liaisons (, 465 ) help students like myself find careers in agriculture,” Dixon remarked.

"Mountain Plains Regional Administrator, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Nutrition Security  Nov 08,  It was a sunny fall day in mid-October when I had the honor of visiting the Omaha Nation WIC program. Upon meeting WIC Director Jessika Free-Bass, I visited the Tribe's WIC garden, which they use to grow produce for client nutrition education. For the Omaha Tribe, nutrition education is a community effort. Free-Bass says that the Omaha Nation WIC program recognizes the importance of incorporating Indigenous foods and traditional cooking practices into the WIC experience to form a holistic approach to nutrition education. Recently, they have taken extra steps to spotlight foods indigenous to their community, as well as dishes and cooking methods traditionally used by the Umóⁿhoⁿ people. This year, the WIC garden grew tomatoes and WIC clients prepared tomato sauce. The garden also produced carrots, which the program used to teach ways to prepare baby food. The WIC garden is small, so the program partners closely with several community organizations to further its nutrition education efforts. For example, the nearby Umóⁿhoⁿ school garden donates squash and indigenous corn to the program for lessons. Omaha WIC also partners with the Nebraska Indian Community College, using their kitchen facilities to provide nutrition education sessions and cooking demonstrations. The WIC program aims to safeguard the health of income eligible women, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutrition risk by providing nutritious foods and information on healthy eating. As we celebrate Native American Heritage Month, I applaud the Omaha Nation for connecting mothers, young children, and the community in celebrating healthy, traditional food. It was a pleasure to see their efforts, and I take great pride in the role the WIC program plays in bringing greater health equity to people in our country.

"Legislative and Public Affairs, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in  Animals  Jun 01,  If you are moving this year from a location within the gypsy moth quarantine area to a location outside the quarantine area, please inspect outdoor household items for pests. This is a federal requirement for homeowners moving from gypsy moth quarantine areas. By complying with the law, you may also save a forest. Gypsy moths are destructive, invasive pests! European gypsy moth larvae feed on over 300 plant species including oak, aspen and elm. Gypsy moths have defoliated more than ates since . About 70% of susceptible forests have never been infested and are at risk. Male gypsy moths are brown and smaller than female gypsy moths, which are primarily white. Females lay fuzzy yellowish-brown egg masses from which caterpillars emerge bearing distinctive red and blue dots. Like many invasive insects, gypsy moths can spread long distances with human assistance. They are notorious hitchhikers and lay their eggs on patio furniture, grills, lawn mowers, children’s toys, and other outdoor items. Larvae can hide on untreated firewood or other wooden items such as pallets and crates. The good news is you can help stop them. If you are moving, use the self-inspection checklist (, 3.6 ) and remove any insects or egg masses you find. To learn more about protecting your neighborhood and how you can help, visit USDA’s Your Move Gypsy Moth Free website.

"Director of the Office of Civil Rights, USDA Forest Service in  Equity  Initiatives  Feb 12,  Vice President Kamala D. Harris and First Gentleman Doug Emhoff. ""We are undaunted in our belief that we shall overcome—that we will rise up. This is American aspiration."" -Kamala D. Harris On the cold January night following her swearing in earlier in the day as the first woman vice president of the United States, Kamala D. Harris and First Gentleman Doug Emhoff stood before the Lincoln Memorial. The stoic face of Lincoln looked eastward, past some of the signposts of our history in the form of war memorials and monuments, all the way to the U.S. Capitol. The monuments before both Lincoln and Harris are symbols of American history; but this January, history was unfolding at Lincoln’s feet. In one day, Vice President Harris broke barriers for Black and South Asian people, for women and for the children of immigrants. As a Black woman, Harris would not have been able to hold office while Lincoln was living. Not until President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act would she have even been able to vote in many parts of our country. In the words of Sam Cooke’s hit song, “It’s been a long time coming, but I know a change gonna come.” Our agency is changing too. We embody our code and commitments (, 4 ) by doing the right things while building trust with each other and the people and communities we serve. When we live by our values, we show each other and the world that we mean it when we say that diversity and interdependence are at the core of who we are. And when others see the diversity of people who wear the same Forest Service uniform, they see a reflection of our respect for diversity in all things. On Jan. 20th, our country witnessed the glass ceiling break. Pioneers such as Shirley Chisholm and Barbara Jordan realized that this day would come. The significance of Vice President Harris assuming the second highest office in the federal government reminds us that progress is happening all around us. If we focus on our values, purpose and relationships, our agency can become a model for others. Historically, February is set aside to celebrate and focus on Black history, starting with slavery. Beyond the Capitol building and across the Atlantic sits West Africa, and prior to colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade, various scholars have noted how the ancestors of many Black Americans were African royalty and nobility from West and Central Africa. Both the African continent and the diaspora have been producing inventors, innovators and world changers throughout history and continue to do so today. This year, history has played out in real time. There is a renewed focus on civil and voting rights at all levels of society, including government. Overcoming systemic injustice is at the forefront of the American conversation, spurred on by Black leaders and allies. While there is still much work to do, Jan. 20th marked a major checkpoint in the belief that “we shall overcome.” We have momentum. Racial equality is one of the top four immediate priorities of the Biden-Harris Administration. As President Biden said in his Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, “Equal opportunity is the bedrock of American democracy, and our diversity is one of our country’s greatest strengths.” This Black History Month, where will we as an organization focus? My aim is that Black history is not only something we recognize and celebrate each February, but also presents a living history that informs our work every day.

"USDA Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Mar 24,   Our commitment to American Indian and Alaska Native leaders, members, and communities is one of great importance to the Obama administration and to me as USDA Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services. This past fall, the White House concluded its second Tribal Nations Conference which provided a venue for tribal leaders to engage in dialogue with high-ranking officials on a wide range of social, economic and political challenges facing Indian country. I would like to continue the dialogue and invite tribal leaders or their delegated representatives to formally consult on how we can improve the health and nutrition of our children in Indian Country. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) recently sent an invitation letter and informational packet to tribal leaders describing major provisions of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of —a key piece of legislation signed by President Obama on December 13, .  The legislation authorizes funding and sets critical policy for USDA’s child nutrition programs, including the National School Lunch, School Breakfast, Summer Food Service Program, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. The act allows USDA, for the first time in over 30 years, the chance to make real reforms to the school lunch and breakfast programs by improving the critical nutrition and hunger safety net for millions of children, and help a new generation win the future by having healthier lives. To help prepare for consultation on this important act, we are providing an informational webinar for tribal leaders and members to attend and learn more about the provisions.  This information session will be held March 30, , 2pm – 4pm eastern time. Please visit our website to register. In addition, you will also find our consultation schedule for the spring and summer.  We encourage tribal leaders and members to visit our website and register today.  Together, we can and will improve healthy eating and access to nutritious foods in Native communities.

"Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Nov 17,   Did you know that Canada is the United States’ largest agricultural trading partner, accounting for 16 percent of all U.S. agricultural trade? In , U.S. agricultural exports to Canada were valued at $15.7 billion. Geographical proximity, similar business practices and eating habits make Canada an attractive export market for new-to-export and new-to-market U.S. companies. Some of Canada’s major agricultural imports from the United States include: fresh vegetables, snack foods, fresh fruits, processed fruits and vegetables, fruit juices, red meats, forest products and fish and seafood. Secretary Vilsack traveled to Canada in August to meet with Canadian trade group leaders as well as Gerry Ritz, the minister of agriculture in Canada. As part of these meetings, he discussed agricultural trade issues that both of our countries face and opportunities for collaboration. The Secretary was honored to serve as the primary spokesperson for U.S. agricultural products during this visit and to highlight their benefits and uses to compliment Canadian cuisine. Canada is the world’s fourth largest agricultural exporter, and Canada and the United States are each other’s largest export market for agricultural products.  Food production in Canada is highly integrated with the United States across a wide array of products that include livestock, fresh produce, and processed products. Free trade agreements, structural changes in U.S. and Canadian food industries, changes in consumer demand, and advances in technology have facilitated this integration over the past few decades. Canadians travel to the United States more than their foreign counterparts providing them with many opportunities to have a taste of the states. On these travels, it’s no surprise that our neighbors to the north find a variety of U.S. food products and regional flavors to whet their appetite. Many U.S. companies could use these opportunities to expand their customer base and may want to consider exporting to Canada. To assist U.S. companies in preparing their products and sales force to enter the market, FAS is offering a complimentary Webinar on Tuesday, November 23rd at 1 p.m.-2:00 p.m.(EST) titled The Basics of Exporting to Canada. This forum will provide U.S. companies with a basic overview of the Canadian food sector industry and initial information to make food products compliant to Canadian government standards.  If you are unavailable for the live session on November 23rd, the webinar will be archived and accessible until November .

"Canoemobile inspires future conservation leaders!   A young girl looks fearfully at the large wooden canoe bobbing on the water. She steps into the canoe and it moves. She yelps, and is given a reassuring smile by her boat captain. She gets settled holding her paddle tightly, convinced with every movement that the canoe will capsize. The canoe takes off as everyone starts to paddle in sync in order to glide across the water. She begins to relax and enjoy herself, soaking up the sun, blue sky and fresh air.

"The Real Story Behind Bats  As Halloween approaches, it is easy to get caught up in the mystery and fear that surround bats, but the truth about bats is that they are fascinating animals vital for a healthy environment and economy. As we celebrate National Bat Week, set your concerns aside. We need bats, and bats need us – now more than ever. Bats occupy almost every habitat in the world. They devour tons of insects nightly, pollinate flowers, and spread seeds that grow new plants and trees. They are our most important natural predators of night-flying insects, consuming mosquitoes, moths, beetles, crickets, leafhoppers and chinch bugs, among others. Many of these insects are serious crop or forests pests, while others spread disease to humans or livestock. Every year, bats save us billions of dollars in pest control by simply eating insects.

Adam found out about Rural Development’s home loan program from his mother, Mary Kay, who works as a realtor in Pine City, Minnesota. Adam works at a local retail store, and his wages restricted the amount of money available to put toward a house payment. “USDA Rural Development serves a clientele that can really use the assistance,” Mary Kay said.  “Because of Adam’s life challenges and restricted income, he was unsure of whether he would qualify a loan that would fit his budget, but Rural Development has a comprehensive application process and programs suited for people with his income.” After discussing his desire for homeownership with his parents, Adam’s mom and dad purchased an older home that, with some major updates, would be a great match for Adam. They hired some contractors to install new windows, paint the walls, replace sheetrock, and re-wire. Once completed, they came to an agreement with Adam on a purchase price, which is when he applied for a loan through Rural Development. “It’s nice to have something to call my own,” Adam said. “The privacy that goes along with it is also a major benefit. I enjoy having friends over without worrying about bothering the neighbors.” Upon the completion of more upgrades, and an appraisal, Adam was able to purchase his home at a reasonable price, and has a monthly payment he can afford thanks to Rural Development.  Complete with a music room, walls painted in to his liking, and furniture and decorations he picked out, Adam is happy and comfortable knowing he’s investing his money in the equity of his own home.

USDA Rural Development worked with Donald Parkos, the potential homebuyer, throughout the application process.  USDA Rural Development provided the first mortgage for him to purchase the home.  In addition to this, Parkos received down payment assistance.  Through the hard work of a number of partners, Donald was able to afford a newly built home for less than $100,000.  Today he resides in his 1,100 square foot, two bedroom, one bath home. The partnership had an impact far beyond that of just homeownership. The process helped revitalize a neighborhood by placing a nice, newly built home where a dilapidated structure once stood. It also helped create a sense of community and ownership in the neighborhood by all involved.

"Oregon USDA Public Information Officer in  Rural  Nov 06,  For Martin Paredes and his family (pictured here), Castle Rock Apartments provide good quality rental housing for working families, while serving as a stepping stone to home ownership. Boardman, Oregon, is a port town of just over 3,000 on the banks of the Columbia River surrounded by productive farm lands. These resources have helped the community generate above-average economic growth through its agricultural, food processing, manufacturing, and shipping sectors. As these industries have grown, however, a significant shortage of affordable workforce housing has made finding and keeping skilled employees difficult and hinders further economic development in this promising community. In order to secure affordable housing, many who work in Boardman have had to endure long commutes from outlying towns or settle for homes that simply did not meet their families’ needs. Martin Paredes, Olgalibia Rosales Rivera, and their four children are one such family. Due to a lack of rental options in the community, the family was living in a two-bedroom apartment in a part of town that offered few family-friendly amenities and services. Last month, the Umatilla County Housing Authority and CASA of Oregon opened the doors to Castle Rock Apartments, with 40 brand-new rental units located adjacent to schools, a grocery store, health care, churches, transportation, a safe playground, and more. To develop a quality housing facility with “built to last” standards, a number of federal, state, local and nonprofit partners worked together to identify financing options that included funding and tax credits provided by the State of Oregon and the federal government. USDA Rural Development provided a $2.4 million low-interest loan through the Farm Labor Housing Program, which offers low-interest financing to develop housing for those working in agriculture and food processing. The program also offers a rental subsidy to ensure housing and utility costs do not exceed 30 percent of a household’s income. Today, Martin Paredes and his family live in a new, four-bedroom apartment with plenty of room for the children. In addition, the rent is lower, allowing the family to start saving for the future. “We hope to buy our own home someday,” Paredes said. Another resident, Lisa Garcia Mendez, explains that before the new complex was built, apartments in Boardman were too expensive for farm worker families and, even then, the options were just not good. Moving to Castle Rock has changed things for her family of six. “I just feel safer here with my kids,” Mendez said. To find out more about USDA Rural Development Housing programs click here. Dancers wearing indigenous Mexican regalia perform a traditional blessing at the grand opening of the Castle Rock Apartments in Boardman, Oregon, where 62 percent of the population is of Hispanic descent. The ceremony offered thanks to farm workers and likened the new apartment complex to a seed sprouting from the ground to bear fruit for the community.

"Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Aug 14,  The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) annual report on the Expenditures on Children by Families has found that a middle-income family with a child born in can expect to spend about $241,080 for food, shelter, and other necessities associated with child rearing expenses over the next 17 years. How much will that little bundle of joy cost? According to USDA’s Cost of Raising a Child report, the answer for a child born in is $241,080 for food, shelter and other necessities over the next 17 years, which translates to about $301,970 when adjusted for inflation! Speaking as a father and a grandfather, I know how much we as parents want to give our children the tools they need to excel at anything they set their minds to—from the essentials, like a roof over their heads and a quality education, to the fun stuff, like a brand new soccer ball, piano lessons or a trip to summer camp. We work hard to ensure our children’s future happiness and success each and every day. But this next generation faces a unique challenge that threatens their future health and well being: a growing health crisis, in the form of diet- and obesity-related diseases. And despite encouraging recent on declining rates of early childhood obesity, nearly a third of our nation's young people are at risk for preventable diseases like type-2 diabetes and heart disease. Preventable diseases have serious consequences – which is why health experts tell us that our current generation of children may well have a shorter lifespan than their parents. In light of this, perhaps the most important leg up we can give to our children is a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, whole grains and other nutrients they need to grow up healthy and strong. We at USDA have been doing our part by making it a top priority to improve child nutrition and provide science-based nutrition information and advice so that the healthy choice is the easy choice for American parents and children. Thirty two million American students now have healthier and more nutritious school breakfasts, lunches and snacks due to improved nutrition standards implemented as a result of the historic Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of . And parents and teachers can use the resources at ChooseMyPlate.gov to access quick, easy reference tools to facilitate healthy eating on a budget for parents, teachers, healthcare professionals and communities.

"Plant Health Safeguarding Specialist in Port of Honolulu, HI, USDA APHIS PPQ in  Animals  Apr 30,  We inspect all contraband from mail and passenger baggage. Any live insects in the contraband go to the local USDA Plant Inspection Station for identification. Aloha! I am a Plant Health Safeguarding Specialist based in Hawaii, where my colleagues and I help protect agricultural crops and natural resources on the U.S. mainland from plant pests like exotic fruit flies, Asian citrus psyllid and the coconut rhinoceros beetle. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s multi-faceted predeparture inspection program supports the movement of travelers, baggage, cargo and mail leaving the Hawaiian Islands, while working to stop the movement of invasive pests. Many do not realize that the mail is an important way invasive pests can move. To find items prohibited from reaching the mainland by this pathway, trained detector dogs spend nights targeting parcels in search of plant material in transit at Honolulu’s main post office. With their keen sense of smell the detector dogs are over 90% accurate at identifying mailed packages containing prohibited items like fruits, flowers and vegetables. In the morning, the packages that the canines identified are processed for a swift, legal inspection on the basis of the dogs’ expertise. One of the items dogs continually alert on are boxes containing prohibited flower leis. Everyone knows the lovely tradition expressing friendship, greetings and love with lei. They are regularly seen at weddings and graduations. To help facilitate the safe movement of the flower lei that nurseries and growers ship daily to the mainland, APHIS has a compliance program specifically for lei made of low risk flowers like orchids and ti leaf. Excluded from this program are lei made from prohibited plant material like berries (a host for invasive fruit flies). Plant Health Safeguarding Specialists don’t just work with detector dogs at the post office. We inspect commodities leaving Hawaii in shipments and we conduct hand inspections of passenger baggage. When inspecting baggage at the airport, any live insects found are turned over to the local USDA Plant Inspection Station for official identification. We rotate into different roles every three months so we’re well-rounded and fully engaged in supporting the APHIS mission. Most of us enter our roles with a background in plant science, entomology or biology. Then we receive intensive, specialized training to prepare us to work with farmers, shippers, travelers and our state and Federal partners. And, because we want to spread the beauty and goodwill of the Hawaiian Islands, I will provide guidance for families mailing lei as mementos to remind distant relatives and friends of home. The proper way to mail an allowable lei is to take it to an APHIS Plant Inspection Station to have the item inspected and sealed in your shipping box at no cost. A USDA label will be affixed to the box and you can take it to a post office to mail knowing it will not be delayed by one of our keen-scented canines. As the Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month draws to a close, one thing we can recognize is that we are all connected through agriculture. We all have a role to play in protecting American agriculture from invasive pests – whether you are a farmer, a shipper, a traveler or you purchase agriculture items over the internet. Every day is a day to be aware of how easy it is to move invasive pests. Please visit this APHIS predeparture page for more information useful to travelers.

"Preclearance Area Director for Europe, Africa and the Middle East in  Animals  Apr 20,  Inspection of Ornithogalum dubium (Star of Bethlehem) in Israel – From left to right, Israeli grower/exporter, Heather Coady, Israeli grower/exporter and Dr. Vedpal Malik, APHIS Senior Treatment and Mitigation Specialist The United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue has proclaimed April as Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month. The goal of IPPDAM is to: increase public awareness of invasive species; provide tips to prevent their spread; and, encourage residents to report signs of them. Today we highlight USDA’s Heather Coady. Ms. Coady, and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) employees like her, assist other countries in their pest control efforts by working to stop pests at the source. I’m lucky that my career allows me to mix two of my passions – the travel bug and protecting our country against invasive pests. My passion for travel started 20 years ago when I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Honduras. A few years later, I began learning about invasive pests when I worked on the Asian Longhorned Beetle program. I directly saw the effects that an invasive species has in the environment. As I moved through my career at APHIS, I worked at a Plant Inspection Station, intercepting pests before they entered the U.S. I am currently stationed in the Netherlands as part of our preclearance program. I work to keep pests from being imported, working directly with our National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO) counterparts, growers and exporters. Preclearance is the first line of defense for the U.S. -- addressing pest risks offshore. I manage eight different preclearance programs: in Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, the UK (England and Scotland), Israel, Turkey, Belgium and France. I love that I get to see the plants growing in the field before harvest. I talk with the growers and the NPPO inspectors in person and find out how the season has been, the weather, their challenges – all in real time. If we see a problem, we can help them figure out what to do right now to ensure that their plants will meet APHIS’ standards and can enter the U.S. pest and disease free. Last December, the Royal Dutch Wholesalers Association for Flower Bulbs and Nursery Stock honored APHIS’ contributions to the Dutch flower bulb and plant trade at its annual conference. We created the Dutch flower bulb and perennial preclearance program 66 years ago to help post-World War II recovery efforts. It was the first program of its kind, and it serves as a model for dozens of other agriculture preclearance programs around the world. With this program, Dutch exporters avoid costly delays or rejections at U.S. ports and both countries benefit because plant health issues are dealt with promptly and transparently. Today, the United States is one of the top markets for Dutch flower bulbs and perennials with sales reaching approximately $120 million last year. Trade and travel are making the world smaller, but also increasing the chance of damaging insects and pathogens entering the U.S. April is Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month so this is the perfect time to share the many ways Americans can protect their gardens and landscapes against invasive Hungry Pests. I want to highlight a few simple things everyone can do to keep invasive pests from spreading to new locations. When you travel internationally, declare all agriculture products to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. If you purchase plants online for your garden or home, buy from reputable sources. Avoid using invasive plant species at all costs! Remove them from your garden and don’t share them with other gardeners. Talk to other gardeners about invasives and how you plan to help in the fight against them. If you are worried that your garden will lose its luster after removing invasive plants, talk to your local native plant society or exotic pest plant council. These organizations will be able to suggest suitable replacements. Report any suspected invasive species to your county extension agent or local USDA office. And be sure to check with USDA before mailing or shipping produce, plants, or plant products into the U.S. from another country to find out what’s allowed. Find more about Hungry Pests and How They Spread – and thank you for protecting the things we love.

"Smuggling, Interdiction and Trade Compliance Officer, Internet Team in  Animals  Technology  Apr 24,  A U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agriculture specialist, with assistance from SITC, inspects a parcel arriving in the United States at an international mail processing facility. (USDA, Erich Glasgow) While we are raising awareness about invasive pests during Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month, I wanted to share a bit about what I do every day to protect agriculture. When you picture someone on the front lines of stopping invasive pests, you probably picture someone outside – in a field or a tree. But I fight invasive pests from a completely different location – my computer. A big way invasive pests can move from one location to another is through unregulated internet sales. We are seeing more and more of these sales, and it’s a real concern. Why? With normal commercial or retail sales, we can use techniques like quarantines and fumigation to make sure that purchased items are pest-free or don’t enter pest-free areas. But many times, sales on the internet do not follow these techniques, opening up the chance for invasive pests to move freely to new areas. My job is to look for these types of sale offers online and stop them. It may not seem exciting, but I enjoy the challenge. Looking for person-to-person sales of prohibited agricultural items on the internet involves a lot of research and investigative work. I use many tools to help me do my job, including open source, government and subscription databases and software that lets me form a “map” of connections to provide a visual of how prohibited items are moving into the country. When I identify a sale of regulated items, I work with the internet company to identify the buyers and sellers, and work to close the pathway by stopping the sale. This can be by removing or amending the listing to include restrictions on where the product may be sent. In many cases, I coordinate with other SITC employees, who physically visit the locations to perform inspections and search for the prohibited item(s). One area where we see growing promotion and sales of agricultural products is on social media. I am spending more time reviewing social media posts to look for previously unidentified pathways for items to enter the U.S. I enjoy my work and I’m proud of the role I play in helping stop illegal internet sales. I never know what my day will look like. Many days, I never leave my computer. Other days, I may give presentations to help others understand the work we do. I’m even the lead author on a white paper on preventing illegal sales through e-commerce. I worked with officials from the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand on that project. In , I received the Employee of the Year award from the Plant Protection and Quarantine leadership for my efforts to protect American agriculture. We are increasing our outreach and education activities to help make sure people understand why buying agricultural items on the internet – especially from foreign countries or individuals instead of companies – can be dangerous. I find many people just aren’t aware that certain products are restricted or banned completely. They just want to purchase something and look for the best deal. Help me raise awareness and protect our agriculture from invasive pests. Be careful when buying agricultural products on the Internet. When in doubt, you can always contact us to find out if an item is allowed, restricted or banned. Together, we can keep harmful invasive species from entering the country through illegal internet sales. United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue has proclaimed April as Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month (, 518).

"Director, USDA Caribbean Climate Hub, US Forest Service International Institute of Tropical Forestry in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico in  Climate  Nov 27,  Cars navigate down a recently cleared road in Puerto Rico where hurricane Maria has downed trees and powerlines. Last September when hurricanes Irma and Maria passed through the Caribbean they caused catastrophic damage to communities and infrastructure affecting homes, businesses, farms and forests across Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In the aftermath of this devastation the two great challenges facing the relief effort are to help bring back basic services and to learn from our experiences so that we are more resilient to future extreme climatic events. Nearly 600 USDA employees live and work in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, representing several USDA agencies. Like most residents, we prepared our homes and workplaces for Hurricane Irma, which hit the Virgin Islands and northeastern Puerto Rico September 8th. Many of us lost power for several days but we were soon back at work assessing damages and gearing up for recovery. However, less than two weeks later, the winds from Hurricane Maria arrived and by the early morning of September 20th the full force of the storm hit St. Croix and Puerto Rico. As the storm passed it left in its path near total defoliation of trees and downed power lines. Coupled with flooding, the loss of communication and electricity has had the most apparent effects. It’s difficult to predict when an extreme event will occur but we can predict and prepare for the consequences. Now, two months after the storms, trees have begun to leaf out, many roads are clear and disaster assessments are underway, but conditions are still difficult. Power, water, communications and other infrastructure have yet to be fully restored, adding to challenges at work and home. The full extent of the storm’s effects on farms, forests and communities are yet to be determined. Local USDA employees, agencies and leadership have been playing an important role in the recovery, by clearing roads and waterways, assisting with needs for power, assessing and assisting with livestock related health issues in the hard hit poultry and dairy sectors, implementing disaster relief programs, and helping communities that surround our facilities. The complexity of the response within and among islands has highlighted the need to work across USDA’s agencies boundaries to deliver services to hard hit communities. The USDA Climate Hubs are designed to share climate related knowledge among USDA agencies and help each agency expand their capacity. As the recovery continues the challenge is to learn about the effects of extreme events on our farms and forests, transportation, communications and energy systems, and on the supporting industries and markets to ensure the delivery of agricultural goods and ecological services. USDA has a great deal of capacity to learn by monitoring incentive and relief programs and through research programs. We can expect more extremes in heat, drought, fire, flooding, and storms. By investing in learning and working across agencies to apply what we know, we can reduce the risks and costs of extreme climatic events, increase our resistance and resilience, and keep important services flowing from our land and water.

"USDA's Commitment to Quality Foods  Across the country, schools are back in session. Here at the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), our inspectors and procurement specialists work hard to make sure that quality, domestically-produced foods are delivered to students and other recipients for our federal food purchasing programs. As students are getting used to their new schedules, we would like to highlight how our own little field trip shed some light on a typical day for some of our employees. A team of AMS employees recently traveled to Knouse Foods, a grower-owned cooperative that supplies apple and cranberry products for federal food purchasing programs. The employees saw first-hand how USDA inspectors help Knouse and other companies verify the quality of their products. As the apple sauce traveled through the facility, USDA inspectors pulled random samples to make sure that they met product quality and condition requirements. All USDA Foods are to be inspected, and in this case, inspectors pulled samples of apple sauce to evaluate traits like its color, flavor, and consistency. As an independent third-party, the inspections help suppliers meet USDA Foods requirements but they also can help them meet requirements from other buyers.

"Economist, Economic Research Service in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Aug 31,   This week my kids headed back to school, and I’ll be busier than last year, having been drafted to be PTA president.  While  getting to know the new parents at our school, I learned that several are interested in improving school meals and exploring the possibility of purchasing locally and starting a school vegetable garden.  Our new principal is interested too.  I myself have something of a brown thumb, but everyone was excited to hear that I work at the Department of Agriculture and had have been studying Farm to School initiatives throughout the country. I have been in close touch with USDA’s Farm to School team that will visit 15 school districts across the country to learn about their Farm to School activities. When our agency, the Economic Research Service (ERS), put together the Food Environment Atlas earlier this year, we included information on which counties had at least one Farm to School program, using from the National Farm to School Network.  The Network maintains the only national base of Farm to School programs.  After the Atlas was released on our website, we received phone calls from programs that hadn’t been included, and this underscored the need to build a complete base of these programs. This month, ERS developed a cooperative agreement with Occidental College, a partner in the National Farm to School Network, to address the lack of on Farm to School efforts.  Anupama Joshi, who co-chairs the Network, will be leading a census survey in every state, contacting school food authorities with Farm to School initiatives.  Our goal is to identify every school district with Farm to School activities, including school gardens, and ask them about what type of activities they conduct, how many farmers they work with, and how many schools in the district participate. Many of our colleagues are eager to gather even more detailed .  How much are the schools purchasing locally?  What prices are they paying?  How much do school gardens contribute to the meals?  Many community groups would like to have objective research on the benefits of such activities to persuade local governments to support their efforts.  Once we have a comprehensive base, our agency and other researchers will be able to use the list to draw representative samples of participating districts to examine a range of more detailed characteristics and results of the programs. As the new school year approaches, I’m looking forward to a good year at our school, and to learning more about Farm to School programs across the country.

"Sociologist, Economic Research Service in  Research and Science  Feb 17,  The Midland County Courthouse in Midland, MI was built in . USDA/ERS photo by Calvin L. Beale. As the Economic Research Service celebrates its 50th Anniversary this year and looks back over the decades, the legacy of Senior Demographer Calvin Beale stands out due to the 55-plus-year length of his service at USDA and the impact of his work. One landmark contribution was Mr. Beale’s discovery of the U.S. nonmetro population turnaround in the early s. His study was first to report that the decades-long stream of rural-to-urban migration had reversed. In Mr. Beale’s obituary in September , The Washington Post extolled his encyclopedic knowledge: “Two or three times a year, Calvin L. Beale would leave his desk in Washington and travel to the University of Wisconsin to speak to graduate students. A professor of rural sociology at the university, Glenn Fuguitt, knew that Mr. Beale had spent decades studying the population trends of rural regions for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and that no one alive had a deeper understanding of his subject. “After his lecture, Mr. Beale would join Fuguitt and the grad students for dinner. In his characteristically reserved but attentive way, he asked the students where they were from. He would then recite the name of each student's county, no matter how remote, and detail its primary businesses and cultural history. As a final flourish, he would describe the local courthouse.” Having once said, “You can’t know what’s going on in the country from behind a desk in Washington,” Calvin visited most U.S. counties. Along the way, he photographed over 2,000 county courthouses. Eighteen of his favorite photos can be viewed in a USDA Flickr gallery.

Participating in programs like USDA’s Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), is one way that farmers and producers of all sizes can demonstrate to buyers that they are adhering to industry food safety standards.  By making this program more accessible to businesses of all sizes, USDA is creating opportunities for our nation’s small and mid-sized farmers.  Last week I traveled to Atlanta, Ga., for the Produce Marketing Association (PMA) Fresh Summit to discuss the expansion of our GroupGAP Program this coming spring. The program is an expansion of our Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) Audit Program, which provides third-party certification services to verify that operations are following industry-recognized food safety practices as well as recommendations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The pilot was supported by funding and technical expertise from the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and the Wallace Center at Winrock International.

"Economic Research Service in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 19,   About this time last year, the city of Washington, DC was digging out from a record amount of snow.  My colleagues at USDA’s Economic Research Service were communicating electronically to get a new web-based mapping tool – the Food Environment Atlas – up and running. This online tool, which measures a community’s food-choice landscape, was to play a key role in the launch of First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let's Move! campaign against childhood obesity. The Food Environment Atlas dovetailed neatly with the obesity initiative: the Atlas allows users to compare the food environment among U.S. counties—the mix of factors that together influence food choices, diet quality, and general fitness among residents. The media took notice, and in that first year the Atlas website received over 100,000 visits – becoming one of the most popular of USDA’s products. Today we’re unveiling an update of the Atlas. It now pulls together 168 indicators of the food environment (up from the original 90), measuring factors like availability and type of restaurants and food stores, food prices, socioeconomic characteristics, and health outcomes. We’ve added items that measure change over time, and several indicators that will make the Atlas more useful in gauging residents’ food accessibility in rural communities. The updated Atlas provides on the number and percentage of a county’s households that are low income or that do not own a car, and that also live more than 10 miles from a grocery store. For rural areas, this a more realistic measure of food access than the one-mile measure in the original Atlas. The snowstorm that coincided with last year’s debut of the Food Atlas, with power outages, impassable streets, and the consequent interruption of easy access to food stores and establishment, underscored the importance of the food environment to the options that can make the difference between healthy and unhealthy diets. For some households, limited options are a daily reality, not just a weather-related inconvenience. With the Atlas, researchers, policymakers, media, and other users can create maps and visualize how counties are faring in providing healthful food environments. For any one county, they can obtain on any or all of the 168 indicators. We hope that the Atlas will continue to stimulate research and provide a resource for policymakers as they address the connection between the food environment and the health of communities.

"Trade Agreements Key to Oregon Winemaker's Success  Exports are vital to the growth of U.S. agriculture. Since , around ates has been exported. Still, it’s difficult to conceptualize the real impact of free trade agreements until you talk to the people who have directly benefitted from them. In April, I had the pleasure of meeting with a group of winegrowers from Oregon – among them Tom Gerrie, president of Cristom Vineyards in Salem, who was kind enough to share with me his personal experience in exporting. Cristom Vineyards is a family-run craft winery producing around 15,000 cases of wine per year. Founded in by Gerrie’s father, Paul, the company decided that in order to build global brand recognition of Oregon’s fine wines, it would need to target high-end restaurants both in the United States and abroad. In , it shipped its first cases to New York, Chicago, London and Tokyo. Since then, Cristom Vineyards has expanded its exports to 48 states and 18 countries, including South Korea.

"USDA Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 04,   The White House on June 2 convened a national forum to seek action on the problem of anti-microbial resistance. The development of antibiotics was one of the most significant medical achievements of the last century, and has helped to save millions of lives. But their overuse or misuse has resulted in the rise of bacteria strains that are resistant to antibiotics. The White House has unveiled a National Action Plan designed to advance the appropriate use of antibiotics in food animals as well as promote collaborations among partners in medicine, veterinary medicine, and public health. This is consistent with a “One Health” approach that embraces the idea that a disease problem impacting the health of humans, animals, and the environment can only be solved through improved communication, cooperation, and collaboration across disciplines and institutions. USDA, which helped develop the National Action Plan, was pleased to join our many Federal partners and continue our work with the agriculture industry at the forum. USDA continues to research alternatives to antibiotics, including vaccines, to reduce the use of medically important antibiotics and develop new tools to prevent and treat diseases that impact the health, welfare, and production of livestock, poultry and fish. For example, recent findings by USDA Agricultural Research Service scientists suggest that lysozyme, an enzyme used in many foods and beverages can serve as a natural alternative to antibiotics used to improve feed efficiency and growth in pigs. And through our shared goal, USDA will continue working with the agriculture industry to optimize stewardship of antibiotics in food animals.   In addition, collaborations among partners in medicine, veterinary medicine, and public health are being promoted to support a one health approach to the issue of antimicrobial resistance.   There are a number of entities in the agriculture sector that are trying to address antibiotic stewardship. Specifically, Food producers and retailers are taking actions such as voluntarily phasing out the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion, providing responsible use to suppliers from whom they purchase meat, and funding research for alternative management practices that reduce the need for antibiotics.  Some store owners are committing to purchase from suppliers who already have or are phasing out the use of medically important antibiotics or that can provide them with antibiotic-free meat and poultry.  Animal pharmaceutical companies are committed to align their medically important antibiotic products with FDA’s guidance, including removing growth promotion uses and changing marketing status to require veterinary oversight of product use.  Further, the companies investing in vaccines, best management practices, on-farm hygiene, and proper nutritional innovations that will benefit animal health while lessening the reliance on traditional antibiotics. Animal feed industry organizations and livestock and poultry farmers are educating producers and ranchers about the FDA labeling changes that will bring all feed uses of medically important antibiotics under the oversight of licensed veterinarians.  These educational campaigns are helping to make farmers aware of antimicrobial stewardship programs and keeping them updated on best practices for antimicrobial use and policy. Livestock and poultry farmers are conducting education and outreach campaigns to make farmers aware of antibiotic stewardship programs and keeping them updated on best practices for antibiotic use and policy. Veterinary, animal agriculture, and meat associations are developing and updating species-specific judicious use , conducting education campaigns on judicious use, and encouraging collection efforts. The organizations are committed to magnifying education outreach efforts through their vast networks by distributing educational material, holding symposiums to bring those in public health and agriculture together, and conducting regional workshops on new antibiotic use and veterinary oversight policies. And, general agriculture, food system non-government organizations are conducting education and outreach and developing standards with an accompanying verification program for the judicious use of medically important antibiotics in food producing animals.  Through this multidisciplinary approach, USDA’s objective remains to preserve, maintain or reduce health risks to animals, humans, the environment and society.

"USDA Office of Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  Nov 20,  General Motors Global Public Policy Executive Director Greg Martin speaks at a press conference announcing the completion of the first-of-its kind purchase of verified carbon credits generated on working ranch lands by Chevrolet, at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), in Washington, D.C. on Monday, Nov. 17, . (L to R Senator Debbie Stabenow (MI), General Motors Global Public Policy Executive Director Greg Martin, Ducks Unlimited Paul Schmidt, The Climate Trust Executive Director Sean Penrith, and USDA Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) Under Secretary Robert Bonnie). USDA photo by Tom Witham. Earlier this week, USDA highlighted the creation of a market for carbon credits generated on working grasslands. Landowners benefit because they receive compensation for the carbon credits generated on their lands. They get a new source of revenue, while thriving grasslands provide nesting habitat for wildlife, are more resilient to extreme weather, and help mitigate the impact of climate change. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, recently purchased almost 40,000 carbon dioxide reduction tons generated on working ranch grasslands in the Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. It was the first purchase of its type.  Robert Bonnie, USDA's under secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the purchase and USDA's involvement in the project at an event at USDA headquarters. He was joined by Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Greg Martin, executive director for global public policy, General Motors; Sean Penrith, executive director of The Climate Trust and Paul Schmidt, chief conservation officer of Ducks Unlimited. The under secretary thanked Senator Stabenow, Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, for her staunch support for the program, which she said is delivering “real world measurable results.” Bonnie said he hopes this purchase will set a pattern for future carbon credit sales. This is how the credit system works: Landowners voluntarily place lands under a perpetual easement but retain rights to work the land, such as raising livestock and growing hay. The carbon storage benefits of this avoided conversion of grasslands are quantified, verified, and formally registered resulting in carbon credits. The carbon credits are made available to entities interested in purchasing carbon offsets. Chevrolet's purchase was undertaken voluntarily as part of its commitment to reduce eight million tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted. This is comparable to the annual carbon reduction benefit of a mature forest the size of Yellowstone National Park. USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded $161,000 through a Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) to Ducks Unlimited in to develop the necessary methodology to quantify the carbon stored in the soil by avoiding grassland conversions, resulting in the generation of carbon credits. Besides the landowners, USDA, and Ducks Unlimited, other key partners that helped make this project a success include The Climate Trust, American Carbon Registry, The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund and Terra Global Capital. Public-private partnerships to enhance U.S. carbon sinks such as forests, grasslands, wetlands and coastal areas, are a key part of the Obama Administration’s recently released Climate and Natural Resources Priority Agenda.

"VegU Coordinator, USDA Farmers Market Season in  Farming  Mar 06,  The VegU featured item is always the key ingredient in the ""VegU-cation"" lesson. This special event creates opportunities for customers to ask questions. With more knowledge, customers are willing to purchase the new fruit or vegetable; ultimately resulting in more sales for market vendors. USDA Photo by Preston Keres. Everyday USDA works to develop tools for farmers and ranchers that support their financial success. The USDA Farmers Market on the National Mall is a “living laboratory” for farmers market operations across the country. During our market season, we tested “VegU-cation” and found that this fruit and vegetable education program was popular with our visitors and increased sales for our farmers. Visitors to our market attended a 10-minute demonstration class in the VegU tent, on how to grow, pick, and prepare that week’s featured fruit or vegetable. Here are five tips to help you bring “VegU-cation” to your market: 1. Use Simple and Creative Recipes – Customers are more likely to consider making a recipe, using the featured item, if it has just a few ingredients that are easy to assemble. Keep the preparation demo to five minutes or less. Highlighting new ways to prepare an item that shoppers may have never considered, like roasted avocado instead of guacamole, works great. Add a toppings bar to a simple recipe to make it more interactive. During a demo last year, VegU featured mangos, with a toppings bar of lime hot sauce, salt and pepper, cumin, and cayenne pepper. This extra feature gave participants a chance to try some of the many ways a mango can be enjoyed. 2. Showcase Variety to Create Interest - Offering variety increases customers’ willingness to try new foods and can make a farmers booth vibrant and inviting. We spotlighted lesser-known varieties of apples and pears, grown by our farmers, during a VegU session. The presentation included “fun facts” along with the variety names, distinguishing characteristics and suggestions on the best varieties for snacking, baking and salads. A similar display for mushrooms listing names, flavor and texture profiles, as well as preparation suggestions, worked really well. 3. Provide Free Samples - Free food gets attention! We have found that serving samples halfway through the demo keeps folks interested. Once they taste it, they often want to buy the featured item and try the recipe. Talking about nutritional value and asking participants to share their favorite recipes also helps to engage your audience. 4. Share How Things Grow - We found that displaying and talking about live plants, grown in the USDA greenhouse or brought in from nearby nurseries and farms, encourages customers to taste and purchase unfamiliar vegetables, like okra. VegU helps shoppers improve their knowledge about seasonal availability of fruits and vegetables and learn more how the foods they love are grown. 5. Don’t Be Afraid of Challenges – For farmers, growing an unfamiliar product can be challenging in an unknown market. However, VegU presentations on new or unusual items can create a great deal of interest amongst shoppers. We have found that shoppers are interested in learning about these out-of-the-ordinary items like how to prepare kohlrabi or fennel. VegU often resulted in vendors selling more of the featured vegetable or fruit – sometimes selling out! Activities like our ""Guess the Mystery Vegetable"" game engage audiences and encourages them to try new things. VegU is just one example of a special event to build market support for farmers. We also asked farmers market managers across the country to share what helped make their markets better. Many told us that hosting special events, offering community programs, and other activities added to their success. Checkout our Farmers Market Improvement Toolkit for more ideas. If you are in our Nation’s capital, please join us at the USDA Farmers Market and stop by the VegU tent.

"USDA Agricultural Marketing Service, Deanna Gierszewski, North Dakota Department of Agriculture and Josh Johnson, Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services in  Research and Science  Aug 14,   Advances in technology, automation, and remote sensing is a cross-cutting, macro movement in science impacting agriculture outlined in the USDA Science Blueprint (, 2.6 ). The Science Blueprint guides USDA’s science priorities for the next 5 years, building from past success. Relative to other crops, many specialty crops are more dependent on agricultural labor for production, harvesting, and processing. This is part of a blog series that highlights research investments to advance automation and mechanization for specialty crops. U.S. specialty crop producers face a variety of challenges that require a diverse set of solutions. From labor shortages and rising production costs that threatened the health of Florida’s strawberry industry to water supply challenges that stymied North Dakota’s vegetable yields, the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program (SCBGP) has helped producers bring to life innovative ideas in automation. USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service provides annual SCBGP funding to State Departments of Agriculture for projects that support specialty crop growers, producers and consumers. The projects can range from outreach and education, training, marketing or research to enhance the specialty crop industry. Each State determines priorities that will be most impactful to the issues they are facing. The tool is designed to mimic human hands and fingers as it picks strawberries. Photo Credit: Shinsuke Agehara In the case of addressing labor shortfalls in strawberry harvesting, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services awarded funding to the University of Central Florida to develop a project that is currently engineering a mechanical arm. This gripper will mimic human hands and fingers as it picks strawberries—without damaging the fruit. The technology aims to be universal for different strawberry varieties. The project will also evaluate the economic impact of the gripper creation. To date, the project team finalized their design and manufactured two prototypes. Both prototypes have gone through laboratory and field tests, and one has been integrated with a robotic arm-like platform for harvesting. The team will measure project success by the number of strawberry varieties to which the picking mechanism can be applied and the number of harvesting platforms that decide to adopt the technology. In North Dakota, the State Department of Agriculture distributed SCBGP funds to North Dakota State University to tackle water management issues. The project’s goal is to improve fruit and vegetable yields by creating a drip irrigation system that can be automatically controlled by soil moisture sensors. The project involves conducting experiments to see how different mulch types and amounts impact weed control with the system. They will then educate local growers on the new drip irrigation technology. Drip irrigation system projected to conserve water, improve soil temperature, and extend growing seasons for North Dakota fruit and vegetable production. Photo Credit: Xinhua Jia To date, the team has designed, built and implemented the drip irrigation system and conducted comparisons on tomato and watermelon yield and quality. With its projected ability to conserve water, improve soil temperature and extend growing seasons, the team sees this system as the future of North Dakota specialty crops. Automated production methods have been a common thread in multiple SCBGP projects. According to the recent ERS Report, Developing Automation and Mechanization for Specialty Crops: A Review of U.S. Department of Agriculture Programs, $12.5 million in funding on automation and mechanization projects has been distributed in the SCBGP between -. As states and growers identify specific needs in the specialty crop industry, SCBGP welcomes innovative ideas to help the industries evolve and adapt.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Mar 15,  42% of districts surveyed by USDA say they participate in farm to school activities. March is National Nutrition Month. Throughout the month, USDA will be highlighting results of our efforts to improve access to safe, healthy food for all Americans and supporting the health of our next generation.  We’ve talked quite a bit in the past about the major benefits we’re seeing in schools and districts that have established a farm to school program.  Their efforts are giving students a deep understanding and appreciation for where their food comes from and drastically shifting kids’ opinions of fruits and veggies. The final results of the USDA Farm to School Census shed light on another huge benefit of farm to school – we’re talking $789 million huge.  That’s the total amount schools report investing in their communities in school year – by purchasing local food from farmers, ranchers, fisherman, food processors, and manufacturers.  This represents a 105 percent increase over school year – , when the first USDA Farm to School Census was conducted.  In addition, nearly half of districts engaged in farm to school report that they plan to purchase more local foods in the coming years. These funds are a major boost to local communities, helping sustain local food systems by providing a consistent, reliable customer base.  With farm to school, “you have a customer, an able buyer willing to pay fair market price and buy in bulk,” explained Chuck McCool of McCool Farms in Arkansas.  As Chuck puts it, “Farm to school is the greatest thing that’s happened to vegetable farmers since… well since I can’t remember when!  I can’t remember what would have been better than farm to school… It’s a win-win for everybody.” But the benefits aren’t just limited to vegetable farmers; farm to school programs present economic opportunities for the whole agricultural industry. Fruits, vegetables and milk top the list of foods schools are most likely to buy locally, but schools indicate that they’d like to also buy more plant-based proteins, grains, meats, poultry and eggs from local suppliers in the future.  And these types of programs aren’t only seen in states known for their agriculture like Iowa or Nebraska.  The Census results show that farm to school programs are present in every state across the country, in schools large and small, rural and urban. We’ve recognized a few of these programs on our Farm to School Census page, highlighting three programs per state that are beating their state’s average spending on local foods.  But we know there are many more schools out there that are doing innovative work through their farm to school programs.  That’s why we’re inviting you to vote for the farm to school program that you think is ‘One in a Melon!’  Now through April 15 you can nominate a school that you believe has an exemplary farm to school program.  So check out the extended results of the Farm to School Census and cast your vote today!  Winners will be announced this May.

"Change Beyond the Plate  The following guest blog from a school and community nutrition services director in Louisville, Kentucky highlights how non-profit School Food FOCUS relies on USDA’s Process Verified Program (PVP) to help increase transparency and choice for school food purchases.  USDA’s objective, third-party auditing services focus on increasing transparency from farm to market by offering verification based on clearly defined, implemented, and transparent process points. Director of School and Community Nutrition Services, Jefferson County Public Schools, Louisville, Kentucky The first time School Food FOCUS brought together a group of school food directors like myself to talk about how we could improve the quality of chicken—the number one protein we serve to students—I was thrilled and a little daunted. Schools across the country spend nearly $1 billion on chicken every year. That’s a lot of buying power. School Food FOCUS challenged us to think about the changes we can make to our food system if districts leveraged this buying power to create a demand for chicken that is better on the plate and for the environment.  Shayla Bailey, AMS Public Affairs  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 05,   Respond to this story",How can school districts leverage their collective buying power to create demand for more sustainable and nutritious chicken options?,"School districts can leverage their collective buying power by working with organizations like School Food FOCUS to negotiate with suppliers, promote transparent and verified processes (such as USDA's Process Verified Program), and collectively demanding higher standards for sustainability and nutrition in the chicken they purchase."
"Acting Deputy Administrator, AMS Fruit and Vegetable Program in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 03,  The Quality Monitoring Program will verify the quality and purity of extra virgin and organic extra virgin olive oil. The program will help consumers know that the products they are buying will meet their expectations. Photo courtesy of Pompeian, Inc.  There have been a lot of questions over the last few years about the quality and purity of olive oil.  USDA has expanded our Quality Monitoring Program to include extra virgin and organic extra virgin olive oil.  This program already evaluates a variety of commodities including canned, frozen and certain fresh fruits and vegetables. With many Americans looking for alternatives and additions at meal time, the popularity of olive oil has been on the rise.  Consumers looking for the qualities and signature flavor of olive oil want to know that the products they buy will meet their expectations. As part of the Quality Monitoring Program for olive oil, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) lab verifies olive oil quality and purity using criteria based on the U.S. grade standards for olive oil and international criteria.  Our assessment also includes unannounced plant visits to review production processes, quality assurance measures, and recordkeeping systems. Pompeian, Inc.—headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland—is the first manufacturer to participate in USDA’s Quality Monitoring Program for olive oil.  Their operation qualified by meeting our rigorous review and evaluation process and their product met chemical testing and flavor analysis requirements.  AMS will conduct ongoing, unannounced plant visits to verify that Pompeian continues to meet the Quality Monitoring Program for olive oil requirements. AMS will apply these same measures for all firms who wish to participate in Quality Monitoring Program for olive oil.  Visit our website to learn more about the Quality Monitoring Program.

"Celebrating the New Face of Agriculture  At the Agricultural Marketing Service and across USDA, we often talk about the fact that the face of American agriculture is changing. The ranks of our farmers, especially young and beginning farmers, include a growing number of women, people of color, veterans or folks in their second careers. So-called “traditional” agriculture defies the term as it pursues new strategies, new products, and new markets. Across the country, agriculture is diversifying and evolving to meet changing consumer demands. I saw the new face of agriculture last week during travels to Illinois and Indiana. My first stop was a roundtable on Women in Agriculture held at FarmedHere in Bedford Park, Illinois, about 15 miles from Chicago. Twenty or so women gathered to talk about their farming goals and to hear about how USDA could support them. This topic is close to my heart – I’m a New Hampshire native, a state with the second highest percentage of women farmers in the country. The women around the table with me represented the new face of ag, but so too did the setting – an indoor, vertical farm that produces basil and microgreens in a facility designed to reduce energy costs and shrink the carbon footprint of growing food.  FarmedHere is managed by Megan Klein, an attorney by training who found her calling in urban agriculture and became part of this “new face.”  Elanor Starmer, AMS Administrator  Posted in  Conservation  Initiatives  Apr 13,   4 Responses","What innovative farming practices are being employed by FarmedHere, an indoor microgreens facility, to reduce energy costs and shrink its carbon footprint?","FarmedHere uses a facility designed to reduce energy costs and shrink the carbon footprint of growing food through its indoor, vertical farm setup."

"Public Affairs Specialist and Maribel Alonso, Technical Information Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA in  Health and Safety  Aug 18,  Always follow food safety steps when preparing lunches at home. Photo courtesy of FSIS With the - school year approaching, many parents are preparing for changes to their routine. Many students may be returning to school for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began and others may be distance learning. Don’t let foodborne illness – commonly called food poisoning – keep your child from learning. Take the time to plan and prepare your children’s lunch meals safely. While children rely on teachers for daily lessons, the task of making safe lunches falls squarely on caregivers. Unlike cafeteria workers who take food safety trainings on a regular basis, most parents preparing lunch for their kids at home, or to take to school, haven’t received any formal food safety instruction. Nutrition counts, too. The lunch you’re making not only satisfies hunger pangs of busy kids, it fuels their cognitive abilities. Studies have shown that proper nutrition improves students’ scores, memory capacities, motor skills, social skills, and language skills. Keep them well fed and safe with the four steps to steps to food safety – Clean, Separate, Cook and Chill. Clean: The best way to prevent many forms of illness, including foodborne illness, is with proper hand washing. Children should always clean their hands before eating, and parents should do so before and during lunch preparation. It’s easy to get preoccupied by busy schedules and rush through the five steps of washing hands; however, handwashing is vital to remove any germs that may be present. Hand washing should always include the following:  Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap and apply soap.  Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Be sure to lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.  Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice.  Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.  Dry your hands using a clean towel. Separate: Prevent cross-contamination by keeping raw meat and poultry away from ready-to-eat foods. When preparing perishable foods that require cutting (for example, raw bacon and raw chicken you plan to cook for salad), make sure you separate these items from fruits, vegetables, cheeses and other foods to avoid cross-contamination.  Cut up and prepare your raw ingredients ahead of time to avoid cross-contamination as you handle your ready-to-eat items for salads or other sides.  Different colored cutting boards are a great reminder to prevent cross-contamination (you can use a green cutting board for fresh produce and another color for meat and poultry). Cook: Have a food thermometer easily accessible to ensure you’re cooking to recommended safe internal temperatures:  Cook whole cuts of meat, including beef and pork to 145 degrees Fahrenheit and allow them to rest for at least 3 minutes before carving.  Cook ground meats, like burgers and sausages, to 160 degrees Fahrenheit.  Cook all chicken and turkey to 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Chill: When preparing lunch ahead of time, remember perishable foods should not enter the Danger Zone – temperatures between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit – where bacteria multiply quickly and can make food unsafe.  Make sure all perishable items are refrigerated within two hours of coming out of the oven or refrigerator.  Discard food that has been left out for more than two hours to prevent foodborne illness.  If your child needs to carry their lunch themselves, never pack perishable foods in a brown paper bag because they will be unsafe by lunchtime. Use an insulated, soft-sided lunch bag and add a frozen gel pack and a frozen juice box or bottle of water with the lunch. These four steps – Clean, Separate, Cook and Chill – give parents and caregivers steps they can use to protect their children from food poisoning. Now that we’ve covered all the basics, you’re ready for the big test – hungry students! Consumers can learn more about key food safety practices at Foodsafety.gov, by following @USDAFoodSafety on Twitter and by liking Facebook.com/FoodSafety.gov. Consumers with questions about food safety can call the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, in English or Spanish, or email to mphotline@usda.gov.

"Celebrate the Chinese New Year While Being Citrus Smart  Out with the snake, in with horse! January 31 marks the start of the Chinese New Year. Many people will be enjoying the rich cultural traditions of this holiday such as food, parades and exchanging gifts. One traditional Chinese New Year gift is citrus fruit, such as mandarin oranges and tangerines. This fruit is said to bring luck, wealth and prosperity. However, without proper precautions citrus can also bring something else that may not be so favorable—the Asian citrus psyllid. This pest carries citrus greening disease, also known as Huanglongbing (HLB), a disease threatening the commercial citrus industry and homegrown citrus trees alike. Although it is not harmful to humans or animals, the disease is fatal for citrus trees and has no known cure.

"Foreign Service Trainee & Andre Bradley, International Climate Hub Coordinator, USDA Foreign Agricultural Service in  Climate  Conservation  Forestry  Research and Science  Technology  Apr 22,  As the U.S. Department of Agriculture celebrates Earth Day with communities across the nation and around the globe, we have an exciting opportunity to highlight the activities, tools and resources of the USDA International Climate Hub. Secretary Vilsack announced the creation of the International Climate Hub in at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Egypt, demonstrating the Administration’s commitment to helping farmers, foresters and other land managers worldwide to mitigate the causes of climate change, adapt to the changing climate and ensure global food security. The International Climate Hub provides a platform that enables agricultural communities worldwide to share research, tools, collaborative efforts and best practices. It builds on the success of USDA’s domestic climate hubs, which serve as the premier model for developing and delivering science-based, region-specific information and technologies to help land managers reduce risk, build resilience and enable climate-informed decision making. Today, under the banner of Sustainably Cultivating the Future, the International Climate Hub will join various USDA agencies, the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation and other partners for an Earth Day celebration on the National Mall from 11 a.m.- 3 p.m. Visitors will have the opportunity to view informational exhibits, attend discussions and participate in hands-on workshops and teaching moments in the USDA People’s Garden. At the event, the International Climate Hub will shine a spotlight on the cross-border benefits of applied agroforestry best practices. Globally, agroforestry best practices integrate the cultivation and conservation of trees and shrubs into cropping or livestock systems, helping sequester carbon, combat soil erosion, provide habitat for wildlife and pollinators, improve water quality, and diversify farms and ranches. ""Trees have often been taken for granted in the Northeast, but now they stand out as one of the best ways to both adapt to climate impacts and mitigate greenhouse gases,"" says Suzy Hodgson, Sustainable Agriculture Outreach Specialist with the University of Vermont Extension, and the USDA Northeast Climate Hub. ""Trees offer relief from the impacts of climate change we're experiencing in the Northeast while also sequestering and storing carbon above and below ground. Agroforestry practices yield multiple benefits to farmers. We are looking at trees in a new light and intentionally blurring the boundaries between forestry and agriculture for mutual benefit."" Through a partnership with Colorado State University, the International Climate Hub is helping global farmers visualize the impact of agroforestry on carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions through the COMET Planner Global Tool. A recent update of the tool allows agricultural producers to better explore the potential benefits of agroforestry. If you’re in Washington, D.C., today, pop on over to the National Mall and help us celebrate Earth Day and climate-smart agroforestry!

"Under Secretary, Marketing & Regulatory Programs, USDA in  Farming  Organic  May 21,  Organic is a growing sector, with domestic sales of organic products topping $69.7 billion in . However, consumer research shows that consumers do not always understand what “organic” means and how USDA protects the organic label. Now retailers and brands can download a toolkit of signs and messages about the requirements for different types of organic products that can be used in stores or online to help consumers learn more about the USDA Organic seal. The National Organic Program (NOP) created the resource to highlight the four pillars of what it means to be organic: Protected by law:  USDA develops standards for organic products.  The USDA can enforce criminal penalties against operations that falsely use the organic seal.  NOP investigates complaints and takes action against businesses that violate the regulations. Inspected by experts:  Specially trained organic inspectors visit farms yearly to confirm they still meet the organic standards. Every organic operation is also subject to additional inspections and testing.  Operations must go through a rigorous process before they can use the organic label. Traced from farm to store:  The Strengthening Organic Enforcement rule increases the USDA’s ability to audit the entire organic supply chain to deter, detect, and stop fraud before it reaches stores.  Farms and businesses must keep detailed records of the organic products they produce, buy, and sell. This allows businesses to choose trusted suppliers and verify that what they sell is organic. Shaped by public input:  Stakeholders provide feedback on proposed regulations to shape final policies.  The organic standards are developed with recommendations from an advisory board – the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB).  The public can attend bi-annual NOSB public meetings and provide input. The full toolkit, along with the individual graphics, is available on the AMS website. Many graphics include a QR code that links to the Understanding the Organic Basics webpage, where consumers can learn more about the NOP and the organic label. NOP is a federal regulatory program that develops and enforces consistent national standards for organically produced agricultural products sold in the United States.

"The People's Garden Apiary, installed in , is located on the roof of the Jamie L. Whitten Building and has homed up to approximately 80,000 Italian honey bees. USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Bee Research Lab in Beltsville, Maryland, helps keep these colonies of bees strong and healthy so they can pollinate crops growing in the People's Garden and neighboring landscapes. They also produce delicious honey! Beehives are often important elements of urban gardens due to the pollination services they provide. They’re also big business. Honeybees pollinate $ates each year, including more than 130 types of fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Honeybees also produce honey, worth about $3.2 million in according to USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). How are hives constructed? The beehives are wooden box-like sections stacked on top of each other. Each box (or super) holds 8-10 wooden frames which include a thin sheet of wax foundation in each frame. The bees build their combs on these foundations. How is honey extracted? Honey is stored in the combs in the upper parts of the hive. When the bees have filled the combs in the upper section with honey and covered them with wax caps, the beekeeper takes them away to extract the honey. Are honey bees native to the United States? Honey bees are not native to the United States. The scientific name for honey bee is Apis mellifera. Since humans first began keeping honey bees, their principal aim has been the harvest of honey. Beekeepers select the appropriate type of honey bee based on temperament, physical characteristics, disease resistance, and productivity. Italian honey bees were selected for the People's Garden Apiary because they are most often used in commercial beekeeping in the United States. These bees have a relatively gentle disposition and are good honey producers. They are not the most resistant to disease, but they excel in most other areas. There have been some queen survivorship issues in both of the People's Garden colonies, which actually mirrors what's going on in the rest of the country. Queen health is an issue for everyone who buys queens, commercial or hobbyist. The exact underlying reasons for poor queen survivorship is unknown, but the ARS lab is actively researching this problem.","What are some common characteristics of constructed beehives used in commercial beekeeping, and how do they facilitate honey production and harvesting?","In commercial beekeeping, beehives are typically wooden box-like sections stacked on top of each other, with 8-10 wooden frames per super, containing a thin sheet of wax foundation. This design allows bees to build combs for honey storage in the upper parts of the hive, which can then be extracted by the beekeeper when the combs are filled and capped with wax."

"It's ideal to have host plants and nectar plants growing in your garden if your goal is to attract butterflies. Selecting what to plant varies enormously based on what butterfly species you wish to attract. Butterflies will roam in search of food and egg-laying sites for many miles—even hundreds to thousands—of miles. Butterflies lay their eggs on host plants that the emerging caterpillars will eat. Different species of butterflies prefer different types of plants to lay their eggs on. Milkweed and Monarch Butterflies The monarch butterfly however is very specific and only lays her eggs on species of Asclepias - commonly known as milkweed. Each fall, millions of monarch butterflies migrate from the United States and Canada to overwintering areas in Mexico and California and make the return flight in spring. Threats, including loss of milkweed habitat, are having a devastating impact on monarch populations. By planting milkweed you can help save the monarch butterfly.","What is the primary host plant that Monarch Butterfly caterpillars eat, and why is it crucial to have this plant in your garden to support their life cycle?","The primary host plant for Monarch Butterfly caterpillars is milkweed (Asclepias), which is crucial to have in your garden as the caterpillars will only eat this specific type of plant, making it essential for supporting their life cycle."

"Administrator, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Nutrition Security  Apr 25,  Setting kids up for success. It’s what every parent, guardian, and educator wants for our nation’s schoolchildren. They understand the power that small changes have to make a big difference in the learning environment. That’s why here at USDA, we recently announced a generational investment in our children’s futures through updated school nutrition standards. Right now, schools across our country are serving breakfasts and lunches to nearly 30 million children every day. Healthy school meals that represent the main source of nutrition for more than half of these students and are an essential part of the educational landscape — like teachers, books, or computers – helping to unlock kids’ full potential in and out of the classroom. It is no surprise that poor nutrition and diet-related diseases are correlated with lower academic achievement, worse health outcomes, and more behavioral problems for kids. We recognize the tremendous work that educators and school nutrition professionals do every day to ensure our children are fueled to thrive. Healthy school meals are an essential element of a quality education and are a part of the solution to promote children’s health. We know that this work is not easy, which is why the Biden-Harris Administration has made historic investments to help schools provide healthy and nutritious meals to students. School breakfast offers the jump start to a great day. It sets the tone for the rest of the day, especially for children. It’s why kids who eat breakfast have increased alertness and improved moods throughout the morning, fostering a better learning experience. What’s more, studies find that students who participate in school meal programs consume more whole grains, milk, fruits, and vegetables during mealtimes and enjoy better overall diet quality. These pivotal updates we are making to school nutrition standards have been shaped by a host of stakeholders, including parents, devoted teachers, school administrators, school nutrition directors, and industry leaders, and are informed by the latest Dietary for Americans. These new standards allow us to take the next step in putting kids’ health at the forefront by:  Reducing the amounts of added sugars in school meals, especially at breakfast.  Making it easier to offer healthy proteins at breakfast.  Scaling back sodium levels over time.  Continuing to emphasize fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains, to give kids the right balance of nutrients for healthy, tasty meals. That’s not all. We are also providing flexibilities to make it easier for schools to accommodate vegetarian diets and the cultural and religious food preferences of students. This way, every child has access to the nutritious foods they desire and deserve to nourish their bodies and minds. We encourage educators to uplift these school meal enhancements as an opportunity to maximize the impact of what they do best – educate. Because it’s that commitment to inspire that enables all students to thrive. For that important gift, our nation couldn’t be more grateful.

"What is a native plant? A native plant is a plant that is a part of the balance of nature that has developed over hundreds or thousands of years in a particular region or ecosystem. Note: The word native should always be used with a geographic qualifier (that is, native to New England [for example]). Only plants found in this country before European settlement are considered to be native to the United States. There are many benefits of landscaping and gardening with native plants including conserving water, protecting soil from erosion, and creating habitat and providing food for many different animals including birds, pollinators, and small mammals. Simply by growing native plants gardeners can bring enormous beauty to a community and joy to its residents. In addition, native plants are easy-to-grow and require minimal maintenance. Fall is widely considered the best time of year to plant native trees, shrubs, grasses, vines and perennials.

Food forests support forest ecosystems and connect communities with nature. Trees of different sizes produce nuts and fruit, while their shade can support a variety of fresh, flavorful mushrooms, herbs, and berries. Trees also improve air quality and retain water. Check out the new Tree Planning and Planting Guide: A Guide for Reforesting Cities and Towns, produced by U.S. Forest Service and partner, the Green Infrastructure Center. The online guide includes a tool to guide communities on where to plant trees to maximize urban cooling across an entire city. Did You Know? Oak trees provide more than shade and food for wildlife, their acorns can also be used to produce flour! By connecting schools to food forests, children can learn about the food they eat and help select and plant trees and shrubs.",What is the primary goal of the Tree Planning and Planting Guide in relation to urban environments?,The primary goal of the Tree Planning and Planting Guide is to guide communities on where to plant trees to maximize urban cooling across an entire city.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Apr 10,  For many American farms, the apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree. The Robison and Stennes family orchards combined equal more than 200 years of growing apples in Washington. The Robison family has been growing apples in Chelan, Washington since the s. Today, Jake – the fourth generation of the Robison family – lives on the early-19th century plot that was used to grow some of the earliest apples to be harvested in Washington. “It’s fascinating that the land we are farming today has been used for apples since nearly the beginning of apple farming in the state of Washington – a unique piece of history,” said Jake Robison. The Stennes family has been growing apples in Pateros, Washington, for more than 130 years, and it continues to modernize its planting, crop management, and harvesting practices. “We’re using self-propelled worker platforms for more efficient work, using robotic harvesting prototypes. Plus, we just purchased our first electric and fully autonomous tractors,” Mark Stennes told FAS. Furthermore, the Stennes orchards have several hundred acres of certified organic production methods and practice Integrated Pest Management to minimize pesticide usage. The Pacific Northwest microclimate has enabled growers to experiment with this specialty crop. Robison Orchards produce a wide assortment of apple varieties. “We see Granny Smith, Honey Crisp, Cosmic Crisp, and other varieties as excellent options of high-quality apples for foreign markets,” said Dave Robison. “We just got to get them there.” Both family farms view the recent trade win of India reopening its market to U.S. apples as beneficial for apple farmers across Washington. The Washington Apple Commission (WAC) and FAS India worked together to regain market access for American apple growers. After retaliatory tariffs were lifted last summer, $10.8 million of U.S. apples were exported to India. This had an almost immediate impact for American apple growers; the market in India opened at the beginning of apple-picking season up in the Pacific Northwest. “Since the tariffs were imposed, other apple origins such as Turkey, Poland, and Iran, took control of the Indian market share, dropping the market share for Washington growers from 53 percent to less than 1 percent in 4 years,” Mark shared with FAS after traveling to India with the WAC in December. “Now that the tariff has been removed, we’ve seen Washington gain back some of the market share that was lost. India is now our fourth largest export market.” USDA is committed to strengthening U.S. exports of apples and other specialty crops. In , specialty crop exports totaled $24.6 billion. FAS is part of the Specialty Crop Competitiveness Initiative (SCCI), which identifies foreign market access and improves domestic production and processing practices. Growing and exporting Washington apples is a prime example of the future-facing American agriculture USDA is working with farmers to achieve. An example of this is FAS’s recently announced Assisting Specialty Crops Exports (ASCE) initiative, which will help expand specialty crop exports. ASCE investments will enable the specialty crops industry to address the many non-tariff barriers it faces when opening or expanding export markets.
