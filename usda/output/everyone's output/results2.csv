"Public Affairs Specialist, Research, Education, and Economics in  Research and Science  Apr 22,  As we celebrate this Earth Day, we want to share a few examples of USDA’s commitment to climate-smart research and scientific investments. USDA science efforts focus on understanding the full range of potential climate impacts, developing science-based solutions, deploying strategies, conducting analyses, creating market opportunities using climate-smart production practices and developing innovative tools for farmers, ranchers and producers. USDA’s Climate Hubs develop and deliver valuable science-based information to agricultural producers and U.S. communities and the Hubs charged with advancing USDA efforts to promote climate-resilient landscapes and rural economic systems. It’s a unique collaboration across USDA and with partnering organizations that brings USDA research into practice. Earlier this year, USDA announced a $9 million investment in Climate Hubs partnerships with Cooperative Extension to bolster climate research and share climate-smart solutions directly with the agricultural community. Under this partnership, projects focus on building net-zero emissions in agriculture on working lands and in communities. USDA launched the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate — an international initiative that seeks to address climate change and global hunger by uniting participants to significantly increase investment in and support for climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. This effort is vital to protect our planet and enable solutions at the intersection of agriculture and climate. USDA also plays an important role in supporting clean energy. USDA joined the government-wide Sustainable Aviation Fuels Grand Challenge to enable scale-up of the production and use of sustainable aviation fuels to meet 100% of domestic aviation fuel demand by . USDA researchers are developing Earth-friendly agricultural feedstocks to support this effort. These USDA-supported efforts—among many others—are part of USDA’s commitment to transform our nation’s food and energy systems in climate-smart ways that will protect our planet for generations to come.

"USDA Rural Development State Director for New York in  Rural  Apr 17,  I recently traveled to Torrey, New York to break ground on the town’s first-ever water district. This project has been more than 20 years in the making and it will improve the health and lives of people living in rural parts of the state. It will also improve the water quality and conservation efforts on the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The town received $2.4 million in funding through USDA Rural Development’s Water and Environmental Program (WEP). Once completed, this project will bring safe and reliable water to more than 40 households. I was joined by town and community leaders – both past and present – as well as the engineers from Clark Patterson Lee and Nardozzi construction teams who will be building out the new waterline. “The residents in this area have trouble with water from the lake or their wells are prone to dry out,” Town Supervisor Peter Martini said. “Some of the wells are inadequate for residential use. Once reliable wells are getting less reliable. If everything goes as planned, residents should have water from the new line by this summer.” As Earth Day approaches, projects like this one make me proud to invest in our planet and in rural America. It is an example of how USDA is partnering with rural communities to build critical infrastructure that will create jobs for people across the state and the nation. Every community needs access to modern water and wastewater systems – especially rural residents and businesses throughout New York state. USDA is proud to celebrate Earth Day to show how we are investing in locally driven solutions like this one in rural New York to expand access to safe water and reliable wastewater infrastructure, renewable energy and essential services that create jobs, build critical infrastructure and create sustainable futures for rural America.

"in Rural  Apr 19,  It’s a human right to have access to clean water and reliable wastewater systems. USDA Rural Development finances projects to build strong infrastructure to help people in rural America thrive and create economic opportunities. This week, as we celebrate Earth Day, we are proud to highlight some of the many ways USDA programs advance climate-smart infrastructure to help people have a more accessible, affordable and safe water supply. Water Independence Comes to a Rural Community in Missouri For six years, Public Water Supply District No. oddard County purchased water from a nearby community. USDA Rural Development awarded $2.6 million under the Water & Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program to make improvements to the district's drinking water production, storage and distribution system. This project is expected to enable the district to provide community members quality water from its own systems. The project will help the district drill two wells in areas with good water quality. That will help reduce operational costs because the water will require less treatment. The funds will also be used to install meters to reduce water loss and more accurately record the amount of water each customer uses. Wastewater System Upgrades Improve Health and Safety for People in Rural Tennessee The town of Baxter is improving the health and safety of the community’s residents. The town used a loan and grant totaling to $3 million through the Water and Waste Disposal Program Loan and Grant program to upgrade its wastewater treatment to provide safe and clean wastewater services to 1,350 people. The improvements will upgrade a sewer pump station and other infrastructure needs. Safe Drinking Water for Tribal and Underserved Rural Communities in Minnesota USDA Rural Development awarded the Fond du Lac Band of Chippewa Indians a loan and grant totaling to $8 million under the Water and Waste Disposal Program to make improvements to the Mahnomen community water system on the Fond du Lac Reservation in Carlton County. This project will replace two water wells, a water treatment plant and water distribution lines. The funds also will be used to build a water tank. These improvements will ensure that the Tribe’s water system is safe for the 620 residents it serves.

"Acting National Coordinator for USDA Climate Hubs, Office of Energy and Environmental Policy in  Climate  Farming  Forestry  Research and Science  Aug 08,  In June , Secretary Vilsack outlined a vision for agricultural solutions to environmental challenges, which included creating the Regional Climate Hubs. In , the USDA Climate Hubs were established in to serve as regional centers of climate change information and outreach to reduce risks. The Climate Hubs enhance USDA capacity to deliver science-based knowledge and practical information to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests. Early career professionals joined the Hubs to hone their science communication and engagement skills while supporting the Climate Hubs’ mission. In , Climate Hub Fellows focused on co-developing science-based information to help land managers make climate-informed decisions. Likewise, Hubs brought on interns and post-doctoral researchers. Climate Hubs were able to enhance engagements among land managers and scientists to co-develop science and technology. To mark the 10-year anniversary of Secretary Vilsack sharing his vision for the Climate Hubs, we share two highlights. Dr. Julian Reyes was a Climate Hub Fellow with the Southwest Climate Hub. During his fellowship, he developed, AgRisk Viewer, which empowers decision makers to assess their climate risks by commodity type at the county scale using long-term crop insurance from Risk Management Agency. This tool identifies areas of agricultural production risk due to extreme events to help target locations for adaptation actions. Haley Case-Scott was a Resource Assistance Program intern with the Northwest Climate Hub. During Haley’s internship, she engaged with Tribal Nations supporting government-to-government consultation for the 25th update to the Northwest Forest Plan. Haley also developed communication materials to share information about USDA programs that could support climate adaptation and mitigation. Both Reyes and Case-Scott have also worked with the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy (OSTP) to provide clear, useful, and useable science and knowledge to inform the Administration’s climate, environment, and nature actions and initiatives. “Communities and decision makers need actionable and usable climate information and services. My time with the USDA Climate Hubs has shown the power of co-production ensuring community voices are embedded in our place-based, people-centered work. These perspectives have also helped me in my work at OSTP,” Reyes said. “Serving as a Resource Assistant Program intern with the USDA Northwest Climate Hub was a great experience. It allowed me to take a deep dive into how the federal government works, and provided me the tools needed to build my professional career,” Case-Scott said. The Climate Hubs continue to build capacity to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests.

"NIFA, Writer/Editor in  Research and Science  Apr 20,  Feeding a world population estimated to exceed 9 billion by will require significant increases in agricultural production, yet those increases must be sustainable solutions that protect the world’s natural resources. As USDA’s primary extramural funding agency, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) invests in research, education and Extension efforts to ensure a secure food supply while protecting and enhancing the world’s natural resources. NIFA’s Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) is the nation’s leading competitive grants program for agricultural sciences. AFRI-funded science is vital to meeting food, fiber and fuel demands as the global population expands while safeguarding the world’s land and water resources. NIFA is working to transform American agriculture to increase production in sustainable ways and doing so in the context of diminishing land and water resources and a changing climate. Examples of NIFA-Supported Research Advancing Climate-Smart Ag:  Researchers at Auburn University have identified two genes that appear to coordinate the fitness of plants in defending themselves from drought while also stimulating growth. The genes will likely be good candidates to help generate crops that are truly drought tolerant.  University of California scientists are developing new instruments and analysis techniques that will provide insights into the sources and chemistry of atmospheric aerosols and the role they play in global climate and regional air pollution.  Rutgers University showed that increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide could lead to changes in soil structure. Researchers are helping develop better crop fertilization and irrigation practices that maximize yields while minimizing soil and water contamination from excess nutrients.  A microclimate study conducted by West Virginia State University Extension Service is helping landowners learn more about climate change impact on regional weather, with the goal of minimizing negative impact on seasonal crops and overall farm livelihood.  At North Dakota State University, researchers developed web-based nitrogen calculators for more efficient nitrogen management without decreasing crop yields in crops like wheat, canola, barley and sugar beets. NIFA and the projects it supports are crucial to feeding the world and protecting the Earth for future generations.

"Chief Officer, OCIO Enterprise Management Center (EDMC) in  Technology  Apr 22,  The USDA recently wrapped up a successful hackathon at Colorado State University. This event, which brought together computer science and science students around a real USDA challenge, is a prime example of the many benefits that hackathons can offer. But what exactly is a hackathon, and why are they so beneficial? A hackathon is an intensive event where participants collaborate to create solutions to specific problems. The fast-paced environment of a hackathon encourages creativity, innovation, and teamwork. By bringing together people from different backgrounds and disciplines, hackathons can foster cross-pollination of ideas and lead to the development of solutions that might not have been possible otherwise. From April 4-6, representatives from USDA joined CSU at the downtown Fort Collins, CO campus, bringing together staff from USDA-OCIO, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS), CSU’s Computer Sciences and Animal Sciences programs, and the Ram Hack student organization to conduct the 24-hour hackathon. USDA Deputy Secretary Xochitl Torres Small provided pre-recorded remarks, and the USDA Chief and AI Officer Christopher Alvares kicked off the event. Our event with CSU was developed around a real-world artificial intelligence use case for AMS. AMS is pursuing ways to expand their meat grading service and want to explore the use of image processing and artificial intelligence. Over 60 CSU students across 18 teams were challenged to develop predictive models that could accurately estimate beef grade (e.g. Prime, Choice, Select) and fat thickness using images of beef ribeye's as they would appear to an AMS meat grader. Representatives from USDA provided technical assistance to many of the hackathon’s participants. Six teams were recognized for their accomplishments and will also receive letters of appreciation and an opportunity to meet with AMS on their project. Prior to the start of the hackathon, a career fair was held with representatives from OCIO’s Office of the Chief Officer, Cybersecurity and Privacy Operations Center, Client Experience Center, and Digital Infrastructure Services Center. Representatives discussed core professional skills, resume tips, and internship opportunities at USDA. Students also heard about programs such as the US Digital Corps, GSA’s two-year tech fellowship program and a partner of USDA. We hope to strengthen relationships with CSU and other universities to not only help address real USDA problems, but also inspire students and learners through hackathon events to hone their skills and consider a tech career in USDA and public service.

"Expanding Affordable Healthcare in Rural South Carolina  Having access to quality health care is often a problem for low-income patients who live in rural communities. Fortunately, there are medical facilities such as Sandhills Medical Foundation, Inc in Lugoff, South Carolina that work on a sliding fee scale, which means that all their patients, regardless of income level, can afford quality health care. However, this has also increased their number of patients over time, and it wasn’t long before they recognized that their Lugoff office was running out of space.  Stephanie Bittiker, USDA Rural Development Public Information Officer  Posted in  Equity  Rural  Sep 16,   Respond to this story",How have expanded affordable healthcare options at Sandhills Medical increased patient care demands?,"The expanded affordable healthcare options at Sandhills Medical Foundation, Inc. have led to an increase in their patient volume, resulting in space constraints at their Lugoff office."
"of Agriculture Xochitl Torres Small in  Equity  Aug 01,  Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has advanced equity by listening to the people we serve and learning how we can serve them better by removing barriers to our programs and services. USDA offices and agencies have developed key actions to comprehensively incorporate equity into the Department’s services, which touch every American’s life. USDA Rural Development’s Equity Action Plan was one of the last projects I worked on as Under Secretary of that mission area. So I know firsthand how hard USDA staff have worked to make change. Now in my new role as Deputy Secretary, I am thrilled to share the release of 14 Equity Action Plans that encompass the work across all of USDA. These plans follow the lead of President Biden’s Executive Order 1, which insists that federal agencies use all the policy levers we have to make progress. Founded on the insight that our country is stronger when everyone participates, and more vulnerable when people are left out, the plans released today are part of our relentless focus to shape USDA to truly be what President Lincoln called us, the People’s Department. While the plans are ambitious, I know they are achievable. The plans share both accomplishments and actions underway. A few examples of the accomplishments include:  Simplified direct farm loan application processes. The Farm Service Agency drastically reduced the burden and time necessary for farmers and ranchers applying for loans. FSA has also rolled out a loan assistance tool that helps farmers and ranchers better navigate the farm loan application process.  Regional Food Business Centers. A dozen Food Business Centers will support a more resilient, diverse, and competitive food system. These Centers—led by partners who include the Mississippi Delta Council for Farmworker Opportunities, the Georgia Minority Outreach Network, and the Intertribal Agriculture Council—will support producers by providing localized assistance to access local and regional supply chains, including linking producers to wholesalers and distributors.  Rural Partners Network – The Rural Partners Network (RPN) is an alliance of federal agencies and commissions, led by USDA Rural Development, working directly with rural communities to expand rural prosperity through job creation, infrastructure development, and community improvement.  Embracing Tribal Sovereignty. The Forest Service has embraced Tribal self-determination principles, releasing the USDA Forest Service Action Plan: Strengthening Tribal Consultations and Nation-to-Nation Relationships, and furthering co-stewardship agreements.  Microfarms at RMA — The Risk Management Agency (RMA) issued a Micro Farm policy to provide additional insurance options for small-scale producers. The policy development process included obtaining feedback from small-scale producers that have grown products for their local communities. But of course there’s still plenty of room for improvement. Some of our plans include:  Increasing access to nutrition programs. FNS will support State and local partnerships to increase the reach of nutrition programs in underserved communities and will continue to expand online shopping. And it will move forward on nationwide implementation of the new Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer program, which will provide grocery-buying benefits to low-income families with school-aged children when schools are closed for the summer.  Expanding Urban and Community Forestry Benefits. The Forest Service will increase access to urban forestry benefits.  Improving Civil Rights processes. USDA's civil rights office will continue to improve civil rights complaint processes; it will eliminate complaint backlogs, meet ambitious timeliness goals going forward, and implement a fast-track emergency intervention program complaint process to allow timely solutions in cases that involve urgent needs.  Enhancing capacity of minority-serving institutions. Research, Education, and Economics will increase stakeholder engagement to identify research needs, enhance research collaboration, offer new grant programs, and invest in facilities and workforce development to help build capacity.

"Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19?  Last year, as COVID-19 rattled the world economy and disrupted trade flows, agricultural trade remained mostly stable, falling only two percent during the initial wave of infections and lockdowns, before bouncing back and ending the year up 3.5 percent. But the growth in agricultural trade doesn’t mean that trade flows were insulated from the effects of the pandemic. Much of was in fact shaped by other factors. For instance, 95% of global agricultural trade growth came from China and was driven in part by non-pandemic related factors of increased feed demand, efforts to restock grain reserves, and policy factors. A recent paper by USDA’s Office of the Chief Economist, Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19? Findings from an Econometric Assessment (, 1.4 ) (Arita et al.), suggests that while agricultural trade remained stable at the aggregate level, a deeper empirical analysis reveals there were still significant disruptions due to the pandemic.

"USDA Foreign Agricultural Service in  Climate  Farming  Technology  Trade  Aug 09,  Accurate crop mapping is a crucial process to informing reliable crop production estimates, addressing climate change, and developing strategies for sustainable agriculture. U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service is working with university students in Tanzania on a pilot project to gather grassroots to strengthen community agricultural systems and improve crop condition assessments with satellite imagery. Their field work is adding truth from the ground up to the sky. In April, 14 YouthMappers spent four days in the Arusha area capturing on 334 fields by photographing, georeferencing, and identifying target crops to enhance FAS satellite imagery analysis. YouthMappers is an international network of university-based chapters that organize and implement mapping activities in response to global and local development needs. “The YouthMappers’ chapters are products under USAID, which empower youth to help their community,” said Gideon G. Sway, one of the Tanzania YouthMappers. The FAS-YouthMappers team’s main objective was to create an agricultural library of ground-truth from the Arusha, Dodoma, and Mwanza regions. This activity is the first time YouthMappers has used its members’ skills to strengthen agricultural . While Tanzania grows several kinds of crops, making this a viable machine learning project the team to focus on locating target crops of FAS’ International Production Assessment Division (IPAD). Oftentimes, crops are grown together in larger fields and can be detectable by freely available satellite imagery. In addition to geo-locating these crops, the team’s field work revealed variability in crop heights and exposed pest damage—especially from the fall army worm. This future-facing project improves understanding of crop conditions and the impact of seasonal rains. Since the project began, the Tanzanian YouthMappers network has collected from 1,700 fields in the Arusha, Dodoma, and Mwanza regions. Thanks to YouthMappers, FAS can now pair satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 with the field . In May, these YouthMappers, trained additional university students on geo-mapping with ArcGIS, OpenStreetMap, and Kobo Collect to help advance Tanzanian agriculture and achieve project goals for the Dodoma and Mwanza regions. The Tanzania partnership is part of FAS efforts to help develop young agricultural leaders to strengthen Africa’s self-development and capacity building. Be on the lookout for this group’s presentation next month at the Africa Food Systems Forum. The goal of the Forum is for public, private, and non-profit groups to strengthen African agricultural and food systems via inclusivity, sustainability, resiliency, and equity.

Located in the heart of Doha, in a fan zone featuring international pavilions, visitors to the USA Pavilion feel as though they’re being transported to the States through the sights, sounds, and smells of everything U.S. agriculture has to offer – including food/ag, education, and tourism. “It’s our mission at the World Cup to introduce the world to our true MVPs, America’s farmers and ranchers who work every day to grow and produce safe, nutritious, sustainable, and delicious foods and ingredients to feed and nourish the world,” said USDA Agricultural Counselor Valerie Brown. “We’ve put together a dream team of U.S. food and commodity groups and celebrity chefs who are looking to score new fans as they kick things up with cooking demonstrations, competitions, and giveaways featuring U.S. ingredients – everything from healthy treats for athletes to decadent game day foods for fans and families. Whether visitors want to learn how to make nutritious snacks with U.S. fruits, nuts, and cheese, or something more indulgent like barbeque, gumbo, and ice cream desserts, the USA Pavilion will offer food lovers from around the world a field of options – all thanks to America’s farmers and ranchers.” According to the latest trade , U.S. food and agricultural exports to the world, and the Middle East in particular, increased last fiscal year (). In , U.S. farmers and ranchers exported a record $196.4 billion of food and agricultural products to the world, of which $6.6 billion was exported to the Middle East, up 20 percent from the prior year. Consumer demand for U.S. foods and ingredients is growing in the region, especially for U.S. tree nuts, dairy products, and beef and beef products, a few of the many ingredients being showcased at the World Cup USA Pavilion in Qatar. “This year the World Cup may be more than 7,ates, but FAS is proudly representing Team USA and our food and ag MVPs back home,” added Brown. “Visitors to the USA Pavilion will travel on a food and ag tour across our wonderful country as their senses discover ingredients and products from Virginia and Louisiana, to Texas, California, Hawaii, and other amazing states in between.

"The Electronic Government Act of was signed into law on December 17, . ""Electronic Government""(E-GOV) is defined as the Government use of ""web-based Internet applications or other information technology to enhance the access to and delivery of government information and services to the public, other agencies, and other Government entities; or to bring about improvements in Government operations that may include effectiveness, efficiency, service quality, or transformation."" The E-Government Act of established a new agency within the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Electronic Government, which is responsible for electronic information management and for promoting interagency cooperation to improve public services. The act creates a Chief Information Council that works with other Federal agencies and State and local governments to help develop electronic technology policies, requirements, and strategies. An E-Government Fund was also established to provide funding for projects intended to allow for easier public access to information, improved government services and transactions, and enhanced agency information technology project coordination and planning. The E-GOV initiatives serve citizens, businesses, and Federal and state government employees by delivering high quality services more efficiently at a lower price. Instead of expensive “stove piped” operations, agencies work together to develop common solutions which achieve mission requirements at reduced cost, thereby making resources available for higher priority needs. USDA currently participates in 14 Presidential E-GOV Initiatives and Lines of Business (LoB).  By participating in the E-GOV Initiatives and LoBs, USDA has improved its business processes and program delivery to its customers, employees, and partners.  Through these efforts, USDA has been able to work with other Federal agencies to streamline common areas of business delivery (e.g. rulemaking, payroll, and grants management) and learn from best practices throughout the government.  The Department will continue to implement these Initiatives and LoBs to achieve further benefits for its customers. The OCIO E-GOV Office serves as USDA’s focal point for E-GOV Presidential Initiatives and Lines of Business, as well as the USDA liaison to the Office of Management and Budget regarding E-GOV. The office provides oversight and guidance to the development and implementation of USDA-wide policies, standards, and procedures for E-GOV implementations. The office manages USDA’s E-GOV relationships with other Federal agencies. It identifies and promotes common enterprise solutions to enable improvements in USDA’s business, information, and technology infrastructures to reduce overall funding requirements.  It also provides leadership in addressing and resolving IT department-wide issues and obstacles to achieving E-GOV objectives.","What is the primary goal of the Electronic Government Act's Office of Electronic Government in promoting interagency cooperation, implementing initiatives, and making resources available across government agencies?","The primary goal of the Electronic Government Act's Office of Electronic Government is to improve public services, make resources available for higher priority needs, and reduce costs by enabling agencies to work together to develop common solutions."

"Information Technology (IT) plays a critical role in the Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) ability to carry out its mission to “…provide leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, nutrition, and related issues based on sound public policy, the best available science, and efficient management.” Each year the complexity of the IT environment grows, and making sound IT investment decisions requires greater amounts of information. For example, the Department improves the Nation’s economy and quality of life by touching the lives of almost every person in America, every day. Nearly 100,000 employees deliver more than $144 billion in public services through the Department’s more than 300 programs worldwide, providing leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, nutrition, and related issues based on sound public policy, the best available science, and efficient management. USDA needs to respond effectively to the challenges posed by the diversity, complexity, and volume of IT investment proposals brought forward by various stakeholders throughout the Department. This new integrated IT governance framework supports government priorities and program delivery. USDA’s Integrated Information Technology Governance Framework (IITGF) is a holistic set of processes, procedures, and that assist the Office of the Chief Information Officer’s (OCIO’s) customers improve mission delivery. It does this by providing structure around the budget formulation, budget execution, enterprise architecture, capital planning, IT security, Section 508, Records Management, and portfolio/project management processes. Implementing the IITGF satisfies the following goals:  Provides a coherent and effective project management methodology to guide IT project management at USDA. The methodology is intended to consistently deliver IT capabilities that provide maximum support to USDA business needs within approved cost and schedule constraints.  Better integrates IT project planning and execution with IT Governance, including more effective multi-disciplinary reviews of IT projects by the stakeholders and IT executive governance bodies. The IITGF includes touch points with other USDA’s governance, management, and control activities and processes, such as: Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC), Agriculture’s System Development Life Cycle (AgSDLC) approach, Project Management (PM), Enterprise Architecture (EA), Risk Management Framework (RMF), and IT Security. Implementing an Integrated IT Governance Framework further supports the USDA mission by providing the alignment for decisions with needed technology components, services, and applications. An important objective of the IITGF Life Cycle is to provide flexibility that allows for tailoring of artifacts, decision gate reviews, and governance board reviews to suit the characteristics of a particular solution development effort. If tailoring is approved in advance by the governance board, these alternative development approaches empower project managers to tailor tasks in order to meet the specific needs of the project while maintaining compliance with the AgSDLC and IITGF governance processes.

"Who Are We? The Enterprise Architecture Division provides a planning concept and delivery process designed to help translate business strategies into mission results. We leverage as a strategic asset so that architecture becomes a tool to make -driven decisions that optimize resources, identify duplication, and cost saving opportunities. The EAD team supports the creation of an integrated, tiered Enterprise Architecture (EA) that supports improved planning and risk management at both the agency and Department levels. Additionally, the team supports standardization on common computing platforms to enhance interoperability and reduce cost of ownership; and improving the USDA’s planning and decision-making by more closely aligning EA activities to the IT Capital Planning processes. EAD provides and maintains for USDA a centralized EAVE (Enterprise Architecture Visioning Environment) that aligns IT assets to the Federal Enterprise Architecture reference models. Through its collection and reporting capabilities, the EAVE enables organizations to better identify collaboration, modernization and transformation opportunities. The EAD reinforces the adoption and documentation of technical standards, making it easier for USDA agencies to realize economies-of-scale cost savings based on aggregated purchases of like products and services. Additionally, the EA helps USDA identify opportunities for business reuse and sharing of existing infrastructure and services, reducing operational and overhead costs. What Do We Do? Enterprise Architecture gives the Department a bird’s eye view of the whole organization – and the ecosystem in which it operates both at a high level and detailed level as it matures overtime. EA is unique from other disciplines within the IT Management Framework in that it:  Encompasses the whole mission and operational scope of the Department  Represents the Department’s ecosystem at a high level of detail  Is based on a metamodel comprised of modular components making it reusable across the practice area in a wide range of scenarios Enterprise Architecture informs and translates strategies and business model changes into a set of coordinated actions needed to make them real via a roadmap. It has a special role between IT Strategy and IT Execution. Consider it a bridge between the two as it defines priorities and scope for translating strategy into operational reality.  Enabling an Actionable Architecture - Supports Agencies in making informed decisions concerning technology investments by implementing an “actionable architecture” which takes enterprise architecture from being a goal and moves it to becoming a platform for decision support.

"Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) is a systematic approach to selecting, managing, and evaluating information technology investments. Optimizing the Performance of IT Investments Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) is a systematic approach to selecting, managing, and evaluating information technology investments. CPIC is mandated by the Clinger Cohen Act of which requires federal agencies to focus on the results produced by IT investments. Here’s how we guide our clients through the CPIC lifecycle: Pre-Select Phase—Executive decision-makers assess each proposed investment’s support of USDA’s strategic and mission needs. Project managers compile the information necessary for supporting a detailed investment proposal. Select Phase—Investment analyses are conducted and the members of the E-Board choose the IT projects that best support USDA’s mission and enterprise architecture. Control Phase—USDA ensures, through timely oversight, quality control, and executive review, that IT investments are executed or developed in a disciplined, well-managed, and consistent manner. Evaluate Phase—Actual results of the implemented projects are compared to planned results to assess investment performance. Once investments are implemented, actual versus expected results are evaluated to: assess the investment's impact on strategic performance; identify any changes or modifications to the investment that may be needed; and revise the investment management processes based on lessons learned, self-assessments and benchmarking.

The spirited discussion covered a range of challenges on the horizon for the emerging bioenergy industry from traditional fuel providers to misperceptions about the tradeoff between food and fuel crops. Canales emphasized that changes are coming to the USDA energy programs that will allow applications to be submitted year round and to encourage geographic and technological diversity. Canales and others brought up the regional nature of biofuel production. Regionally significant feed stocks mentioned included cellulosic switch grass, wood pulp and sucrose-rich crops. With the commercial availability of existing flex fuels growing rapidly, participants called for a fresh examination of regulations intended to encourage their use. ""Greater use helps drive down production costs and will encourage more stations to carry fuels like E20, E30 and E85 as they come online,"" said Goode. ""We can help drive the change to cleaner fuels by doing more to take advantage of flex fuels in fleet vehicles and by educating consumers on the benefits of using more renewable American-made energy resources."" Coop Manager Louis Buck said that with the advances being made in bioenergy production today he looks forward to a time when farmers send power down wires to the city and get a check delivered back in the mail. Electronic mail, presumably. During the roundtable, Canales also announced the award of a $25,000 Rural Energy for America (REAP) grant to the Tennessee Biomass Supply Cooperative. According to Buck, ""The investment will be used for research into commercializing a new, more efficient technology for generating hydrogen from what is typically regarded as low-potential biomass feed stock.""

"Missouri State Director and George Thomas, Public Information Coordinator in  Energy  Rural  Apr 14,   To “flex” or not, that is a good question.  I own a flexible fuel vehicle and have for several years and as a Government Agency, Rural Development has government owned vehicles that accommodate flexible fuel.  As State Director, I travel throughout Missouri and even though I have the appropriate vehicle and even though there is an adequate supply of renewable fuels, there is an inadequate number of service stations that have flexible fuel pumps.  Compound this with the desire to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and make our nation more environmentally clean, you can imagine my reaction when Rural Development announced a program as part of the solution to address these issues. There was excitement in Jefferson City, Missouri’s State Capitol, when Judith Canales, Administrator for USDA Rural Development Rural Business-Cooperative Programs kicked off  Rural Development’s  Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) workshop on flex-fuel options.  Canales informed the 45 people in attendance that grants are available to provide fuel station owners with incentives to install flexible fuel pumps that will offer Americans more renewable energy options. Pictured left to right: John Eggleston, Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives; Bradley Schad, Missouri Corn Growers Association; Judith Canales, USDA Rural Business-Cooperative Service Administrator; Matt Amick, Missouri Corn Growers Association; Gary Wheeler, Missouri Corn Growers Association; and Janie Dunning, USDA Rural Development Missouri State Director The event was hosted by the Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives and their Secretary/Treasurer, John Eggleston, (also a 30-year pioneer of the ethanol industry in Missouri).  He  emphasized the importance of ethanol as a renewable energy source in reducing America’s dependency on foreign oil. Matt Moore, Director Business Programs for Missouri Rural Development (RD), illustrated that the REAP incentives offer options for financing the conversion of fuel stations pumps or installation of new flex fuel pumps resulting in a choice for Missourians when purchasing fuel in the future. The REAP incentives can be coupled with $5,000 incentives offered from both Growth Energy and the Missouri Corn Growers Association according to Bradley Schad, Director of Ethanol Blends with the Missouri Corn Growers Association. Other stakeholders in attendance that provided comments in support of the renewable energy programs included: Loyd Wilson, Division Director for Missouri Department of Agriculture; J.P. Dunn, Missouri Soybean Association;   Tom May,  Marketing Director for MFA Oil Company;  retailers, flex fuel pump distributors and others. As a highlight, the Missouri Corn Growers brought to the meeting a flex fuel pump for all the attendees and media to see. During the Question and Answer session of the meeting, it was pointed out that a small convenience store chain was exploring the possibility of putting new fuel dispensers in at several of their locations. Canales summed up the day by saying, “I want to make certain that everyone is aware of the variety of assistance USDA Rural Development provides to help businesses create jobs and become energy more efficient. This assistance builds on the Obama Administration’s commitment to ‘Win the Future’ by ensuring the Nation develops innovative ways to meet our future energy needs.” Administrator Canales explains the provisions of USDA’s Rural Energy for America Program during an appearance in Missouri  Category/Topic:  Energy  Rural  Tags:  Energy  Jefferson City  Judith Canales  Matt Moore  Missouri  REAP  Renewable Energy  Rural Development","**What funding sources and incentives are available for fuel station owners to install flexible fuel pumps in Missouri, as part of the USDA's Rural Energy for America Program (REAP)?**","According to the content, fuel station owners can access the following funding sources and incentives in Missouri to install flexible fuel pumps: * Grants from the USDA's Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) * $5,000 incentives offered by both Growth Energy and the Missouri Corn Growers Association."

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Conservation  Feb 24,  Red-backed salamanders and other amphibians are key players in ecosystem health. (iStock photo) Forested areas that border wetlands help protect wildlife, but until recently their efficacy has been untested for most amphibian species.  Now, recently published results of a six-year study explore how the loss or reduction of amphibians could affect the ecosystem. At the University of New Hampshire, Dr. Kimberly Babbitt and a team of graduate students conducted landscape-scale experiments that tested the impacts of forest buffer width vernal pools on population size and structure, body size and condition and population genetics of two amphibian species in the northeastern United States. A grant from USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supported the project. The investigation examined the response of spotted salamanders and wood frogs in three environments: wetlands surrounded by either intact forest, a 30-meter forest buffer surrounded by a 100-meter clearcut, and a 100-meter forest buffer surrounded by a 100-meter clearcut. The study indicates that areas with smaller buffers had negative impact on size and condition of salamanders and frogs. Analysis of genetic relatedness indicated that, despite logging, populations across the broader landscape are well-connected. Babbitt and doctoral student Danial Hocking also examined the role of amphibians in forest floor ecosystem function and conducted a review of amphibian contribution to ecosystem services. “We found that amphibians contribute in a variety of ways to human societies,” Babbitt said.  “We are examining the roles in different forest types to understand under what context salamanders can influence ecosystem functions, such as decomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant growth.” Some of the beneficial effects of amphibians on the ecosystem are known, such as the ability of tadpoles reduce eutrophication (greening) by consuming excess algae.  In many ecosystems means that amphibians have important roles both as food sources and as predators – amphibians feed heavily on mosquitoes, making them an important line of defense against mosquito-borne diseases, including the West Nile virus.  Babbitt noted many that amphibians have a lot more to offer – if we can ensure their survival. “Although yet to result in approved pharmaceuticals, amphibian skin secretions have shown the ability to inhibit HIV transmission and provide stronger analgesic effects than opioids,” she said. “Learning from these chemical secretions could lead to breakthroughs in human medicine. However, amphibians are declining across the globe and species are going extinct. It’s important to protect species before potential advances are lost.” NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.  Greater understanding of how forest buffers can protect the amphibians that serve the ecosystem is important knowledge that will help states, communities, and landowners make more informed decisions about land use and management, Babbitt said.

"USDA Public Information Coordinator, Virginia in  Rural  Aug 10,  USDA officials and residents of Carroll County gather in front of emergency equipment and transportation equipment purchased with USDA support. Under bright, sunny skies last Friday, hundreds of residents of Carroll County, Virginia turned out to acknowledge the support provided by USDA Rural Development. Working in conjunction with State and local governments, non-profit entities and the business community, USDA has infused well over $80 million into the area in recent years, and half of that was to improve water quality. Carroll County is located in the Southwest portion of the state, and the county seat, Hillsville, is surrounded by the Blue Ridge Mountains. USDA officials on hand for the celebration included Rural Development Deputy Under Secretary Cheryl Cook and Virginia State Director Ellen Davis. Both toured facilities that Rural Development helped finance, including a retraining center, court house and a public exercise facility.  In late morning, the USDA officials were the guests of honor at a luncheon at the regional farmers market that was attended by an estimated 500 guests.  Speaking to the audience, Congressman Rick Boucher praised Cook and Davis, along with Rural Development staff and acknowledged the efforts of Travis Jackson, a longtime USDA employee and regional Rural Development representative. The Congressman called Jackson “A premier public servant…enormously effective,” and praised Jackson for his work with local residents to complete funding application processes.  Congressman Boucher also thanked the County Supervisors who “Have a vision of what rural America can be.” During the luncheon, Board Chairman Wesley Hurst joined his colleagues and representatives of the school board in presenting Ms. Cook and Ms. Davis with plaques making them “Honorary County Residents.” Afterward, the guests lined up for a photo in front of emergency response and public transportation equipment funded through Rural Development’s Community Facilities Program.

"USDA Rural Development Public Information Office in  Rural  Sep 09,   “Small towns and rural communities need assistance from USDA Rural Development, now more than ever.” That was the consensus of attendees participating in a breakout session at the National Association of Towns and Townships (NATaT) annual meeting in Washington in early September. During and after the session Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development Cheryl Cook heard accounts of how local Rural Development staff have made a difference in the economic health of rural communities in states including Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Many described the positive impact of investments made through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act over the last two years, but expressed concern for the future. Water systems, broadband access, and fire and rescue capabilities were frequently cited as critical foundational investments every community needs. But many said finding private partners willing to lend on affordable terms is a challenge for smaller communities that have a limited tax base. A number of elected officials said that increasing the availability of private capital for existing and start-up businesses, improving educational and healthcare opportunities, and helping develop renewable energy options were all key to strengthening local economies through diversification. Many also praised the local knowledge and accessibility of RD’s network of staff members who regularly visit nearly every county in the nation. “Most of us have full time day-jobs and serve our communities as best we can,” explained one local leader from northeast Pennsylvania. “Without the technical assistance from our regional Rural Development Office I doubt we could get through the application process successfully. And that’s assuming we could even keep track of when funding is available for the infrastructure our town needs.” Cook described Rural Development as, “Three agencies on a mission, using loans, loan-guarantees and leveraging grants,” to make it affordable for small towns to keep up with advances in technology, provide necessary infrastructure, and to attract the pool of business investment capitol often taken for granted in larger cities. “One of the great things at Rural Development is that we make it affordable for rural communities to help themselves,” she said. “And by being hands-on from the start, we set them up for success.” According to Cook that means nearly all the investments RD makes get paid back with interest. “So, even as budgets get tighter, the capacity of our community facilities programs is able to grow to meet the needs of the many small towns struggling to survive.” “We want to Rural America to do more than just get by; we want these communities to thrive as the American economy recovers,” said cook.

"Rural Development State Director, New Jersey in  Initiatives  Rural  Oct 29,   After struggling for several years with a stagnant economy, the future is looking brighter for Paulsboro, New Jersey.  Earlier this week, USDA Rural Development Deputy Under Secretary Cheryl Cook, Assistant Administrator for the Water and Environmental Program Jacki Ponti, and I attended an event to celebrate a Recovery Act-funded water project that will help to stimulate job creation while also upgrading Paulsboro’s water system. The diverse borough of Paulsboro houses just over 6,000 residents and faces many of the same challenges of rural towns across the country.  In recent years, the decreasing demand for fuel spurred a number of oil refinery layoffs, displacing hundreds of Paulsboro workers and contributing to a steady rate of out-migration. In addition to the poor economic conditions in Paulsboro, the continuous repair of the public water system, much of which was built in the ’s, was becoming unfeasible, so the Borough worked with RD’s Water and Waste Disposal program to obtain financing for the water system improvements. “We’ve done over $20 billion in investments under the Recovery Act, with over $134 million of that right here in New Jersey,” said Deputy Under Secretary Cook.  “This is an investment that will yield dividends many years into the future for the residents of Paulsboro.” A Recovery Act loan-grant combination of $4.3 million will allow for the construction of two new water supply wells and a new water treatment plant.  These upgrades will remove aluminum, iron, manganese, benzene, and radium contaminants from the raw water, so Paulsboro residents will enjoy clean drinking water. In addition, these water system upgrades will facilitate greater economic development along the Port of Paulsboro.  New Jersey’s Governor recently traveled to the Port of Paulsboro to announce an off-shore wind energy generation initiative, which involves the employment of Paulsboro residents in receiving and assembling wind turbines at the Port.  This renewable energy initiative has the potential to create thousands of permanent jobs in the area. This is an exciting time for the borough of Paulsboro, and I am thrilled Rural Development, through Recovery Act funding, can contribute to this great project.  The jobs to be created in the construction of the new water system will serve to invigorate the Paulsboro economy now, but the upgraded system will allow for continued economic growth into the future.

"Michigan Rural Development Public Information Officer in  Rural  Jun 04,   Last week, USDA Rural Development in Michigan got an early start on Homeownership Month by promoting a pilot refinancing program, announced in February by Secretary Tom Vilsack, to help residents with current USDA home loans reduce their payments. Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development Doug O’Brien and USDA Rural Development State Director for Michigan James Turner made the announcement at the Portage office of AmeriFirst Home Mortgage, a leading partner with USDA’s Guaranteed Home Loan program. AmeriFirst agreed to participate in the pilot refinance initiative and eight of the first 26 loans were with their customers. “Since the creation of the USDA Guaranteed Home Loan program, USDA has helped more than 54,000 rural Michigan residents purchase houses,” O’Brien said.  “This pilot refinancing initiative helps people keep their homes and avoid financial hardship. I encourage any USDA homeowner who is eligible to explore this simplified refinancing program.” Existing Rural Development borrowers eligible for the pilot refinance program are not to obtain new appraisals, property inspections or credit .  The new interest rate for the refinance must be a fixed rate at least 1 percentage point below the current interest rate. The term cannot exceed 30 years.  No cash-out is permitted to the borrower. Complete details concerning eligibility are available at any USDA Rural Development office. Homeowners who meet these criteria may refinance their Rural Development guaranteed loans regardless of the loan-to-value ratio for the property. This enables borrowers who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth to get lower interest rates and reduce their monthly mortgage payments. “The pilot program can help stabilize neighborhoods and prevent the disruption and loss caused by home foreclosures,” Turner said.  “The goal is to help residents keep their homes and meet their obligations by giving them some financial breathing room.” After the Portage event, Deputy Under Secretary O’Brien went to Edwardsburg, on the Indiana state line, where he toured a glycerine-refining facility owned by CRB Real Estate LLC.  The company received two Business and Industry Guaranteed Loans for the purchase of real estate and the building and funding to finance the purchase of machinery and equipment.  Funding was through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

"Vermont/New Hampshire USDA Rural Development state director in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Dec 12,  USDA Rural Development’s Business and Loan Guarantee Program supported new construction for an expanded Brattleboro Food Coop in Brattleboro, Vermont. The original plan for two stories was expanded to four thanks to an innovative partnership with the Windsor Housing Trust to develop mixed-income apartments. “Smart Growth” is a term we hear more and more often.  It is the idea that as communities plan for the future, they consider the highest and best use of every resource – land, infrastructure, organizations and people.    From housing to transportation to energy to food; community developers and planners are asking how Smart Growth principles can be applied to ensure a sustainable and dynamic future for their communities and their residents. How is USDA involved in these efforts? Consider Brattleboro, Vermont.  With a population of 12,000, Brattleboro sits on the state’s southeastern border, and is a vibrant mix of industry, art and education.    Brattleboro’s downtown district was one of the first communities to take advantage of Vermont’s Downtown Program giving it access to state tax credits and shining a spotlight on its rich history. Its vibrant downtown is an inviting mix of shops, restaurants, offices and an art deco theatre and hotel.    Anchoring one end of the downtown is the Brattleboro Food Coop. Founded in , the Brattleboro Food Coop started as a local buying club.  It eventually grew into a popular retail destination featuring a wide range of products from nearby farms in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.  By , the Brattleboro Coop was outgrowing its space.  It considered moving to a new location outside of downtown.  The Board of the Coop, however, decided that its mission was much more compatible with a Smart Growth solution to its expansion needs.    In the meantime, the Windham and Windsor Housing Trust (WWHT) and Housing Vermont, were looking for a solution to Brattleboro’s need for more mixed income housing that was easily accessible to downtown’s services and amenities. With support from a loan guarantee from USDA’s Business & Industry Loan Guarantee Program, the Brattleboro Coop remained downtown in a new, highly energy efficient building with expanded retail space.  The new Coop space was originally envisioned as a two story building.   Through innovative partnerships, an additional two stories on the new building were sold to WWHT and Housing Vermont.   Though the Coop and the housing complex have separate ownership, they have similar commitment to the sustainable future of Brattleboro. The Brattleboro Coop is featured in the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass for its dedication to local food and local communities. It recently received a National Award for Smart Growth Achievement as awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its commitment to Smart Growth principles.  The results are stunning.  The new Brattleboro Coop Building opened in June, .

"Closing the Gap on Food Safety   From small, family farms to large food production companies, food safety is a top priority for the folks who feed our nation and put food on tables around the globe. Participating in programs like USDA’s Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), is one way that farmers and producers of all sizes can demonstrate to buyers that they are adhering to industry food safety standards.  By making this program more accessible to businesses of all sizes, USDA is creating opportunities for our nation’s small and mid-sized farmers.  Last week I traveled to Atlanta, Ga., for the Produce Marketing Association (PMA) Fresh Summit to discuss the expansion of our GroupGAP Program this coming spring. The program is an expansion of our Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) Audit Program, which provides third-party certification services to verify that operations are following industry-recognized food safety practices as well as recommendations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The pilot was supported by funding and technical expertise from the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and the Wallace Center at Winrock International.

"Know Where Your Food Comes From with USDA Foods  Do you know where your food comes from?  If you can pinpoint where your food was grown and produced, you can make more informed decisions to maximize quality, freshness, and nutritional value.  You can also help support local economies through your purchases.  The USDA Foods program takes this mantra to heart and publishes state of origin with procurement information on all USDA Foods every year.  As we like to say at FNS, “All USDA Foods are local to someone.” USDA Foods are 100 percent American grown and produced.  Each year, USDA procures more than 200 types of food, including meat, poultry, fish, fruits, vegetables, flour, cereals, and dairy products, totaling approximately $2 billion.  Organizations such as food banks, disaster and emergency feeding organizations, Indian Tribal Organizations, schools, and other feeding groups receive these USDA Foods for use in meal service or distribution to households through programs like the National School Lunch Program, The Emergency Food Assistance Program, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations.

"Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Jul 13,  Lori Cook, aka TV-personality “Maranda,” interviewed me about the importance of the Summer Food Service Program.  Hunger doesn’t take a summer vacation, and the State of Michigan is making sure that nutrition assistance programs don’t either. I recently traveled to the west side of the state to see some of the inspiring work our partners are doing to make sure that no one in their community has to face hunger. I first visited Fulton Street Farmers Market in Grand Rapids, where State and community partners are implementing new initiatives to improve the health of low-income Americans, such as fruit and vegetable incentive programs and nutrition education. A Michigan Department of Community Health employee even demonstrated a new pilot program that uses iPods and iPhones to accept SNAP and WIC benefits—very impressive! This means low-income individuals can more easily access fresh fruits and vegetables at farmers markets, and local farmers can increase their consumer base. I also got a chance to share exciting news about USDA’s new wireless technology grants for farmers markets that currently do not accept EBT. These grants increase access to fresh, healthy food while supporting family farmers and the local economy. Afterwards I headed to Kalamazoo, where community partner Loaves & Fishes hosted an energizing roundtable. Faith-based and community organizations from around the state joined me in a thoughtful discussion of the successes and challenges in operating the 15 USDA Food and Nutrition Service programs. I always learn something new by listening to those who work directly with the people who use our programs. The Grand Rapids school district feeds so many children that it needs semi-trucks to transport all of its meals! This year, I was happy to see they designed the outside of the trucks to show just how important school and summer meals are to so many children.  Later that afternoon, the Grand Rapids Press held an editorial board/community forum. This unique set-up gave me an opportunity to live Web chat with MLive readers about USDA nutrition assistance programs. We talked about everything from Summer EBT programs that allow families to feed children during the summer to the healthy changes USDA is making to school meals. The next day the Feeding America West Michigan Food Bank gave me a tour of their facilities. This food bank pioneered the concept of mobile food pantries. By modifying a beverage truck, the food bank was able to take fresh produce out into the community. Ken Estelle told me the food bank receives about 15% of its food from USDA Foods. Finally, I was fortunate enough to attend a kickoff of West Michigan’s Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). During the school year, more than 21 million children receive free and reduced-price lunch through the National School Lunch Program. And yet, when school lets out, only 3 million children receive a meal through a summer program. USDA’s SFSP is designed to address that gap, and WOOD-TV personality “Maranda” makes sure that happens every summer in western Michigan. Thousands of children came out to enjoy lunch and lots of physical activities. I’m a big supporter of the First Lady’s Let’s Move! initiative and it was great to see so many children playing outside and being active. What a fun event and a great way to end my visit to a state that is working so hard to improve the health and lives of its people!

"Natural Resource Specialist, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 17,  Wildlife cameras capture a young black bear enjoying new growth from a prescribed burn on the Pisgah National Forest. Photo credit: Lisa Jennings It was my first prescribed burn. After weeks of training and months of anticipation, I was finally on the ground – drip torch in hand – ready to apply fire to restore the mixed pine-hardwood forests at the edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains on the Pisgah National Forest. Joining the U.S Forest Service only two months earlier, my knowledge of fire’s effect on plant and wildlife communities was limited. But as the coordinator for the Grandfather Restoration Project, part of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration program, I had to quickly come up to speed with the on-the-ground reality of prescribed fire use. As I lit my drip torch that early March morning, igniting the thick leaf litter and dense shrubs that had accumulated during years of fire suppression, I couldn’t help but wonder – What happens to the wildlife after the fire? Utilizing fire is unnerving to those not familiar with fire as a restoration tool. The reality is much different; just as certain plants need fire to succeed, the animals that depend on those species benefit from fire as well. With the evolving use of prescribed fire as a restoration tool, it is critical to study the effects of fire on the communities we seek to restore. Traditional fire studies often focus on vegetation. The participants in the Grandfather Restoration Project decided to take it one step further and directly study wildlife use in sites treated with prescribed fire compared with untreated sites. Working collaboratively, wildlife specialists from Pisgah National Forest, the North Carolina Wildlife Resource Commission, and The Nature Conservancy designed a cutting-edge study using wildlife cameras. Re-entering the prescribed burn unit just four months after the fire, wildlife cameras in tow, I could see the changes in vegetation. Arising from the blackened ground a lush herbaceous layer had appeared, carpeting the forest with blueberries and grasses. Using 50 camera points over a six-week period in July and August, we studied the wildlife species that use our forests, and what habitats they prefer. Almost immediately, our cameras captured images of white-tailed deer, black bear, turkey and other wildlife attracted to the abundant grasses and forbs. Not only was I encouraged from the positive wildlife response to our burn, but our indicated a higher usage of the burned unit by wildlife when compared to the unburned unit; valuable information for land managers in determining population estimates and predator-prey ratios. I often think back to that first prescribed burn. I now understand what wildlife have known all along; that not only are wildlife capable of surviving fire, they reap the rewards of new growth, cover, and food stemming from fire and prescribed burning. For me, seeing these benefits firsthand is one of the most rewarding parts of my job with the U.S. Forest Service. Wild turkeys often nest in recently burned areas, taking full advantage of newly established sources of food and cover.

(Photo courtesy of Randall Hildreth)  Focus on land tenure and transition issues has grown considerably in recent years, especially its impact on new and beginning farmers. ""New and beginning farmers are the future of American agriculture,"" said Deputy Secretary Harden.  ""The average age of an American farmer is 58 and increasing, so we must help new farmers get started if America is going to continue feeding the world and maintain a strong agriculture economy.""  As the age of the principal farm operator continues to increase, the focus on this issue intensifies. Land tenure, succession and estate planning, and access to land for new and beginning farmers will be among the topics discussed in a session at USDA’s Agricultural Outlook Forum this month. Succession was also one of the key focal points for the Tenure, Ownership, and Transition of Agricultural Land (TOTAL) survey, the results of which provided updated on these issues.  The TOTAL survey showed that U.S. farmland owners expect to transfer 91.5 million acres to new ownership over the next five years.  This represents 10 percent of all farmland across the nation. In addition to providing the number of acres expected to transition, TOTAL also provided on how the owners expect to transition this land and much more. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) conducted this survey jointly with USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS).  At the upcoming Agriculture Outlook Forum, Mary Bohman, ERS Administrator, will moderate a panel and lead a discussion on “Land Tenure & Transition.”  Joining her on the panel will be Neil Hamilton, Professor of Law and Director of the Agricultural Law Center at Drake University, Julia Freedgood, Assistant VP for Programs at the American Farmland Trust, Greg Ibach, Director, Nebraska Department of Agriculture, Dr. Damona Doye, Regents Professor and Rainbolt Chair of Agricultural Finance at Oklahoma State University, and Randall Hildreth a farm operator in Alabama and member of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives.  To take part in the Agricultural Outlook Forum and be a part of the discussion, visit www.usda.gov/oce/forum/index.htm for more information and to register.

"Volunteer/Intern, U.S. Forest Service National Forests in North Carolina in  Forestry  Aug 14,   Angeliz Vangas and Hanniah Rodriguez made a big impact serving as interns on the National Forests in North Carolina and are now heading back to school and continuing on their road to success. As part of the Student Career Experience Program (SCEP), this summer Vangas and Rodriguez interned in the U.S. Forest Service’s engineering department in Asheville, N.C. SCEP provides work experience that is directly related to the student's academic program or career aspirations and gives students exposure to public service while enhancing their educational goals. The civil engineering majors are rising seniors at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez and have a passion for engineering. Both are members of the student chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers, where they serve as treasurer and secretary, respectively. The students were introduced to the Forest Service last year when they interned at the agency’s Southern Region headquarters in Atlanta, Ga. There, they were given a crash course on how engineering worked within the agency and assisted with inspections within the national forests. The energetic duo took what they learned in Atlanta and put it into practice to deliver results in Asheville, N.C. this summer. They were instrumental in developing an application for a $7 million grant to repair many of the damaged roads in the Nantahala, Pisgah, Uwharrie and Croatan National Forests in North Carolina. They transferred sketches made of the damaged roads to an Auto-CAD, which is used to produce more technical computerized models of the damaged areas. These models are crucial in formulating proposals needed to obtain the grant and to determine how best to repair the roads. Vangas and Rodriguez said interning with the Forest Service has been an engaging and insightful experience. They enjoyed working in Atlanta last year and the city life that comes with it. They said it has been particularly interesting working in Asheville, N.C. because of its close proximity to the national forests. This proximity provided them with more field work experience and to see the environment that they are affecting. “It has been really easy to adjust here because everyone has been so welcoming,” Rodriguez said. Rodriguez chose to intern with the Forest Service because of the diversity of opportunities.  “Working with the Forest Service provides two work scenarios – both field and office work,” she explained. Vangas echoed these sentiments. “It’s nice using our technical skills to help improve the forests,” she said. Although they are unsure about what they want to do after graduation, both say they would like to continue working for the Forest Service in civil engineering. They enjoyed learning from and meeting a lot of new people who have been influential on paving their road to becoming civil engineers and perhaps future Forest Service employees.

"Foreign Agricultural Service Public Affairs Specialist in  USDA Results  Trade  Oct 18,  Dutch Chef Eric Troost prepares an upscale dish using U.S. beef during a cooking demonstration for about 130 Belgian chefs Sept. 24. The demo was part of the first U.S. beef tasting event held in Belgium, which was hosted by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) office in The Hague, Netherlands, and the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF). The tasting was part of ongoing efforts to help expand U.S. beef exports to the European Union (EU). (Photo courtesy FAS The Hague)  The European Union (EU) is a relatively new market for U.S. beef exports. It wasn’t until August when the United States began exporting high-quality beef (marbled with a high fat content) to the EU under a negotiated tariff rate quota for non-hormone treated beef. Today, about 25 percent of U.S. beef exports to the EU are high-quality cuts such as tenderloin, strip loin and rib eye mostly used by upscale restaurants. The remaining beef exports include medium and lower quality cuts such as flank steak, chuck eye roll, briskets and shoulder clods. Finer restaurants in the EU traditionally do not integrate these cuts into their menus To help introduce these secondary cuts and expand U.S. beef exports to the EU, the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) office in The Hague, Netherlands, partnered with the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) and a Belgium-based meat importer and distributor to host the first U.S. beef tasting event in Belgium Sept. 24. USMEF’s international marketing efforts on behalf of U.S. beef, pork, lamb and veal are funded by the FAS Market Access Program (MAP) and Foreign Market Development programs to support activities such as this event. During the U.S. beef tasting event, approximately 130 Belgian chefs learned about the preparation of these less familiar beef cuts. Local Dutch Chef Eric Troost presented various cooking demonstrations including slowly cooked top sirloin with barbecue sauce, tartar of shoulder clod with artichoke and shallots and top blade with beets, coriander and sesame vinaigrette. The chefs were excited to learn cooking techniques for the secondary beef cuts, which are nearly 40 percent cheaper than primary beef cuts, said Mary Ellen Smith, agricultural attaché at the FAS office in The Hague. “Typically, secondary cuts from European beef cannot be used for finer dishes, so the Belgian chefs were intrigued by the various cooking methods that take advantage of the unique marbling in U.S. beef,” she said. “Events like these help introduce new U.S. products not only to the chefs that prepare them but to the thousands of European consumers that they serve.” The U.S. beef tasting event is just one example of how FAS’s market development programs have a long history of helping farmers, ranchers, and businesses of all sizes build and maintain commercial markets for U.S. food and agricultural products around the world. It also helps support President Obama’s National Export Initiative, which aims to double U.S. exports by the end of . Click here to view a video recap of the U.S. beef tasting event in Belgium.

"USDA Office of Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  Nov 20,  General Motors Global Public Policy Executive Director Greg Martin speaks at a press conference announcing the completion of the first-of-its kind purchase of verified carbon credits generated on working ranch lands by Chevrolet, at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), in Washington, D.C. on Monday, Nov. 17, . (L to R Senator Debbie Stabenow (MI), General Motors Global Public Policy Executive Director Greg Martin, Ducks Unlimited Paul Schmidt, The Climate Trust Executive Director Sean Penrith, and USDA Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) Under Secretary Robert Bonnie). USDA photo by Tom Witham. Earlier this week, USDA highlighted the creation of a market for carbon credits generated on working grasslands. Landowners benefit because they receive compensation for the carbon credits generated on their lands. They get a new source of revenue, while thriving grasslands provide nesting habitat for wildlife, are more resilient to extreme weather, and help mitigate the impact of climate change. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, recently purchased almost 40,000 carbon dioxide reduction tons generated on working ranch grasslands in the Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. It was the first purchase of its type.  Robert Bonnie, USDA's under secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the purchase and USDA's involvement in the project at an event at USDA headquarters. He was joined by Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Greg Martin, executive director for global public policy, General Motors; Sean Penrith, executive director of The Climate Trust and Paul Schmidt, chief conservation officer of Ducks Unlimited. The under secretary thanked Senator Stabenow, Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, for her staunch support for the program, which she said is delivering “real world measurable results.” Bonnie said he hopes this purchase will set a pattern for future carbon credit sales. This is how the credit system works: Landowners voluntarily place lands under a perpetual easement but retain rights to work the land, such as raising livestock and growing hay. The carbon storage benefits of this avoided conversion of grasslands are quantified, verified, and formally registered resulting in carbon credits. The carbon credits are made available to entities interested in purchasing carbon offsets. Chevrolet's purchase was undertaken voluntarily as part of its commitment to reduce eight million tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted. This is comparable to the annual carbon reduction benefit of a mature forest the size of Yellowstone National Park. USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded $161,000 through a Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) to Ducks Unlimited in to develop the necessary methodology to quantify the carbon stored in the soil by avoiding grassland conversions, resulting in the generation of carbon credits. Besides the landowners, USDA, and Ducks Unlimited, other key partners that helped make this project a success include The Climate Trust, American Carbon Registry, The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund and Terra Global Capital. Public-private partnerships to enhance U.S. carbon sinks such as forests, grasslands, wetlands and coastal areas, are a key part of the Obama Administration’s recently released Climate and Natural Resources Priority Agenda.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Missouri in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Aug 12,  Curtis Millsap works in the Chinese High Tunnel on his southwestern Missouri farm. NRCS photo. You can get just about anything you want at Millsap Farms, including an education about market farming. Curtis Millsap estimates that he, his family and a crew of interns feed about 200 families on 2.5 acres of his 20-acre farm near Springfield, Mo. While another seven acres of the farm sometimes includes sheep, poultry and cattle, it’s the vegetable operation that supports Millsap, his wife Sarah and their nine young children. Millsap uses two greenhouses and three seasonal high tunnels to grow produce year-round. High tunnels are plastic-covered structures that enable farmers to lengthen the growing season by using the sun’s heat to regulate temperature inside. Millsap sells through the Farmers Market of the Ozarks and to 75-100 community supported agriculture, or CSA, customers. In a CSA, people buy shares of the farm, and in return they receive a portion of the harvest when in season. One of Millsap’s high tunnels is a Chinese high tunnel, which he built with funding through a Conservation Innovation Grant from the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Previously, Millsap received financial assistance from NRCS to install a conventional seasonal high tunnel through NRCS’ Environmental Quality Incentives Program. Missouri is home to hundreds of seasonal high tunnels, including nearly 500 funded by NRCS, but Millsap’s Chinese high tunnel is the only one in Missouri, and one of only a few in the United States. Millsap received $20,000 from a $50,000 Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) awarded to the Watershed Committee of the Ozarks to build the Chinese high tunnel, pay for energy renovations in other greenhouses and to establish a grazing system. This grant program helps groups demonstrate innovative approaches to improve soil quality, air quality, and water quality, conserve energy, and enhance wildlife habitat in balance with productive agricultural systems. The committee wanted to demonstrate the benefits of the Chinese high tunnel, which differs from other seasonal high tunnels in that one of the long sides of the 23-by-70-foot structure and both short ends are heavily insulated with concrete and soil. “One of the things the CIG did was improve our efficiency in the high tunnel,” Millsap said. “It is warmer in the morning and warmer in the evening (in the Chinese high tunnel) than in the other greenhouses. But what’s interesting is that midday, it is cooler in there than in the other greenhouses. This thing never spikes. It has a smooth curve, which is better for plants.” Millsap said the different design is popular in China, where energy is expensive and labor is cheap. “I was looking into the future and thinking that energy is not going to get cheaper, so it made sense,” Millsap said. “And this is a teaching farm, so I have the workers.” Millsap’s workers include seven apprentices who are compensated with room, board, a farming education and a stipend. “These are people who seriously want to experience this and see if they want to be farmers,” Millsap said. “We’ve been doing this for seven years. I’ve had 20 apprentices, and seven are still actively involved in agriculture.” The farm also serves as a site for farm tours and other community events, all intended to further the buy-local movement. High tunnels are a cornerstone of USDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative, which coordinates USDA’s work on local and regional food systems.  Since , through NRCS, USDA has provided assistance to help producers construct over 13,000 high tunnels on farms around the country. “We have this great promotion in ‘buy local,’ but that will go away if we can’t meet demand,” Millsap said. “We try to get as many people out to the farm as we can, show them what farming is about, maybe get their hands dirty.” Not raised on a farm, Millsap said he learned to farm by attending conferences, by reading and by visiting with lots of other farmers. He said it was something he found himself called to do. “It’s not something I was looking to do, but sometimes when you are called, you better listen,” he said.

"Northwest Regional Conservationist, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Aug 11,  The Mid-Snake River, near Twin Falls. Water Quality Trading is one way the States of Washington, Oregon and Idaho are working to protect their rivers. Photo courtesy of the Idaho DEQ Twin Falls Regional Office, used with permission. The Pacific Northwest is known for its picturesque lakes, cascading streams and dramatic coastlines. The many rivers of the Pacific Northwest—the Yakima, the Snake, Snohomish, Willamette, Klamath, Boise, and others—are part of the cultural, economic and environmental foundation of the region. These waters are meaningful for local Native American Tribes, agricultural production, industries who rely on water resources, and local communities and tourists from around the world that enjoy fishing and other forms of recreation along Northwestern rivers and streams. It’s no surprise that the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho are interested in protecting their rivers to preserve these values, and the wildlife and ecosystems they’re a part of. More surprising, however, is the innovative way the states are collaborating to do it. Water quality trading allows point sources that directly discharge to water, like wastewater treatment plants, to invest in “green” infrastructure by restoring the watershed’s natural capacity to filter water. For example, instead of installing expensive technology to reduce phosphorous discharges, the treatment plant could pay farmers upstream to plant trees along their fields to reduce the same amount (or more) of phosphorous from reaching the rivers. Water quality trading may create cost savings for regulated sources, supports conservation on working agricultural lands, and generate environmental solutions that have benefits beyond just water quality—including carbon sequestration and wildlife habitat. In , the Willamette Partnership was awarded a $1.5 million Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to help facilitate a conversation with Washington, Oregon, and Idaho to develop multi-state recommendations on water quality trading. The CIG allowed the Willamette Partnership and The Freshwater Trust to convene Washington, Oregon and Idaho state department of environment staff and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 10 to identify common principles and practices to shape consistent approaches to trading in the region, with a focus on how trading could help regulated sources of pollutant discharges meet their discharge limits while providing additional environmental benefits. The effort resulted in a set of joint recommendations for each state to consider as they develop and further their water quality trading programs, with a goal of keeping those programs consistent with the Clean Water Act and state and local water quality laws. The recommendations address the importance of sound science, avoiding local water quality problems, providing evidence that resulting environmental benefits are real, and ensuring that these benefits are echoed in local communities. Today, the three states have committed to testing these principles and an associated set of recommendations through . Following this piloting phase, the states and EPA will discuss their experiences, and if necessary, refine their joint recommendations. The states, in consultation with partners, will decide how or whether to incorporate the joint recommendations into formal policy or guidance on trading. Bobby Cochran, Executive Director for Willamette Partnership noted, “This is a really exciting time for the Northwest. Washington, Oregon, and Idaho thought deeply about how the joint recommendations can help provide some clarity on trading, promote good stewardship, and support clean water for communities and fish.” The joint recommendations put forth by Washington, Oregon and Idaho can serve as an example for the rest of the country on how to establish well thought out trading programs that are built for success. Through CIG projects and other joint efforts, including the EPA – USDA Partnership Agreement to support water quality trading, we can do a better job of protecting water resources we rely on—while benefitting local communities, producers, and the environment.

"U.S. Forest Service, North Carolina in  Forestry  Mar 28,  For six years, U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement Office Jason Crisp and his K-9 partner Maros patrolled the Grandfather Ranger District on the Pisgah National Forest. They were killed during a search for a homicide suspect. (U.S. Forest Service) Law-enforcement peers, U.S. Forest Service employees, dignitaries and friends gathered at the McDowell County High School in Marion, N.C. last week to honor Forest Service law enforcement officer Jason Crisp and his K-9 partner, Maros. Among the memorial service attendees were 75 K-9 officers and their partners who paid tribute to both fallen officers. U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory were among the thousands who filled the school’s gymnasium. Crisp and Maros were shot and killed on March 12 pursuing a suspect who, just hours earlier, had allegedly killed his father and step-mother. As they had so many times before, Crisp and Maros were working to keep the Grandfather Ranger District, Pisgah National Forest, and surrounding area safe. “Jason was happy being with his family, and he was happy serving his community,” the Rev. Charles Dicks said. “He cared about the agency, and he cared about his coworkers.” These were common themes shared by speakers at the ceremony. They described the 38-year-old Crisp as a devoted husband, a loving father of two and a kind-hearted man who helped others. A Forest Service law enforcement officer for eight years, Crisp was a man of strong faith, whose spirituality served as the foundation for how he approached life. He and Maros performed their duties with honor, courage and dignity. One of Jason’s family members shared the following story prior to the ceremony. Honor Guard members begin to fold the U.S. Forest Service and North Carolina State flags during a memorial ceremony for Officer Jason Crisp and his K-9 partner Maros. (Courtesy of Mario Rossilli) “The last time I saw Jason, he came to my house and spent a couple of hours with me; but he was upset at me,” the grieving family member said. “I had recently helped another family member with some house work, and Jason was upset that I didn’t call to ask for his help… That’s the type of person Jason was.” March 12 was Jason’s day off. When he received the call about a murder suspect who was on the loose, he didn’t hesitate to respond. Maros assisted in the call, and it was the last time the two would answer the call of duty. Despite the tragic outcome, the two officers are not separated. Jason was laid to rest on March 17 with Maros’ ashes placed in an urn in his arms. They will be missed by the people who knew and loved them in western North Carolina. Thousands packed into the McDowell County High School to pay tribute to Forest Service Law Enforcement Officer Jason Crisp and his K-9 partner Maros.

"USDA Rural Development Public Information Coordinator in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Dec 26,   USDA Rural Development New Mexico State Director Terry Brunner (center) presents a certificate of obligation to the Ten Southern Pueblo Council Governors and representatives during ceremonies to celebrate the successful application of funds creating the first ever Native American Food Hub in the nation. (USDA Photo) The air was crisp and cold as the wind blew across Sandia Pueblo in mid-December.  But, the atmosphere among the Ten Southern Pueblo Governor’s Council was warm and jovial. Why? Because, the Governors were celebrating the obligation of a USDA Rural Development funded study that creates the first ever Native American Food Hub in the nation. For hundreds of years the residents of the Pueblos in New Mexico have farmed the land to provide the food they ate.  Today, the Native farmers continue to grow corn, squash, beans and other produce for their own consumption.  But often they have abundance of food at the end of every growing season. This successful farming can be a problem because the farmers do not have a mechanism to deliver excess produce to market or those in need.  Food hubs offer a model to provide infrastructure support to farmers usually through a central location where food can be processed and distributed. The Ten Southern Pueblos Council contracted with the Acoma Business Enterprises to serve as the fiscal manager and apply for a Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG) through USDA. The RBEG financial support is funding a study to determine how best to manage the distribution of food produced by native growers through a food hub concept.  Work has begun to identify farmers and their needs to market and deliver the food to a central distribution point.  Once the is collected a plan will be implemented in to make sure the food is provided to the residents of the ten Pueblos and to others needing fresh, healthy produce for their diet.  As well, the Pueblos hope that a successful food hub offers more sustainability to native farmers who wish to make a living through farming.

"Conference Explores Ways to Value Resources, Improve the Environment and Put a Check into Producers' Pockets  What is the monetary value of a supply of clean water?  Or the value of clean air or having places available to hike and fish? For decades we have taken these resources for granted, or at least we have not put a monetary value on their benefits. That’s changing.  Participants from 30 nations met this week at the ACES: A Community on Ecosystem Services; Linking Science, Practice and Decision Making conference to talk about just how we can value these benefits and include that in our decision-making and planning.  As the conference kicked off, U.S. Forest Service Chief Tidwell talked about the need to quantify the benefits of public lands, building consensus and support for a multi-generational outlook, moving away from short term objectives and toward “sustaining the health and diversity of our forests and grasslands.” Participants included a number of other federal officials, including Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, USDA Undersecretary Robert Bonnie, and Jay Jensen of the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ).

"Office of Tribal Relations, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jan 29,  Tim Mentz Sr., Standing Rock Sioux cultural resource expert, explains the historical significance of the area that is now the Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota. (U.S. Forest Service/Fred Clark) Our curiosity was palpable in our expressions, we visitors to this South Dakota field, as we pondered the patterns produced by the tops of rocks pressed into grass and soil, patterns tantalizingly organized and purposeful: shapes of things that have been. What stories were held in this small corner of the Black Hills National Forest? As members of the Forest Service’s sacred sites executive and core teams, our task is to develop ways to fulfill the recommendations from the Report to the Secretary of Agriculture: USDA Policy and Procedures Review and Recommendations: Indian Sacred Sites. Visiting this sacred place was the starting point of our learning and working together as a team. We needed to experience firsthand the feeling and meaning of this place to help us incorporate an appropriate attitude as we started three days of meetings on how to best implement the recommendations, to better protect and provide access to Indian sacred sites. We were guided and educated, at least as much as can be done in just one morning’s time, by Arvol Looking Horse and Tim Mentz Sr. Many years ago, when he was only 12, Looking Horse had been given the enormous responsibility of being the 19th generation Keeper of the Sacred White Buffalo Calf Pipe. He is a spiritual leader for the Lakota Dakota Na-kota Oyate, the great Sioux Nation. Mentz is a cultural resource expert with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. He was their first Tribal historic preservation officer and continues to be an amazing source of information about cultural sites for his Tribe. We learned from tribal elders and Forest Service staff that these stone formations had been misinterpreted several years ago by an archaeologist as teepee rings, or circles of rocks left after having served their purpose of holding down the edges of teepees. The archaeologist had deemed these features as “insignificant” in terms of historical value. The tribal elders explained that these were no teepee rings.  Rather, the stone features were ceremonial shapes, purposefully placed and each with its own sacred reason. Having worked as an archaeologist for some 20 years myself, including having mapped and excavated teepee rings in Montana and Wyoming, I was also aware that these forms were far from the evenly rounded rings I’d seen many times before. They were shapes, but shapes of what? The elders explained how the features are organized, how they relate to the surrounding landscape, the directions, other sites both near and far, and a bit about what each feature’s functions would have been. They pointed out the meaning behind the features and talked about how these places have current and ongoing power. Mentz and his crew mapped the entire site during our visit, and related the physical shapes and functions to hundreds of other sites they had recorded. They talked about how many of these types of sites had already been destroyed by development, and how many are endangered. They showed us the life and significance in the rocks, reinforcing the great need to further protect places like this. While many of the sites being destroyed are on private land, the message was urgent and relates directly to our task of doing a better job within the agency to protect the places held sacred by American Indians and Alaska Natives on national forests and grasslands. Meeting and working with elders like Looking Horse and Mentz and having them share this kind of information, we are better prepared to bring to this work a good mind and a good heart, and better able to affect the shape of things to come.

"Producers get a New Revenue Source, Waterfowl Habitat is Preserved and Industry Benefits from Conservation Effort  Earlier this week, USDA highlighted the creation of a market for carbon credits generated on working grasslands. Landowners benefit because they receive compensation for the carbon credits generated on their lands. They get a new source of revenue, while thriving grasslands provide nesting habitat for wildlife, are more resilient to extreme weather, and help mitigate the impact of climate change. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, recently purchased almost 40,000 carbon dioxide reduction tons generated on working ranch grasslands in the Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. It was the first purchase of its type.  Robert Bonnie, USDA's under secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the purchase and USDA's involvement in the project at an event at USDA headquarters. He was joined by Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Greg Martin, executive director for global public policy, General Motors; Sean Penrith, executive director of The Climate Trust and Paul Schmidt, chief conservation officer of Ducks Unlimited. The under secretary thanked Senator Stabenow, Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, for her staunch support for the program, which she said is delivering “real world measurable results.” Bonnie said he hopes this purchase will set a pattern for future carbon credit sales.

"Public Affairs Officer, National Forests in North Carolina in  Forestry  Jun 06,   National Fishing and Boating Week, a part of the June celebration of Great Outdoors Month, will be celebrated again this year June 2 - 10. It’s a time when fishing fanatics and amateur anglers will visit national forests and grasslands across the country to try their hands at landing the big one. On the National Forests in North Carolina, anglers with physical disabilities who visit the Nantahala, Pisgah, Uwharrie, and Croatan National Forests will have a number of accessible piers to choose from. Some of these piers provide access to premier trout fishing destinations. “For more than 20 years, the National Forests in North Carolina and North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission have been committed to providing anglers of all abilities with the opportunity to go fishing on public lands,” said Sheryl Bryan, the forests’ fisheries and wildlife biologist. Some of these piers provide access to premier trout fishing destinations. “During this time, forest and district biologists, engineers, landscape architects and recreation proponents have worked together to create a comprehensive network of accessible fishing opportunities across a diversity or resources,” added Delce Dyer, the forests’ developed recreation program manager. Today, there are close to 20 barrier-free fishing piers in the four national forests. Through careful planning, design and construction -- in partnership with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission -- accessible fishing facilities have been constructed from the mountains to the sea. The facilities provide fishing opportunities in warm-water reservoirs and small ponds, as well as cold-water streams and rivers. “Designs of fishing piers that extend over waterways have been refined over the years and have been adopted for use by the Wildlife Resources Commission throughout the state,” said Lynn Hicks, engineer and heritage and recreation staff officer. ”Site-specific designs have provided accessible parking and routes to these water-based sites, and most of the fishing piers include areas for both seated and standing fishing.” Recent piers include a metal mesh water-viewing component into a portion of the pier’s flooring. Accessible facilities on majestic Cherokee Lake in Nantahala National Forest include picnic tables and a pavilion, all connected along an accessible route. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service photo In addition to tourists, a number of local residents regularly use the accessible piers. In many communities, the piers have become centers for frequent outdoor recreation. For example, Boone Fork Pond pier, near the communities of Lenoir and Hudson, is commonly used as an outdoor destination for the mentally and physically challenged. Chapters of Wounded Warriors have assisted with projects, particularly on the Croatan National Forest. Other partners who have provided funding or assistance in constructing these facilities include Trout Unlimited, the Muskie Club, and Bass Anglers Sportsmen Society. The two piers near Robbinsville -- one on a small pond, the other on Santeetlah Lake -- provide community fishing opportunities. Many of these accessible fishing facilities are used during National Fishing Week activities, including sites for Special Needs Fishing Days. Great Outdoors Month is a time for all Americans to get outside and take part in a number of national events that encourage people to hike, fish, boat and/or camp at locations all across the country.  June 9 is also a fee free day for public lands including national forests.  So join friends and family and take time to celebrate our national heritage and enjoy the wonders of our national landscape.

"Program Analyst, USDA Office of Environmental Markets, Office of the Chief Economist in  Conservation  Dec 16,  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack speaking at a press conference in Fairfax, VA. USDA photo by David Kosling. USDA has a long history of helping farmers, ranchers and forest landowners maintain their bottom line while improving soil health and reducing runoff into streams and rivers.  For nearly 80 years, USDA has offered funding and technical assistance for farmers to implement conservation practices through the conservation title of the Farm Bill. In recent years, however, USDA has also supported new, innovative approaches to voluntary, private lands conservation. An announcement today by USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, and Administrator Gina McCarthy of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in northern Virginia highlights an innovative approach called water quality trading. Farmers like John Harrison of Appomattox County are taking advantage of private investments to implement conservation practices on their land. These practices help reduce erosion and nutrient runoff into local bodies of water, generating nutrient credits that can then be sold to regulated entities looking to offset nutrient losses for compliance purposes. In this case, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) purchased phosphorous credits to offset water quality impacts from road construction. The offset credits have permitted the completion of more than 40 small road construction projects that improve traffic safety and flow by adding turn lanes, clover leafs, and small connectors, and repairing approaches to aging bridges. Compared to traditional engineered practices, the offset credits provide greater water quality benefits for up to half of the costs of installation and long-term maintenance. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack (left) participates in a press conference with Commonwealth of Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.

Mr. Harrison appears in a USDA video explaining the project and the benefits realized on his farm. The project was the result of collaboration between the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, with support from USDA, the Federal Highway Administration and EPA.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Colorado in  Conservation  Mar 31,  The Southwestern willow flycatcher is an endangered bird that lives in the riparian areas of the Southwest. Photo courtesy of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The distinctive “fitz-bew” of the Southwestern willow flycatchers is music to the ears of the partners of Wetland Dynamics, LLC, and USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) recently improved the ability to hear them. Wetland Dynamics received a $60,000 Conservation Innovation Grant from NRCS in to develop innovative technology for monitoring the endangered flycatcher and two other imperiled species in Colorado’s San Luis Valley. “What we’re doing is innovative,” said Jenny Nehring, a biologist and partner at Wetland Dynamics. “The technology we’re using has been around for quite some time. But with the partnership now forged with NRCS, we are able to expand and improve our innovative techniques that build upon existing tools, which will in turn help to better understand certain wildlife species and improve protection of them.” Wetland Dynamics is expanding and exploring the use of a passive acoustic monitoring technology traditionally used to monitor bats and aquatic species like whales. The company is using this innovative technology to improve detection and monitoring of the Southwestern willow flycatcher, Western yellow-billed cuckoo and Northern leopard frog. The flycatcher, cuckoo and leopard frog are currently being monitored, but the widely used approach takes substantial labor and stresses birds. By recording the birds’ noises, Wetland Dynamics is able to study the endangered Southwestern willow flycatcher. Photo courtesy of Wetland Dynamics. “It requires an observer in the field broadcasting the call of the bird to illicit a response from a bird on a territory,” Nehring said. “This method is intrusive and tricks the birds into thinking its territory is being threatened or infringed upon. Birds will, of course, react, but this reaction is stressful and energetically costly to already threatened and endangered species.” The new way of monitoring, funded by the grant from NRCS, eliminates the stress on the bird while expanding the information gathered. It relies on passive recording equipment. Because the devices can be stationed for prolonged periods of time, the consistency and quantity of information gathered will provide increased detection of species.  These more accurate detections will allow more focused and precise research on other things such as breeding success and habitat use. Between observer bias and influences like weather, which might prevent an observer from even reaching a monitoring site, the margin for error within the typical call play back monitoring method is high. A grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is enabling Wetland Dynamics to expand its monitoring efforts of the Southwestern willow flycatcher and other at-risk species of the riparian habitat. Photo courtesy of Wetland Dynamics. “Our recorders are stationary devices, can be set up for weeks and have limited disturbance. Recordings are then scanned to detect the vocalization of interest and to differentiate varying vocalizations like birds that are close or far away.” Although this technology is promising and is quite significant for future monitoring of species in areas, it cannot determine the number of species in a particular area. “But it can detect if the bird is present which will help researchers focus their on-the-ground field work to determine territory size, breeding effort and success as well as habitat condition,” she said. “More work is clearly needed and that’s why the CIG grant was so important.  It allows us to refine and test the technology and quantify perimeters for accuracy. We greatly value our partnership with NRCS and hope it grows so that other monitoring opportunities can be explored.” Conservation Innovation Grants aim to stimulate the development and adoption of innovative conservation approaches and technologies. This is one of NRCS’ many investments in the Southwest to help the flycatcher and other species. NRCS announced Monday its plans to broaden the conservation opportunities available to producers.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Earth Team Volunteer in  Conservation  Jun 17,  Honeybees leaving and returning to the hive after collecting pollen. Photo: Ashton Ebarb. “They’re in a happy mood today,” Jim Pratt, a local apiarist, said. At a comfortable 62 degrees, honeybees buzz with a clear objective: collect nectar and pollen, for honey and pollination. “Pollinators, like honeybees, support food crops,” Pratt said, explaining why for 20 years he’s raised honeybees. Pratt’s Farm annually produces about 120 pounds of honey per colony. He maintains 100 colonies, collecting honey from them each spring, summer and fall. During the winter, the bees eat stored honey until warmer weather arrives. Honeybees, like all pollinators, face challenges. Lack of habitat is the number one local threat Pratt sees to pollinators. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) works with farmers, ranchers and forest landowners to implement conservation practices on the ground that have numerous environmental benefits, including ones that provide habitat and food for pollinators. “Much of our local land is managed pastures,” Pratt said. Pastures provide benefits in various forms of agriculture, yet there are times between seasons when nothing is grown to attract pollinators across vast measures of land. “As a beekeeper, I seek out managed pastures over-seeded with clover. Placing colonies of honeybees in and around the pastures benefits not only the beekeeper with the potential of premium grade honey, but also benefits the landowner by sustaining the clover population as a result of the necessary pollination by the bees.” With NRCS’ Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), landowners can offset the cost of over-seeding clovers in their pastures and adjacent tracts specifically for pollinator species. “Pastures over-seeded with clover provide benefits in various forms of agriculture,” Pratt explained. “First, pollinators of all types are attracted to it. Second, clover replenishes nitrogen in the soil which better supports livestock forage.”  Since clovers are a cool-season legume, and usually die-back with the onset of mid-Summer, Pratt looks for tracts of land with natural habitat, such as wildlife refuges, conservation reserves and pollinator plantings adjacent to the pastures for nectar and pollen sources after the clover has died. Pollinators need nearby habitats which is vital to sustaining their populations. People need pollinators, too. No matter the pollinator, whether bee, bird, beetle, butterfly, bat or any other, all contribute to our food supply by pollination. “90 percent of fruits and vegetables are not self-pollinating,” said Janice Hutton, horticulturalist with The Sabine River Authority in Sabine Parish, Louisiana. Fruits and vegetables almost entirely depend upon pollinators. Every living person and thing that depends on fruits and vegetables depends on pollinators too. The good news: helping pollinators achieve their goal is as simple as growing certain plants. “I have to know what blooms, when it blooms and whether each colony has enough worker bees to collect nectar and pollen,” said Pratt. This week, USDA is celebrating National Pollinator Week by highlighting the many ways in which conservation benefits pollinators. Through the Farm Bill, landowners have an opportunity to receive financial assistance through conservation programs and practices, which includes planting cover crops to target these beneficial pollinators.

"Media Relations Officer, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Mar 08,   The Forest Service has added an iPhone/iPad application called Invasive Plants in Southern Forests: Identification and Management to its strategy of reducing nonnative invasive plants in the South. The free app will allow more people to get involved in eradicating foreign plants, which, along with nonnative animals and pathogens, harm water supplies.  They also harm native plants, wildlife, livestock and property in both rural and urban areas at a cost of about $138 billion annually. Using Forest Service funding and research, the University of Georgia Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health created the software from the Southern Research Station publications A Field Guide for the Identification of Invasive Plants in Southern Forests and A Management Guide for Invasive Plants in Southern Forests. The U.S. Forest Service is a leading agency working to reduce the impact of the hundreds of invasive plants threatening public and private lands. The application was funded by a grant from the Forest Service Southern Research Station’s Insects, Diseases and Invasive Plants unit. The software provides photos and information that allow users to identify the 56 nonnative plants and plant groups currently invading 13 Southern states. “Ultimately we hope this app will give people a new tool to go out and identify invasive plants and map their occurrence,” said Southern Research Station Research Ecologist James Miller, who co-authored the application’s source guides. “Effective control relies on understanding of species and how they spread across the landscape. Those are important first steps in stopping and containing the invasions of harmful nonnative plants.” Like the publications it was developed from, the app divides nonnative invasive plants into trees, shrubs, vines, grasses, ferns and forbs, and provides identification keys, photos and management recommendations. The app also gives users simple, on-the-spot options for treating invasive plants. Future versions of the application will include the ability to directly report new sightings of select species into the Georgia Center’s Early Detection and Distribution Mapping System (EDDMapS), which provides a quick way to submit photos and report new sightings of invasive plants on the spot throughout the United States.

"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication in  Forestry  Research and Science  May 22,  During April and May ramps are often served in restaurants in the eastern U.S. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. To many of locals in western North Carolina, they’re called wild leeks.  Some call them ransoms and still others call them wood garlic because of their pungent smell. Nevertheless, ecologists simply call them ramps. This native plant has been useful to humans since inhabiting the eastern regions of the U.S. and Canada.  Still today, locals harvest ramps for food, medicinal preparations, and to sell at markets and spring festivals. U.S. Forest Service scientist Joan Walker has been monitoring populations of ramps in the mountain coves of western North Carolina for 11 years. The results of her research show that although abundance can vary from year to year, about a quarter of the plots had decreasing ramps cover. “All of the plots that showed a decrease were where harvesting disturbance was high,” said Walker who is based out of the agency’s Southern Research Station. “Also, harvested plots as a group have reduced ramps populations compared to undisturbed ones.” These results suggest that it may be time to re-examine the current harvest policy and perhaps take corrective measures to ensure the species will be available for future generations of Americans. In the Southern Appalachians, many prime sites for harvesting ramps are within national forest boundaries. The National Forest System is responsible for maintaining biological diversity to sustain valuable ecosystem services such as clean air and water, healthy soil, abundant wood, recreational opportunities and other forest-based commodities that include herbs and edible plants. Ramps are among the first ephemeral greens to emerge during the spring months of March and April. With their electric green leaves, plump, white bulb and distinct odor, ramps are easy to distinguish from other early growers. After a hard winter in the mountains with food stores running low, this green “manna” would have literally been a life saver to both Native Americans and settlers living throughout the region in years past. Concerns about harvesting effects in the southern range (northern Georgia and Alabama and western North Carolina) prompted Walker’s monitoring study in two areas of the Nantahala National Forest in western North Carolina. The goal of the project is to track the populations over time and to determine if trends are related to local harvesting, weather, or even changing climate. The monitoring study consists of 25 plots distributed between 3,500 feet to just over 5,000 feet in elevation.

Besides providing food and habitat for manatees, sea turtles, shellfish, and other animals, seagrasses protect coasts from erosion and store vast quantities of carbon dioxide. “Seagrasses grow off the coast of many other U.S. states, including North Carolina and Virginia, as well as around the world,” said U.S. Forest Service Southern Research Station scientist Zanethia Choice. “Globally, their economic value is nearly $4 trillion.” Although more closely related to lilies than to terrestrial grasses, like most of their distant grass kin, seagrasses require plenty of sunlight. Poor water quality reduces the amount of sunlight that reaches them, and seagrasses around the world are threatened by practices that affect water quality such as wastewater disposal and fertilizer runoff. Choice, a natural resource specialist at the research center’s Center for Bottomland Hardwoods Research, and her colleagues from the University of Florida recently studied light requirements for four common seagrass species along the Florida Gulf Coast. The study was published in the Marine Pollution Bulletin. “We found a direct relationship between the amount of light reaching the ocean floor and the amount and diversity of seagrasses growing there,” said Choice. In 90 percent of sites where 13 years of historic showed that adequate sunlight had been reaching the ocean floor, researchers found thriving seagrass meadows. However, areas with suitable light but no seagrass were most likely due to unsuitable substrate, temperature, and the amounts of dissolved salts and oxygen. Seagrasses are adapted to nutrient-poor waters. When nutrients – whether from fertilizer runoff, wastewater disposal, or other human activities – wash into the ocean, they float suspended in the ocean waters. Seagrasses cannot use these suspended nutrients very efficiently, but tiny algae called phytoplankton can. Phytoplankton thrive in nutrient-rich waters, and as they grow, they intercept light and shade the ocean floor. Seagrasses were notably absent from areas with high nutrient levels. Some seagrasses such as star grass could survive with as little as 8 percent of sunlight reaching the ocean floor, while other species 25 percent sunlight or more. “Light requirements for all the seagrasses we studied differed from previous findings at other locations,” said Choice. “The differences are probably due to morphological and physiological differences, and adaptation to light histories at specific locations.” Understanding the light requirements of different seagrass species is essential for coastal managers who want to maintain seagrass habitats, and managing for seagrass health also provides water quality targets that can benefit other marine life.

"Public Affairs Specialist, NRCS California in  Conservation  Jul 28,  A planning meeting with Freitas at the Redding Service Center.  Shasta County landowner Karen Freitas has worked with the staff of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) since , when she sought help recovering from a devastating wild fire that had burned much of her 160-acre tree farm the previous summer. Helping agricultural producers recover after a natural disaster is fairly routine work for NRCS, and the Redding office, where Freitas went for assistance, was no different. But what was unusual for these NRCS employees is that Freitas is deaf—presenting an unusual opportunity for client assistance. Freitas approached the Redding NRCS office initially for assistance rebuilding her operation, and District Conservationist Bob Bailey was able to help her put together a conservation plan and an application for cost-share funding through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Conservation work implemented under the first contract she signed with NRCS covered water control structures, brush management, critical area plantings, fuel breaks, tree and shrub establishment, forest site preparation, forest stand improvement and access road work. More recently, Freitas has been working with NRCS to develop a forest management plan on her property. District Conservationist Bob Bailey, Karen Freitas and Forester Jeff Webster working on a forest management plan with the assistance of a sign language interpreter.  Initially it seemed there might be some communication challenges in working with a hearing-impaired client, especially in some of the more technical aspects of the work. Freitas was the first deaf client NRCS California’s Redding office had ever helped. But the office contracted for professional sign language interpretative services, with excellent results. Since then, District Conservationist Bailey has used an interpreter several times to facilitate communications between Freitas and NRCS staff during planning meetings and implementation of projects in the field. “Using an interpreter has worked out great,” Bailey says. “I feel a sense of satisfaction that I was able to assist Mrs. Freitas with her forest management objectives. She is one of the hardest working clients I have, and she takes great satisfaction in the conservation projects she completes.” NRCS often works with clients to meet their communication needs, relying not only on American Sign Language interpreters, but also interpreters for non-hearing impaired landowners and land managers whose first language is not English. A sign language interpreter facilitates communication as Bob Bailey explains how soil erosion concerns on an access road might be addressed.  In addition, USDA has many department-wide provisions to ensure equal access to services for traditionally underserved groups such as women and black farmers, low-income farmers, and Tribes.

"Web Communications Intern in  USDA Results  Initiatives  Energy  Forestry  Sep 16,  Rick Huszagh and Crista Carrell, Down to Earth Energy, Georgia Cross posted from the White House Rural Champions of Change website: When Rick Huszagh and Crista Carrell purchased part of her family’s farm in , their focus was on farmland preservation as much as the creation of a successful business enterprise. Mountain Creek Farm started out selling Boer goats to purebred and commercial breeders and bermuda hay to neighboring horse farms. Goat kids were raised each spring to sell for breeding stock or meat.  The couple improved their farm marketing by participating in shows, performance tests, and field days.  The farm’s proximity to the University of Georgia facilitated their involvement in herd management studies related to the control of internal parasites. They took full advantage of resources offered by the Cooperative Extension Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and participated in the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Rick and Crista’s interest in sustainability issues on the farm led them to research and implement small-scale biodiesel production for the tractors in . In , they intensified their renewable energy involvement when they were awarded a Renewable Energy for America Program (REAP) grant and USDA guaranteed loan. Along with like-minded partners, they established Down to Earth Energy, a commercial biodiesel production facility located adjacent to the farm. Concern with some of the inefficiencies in the biodiesel process led them to partner with the University of Georgia to develop a more effective catalyst.  The concept was further funded by an EPA Small Business Innovation Research Grant (SBIR) and a Venturelab grant. Crista was appointed a Walton County Soil and Water Conservation District Supervisor in . She has spearheaded the district’s sponsorship of community forestry activities in Monroe and served as the coordinator of Atha Road Elementary School’s outdoor classroom from -.

"Forest Service Research & Development in  Conservation  Forestry  Research and Science  Mar 03,  Kellie Carim, eDNA coordinator for the Genomics Center, collects and processes samples. (Photos by Michael Schwartz (left) and Katie Zarn, U.S. Forest Service) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research profile. The U.S. Forest Service has a long history as a leader in conservation genetics, and this recently took an exciting step forward with the launch of the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation. The Forest Service’s wildlife genetics lab, which has been central to the Rocky Mountain Research Station’s conservation genetics program since , has been reorganized and renamed to better reflect the scope of its work nationwide. The Center is a leading edge facility for advanced genomics research, nationally recognized, and works extensively with states, tribes, universities and private groups to address the management issues of over 60 fish and wildlife species.  collected by the Center will support the new Forest Service Forest Planning Rule with timely and cost-effective information on wildlife and fish species. Information developed by the Center will be made available through the network of USDA Climate Hubs to assist private forestland managers, farmers and ranchers in reaching their conservation goals. With state-of-the-art technology and the development of new tools and techniques, the main objective of the Center is to provide cost-effective and reliable genomic for improved species monitoring. By having more robust information, state and federal managers are better able to evaluate the genetic health and population viability of fish and wildlife species across the landscape. The discovery of a new fish species and the detection of invasive species are among the Center’s many contributions to the advancement of science and management. Imagine an expansive landscape, filled with different and remote terrain, and being asked to determine if the area has been impacted by a new invasive species. This is a daunting challenge that land managers face on a regular basis. One of the Center’s specialties, analyzing samples of environmental DNA, or eDNA, shows great promise in addressing this challenge. This type of DNA has been separated from organisms into the surrounding environment and can be found in soil, water and air. Forest Service scientists are developing ways to determine what species are present by simply sampling a cup of water from locations across the landscape. “eDNA is a highly sensitive method for detecting organisms in low abundance and is generally faster and extremely cost effective compared to traditional methods used to detect exotic or endangered species,” said Dr. Michael Schwartz, director of the center. The use of eDNA is an innovative approach to inventorying and monitoring fish and wildlife species. eDNA is particularly effective for detecting rare species that can be difficult to sample using traditional methods. For example, researchers at the Rocky Mountain Research Station have been working with partners and collaborators on the threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) since . Bull trout is a culturally significant species to several Tribes in the Northwest and Columbia River Basin. It is also a prized game fish, and land management and recreational angling are significantly influenced by whether or not this species is present in a given watershed. This species is particularly sensitive to changes in habitat and is also threatened by the introduction of the nonnative brook trout (S. fontinalis). Forest Service scientists have developed sampling methods to make eDNA surveys a reliable and accessible option for managers to detect the presence of bull trout and their invasive competitor, brook trout. Forest Service scientists continue to develop eDNA techniques for detecting priority fish and wildlife.  eDNA is just one method of non-invasive genetic sampling, which uses forensic-style DNA samples to monitor rare and sensitive species, employed by the Center.

This year’s tagline, Learn, Play, and Volunteer, emphasizes connecting people with the natural world through education and recreation as well as volunteerism, and partnerships forming around this year’s events embody NPLD’s expanding scope. The focus is Every Kid in a Park: a multi-agency effort to connect fourth-graders with their public lands through educational events and year-long free passes to national forests and parks. For Carmen Young, the Forest Service Public Lands Day lead, it’s a labor of love. ""It was so great seeing all the kids playing outside, learning about how water comes from forests and gets to our faucets, and contributing to water monitoring efforts in the D.C. area,” said Young. This year’s events are already in the works: from trail clearing to citizen science, there’s something for everyone. National Public Lands Day runs from Sept. 1-Oct. 10 on Forest Service sites all over America.

"Hoosier National Forest in  May 13,  Bedford, Ind., May 5, -- A group of Hoosier National Forest employees plant chestnut trees in a timber sale area of the Hoosier to return the American chestnut to its native range (Photo Credit: US Forest Service). Once a prominent phenomenon in southern Indiana, Bedford just experienced the first re-planting of American chestnut trees on the Hoosier National Forest in partnership with Purdue University and the U.S. Forest Service’s Northern Research Station. “Historically, the American chestnut was once one of the most important trees in the eastern United States, occupying about 25 percent of the hardwood canopy in eastern forests,” said David Cleaves, climate change advisor for the Forest Service. The trees grew to be 80 feet tall or more, and were known as ‘the redwood of the East.’  By the s, the tree was nearly wiped out by an Asian fungus known as chestnut blight.  The restoration of American chestnut to eastern forests depends on the development of blight-resistant seedlings. The Forest Service, American Chestnut Foundation, and the University of Tennessee have been conducting research and tests to produce a blight-resistant American chestnut, with aspirations of restoring the species in its grandeur. Bedford, Ind., May 5, -- Forest Botanist Kirk Larson (foreground) plants an American chestnut tree on the Hoosier National Forest to return the American chestnut to its native range (Photo Credit: US Forest Service).  A traditional back-cross breeding method is being used to create blight-resistant American chestnut seedlings, which are 94 percent American chestnut and 6 percent Chinese chestnut --- and are blight resistant. The restoration effort began when the American Chestnut Restoration Project partners planted seedlings in three national forests in Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina in early . Scientists say the seedlings are surpassing expectations of survival and they are cautiously optimistic. A full decade will need to pass before massive replanting begins.  But the trees will be given every opportunity to do well. They were planted in a fenced enclosure to keep out deer and minimize damage from wildlife, and herbicides will be applied as needed to control undesirable competition. The fenced enclosure was built with help from fire crews from the Ottawa and White Mountain National Forests as well as Hoosier employees.  Ron Doyle planted the first blight-resistant American chestnut on the Hoosier National Forest, unofficially in honor of his father -- a long-time member of the American Chestnut Foundation. His father, now in a nursing home, was very pleased to hear the trees were returning to Indiana. Another Indiana site will be planted in .

"Manager, USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline in  Health and Safety  May 25,  Cook pork, roasts, and chops to 145 ºF as measured with a food thermometer, then allow the meat to rest for three minutes before carving or consuming. Cross posted from the FoodSafety.gov blog:  On May 24, USDA made some important changes in their recommended cooking temperatures for meats. Here’s what you need to know: Cooking Whole Cuts of Pork: USDA has lowered the recommended safe cooking temperature for whole cuts of pork from 160 ºF to 145 ºF with the addition of a three-minute rest time. Cook pork, roasts, and chops to 145 ºF as measured with a food thermometer before removing meat from the heat source, with a three-minute rest time before carving or consuming. This will result in a product that is both safe and at its best quality—juicy and tender. Cooking Whole Cuts of Other Meats: For beef, veal, and lamb cuts, the safe temperature remains unchanged at 145 ºF, but the department has added a three-minute rest time as part of its cooking recommendations. What Cooking Temperatures Didn’t Change? Ground Meats: This change does not apply to ground meats, including beef, veal, lamb, and pork, which should be cooked to 160 ºF and do not require a rest time. Poultry: The safe cooking temperature for all poultry products, including ground chicken and turkey, stays the same at 165 ºF. What Is Rest Time?  “Rest time” is the amount of time the product remains at the final temperature, after it has been removed from a grill, oven or other heat source. During the three minutes after meat is removed the heat source, its temperature remains constant or continues to rise, which destroys harmful bacteria. Why Did the Recommendations Change? It’s just as safe to cook cuts of pork to 145 º F with a three-minute rest time as it is to cook them to 160 ºF, the previously recommended temperature, with no rest time. The new cooking recommendations reflect the same standards that the agency uses for cooked meat products produced in federally inspected meat establishments, which rely on the rest time of three minutes to achieve a safe product. Having a single time and temperature combination for all meat will help consumers remember the temperature at which they can be sure the meat is safe to eat. How Do You Use a Food Thermometer? Place the food thermometer in the thickest part of the food. It should not touch bone, fat, or gristle. Start checking the temperature toward the end of cooking, but before you expect it to be done. Be sure to clean your food thermometer with hot soapy water before and after each use. To see where to place a food thermometer in different cuts of meat, see Thermometer Placement and Temperatures. For more information on cooking temperatures for all types of food, see the Safe Minimum Cooking Temperatures chart. If you have questions about cooking meat, feel free to contact us at the Hotline or online at Ask USDA.

"Under Secretary, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  May 21,   I had the distinct pleasure of visiting the birthplace of former Agriculture Secretary Henry A. Wallace during a recent trip to Iowa.  In fact, my tour of the farm near Orient in south central Iowa happened to be May 15, the day the USDA celebrated its 150th anniversary. Wallace was Secretary of the Agriculture from March 4, until September 4, .  He served as Vice President of the United States from to under President Franklin D. Roosevelt and was also Secretary of Commerce from to . Wallace is perhaps the 20th Century’s most well-known Ag Secretary and his accomplishments are monumental. The Wallace Centers of Iowa. Henry A. Wallace was born in Iowa and went on to serve as Vice President and as cabinet secretary of two departments, including USDA. He helped guide the creation of the Farm Security Administration, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and the Rural Electrification Administration (REA). USDA Rural Development, the mission area that I lead, traces its roots back to the REA. Food stamps (now the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP) and the school lunch programs were also started during Wallace’s time as Ag Secretary. Wallace was also dedicated to research and science. The USDA’s research center in Beltsville, Maryland, became the largest and most varied scientific research station in the world during his time as Secretary. My visit to Wallace’s birthplace also served another purpose as the Wallace Centers of Iowa recently received a $50,ep at a Time. This program is helping farmers in southwest Iowa add value to the fruit and vegetable they harvest by providing guidance and training on such things as food safety protocols, recipe development and testing and product placement. More and more people want to know where their food is coming from and are requesting locally grown foods. They also recognize the importance of supporting local producers and local economies. Agriculture Under Secretary for Rural Development speaks about the Department's 150th anniversary during an event at the Wallace Country Life Center I want to thank Diane Weiland and all her wonderful staff for such a great time at the Henry A. Wallace Country Life Center. It was a tremendous way to celebrate the 150th anniversary. Throughout , USDA will continue to commemorate the positive impacts the department has on the life of Americans each day.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Dec 01,  BAC!®, the Discovery Zone’s “green bacteria” mascot greets Metropolitan Cooking and Entertaining Show attendees as they line up to tour the interactive and educational Food Safety Discovery Zone.  Last month, thousands of foodies packed into the Washington Convention Center for the Metropolitan Cooking and Entertaining Show to gain culinary wisdom from like Paula Deen, Guy Fieri, Giada De Laurentiis, and… the USDA Food Safety Discovery Zone. Among the live demonstrations and more than 300 vendors, there consistently was a line of people waiting for a tour of the Food Safety Discovery Zone. Chefs and guests alike remarked about the 40-foot long yellow truck’s uniqueness, and everyone who toured the interactive exhibit learned something new. A favorite game among visitors was trying to guess which of two identical-looking burgers had been cooked to 160 °F and was safe to eat. Using a food thermometer to check their answer, many were shocked to see that they had guessed wrong! As they exited the Discovery Zone, people grabbed free copies of the Kitchen Companion handbook, keychains with food safety reminders, and food thermometers. One couple returned to the Discovery Zone late in the afternoon to report their shock that a vendor touched raw meat and then served them a cooked sample without washing his hands. “Really? Well, it’s good that you noticed!  It’s scary, right? It’s so easy to get sick if people don’t follow our recommendations,” Discovery Zone staffer Eileen Dykes told them, smiling. “You now know what you can do to protect yourselves and your loved ones!” BAC!®, the Discovery Zone’s “green bacteria” costumed mascot posed for pictures with younger visitors. Appealing to foodies of all ages, the Discovery Zone staff made a big impression on the Metropolitan Cooking and Entertaining Show’s attendees and showed them how they can protect themselves and their families from foodborne illness.

"Technical Information Specialist, USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline in  Health and Safety  Mar 25,  Food safety is a key ingredient for a successful meal. Visit FoodSafety.gov for more information on the four key food safety steps: clean, separate, cook and chill. Ahh, Spring! This week, a new season is getting a nice kick-off with Passover and Easter holidays. These celebrations are filled with traditional meals that have unique food safety considerations that may or may not be included in the family recipe book. The USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline has some food safety tips and steps here that, if added to your favorite recipes, can reduce the risk of food poisoning.  As with any food preparation, always remember to Clean, Separate, Cook, and Chill. Before preparing any meal, wash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds, and clean surfaces and utensils with hot soapy water before and after handling raw food. Perishable food should not be left out for more than two hours at room temperature, so check the time at your gathering and make sure either to get food back in the refrigerator or to discard it. Refrigerated leftovers for all foods in this blog should be used within four days.  Beef Brisket: One reason that it’s an excellent choice for entertaining is that it can be prepared in advance. In fact, you must prepare it in advance and cook it slowly to make it tender. Also, because it can be cooked ahead of time and it reheats well, brisket is a great cut of meat to serve to large groups.  Follow these food safety tips for cooking and serving brisket: Be sure to allow plenty of time to thaw a frozen brisket. Thawing in the refrigerator can take about 24 hours for a trimmed, first-cut brisket. A whole brisket weighing about 10 pounds can take several days. Keep raw meat refrigerated at 40 ˚F or below until ready to cook. Place the meat on a plate or container to hold the juices that can drip on other foods to prevent cross-contamination. Bake the brisket, fat side up in a baking dish, in an oven set no lower than 325 ˚F. The brisket is safe to eat when it reaches an internal temperature of 145 °F and is allowed to rest at that temperature for three minutes. Use a food thermometer to be sure. For personal preferences, consumers may choose to cook the brisket longer for tenderness. If reheating brisket before serving, remember to reheat to 165 °F.To serve brisket cold, keep it at 40 °F or below by nesting dishes in beds of ice, or use small servings platters and replace them often. Ham: There are many kinds of hams on the market, but your family likely is purchasing a fully cooked ham. Here are tips for storing and serving a fully cooked ham: When buying a ham, look for the USDA or State Mark of Inspection.  Refrigerate the ham at 40 ˚F or below immediately after arriving home. These hams are best served cold. However, if you want to reheat them, set the oven at 325 ˚F and heat to an internal temperature of 140 °F as measured with a food thermometer. If the ham was repackaged at your butcher shop or grocer, reheat it to 165 °F. Individual slices may also be warmed in a skillet or microwave. Deviled Eggs: Follow these food safety tips below for making an egg dish such as deviled eggs. Remember, eggs are perishable just like raw meat, poultry, and fish, and could contain pathogens. Our virtual food safety expert, Ask Karen, has helpful instructions on how to boil eggs. After cooking the eggs, it is a good idea to keep the whites refrigerated while preparing the filling. Keep deviled eggs chilled until you are ready to serve. Eggs should not stay at room temperature for more than 2 hours. Use a cooler with ice when transporting to another location.

USDA photo by Bob Nichols. Fifty years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Economic Opportunity Act.  This Act, part of the government effort to wipe out poverty, created the Job Corps program, which has had a positive effect on countless young lives, giving them a chance to break multi-generational cycles of poverty, get an education, and find jobs in the federal and private sectors, and in the military.  The U.S. Forest Service works closely with the Department of Labor to operate Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers (Job Corps CCCs) around the country. Last week, dignitaries including Deputy Under Secretary Butch Blazer, Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell, and Tina Terrell, Forest Service National Director of the Job Corps, along with colleagues from the Department of Labor, came together in Washington at USDA’s Whitten Building to mark the anniversary. As Chief of Staff for Natural Resources and Environment here at USDA, I am a passionate advocate for this program. Not only does it change families, it allows students to practice conservation on public lands and it also creates a trained group of firefighters to battle wildfire. In the previous two fiscal years, Job Corps CCC students accomplished more than 500,000 hours of service work on public lands. This year, we connected nearly 1,500 of our Job Corps students to training opportunities as part of the 21st Century Conservation Service Corps . In addition to work on public lands, Job Corps CCC students also work on projects that contribute to their local community. During the anniversary event, Deputy Under Secretary Butch Blazer, who grew up on the Mescalero Apache Reservation in New Mexico, spoke of the profound difference that was made when one of America’s first Job Corps centers came to his reservation. “We learned a lot, and it added to the diversity of our community.” He talked about how the Center and others like it produced success and gave students hope for the future. Chief Tidwell thanked everyone, but especially the students, past and present. He acknowledged the partnership forged with the U.S. Department of Labor and commented that during the summer of passage of the Economic Opportunity Act, the Wilderness Act and the Civil Rights Act made history in America.  As important as the last 50 years have been, the Chief said, this is “a moment in history, a time to reflect and celebrate, but also a time to dream of what is next.” National Director Tina Terrell, born in Philadelphia, said that the Job Corps allows students access to the path she took, going from a life where all she knew about trees was “that they were in my back yard” to a fulfilling career with the Forest Service. “The future is up to you,” she said, “Culinary arts, Rural Development, Farm Service Agency, or an avenue for you if you want to work in the Forest Service.” She said it best: “After 50 years, it is all about love of nature, love of the land, and helping young folks. Fifty years down, and now on to the next 50.”  Category/Topic:  Conservation  Forestry  Tags:  21st Century Conservation Service Corps  Butch Blazer  Conservation  Department of Labor  economic opportunity  Forestry  FS  Job Corps  Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers  New Mexico  NRE  President Johnson  Tom Tidwell  Washington DC","What impact has the Job Corps program had on young Americans, particularly in terms of breaking multi-generational cycles of poverty and providing career training opportunities?","The Job Corps program has had a positive effect on countless young lives, giving them a chance to break multi-generational cycles of poverty, get an education, and find jobs in the federal and private sectors, and in the military.

"Thanksgiving Is a Great Time to Start Reducing Food Waste with Friends & Family  Thanksgiving is a time to appreciate all that is good in our lives and to spend it in the company of friends and family while enjoying great food.  It is also a time to reflect on the bounty of our food supply.  Each year, as I put away the leftovers from my Thanksgiving dinner, I marvel at the abundance. I also can’t avoid pausing to consider how much food is wasted in this country. USDA estimates that on average, American consumers waste about one-fifth of food that is available to them, equivalent to about $371 per person annually.  That’s enough money to buy about 21 whole turkeys for each person in the country.  Dr. Elise Golan, USDA Food Waste Challenge Team  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Nov 24,   1 Response","What is the estimated amount of money wasted on food per person annually in the US, equivalent to how many whole turkeys could be purchased with that amount?","$371 per person annually, which is enough to buy about 21 whole turkeys."
"Philly Market Rises Up to Meet Hunger Challenge  Did you know that nearly one-third of the food available to U.S. retailers and consumers never makes it to the dining room table?  That’s 133 billion pounds of food going to waste--all of which has far-reaching impacts on food security, resource conservation, and climate change.  Experts have projected that reducing food waste by just 15 percent would provide the equivalent of enough food for more than 25 million Americans every year. That’s why my agency, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), decided to help tackle the problem by sponsoring the Terminal Market Food Waste Challenge.  Produce markets across the U.S. joined the friendly 90-day competition by making sure that usable fruits and vegetables were not thrown away.  While these fresh foods weren’t picture-perfect supermarket quality or simply didn’t sell, they were healthy, wholesome foods that could be made into juices, added to animal feeds, used for compost, or donated to charity.  Bruce Summers, Agricultural Marketing Service Associate Administrator  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 06,   Respond to this story","What percentage of food available to U.S. retailers and consumers could be saved by reducing food waste by just 15%, and what would be the equivalent benefit for American food security?","Reducing food waste by 15% would save approximately one-third (33%) of the wasted food, which is equivalent to enough food for more than 25 million Americans every year."

"Merrigan Meets Main Street in Momence, Illinois  This week, Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan toured the Main Street of Momence, Il, to view the positive growth made possible by USDA’s investments in rural revitalization. The community was decorated with corn stalks and fall mums to welcome Agriculture Deputy Secretary Merrigan to this town of 3,200 people, located 50 miles south of Chicago.  Merrigan and Momence residents enthusiastically toured several businesses that received financing thanks to a USDA Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG), administered by the USDA Rural Development agency.  Last year USDA provided a $99,000 grant to “Main Street Momence,” a preservation and volunteer based economic development program, to help them establish a revolving, low-interest loan fund.  The program is designed to help small businesses locate or remain in Momence’s historic downtown area. Thirteen months later, four businesses have taken advantage of the increased access to credit by taking out loans.

"Office of Communications in  Conservation  USDA Results  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Technology  Feb 03,  In the 151 years since the U.S. Department of Agriculture was founded, America's oldest industry has evolved to meet the changing needs of our modern agricultural landscape. From growing overseas markets, building a 21st century rural infrastructure, and finding ways to address the challenges of climate change, USDA has worked beside farmers, businesses, and community leaders to streamline programs and spur innovative solutions for today's challenges. For USDA, that also means looking inward and changing the way we do business. We have done this by designing initiatives that collectively utilize the full scope of our mission, better focusing resources and staff across the Department to meet the needs of the communities we serve using modern tools, technology, and processes. USDA's recently expanded StrikeForce for Rural Growth and Opportunity initiative illustrates this trend with a broad commitment to rally available tools and technical assistance to combat persistent poverty in rural communities in 20 states. Our Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative aims to support the rapidly expanding local and regional food market with new products and services, as well as tailored cross-agency web resources and that illustrate opportunities and promote local and regional food systems. And finally, through the Blueprint for Stronger Service, USDA responded to the uncertain fiscal environment by streamlining mission critical work and taking a close look at operations to find ways to cut costs and modernize processes to be better stewards of taxpayer dollars - with great results. Over the next month we'll share more about the ways that USDA has evolved to meet the needs of modern agriculture in America. We'll use hashtag  on social media to share these stories, but we want to hear from you too.

"Public Information Coordinator – USDA-Rural Development – Alaska in  Rural  Dec 01,   They say nothing beats teamwork and that can certainly be said about a very forward-thinking and ambitious project being led by USDA-Rural Development in Alaska. USDA-RD Alaska State Director Jim Nordlund is leading the efforts to coordinate several federal agencies in organizing statewide collaboration meetings with Alaska tribal governments.  The collaboration will involve 12-18 meetings held over the next eleven months.  This effort is in response to a memorandum signed by President Obama directing federal agencies to engage in regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials. There are 229 federally recognized tribes in Alaska and nearly all coincide with rural villages.  The USDA led plan involves face-to-face collaboration meetings with the acknowledged leader or single point of contact for each tribe. The meetings will be held in local communities and will involve a conversation with several tribal leaders in an area that is geographically distinct and culturally homogenous. “Collaboration with 229 tribes in their local areas is a large undertaking, but we feel this is the best way to understand the needs of Native communities and to seek their advice,” said Nordlund.     “Through these meetings we hope to strengthen the government-to-government relationship between tribal leaders and the federal government; provide an overview, by topic, of certain federal programs that have an effect on tribes; and engage in constructive dialogue, respond to questions and solicit ideas regarding federal programs,” added Nordlund. The consultation discussions will be focused on five topics: Food production, availability and nutrition Rural housing Natural Resources Conservation Service and Forest Service Rural utilities (electric, telecom, solid waste, sewer and water) Rural economic and community development Five USDA agencies will participate in the meetings, including Rural Development, Farm Service Agency, Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), Forest Service, and Food and Nutrition Service.  Additionally, five other federal agencies with similar programs will be represented, including: Department of Housing and Urban Development, Small Business Administration, Economic Development Administration, Department of Energy and the Denali Commission. USDA Farm Service Agency Executive State Director Danny Consenstein said, “Food security is a big issue in our rural areas.  Not only are fish and game important, but growing more local  produce can create jobs, healthier food, and more self-sufficient communities.  I’m excited to talk with and learn from tribal leaders about this important topic.” ""I look forward to participating in the collaborations and hearing directly from tribal leaders about what they need and expect from federal agencies.  It will be an opportunity to explain our programs and the assistance we can provide,” said Bob Jones, State Conservationist for the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The Alaska Inter-Tribal Council (AITC) will be coordinating the logistics for the meetings.  The places and dates for the meeting will be determined by the tribes in consultation with AITC.

"Posted by Shannon O’Brien, Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jul 17,  The aftermath of ""mudders"" driving their vehicles through a pristine meadow on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest in Washington. Participants could face charges including malicious mischief and fines up to and including paying for the costs of restoration. (U.S. Forest Service photo) Mudders, take note: It is against the law to tear up forest roads and meadows for fun, and the legal and financial consequences can be steep. Tearing up high-country meadows with four-wheel-drive and off-road vehicles destroys wildlife habitat and ecosystems. During a recent investigation, Forest Service law enforcement officers gathered information about mudding that occurred over Memorial Day weekend on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest at Buck Lake Campground, near Winthrop, Wash. A meadow near the campground was torn up by vehicles. Where there was green grass there are now mud pits and tire tracks. The activities that caused this damage are illegal under both state and federal law. Participants could face charges including malicious mischief and fines up to and including paying for the costs of restoration. Smoothing ruts, reseeding or planting and repairing roadbeds cost a lot of money. Mudding, or driving through wet areas and puddles while mud sprays up onto a vehicle is considered fun by some motor sports enthusiasts. Some people enjoy the challenge of maneuvering a vehicle through a situation where they could get stuck, or they may simply get a thrill out of seeing how high they can fling mud. There are websites and groups that cater to this interest and there are places, mostly private land (with a landowners permission), where such activities are allowed. But a national forest is not such a place. The results of this incident on the Okanogan-Wenatchee are a familiar sight to natural resource specialists across the Forest Service. There is a difference between acceptable use of off-highway vehicles and mudding -- tearing through grass to expose underlying soil or unnecessarily driving through a soft spot in the road. Spinning tires on plants destroys the plants, leaving behind bare dirt. When plants are gone, there is nothing to stop soil from washing into nearby streams and lakes. Muddy streams and lakes are bad for fish, wildlife, irrigators and recreationists, and many local towns depend on clean water and tourism for survival. When native plants are gone, noxious weeds move in. A meadow of native grasses and flowers may soon become a field of thistles and knapweed. Believe it or not, mudding actually compacts soil. It’s hard for plants to grow in compacted soil. Healthy soil should bounce a bit when you walk on it. Tire tracks create hard, dried-up soil where water runs down tire tracks and into creeks and lakes, carrying mud and pollutants with it. Meadows and wetlands provide important breeding, rearing and foraging habitats for many birds and other animals. Tearing-up these areas removes nesting and hiding cover, decreases forage, interferes with feeding and pushes animals out into areas where they may not survive. Off-highway vehicles are permitted on designated trails within the National Forest System.

"U.S. Forest Service, Florida in  Forestry  Mar 31,  A trail rider expert from Red Hills Powersports of Tallahassee, Fla., answers questions from a young boy from nearby Crawfordville, Fla., during the grand opening of the Springhill Motorcycle Trailhead. Forest Service engineers designed the recreational trailhead area to include spacious parking for visitors with trailers to offload motorcycles. (U.S. Forest Service Photo/Susan Blake) For many, the “great” in “the great outdoors” answers the call to hit the open road with body, soul and little else except their motorcycle. That got a little easier on the Apalachicola National Forest in Florida with the opening of a new trailhead beckoning riders with easier trail access and opportunity to ride for recreation. The grand opening of the new Springhill Motorcycle Trailhead south of Tallahassee, Fla., highlights the U.S. Forest Service policy to develop a system of roads, trails and areas designated for motor vehicle use. The project includes a new, single-span aluminum bridge to connect the forest’s separate motorized northern and southern trails. The prefabricated 90-foot Fisher Creek Bridge, shipped in two sections, replaces an older, antiquated bridge that stretched across the waterway. “Introducing a new recreation site to the area is very exciting. It’s a milestone for the forest but one we hope the public will enjoy for years,” said Chandra Roberts, recreation program manager for the forest. The Apalachicola saw the opportunity to create the new recreation area with a Recreational Trails Program (RTP) grant through the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The program provides financial assistance to develop recreational trails, trailheads and trailside facilities. “The $933,900 grant, funded by off-road vehicle fuel tax dollars through the Federal Highway Administration, has assisted the Forest Service in developing these facilities,” said Alex Weiss, Florida Department of Environmental Protection. “The Springhill Motorcycle Trailhead and Fisher Creek Bridge project, located in Leon County, exemplify the intent of RTP, which was created by Congress in .” Alex Weiss, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, discussed the benefits of the recently completed Springhill Motorcycle Trailhead on the Apalachicola National Forest to a crowd gathered for its grand opening. The new facility is a short distance from Tallahassee, Fla. (U.S. Forest Service Photo/Susan Blake) The Florida Forest Service also provided money through their T. Mark Schmidt Off-Highway Vehicle Safety and Recreation Act, which is designed to provide the public with more opportunities to ride off-highway vehicles on public lands. “Some people parked on the side of the highway and entered the trail, but now at this new facility there’s plenty of room to safely offload motorcycles and equipment before heading out on a ride,” said Steve Tomicich of the Tallahassee Trail Riders. Roberts said the Tallahassee Trail Riders, a local motorcycle club, and the Red Hills Powersports of Tallahassee promoted and participated in the grand opening and provided tips on trail riding. Local resident Jeff McKenzie was particularly grateful for the new trailhead. “I wanted to get a small motorcycle to ride with my kids, but we really didn’t have a place to ride,” McKenzie said.  “Now we have this new motorcycle trailhead and it’s really easy to get to.” A local motorcycle enthusiast runs one of the motorized trails on the Apalachicola National Forest near Tallahassee, Fla. The forest features approximately 111 miles of trails for motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles and other off-highway vehicles.

"Philly Market Rises Up to Meet Hunger Challenge  Did you know that nearly one-third of the food available to U.S. retailers and consumers never makes it to the dining room table?  That’s 133 billion pounds of food going to waste--all of which has far-reaching impacts on food security, resource conservation, and climate change.  Experts have projected that reducing food waste by just 15 percent would provide the equivalent of enough food for more than 25 million Americans every year. That’s why my agency, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), decided to help tackle the problem by sponsoring the Terminal Market Food Waste Challenge.  Produce markets across the U.S. joined the friendly 90-day competition by making sure that usable fruits and vegetables were not thrown away.  While these fresh foods weren’t picture-perfect supermarket quality or simply didn’t sell, they were healthy, wholesome foods that could be made into juices, added to animal feeds, used for compost, or donated to charity.

"U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Apr 12,  Western Slope ATV Association work party on Young’s Connector . Photo credit: US Forest Service Your face is dusty. Your All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) is muddy. Your adrenaline is at an all-time high. You have just finished riding one of your favorite trails on the U.S. Forest Service’s Grand Mesa National Forest and couldn’t be happier. But, do you ever wonder how all these miles of off-highway vehicle, or OHV, trails traversing a vast and diverse landscape stay in good shape? The fact is forests across the nation have the annual challenge of maintaining hundreds of miles of trails with limited budgets and personnel. One such example of this national trails preservation effort is happening on the Grand Valley Ranger District. The district, along with the thousands of recreational trail users who frequent the Grand Mesa, benefit greatly from outside funding sources such as the state of Colorado OHV Grant Program and numerous partnerships with local groups and associations that help maintain their system trails. Partnerships have been instrumental in the maintenance and improvement of the many recreational opportunities on the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests. The Grand Valley Ranger District currently has partnerships with ten different organizations that volunteer to help clear trail corridors, conduct volunteer trail patrols and organize work parties to help with specific projects. These partners have been essential not only in providing thousands of hours of help each year to maintain trails but, have been able to leverage and acquire additional monies to help fund trail improvement projects on the forest. One such project completed during the season was the Young’s Connector Trail , located on the Grand Mesa. The Western Slope ATV Association volunteered many hours clearing the trail corridor and the Forest Service’s trail dozer crew, funded by a state OHV grant, built the new one mile trail linking two routes, and creating a 15-mile loop opportunity. In addition to funds for specific projects, the Forest Service receives annual funding under a Good Management Grant that allows the Grand Valley Ranger District to hire two OHV crews, totaling 4 people, throughout the summer and fall when motorized use is at its peak. So now, armed with a little more background on what goes on with the care and upkeep of your motorized trails on the Grand Mesa National Forest, get out and enjoy another ride!

"Siuslaw National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jul 19,  Visitors hike on the Siuslaw National Forest section of the Ya’Xaik Trail. U.S. Forest Service photo. The Alsea were a tribe of Native Americans who, for thousands of years, lived along the central Oregon Coast. In anthropologist Livingston Farrand predicted their loss in “Notes on the Alsea Indians of Oregon.” On June 1, the City of Yachats, a small coastal city in Oregon, joined with the U.S. Forest Service and Oregon State Parks to celebrate National Trails Day with a variety of activities, including the dedication of the new Ya’Xaik (pronounced yäh' khīk) Trail. The trail is named for the only known village of the Alsea people who originally inhabited the area. This trail is the result of many years of collaborative planning between the City of Yachats, the Siuslaw National Forest, area land owners and many citizen volunteers. The newest leg of the trail, completed in April, enables hikers to complete just over a one mile loop from the historic 804 trail north along the ocean, through the Gerdemann Botanic Preserve and across Siuslaw National Forest land. The Yachats Trails Committee hopes to one day extend a link into downtown Yachats. Mary-Beth Nickel performs during the trail’s dedication. U.S. Forest Service photo. “Trails, and the environments they traverse, have both economic and symbolic importance,” Mayor Ron Brean said. “Trails connect communities, they bridge cultures and they can connect the past and the future.” “The City of Yachats is especially grateful to the Siuslaw National Forest, Angell Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center and the many land owners and tireless volunteers who have assisted with creation of this outstanding resource that will benefit residents and visitors for years to come.” “For years we have truly valued our partnership with the community of Yachats,” said Michele Jones, district ranger for the Central Coast District and Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. “These energetic people have made many hiking opportunities come alive for those visitors exploring Cape Perpetua and Yachats.” The overall theme for this year’s National Trails Day celebration was “interpretation” and, in addition to the dedication, the day provided a number of opportunities for visitors to learn more about the natural, historical and cultural stories of the area. Visitors learned how Alsea Indians used spoons called Meixat made from elk antlers. They also commonly used clamshell cups and ate out of maple bowls made only by the men of the tribe.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 14,  Snowmelt on Mount Hood sends ample water down a stream in Oregon. NRCS photo. April storms delivered a mix of rain and snow to the northern half of the West but didn’t provide much relief for the dry southern half, according to the latest USDA water supply forecast. Washington, most of Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and the northern parts of Colorado and Utah, are expected to have near normal or above normal water supplies, according to the forecasts from the Natural Resources Conservation Service’s National Water and Climate Center (NWCC).  Streamflows that are far below normal are forecast for the southern parts of Oregon and Utah, southwestern Idaho, California, Arizona, New Mexico and western Nevada. Many of these areas are in the nearly 500 counties experiencing drought across the country, 57 of them in California alone, according to USDA disaster designations. Snowpack generally peaks in early April, and then begins to melt. Forecasters will continue to monitor conditions in preparation for the June 1 outlook, according to NWCC hydrologist Cara McCarthy. She said the rate of snowmelt in Montana and Wyoming will be especially important, because the record snow in some basins in those areas creates flooding potential. ""These areas will be most vulnerable if snow melts rapidly during a hot spell, or if there's extreme rain while the streams are swollen with snowmelt,” McCarthy said. “We’re hoping for a slow, consistent melt that will reduce the risk of flooding.” Streamflow in the West consists largely of accumulated mountain snow that melts and flows into streams as temperatures warm into spring and summer. USDA scientists analyze the snowpack, air temperature, soil moisture and other measurements taken from remote sites to develop the water supply forecasts. The NWCC water supply forecast is part of a group of USDA efforts to improve public awareness of and to help mitigate the impacts of climate change, including drought and other extreme weather events.  Through the creation of the National Drought Resilience Partnership, launched as part of the President’s Climate Action Plan, federal agencies are working closely with states, tribes and local government to develop a coordinated response to drought.

However, I can report that USDA Rural Development has programs that can offer some relief to these unfortunate victims.” George cited USDA Rural Development programs such as funding to replace and repair single-family homes, shared community facilities and the water and wastewater systems in the damaged areas. “I want to make sure that people know about the availability of our programs, especially our single-family home loan and home repair loan programs, so that they can rebuild their homes and businesses and continue to have clean water.” George has a history of fast action on disaster relief. Most recently, she was on the scene the day after tornadoes ran thru Holmes and Yazoo Counties in and made sure that USDA Rural Development programs were a part of both the immediate and long-term relief efforts in those counties.

Year after year, fire seasons grow longer and longer, destroying homes, threatening critical infrastructure and the watersheds that provide clean drinking water to millions of people. Between and , the average annual number of fires on Federal land more than doubled, and the total area burned annually tripled. Even as fire seasons have grown, the way we pay to fight these fires remains unchanged – and fundamentally broken. The Forest Service’s firefighting appropriation has rapidly increased as a proportion of the Forest Service’s overall budget, increasing from 16 percent in to 42 percent today. As the costs of wildfires have spiraled out of control, it has shrunk the budget of other Forest Service programs, taking millions of dollars from other critical forest health and land management priorities in order to pay for them. What’s more, often the programs we are forced to divert funds from are the very programs which help to mitigate the impact of wildfires.  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Director of the Office of Management and Budget Shaun Donovan  Posted in  Forestry  Aug 20,   5 Responses","""What is the main concern with the way firefighting costs are being managed in relation to other Forest Service programs?""",The main concern is that the increasing firefighting costs have led to a shrinking budget for other critical forest health and land management priorities.

"Still Made in Rural America: Steel in California Gold Country  Small town Oroville, California sits on the banks of the Feather River at the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains. It was established to supply the thousands of prospectors headed to Bidwell Bar, one of the first gold rush mines in the state. Today, this community of 16,260 people produces much more than just gold dust. At the edge of town, what started in as a backyard blacksmith shop by owners Michael Phulps and Sean Pierce has become a 82-employee steel manufacturing company called Metal Works, thanks to a little help from USDA Rural Development. Fourteen years ago, Metal Works received their first Business & Industry loan guarantee to purchase a 20,000 square foot fabrication shop and office building on a little over 18 acres. Since then, they’ve converted their original 9,400 square foot building to a retail steel shop, and added another 20,000 square foot fabrication shop, burn table, and a modern, high-precision drill and beam line.

"USDA Photographer, Office of Communications in  Initiatives  Aug 30,   A day in the life of a U.S. Department of Agriculture photojournalist is never the same. This one was no exception. It started out testing a new memory card that transmits photos from a digital camera to our Flickr social media gallery (www.USDA.gov and click the Flickr link).  After making the card work in the office , a field test was in order. Sunflowers in the People's Garden at the Department of Agriculture, in Washington, DC. USDA Photo by Lance Cheung. The nearest field was the Native American Garden, one of the two People's Garden fields just outside Whitten Building. My task was simple enough, take some pretty photos of corn and see if technology does it's magic. As soon as I take the first photo of what it thought were two big fat healthy ears of corn  I hear voices behind me on the sidewalk, ""Look at that, they're past their harvest."" Mature corn on the stalk in the People's Garden at the Department of Agriculture, in Washington, DC. USDA Media by Lance Cheung So, me being a ""city-boy"" had to turnaround and see who was making these comments about these ""perfect"" ears of corn. Turns out a mother and young teenaged son were walking from one tourist site to another, and stopped to looking up at the rows of 9-foot stalks. Their voices were confident and seemed to speak from experience as they continued, ""They waited too long.""  The young man was still nearby, while the mom continued past the garden watching our conversation. When asked how they made such deft evaluation, he easily pointed out the brown lower portions of the stalk and the yellowing upper half. Corn stalks that some passersby said was past their harvest time in downtown Washington, DC at the Department of Agriculture. The yellow and brown leaves were telltale signs of a spent stalk and hot dry summer days. USDA Photo by Lance Cheung.  A closer look at other ears of corn, revealed corncobs kernels that were picked away by birds. What kernels that remained, were simply dried out in the sun, because the husk was picked away. In the next moment, the boy was gone, before I could get names or a photo. What he didn't know and I had forgotten, was that the Three Sisters crop, in this demonstration garden, was keeping with Native American tradition. The type of corn planted is Dent Corn or field corn.  Not the kind most of us are used to seeing on a dinner plate. In fact, Dent Corn must be ground or further processed to be usable. And, unlike its sister crops of beans and squash, it is not suitable for donation to local food banks. Please see photos and info from the day the plants were planted on our Flickr site. So, corn stalks are not all the same. Just as, their harvest times are not all the same. With this crop, birds get a free meal, the stalks will become holiday decorations; and visiting groups to passers-by get to see living American heritage growing before them. All in all, the young (hopefully) future farmer was inspiring. I was left recalling the voice of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, as he often speaks about the value the next generation of farmers, who are they; what will be their motivation; where will they get help if needed in a world whose population is increasing, and the number of farmers are decreasing. Today, I met one young man that might be part of the answer.

"Director of the AMS Agricultural Analytics Division in  Food and Nutrition  Feb 03,  Infographic of Super Bowl & chicken wing facts. Click for a larger version. On January 15, , the Green Bay Packers faced off against the Kansas City Chiefs in the very first Super Bowl.  On that day, few of the estimated ates.  The Packers won the game 35-10, but ultimately the real winner was chicken – particularly wings. In , Americans consumes 32.6 pounds of chicken per capita, typically purchased in whole-bird form.  Cuts of chicken were a novelty at the grocery story, and there was little demand for chicken wings.  But, in , the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, N.Y. decided to turn the typical soup-stock staple into a spicy finger food to feed a hungry crowd. For a few years after they first served them, wings gained popularity in the bar scene—then came Super Bowl I, turning them into a sporting event tradition.  Since that first game, chicken wings have become a staple of football gatherings and tailgaters, even carrying over into other major sporting events with the annual college basketball tournaments and the college and pro football season rivaling the big game for wing consumption. In fact, any big sporting event that generates a crowd increases demand for chicken wings. On the day of Super Bowl I, the wholesale price for chicken wings on the New York market was 23 cents per pound. Today, chicken consumption is estimated at 90.1 pounds, a 176 percent increase from .  This past week, chicken wings averaged 197 cents per pound, a 743 percent increase.  At current prices, wings account for nearly a quarter of the whole bird value! In , the U.S. chicken industry produced around 28.5 billion chicken wing portions – the drumette and flat portions of the wing, which excludes the tip portion that is typically exported.  At least 5.6 percent of those chicken wing portions were marketed during the week leading up to the big game. That’s 1.6 billion chicken wing portions flying through the fingers of eager football fans across the nation! A similar volume is expected to move for this year’s big game. With an estimated viewership of nearly 115 million, that’s about 14 wings per viewer. A lot has changed for chicken since that fateful day in . But one thing has not – they still only come with two wings!

"NRCS Idaho in  Conservation  Mar 02,  This sign is posted at all officials snow course sites. Once a month in winter and spring, snow surveyors from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) head for the hills to measure the mountain snowpack. These trained observers ski, snowshoe or snowmobile to established snow measurement courses to record snow the old fashioned way – by hand. In 12 western states, NRCS employees measure the mountain snowpack each month from January to June at over 900 snow courses. NRCS uses snow and climate to forecast water supplies – did you know up to 80 percent of the West’s water supply comes from melting mountain snow?  Today we’re going to snowshoe into the Mores Creek site, near Boise, Idaho. At four stops along this 1,000-foot-long snow course we will measure the snow. Then, doing some quick calculations, we can determine how much water the snowpack contains. By the way: snow courses are usually located in remote backcountry locations where snowfall accumulates. Because the work can be dangerous, the technicians, hydrologists, engineers and volunteers that serve as snow surveyors attend training every three to five years to maintain their survival skills. At “Snow School” they learn snow sampling, avalanche recognition, outdoor survival and backcountry emergency care. They even build snow shelters and spend the night in them! To measure the snow we use an official Federal Snow Sampling tube which is an eight-foot long hollow tube precisely 1.485 inches in diameter. That’s so 1 ounce of tube weight exactly equals 1 inch of snow water equivalent. The tube is plunged straight down through the snow to the ground to get the sample. First we measure the snow depth using the ruler on the tube. Abramovich reads the snow depth using the gauge on the tube. Then we carefully extract the tube with a snow core and weigh it – tube, snow and all. Subtracting the empty tube weight from the tube and snow weight reveals how much water is in the snow. This is used to accurately forecast spring runoff and predict summer water supplies. Good job – you’ve now measured the snowpack! Abramovich balances the tube on the scale to get the weight of the tube and snow sample. Besides these manually measured snow courses, NRCS maintains 800 automated sites (called SNOTEL for SNOw TELemetry) that collect snow, precipitation and temperature available on NRCS Web pages. The are used by hydrologists, planners, engineers and others to manage water supplies for industry, cities, recreation and wildlife. For over 100 years, snowpack has been collected to forecast agricultural water supplies in the West – thanks for helping carry on the tradition! Snow surveyor Ron Abramovich, checks the snow survey tube to make sure it’s empty before taking the next measurement.

USDA Rural Utilities Service Administrator John Padalino recently visited the 500th water and wastewater project completed under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of . ""The Recovery Act has brought improved water and wastewater services to nearly 1.7 million rural residents,” said the Administrator. Administrator Padalino made his remarks at the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority Treatment Plant in Arkansas. Most people in the U.S. take for granted the fact that safe drinking water is readily available for use by simply turning on a tap, or pushing a button on a fountain.  However, many rural communities within the U.S. must deal with negative impacts associated with contaminated water sources at their homes and schools. In fact, since the ’s there have been efforts to bring safe drinking water to Boone, Newton, and Searcy counties in Arkansas.  Groundwater in this region is often contaminated with naturally occurring random, radium, and fluoride, which water systems must address.   Contaminated ground water is unsafe and unfit for humans to use. USDA funding for the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority system is used to provide clean, safe water for over 20,000 residents and businesses. In addition to the USDA funding, the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission provided nearly $10 million for the project. Programs like the one which funded the Treatment Plant would not be available without a Food, Farm and Jobs Bill. Rural areas need safe and reliable water for the health of their communities and sustainable economic growth.

"Addressing California’s Water Challenges Through Action and Collaboration  Cross posted from DOI News: California is in the throes of the worst drought in the 160 years during which records have been kept. As a result, the state’s overextended water system is in crisis. All segments of California’s economy— one of the largest in the world—are experiencing the effects of this drought. The economic, social and environmental impacts on agriculture, industry, jobs, communities’ drinking water and the ecosystem will reverberate across the country, and that is why actions need to be taken to address the situation not just in the short term, but also to sustain the state over the long run. Following two years of dry conditions, on January 17, California Governor Jerry Brown proclaimed a State of Emergency for drought. Subsequently, the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce have committed to helping California prepare for and lessen drought impacts. In addition, as called for in President Obama’s Climate Action Plan, the National Drought Resilience Partnership, which includes the Department of the Interior, Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Energy, will help align federal resources and policies to better support response to drought impacts and build long term sustainability and resilience in California’s water system.

USDA works to educate consumers on the importance of making healthy dietary choices. Choosing healthful beverages is one part of that equation and drinking more water is something that all Americans can benefit from.  Increasing water intake, “drinking up”, is an easy change every one of us can make every day. Tap, filtered, bottled, carbonated- it all counts! Personally, water is my favorite beverage.  In the afternoon, it’s a perfect complement to smart snack in schools, at work, or on the go.  I drink it as part of my balanced MyPlate-inspired meals and throughout the day, always carrying a water bottle around with me.

"Rural  Research and Science  Jun 16,   Worcester Prep, Berlin, MarylandThe upgrades currently taking place at the Berlin Wastewater Treatment Plant are comprehensive, and will allow the plant to fully process all the wastewater that goes through the system down to near drinking water quality.  The technology that the Town of Berlin, MD is installing was made possible thanks to a grant and some low interest Water and Environmental Program loans from the USDA.  These upgrades will help to remove the pathogens, nutrients and other pollutants from the influent. Technology that is being installed as part of these upgrades is called a SBR or sequencing batch reactor.  I recently spoke with Jane Kreiter, Director of Water and Wastewater for the Town of Berlin, about this new technology and got a look at the lab where the Berlin wastewater officials monitor every stage of the treatment for specific criteria. The new SBRs being installed at Berlin’s wastewater plant will all work in essentially the same way:  there will be three different SBR tanks installed as part of the ongoing upgrades, and Kreiter says that these will contain different amounts and kinds of bacteria to break down certain types of “bad” nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous.  Giant blowers at the bottom of each tank blow varying amounts of oxygen into the tanks, causing the oxygen to slowly bubble to the top.  The oxygen is needed to maintain the biomass inside the tank so that they can be healthy and break down and remove the various constituents in the waste stream.  When the bacteria are young in the biomass, they consume and break down a lot of the nitrogen and phosphorous, but as they begin to get older, they become full and less efficient at breaking down nutrients.  When this happens, they die and fall to the bottom of the SBR.  The dead bacteria are then removed from the bottom of the tank by way of a pump assembly and sent to a digester.  The amount of bacteria and oxygen in the SBR must be constantly monitored to ensure that the right amount of contaminants will be removed at each stage of the treatment process inside the SBR. After the influent has gone through the entire treatment process it is ready to be sent to the spray irrigation site in Libertytown, Maryland.  Samples of the treated effluent are collected as they are leaving the plant and are taken to the lab.  Kreiter was embarrassed to take me inside the cramped, temporary lab that is located inside the mobile trailer they are currently using while the regular lab is being renovated.  She assured me that this was not what the lab normally looks like and asked to “make sure to come back when we get our new lab,” which will be opening when the rest of the upgrades are completed on site.  In the lab they test for pathogens, nutrients, total suspended solids, PH levels, and biological oxygen demand. The upgrades to the Berlin wastewater plant, when completed, will break down nutrients and contaminants in the influent to create near drinking water quality effluent. “It’s a better quality than [the water] a lot people get out of their wells,” Jane Kreiter adds.  For a 24-hour time-lapse video of part of the Berlin Wastewater Plant SBR installation, you can visit the following links: for Part 1 and for Part 2.

Photo: Amy Overstreet Rwanda native Janine Ndagijimana, her husband Faustine and their children moved to Burlington, Vermont in after living in a refugee camp in Tanzania for 13 years. Now a U.S. citizen, she works closely with Ben Waterman, the New American Farmer Program coordinator at the University of Vermont Extension Service (UVM) Center for Sustainable Agriculture. He manages the Land Access and Assessment Program that helps Vermont's resettled refugee and immigrant farmers obtain access to the resources they need to pursue their goals as farmers and to link common threads between their new home in America the culture of their homelands. Janine was one of several farmers who recently attended a meeting of the Association of Africans Living in Vermont to learn about USDA programs and services. Farmers from Burundi, Rwanda, Somalia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo learned about land acquisition, insurance programs, loans to support farming, and technical and financial assistance for implementing conservation farming practices. Waterman coordinates a project from USDA’s Outreach and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers and Veteran Farmers and Ranchers Program (OASDVFR), administered through USDA’s Office of Advocacy and Outreach. The $43,000 grant is helping Vermont refugee farmers improve their understanding of programs and technical assistance available through UVM Extension and USDA agencies. “We want to help these individuals, like Janine, build strong working relationships within the community and link them with the many resources that are available to them from the University and USDA,” said Waterman. UVM Extension outreach includes two workshops with translators on-hand assisting refugee farmers as they learn more about the programs and services of USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Farmers are then matched with an appropriate USDA representative to help them meet their individual goals and needs. Many of the farmers are interested in the kinds of vegetables they grew up with and raised in their home countries, like “intore,” a variety of eggplant found in Africa that Janine grows. Of course, the climate in Vermont is very different from that of Africa, where eggplants could be harvested through January. Thanks to technical and financial assistance through the NRCS Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Janine will be able to extend her growing season in Vermont using a high tunnel. High tunnels, also known as hoop houses, are structures used to extend the growing season by shielding tender, sensitive crops—including vegetables, herbs, berries and others—from weather variations in the spring and fall, allowing them to grow where they might otherwise struggle. With the assistance and mentorship of local farmer Gene Button, Janine is leasing land to raise her eggplants and market them locally and across the border in Canada. NRCS Soil Conservationist Danny Peet is also helping her use cover crops to improve soil health. “The high tunnel allows production from mid-summer until later in the fall,” said Peet. He assisted Janine with the process of submitting the EQIP application, securing the lease for the acreage and locating the appropriate area to construct the high tunnel. It can be a challenge to provide outreach and education to farmers for whom English is a second language. To help address this, another goal of the grant is to educate farmers through instructional videos in several languages. The first up provides an Introduction to USDA Programs for New American Farmers featuring USDA staff. “A realistic outcome for the outreach meetings and the video is relationship building.”  Waterman said. “Translation is key.” Farmers can view the English and Kirundi versions of the video and Nepali and Maay Maay versions are in production. The educational and technical assistance content is designed to address barriers that resettled refugee farmers commonly face. Water said, “It has been a pleasure and an honor to work with the farmers who bring their diverse culture, unique skill sets and such a rich agricultural heritage to the United States. They have tremendous potential and it is wonderful to see USDA in Vermont making a special effort to reach out to the farmers and improve access to programs and services.” Danny Peet, NRCS Soil Conservationist in Williston, Vermont, educates farmers about Farm Bill programs and technical assistance available from USDA.

Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest in Washington. (U.S. Forest Service photo) If you’re a student who likes fresh air, scenic vistas, hiking and camping, the U.S. Forest Service might have the perfect job for you. This year, some units of the Forest Service have been hosting one-day recruiting fairs that teach high school and college students how to apply for upcoming summer jobs with the government. In one example, about 30 hopeful candidates met in downtown Seattle. Staffers from the Forest Service taught students tips to make a resume shine and how to ace an interview. The session also gave the hopefuls an opportunity to develop professional relationships and networking with potential employers. During the meeting, students who have worked for the Forest Service shared their experiences working as guides, building trails or fighting fires. Nik Vasquez, 21, of Seattle, talked about working on the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest for three summers where he began on a trail crew. Nik Vasquez, 21, of Seattle, worked on the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest for three summers. (U. S. Forest Service photo) Vasquez worked 10-hour days maintaining trails, removing fallen trees, fixing water drainage, repairing trail paths and brushing out shrubs and branches. His typical work week began by backpacking five to seven miles to the trail, setting up a base camp, accessing damage and clearing away downed trees or branches. “You quickly learn how to use a Pulaski, a shovel and a grub hoe, to fix the trails,” said Vasquez. “I love being out there. It is the simple things: fresh air, mountain lakes, fishing for dinner, exploring mountain peaks, relaxing by the fire. Working outside is better than a 9-to-5 job.” During Vasquez’s second year on the Forest Service trail crew he began training to fight wildfires. The next year he was selected for a position on an initial attack crew. His stint on the trail crew gave Vasquez the training but didn’t quite prepare him for the long hours needed to fight fires. His most memorable experience was fighting the Waldo Canyon Fire in Colorado Springs last year. “At a fire assignment you work long days, and you can be gone for months,” he said. But one of the bonuses for working on the fire crew is the pay, which he is using to pay for his college tuition. Vasquez is now majoring in engineering and physics at Loyola University in New Orleans, La. This summer he will take a break to return home and hike the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, a trail he learned about from those summer jobs. “There are so many peaks I want to climb along the way,” he said. Annually, the Forest Service and its conservation partners hire more than 3,000 people for summer positions that involve work such as reducing the impacts of climate change on the nation’s natural resources, empowering Native American communities, building trails, enhancing wildlife habitat, and improving and restoring cultural and historic landmarks.

"USDA Assistant Secretary for Administration in  Conservation  Initiatives  Farming  Rural  Nov 15,  Ribbon Cutting for the Socially Disadvantage Farmers and Ranchers Policy Research Center at Alcorn State University Day in, day out, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) brings programs to many farmers and ranchers as well as opportunities to students. As I meet with farmers, ranchers and USDA interns, a sense of great appreciation and anticipation wells up for the future of agriculture. One of the USDA offices that serves these farmers and students is the Office of Advocacy and Outreach (OAO). OAO staff connect with farmers, community organizers, veterans, educators and students to bring opportunities and services. OAO works with community-based organizations to ensure access to USDA programs and services for underserved and limited-resource communities and farmers. A major program is the Outreach and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged and Veteran Farmers and Ranchers Program (also known as the Program).  Forty-five projects from organizations representing 25 States were awarded $8.8 million in . This included a second year of $400,ate University. Among the program grantees are Robert Gates and Clay Taylor, President and Agribusiness Specialist at the Tri-County Agricultural Cooperative (Tri-County Co-op) in Mississippi. The co-op serves approximately 45 small, socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers – 80 percent of whom are under the age of 40.  “Thanks to the program, we are able to do one-on-one work with farmers,” said Gates. “We can spend quality time doing the research they need and training them on marketing practices.”  Taylor added, “The program allows rural individuals to turn family-owned property and rural towns into economic spaces and income generators. In the south we have a lot of space that is underused in terms of agriculture, especially sustainable agriculture. This program helps small, beginning, and socially disadvantaged farmers to unlock the hidden potential of agriculture.” In September , OAO organized the second annual Program Partnership Symposium. I spoke to the group along with officials from Farm Service Agency, Rural Development and Natural Resources Conservation Service emphasizing the importance of leveraging USDA programs to strengthen outreach and services. Among the 300 participants in two years was Robert Gates of Tri-County Co-op who that both meetings where great opportunities to network with other grantees and university and community partners. Minority Farmers Advisory Committee OAO manages two critical advisory committees to the Secretary -- the Minority Farmers Advisory Committee and the Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Advisory Committee. Both committees provide recommendations to enhance USDA programs. This year, OAO coordinated the USDA/Task Force meeting attended by a record number of Presidents, Agriculture Deans, and Research Directors.  Among the objectives was to continue work on the Centers of Excellence which promote and expand USDA’s partnership with the Land-Grant Universities. USDA agencies have provided $1.6 million to the Centers. OAO also ensures that the National Scholars Program places top students across USDA.  If you are a student or know of any students who would like to apply for the National Scholars Program, please download the application and submit it to USDA by the December 31, deadline. USDA also partners with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF) to provide internships and this year, USDA increased the number to 117 TMCF interns. I am fortunate to have TMCF interns working in my office and one of those is Jay Coleman, a graduate of Southern University Law Center, Baton Rouge, LA. “Interning at the USDA has been eye-opening, and has allowed me to put my Juris Doctor to use,” Coleman said. “I have been given the opportunity to use skills obtained in law school to assist in implementing technological advances in the Office of the Assistant Secretary.” In , USDA hosted 222 Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities interns and set a record. The E. Kika De La Garza Fellowship Program offers faculty and staff from Hispanic Serving Institutions the opportunity to work with USDA to gain an understanding of the Federal government. In , ates and 12 universities. OAO staff also leads the USDA Tribal Land-Grant Colleges and Universities Program serving the Tribal Colleges which includes 34 tribal land-grant institutions. With these OAO services in as well as over the past several years, USDA made great strides in addressing barriers faced by minority and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers. To further strengthen and elevate this engagement with historically underrepresented communities, OAO now will report directly to the Office of the Secretary. The realignment highlights the critical importance of OAO’s mission and function, and also demonstrates USDA’s commitment to maintaining the momentum in addressing long-standing challenges.  This action also will create transparent lines of accountability and authority, and better facilitate oversight and coordination throughout USDA. The Department will continue to strengthen its outreach to customers on programs and services that support agricultural interests and rural communities -- the future of agriculture depends on it.   Category/Topic:  Conservation  Initiatives  Farming  Rural  Tags:  National Scholars Program  USDA/Task Force  Tribal Land-Grant-Colleges and Universities Program  Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Advisory Committee  Farm Service Agency  Minority Farmers Advisory Committee  Natural Resources Conservation Service  Office of Advocacy and Outreach  Rural Development","What USDA program, managed by the Office of Advocacy and Outreach (OAO), provides grants to organizations serving socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers?","The USDA program that provides grants to organizations serving socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers is called the ""Outreach and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged and Veteran Farmers and Ranchers Program"" (also known as the Program)."
"NRCS Wisconsin in  Conservation  Jan 26,  Some bees are specialists that only pollinate certain plants. This squash bee works the Cucurbita crops—squash and pumpkins. (Photo courtesy of Nancy Adamson and the Xerces Society) A recently awarded USDA Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) will fund research into bee-friendly seed mixes. A partnership made up of the Xerces Society, University of Wisconsin Center for Integrated Agriculture Systems and USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service in Wisconsin is working to develop and test seed mixes that will provide the best habitat for native bees. CIG-funded projects use innovative technologies and approaches to address natural resources issues. Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants depend on pollinators to reproduce, and in the U.S., bees are the main pollinators of fruits and vegetables. But bees, bats and other pollinators are struggling as habitat loss, disease, parasites, and environmental contaminants have all contributed to the decline of many species of pollinators, including the more than 4,000 species of native bees in North America. To ensure that bees and other pollinators don’t just survive, but also thrive, USDA programs provide funding and technical assistance for farmers to implement pollinator-friendly practices on their lands. One important practice is incorporating plantings that attract native bees and other pollinators to the borders of fields and other areas and feed them a varied diet throughout the year. Providing healthy habitat for native bees will also help feed managed hives of European honey bees—which are used to pollinate many commercial crops in the U.S.—and make them heartier, as they too reap the benefits of a diverse and healthy diet. Not long ago, Wisconsin was home to 13 species of bumble bee. Now, two of the most common bumblebees are no longer found here, due to habitat loss and environmental contaminants. (Photo courtesy of Hannah Gaines from UW-Madison Entomology Dept.) That’s where bee-friendly seed mixes come in. Four half-acre demonstration sites have been planted using the new seed mixes in field borders and buffer areas: on apple and fresh vegetable farms, a cranberry operation, and a cucumber-and-pepper farm. The first results will be seen this summer, when scientists will observe how quickly and successfully the new plantings establish themselves, and how quickly the bees return. Getting the right seed mix to attract and sustain a healthy native bee population is a challenge. Bees need flowers—but not just any flowers. They need to be the right color and size, and bloom at the right times. Bees are attracted to white, yellow, blue or purple flowers. Bees also need a variety of sizes, ranging from big sturdy flowers for the bumble bees to small delicate ones for the sweat bees. Timing is also important—for example, bees need some flowers to be steadily in bloom from the time the bees first crawl out of their winter nests in early spring until they go back in late fall.

"APHIS Public Affairs Specialist in  Animals  Plants  Jul 11,  A gypsy moth caterpillar on a leaf in Massachusetts While being outside in Massachusetts this June, I first noticed it.  A lot of leaves were falling from the trees, only these were chewed leaf parts, not whole leaves. Similar to the children's book, The Very Hungry Caterpillar written by Eric Carle, some leaves didn’t just have chew marks but actual holes going straight through them.  Unlike the children’s book, this damage isn’t being caused by a friendly caterpillar who turns into a butterfly.  Instead it’s the result of ravenous gypsy moth caterpillars feeding…and feeding.  It’s so bad that in some areas, on walkways and roadways, it looks like fall.  Brown, dried up leaves are a contrast to summer’s lush greenery. What comes along with all the feeding and falling leaf parts?  Caterpillar feces, everywhere.  It too covers walkways and roadways.  And you don’t have to listen hard to hear the feeding, or the leaves and feces dropping.  The chewing is constant and so are the droppings.  It almost sounds like rain falling, continuously.  I regret that I did not take a picture of a car covered with caterpillar feces that I saw at the grocery store this weekend, which looked like it had peppercorns stuck all over it.  Don’t park under a tree, or like everything else, your car will be covered. Gypsy moth is not everywhere in the United States.  It’s primarily in the northeast to mid-west, and it’s Federal and State agriculture officials’ goal to not let it spread further.  You can do your part to help by finding out if you are in an area that already has gypsy moth, and if you’re not, report any gypsy moth egg masses or caterpillars on trees to Federal or State agriculture officials.  Also, the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is asking folks to check for gypsy moth before you move to a new area by inspecting your outdoor household articles (lawn furniture, yard equipment, outdoor toys, etc.) for gypsy moth egg masses and remove them.  It's not just the right thing to do—it's also the law. And now it’s easier than ever because APHIS just made its gypsy moth inspection checklist a fillable (page 2 of our gypsy moth factsheet) that can be digitally signed, making it acceptable in all situations where the form is . The gypsy moth caterpillars here in Massachusetts are ruining thousands of trees, changing the way the landscape looks.  The crabapple tree I planted two years ago didn’t bloom this year, and it may not survive these gypsy moth caterpillar attacks.  Please help prevent this insect from moving to other areas by visiting www.HungryPests.com to learn more about gypsy moth and other invasive pests we don’t want in the United States. Gypsy moths can lay their masses on just about any outdoor item—like this lawnmower—which people could move to uninfested areas, accidentally causing great harm.

"NRCS Utah in  Conservation  Jun 04,  Roger Barton’s center pivot irrigation system is running on green renewable energy. The hydroturbine system was funded by NRCS in Utah through a Conservation Innovation Grant. Photo credit Roger Barton. Like other farmers in the West, Roger Barton must irrigate the alfalfa hay he raises for horse owners. And like many farmers, Barton has to be creative to make ends meet. He has an off-farm job to support his family and is always trying to think of ways to keep his farm costs down. When diesel costs rose to $4.25 per gallon a couple of years ago, Barton came up with a new, non-diesel-powered way to power his center pivot irrigation system, which creates those crop circles you may have noticed when flying over rural America. (The center pivot also saves lots of water by spreading just the right amount evenly over the land.) With the help of a Conservation Innovation Grant from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Barton worked with a pump company and NRCS engineers to design a hydroturbine system that generates electricity to power his pivot irrigation system. CIG-funded projects use innovative technologies and approaches to address natural resources issues. A close up view of Roger Barton’s hydroturbine system which generates electricity to power a pivot irrigation system on a 127 acre alfalfa field in Utah. Photo credit Roger Barton.  Irrigation water in his area is delivered from the mountains in a pressurized pipe at about 85 pounds per square inch (psi)—about twice as much as needed. In the past, this caused some damage to Barton’s sprinkler heads. Now when the water enters his new system it travels through the vanes of the turbine (Fig. 1), causing the turbine to spin and turn a hydraulic pump that pumps hydraulic fluid through gears that turn the wheels, moving the long irrigation boom around the circle. Along the way the water pressure is reduced to about 45 psi, just the right amount to keep it from damaging the sprinkler heads. This system is terrific,” Barton says. “It not only did away with a $3,500 annual fuel bill, but it eliminates emissions from the old motor, avoids storing fuel on the farm and lessens our dependence on foreign sources of oil. I’d say that’s a win-win for everybody. The turbine runs a 127 acre T-L hydraulic pivot and it is still running like a charm in its fourth year of operation.” NRCS State Engineer Bronson Smart estimates the annual operating cost of the new turbine system to be less than $100.Barton has shared information about his system with neighbors, and his ideas, developed with the USDA grant, have been adopted into the NRCS standard practices list approved for use on other farms participating in the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP).

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Forest Service, Fire and Aviation Management in  Forestry  Animals  Plants  Jan 12,  USDA Forest Service Smokejumpers are trained to climb trees in case they, or their supplies, land in them. When Smokejumpers aren’t fighting wildfires, the USDA Forest Service calls on them to use their tree climbing skills to complete a variety of natural resource management projects, such as harvesting pine cones and constructing owl nesting boxes.  While many USDA Forest Service employees spend their summers working as Smokejumpers fighting wildfires in the west, they in turn spend their falls in the east working as Beetle Busters, helping the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) combat the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB). Since these nonnative insects were first discovered in Brooklyn, New York in , the  ALB has caused tens of thousands of trees to be destroyed in Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. They  feed- and develop deep inside certain species of hardwood trees, weakening and eventually killing them. To stop the destruction from furthering, Smokejumpers soon began working as ""tree climbers"" to help APHIS identify trees infested with ALB. Smokejumpers are highly trained, skilled, and experienced wild land firefighters – taking their past expertise, and putting it to use saving trees from another grave danger: the Asian longhorned beetle. While climbing, these Forest Service employees seek out dime-sized holes that indicate the presence of the destructive ALB in tree canopies soaring over ten stories high. Once the infested trees are recorded on a GPS unit, they are ready to be marked with paint so they can be removed.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  Aug 31,  University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, Food and Environment researchers are helping homeless youth in Louisville, KY using a NIFA Children, Youth, and Families at Risk (CYFAR) Sustainable Community Projects grant. Photo credit: iStock The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that every year more than 1.ates.  According to the Coalition for the Homeless, Louisville, Kentucky, had 555 young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 stay in homeless shelters over the past year. When those young adults were surveyed about who they turned to for help in reaching their goals or fulfilling their basic needs, an alarming number replied: “No one.” Researchers from the University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, Food and Environment (UKag) are helping this underserved population with the help of a five-year, $660,000 Children, Youth, and Families at Risk (CYFAR) Sustainable Community Projects grant from USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). UKAg has partnered with Kentucky State University (KSU) Extension and two YMCA centers in the Louisville area to carry out the project. This partnership began when Louisville YMCA’s Safe Place Services contacted the Jefferson County Extension office, interested in their evidence-based life skills programming. “We have always wanted to work with the homeless, but in order to work with them you need infrastructure that Cooperative Extension doesn’t have,” said Janet Kurzynske, UK Extension professor in dietetics and human nutrition and the project’s lead investigator. “When you are working with homeless youth, you have to provide shelter. That’s what the YMCA has. So it made for a really good collaboration.” The primary goal of this program is to teach important life skills such as workforce preparation, communication, and healthy living. One way this program will achieve that goal is through a community garden. “The garden is on YMCA Shelter House property and will be used to supply fresh food to the shelter and give them an opportunity to build hands-on skills,” said Kurzynske. Researchers will collect throughout the program to determine its effectiveness, providing records for CYFAR’s Common Measures for workforce preparation, a national program measuring young people’s ability to effectively solve problems and make decisions. NIFA’s CYFAR program helps improve the quality and quantity of comprehensive community-based programs for at-risk children, youth, and families supported by the Cooperative Extension System. CYFAR marshals resources of the Land-Grant University and Cooperative Extension Systems to develop and deliver educational programs that equip limited resource families and youth who are at-risk for not meeting basic human needs with the skills they need to lead positive, productive, contributing lives.

"Boston Beats the Asian Longhorned Beetle  One of the things I consider a highlight of my career and that I will always remember is our successful response to the July detection of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) in Boston, Massachusetts.  As I attended the May 12 ceremony commemorating the eradication of the ALB infestation in Boston and listened to the speakers share their thoughts about what it took to get us there, I had a deep sense of appreciation for the partnership among the state and federal cooperators who worked together to bring us to that day.  It was swift action and continued diligence that protected Boston’s trees from further destruction. APHIS and its cooperators were able to accomplish the goal of eradicating ALB in Boston in less than 4 years.  Thanks also go to a community member who reported the infestation early.  That early detection and report resulted in the loss of only 6 infested trees. But as I celebrate our first victory over the invasive pest in Massachusetts, I am compelled to ask you to remain vigilant in inspecting your trees regularly for signs of the beetle and report any suspicious damage to your State Plant Health Director.

ALB experts Joseph Gittleman of APHIS' Plant Protection and Quarrantine program and Joan Mahoney of the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets recognized Carner in April. Carner first noticed small holes in the Norway maples on his property in Brooklyn, N.Y., in . The holes were slightly smaller than a dime, but larger than the diameter of a pencil. The holes were identified as the exit holes where the invasive ALB emerges from the tree trunk.  At first, Carner thought the holes were the work of vandals, but later spotted the beetle on the same trees, which have a distinct appearance. He reported it to authorities, which eventually led to eradication efforts and regulation changes that are still underway today. The insect has since been found in other areas of New York City, Long Island, Staten Island, northern New Jersey,  Illinois and Massachussetts. Carner also received a certificate of appreciation, a plaque, and an autographed copy of a book about the ALB. It's notable that Carner isn't a trained naturalist, botanist or entomologist—he's a citizen with a sharp eye who knew something was amiss and performed his civic duty in reporting it.

"Reversing Pollinator Decline is Key to Feeding the Future  Without pollinators, we don’t eat—it’s simple as that—and, at the moment, large numbers of pollinators are dying.  With the world’s population projected to exceed 9 billion in just the next 30 years or so, that is not a good position for us to be in. More than 90 species of U.S. specialty crops require pollination, and various animals, including bees, butterflies, moths, bats, and birds are a critical part of the pollinator-plant ecosystem.  Despite the myriad species of pollinators available, American farmers rely on one species of honey bee, Apis mellifera, for most of the pollinator services to pollinate their crops.

"Training Technician, National Detector Dog Training Center in  Animals  Plants  Aug 12,  Thunder attending a course at the National Detector Dog Training Center. My name is Thunder.  Not too many months ago, I was homeless and waiting for someone to take me home from the Houston Beagle Rescue in Houston, Texas.  Then, a nice lady from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s National Detector Dog Training Center (NDDTC) in Newnan, Georgia came to visit.  From that day on, my life changed. At the NDDTC, I met my human handler and my fellow classmates.  What a diverse group!  You see, detector dogs come from places all over the country, including humane societies, beagle rescue groups and private owners.  Before we’re adopted, we go through extensive temperament tests and are evaluated by a licensed veterinarian.  And when we retire from service, or if we don’t meet the training requirements, APHIS ensures that we’re adopted and placed in good homes. My classmates and I trained hard for four whole months and learned how to prevent pests and diseases from coming in on smuggled agricultural products.  I learned the scent of agricultural contraband and how to find it in bags, boxes and parcels.  Beagles and beagle mixes are really good at sniffing out food and agricultural items in luggage and on passengers.  Labs and lab mixes trained hard to patrol international borders, cargo warehouses and postal facilities for smuggled contraband.  Even Jack Russell terriers have a job—they learned to detect invasive brown tree snakes in Guam. Eek! Thunder attending a course at the National Detector Dog Training Center. My job is extra special—I sniff out the invasive Asian Longhorned Beetle, an invasive insect that’s killing trees in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Ohio.  I didn’t know much about the ALB until I started this job, but I did know that my handler kept giving me treats just for sniffing out beetle “frass”, or the sawdust the beetle leaves behind as it chews.  If there is something I am really good at it is sniffing and eating treats.  After all, I am a beagle! My handler says I am part of an important team dedicated to protecting neighborhood trees and this country’s valuable forest resources. Wow!  That’s a lot for a little beagle from Texas to take in, but I am proud to protect America from these harmful pests and diseases.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Kentucky in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Sep 16,  The University of Kentucky is using a Conservation Innovation Grant to improve the efficiency of seasonal high tunnels. NRCS and UK staff view a water line with a high tunnel in the background. NRCS photo. Seasonal high tunnels have emerged in the past few years as an important tool for farmers wanting to extend their growing seasons. Right now, thanks to a Conservation Innovation Grant from USDA, a University of Kentucky professor is studying them – and how they can be made more efficient. Krista Jacobsen, an assistant professor of horticulture, is studying the soil inside of high tunnels and the possibilities of catching rainwater to irrigate crops inside of them. High tunnels are plastic-covered structures that enable farmers to have crops ready earlier or later in the season. In high tunnels, plants are grown directly in the ground, and the sun’s heat regulates the temperature inside. Since , USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service has provided assistance to help producers construct more than 9,000 high tunnels on farms around the country. In the past two years, more than 400 have been installed in Kentucky. Many farmers use drip irrigation to water crops in high tunnels. The water typically comes from natural sources, such as ponds or springs, or from city water. But city water can often cost more and the chemicals sometimes added to it aren’t good for plants because they can cause a buildup of salts, said John Graham, a soil health specialist. Jacobsen is looking at a device that will catch rainwater and then make it available to irrigate crops. This puts natural water to use, simulating rainfall on traditional field crops. Using rainwater also conserves water by not using underground sources.” “A main focus of this project is decreasing the ‘water footprint’ of high tunnel production for a variety of locations in Kentucky,” she said. “In areas with access to city water, this means reducing the use of drinking-quality water for irrigation purposes.” And in rural areas, it offers a low-cost and simple solution for farmers, she said. “Our project focuses on developing rainwater capture systems that are scale-appropriate to the smaller high tunnels popping up throughout Appalachia, and training farmers on efficient irrigation practices using relatively low-cost soil water monitoring equipment,” Jacobsen said. The first of the rainwater catchment devices developed and constructed by the university will be installed and demonstrated for this fall and winter crop. These irrigation systems rely on low-pressure irrigation systems powered by gravity, something the university is studying at two demonstration sites, a partnership with Grow Appalachia in London, Kentucky, and the University of Kentucky Robinson Center for Appalachian Resources for Sustainability in Jackson, Kentucky. The Conservation Innovation Grant program helps groups, like the University of Kentucky, demonstrate innovative approaches to improve soil quality, air quality, and water quality, conserve energy, and enhance wildlife habitat in balance with productive agricultural systems. Just yesterday, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced USDA is investing $15.7 million through grants to 47 entities.

"APHIS Administrator in  Animals  Plants  Aug 01,  Tiny to the naked eye, the adult Asian citrus psyllid is no bigger than a common gnat and feeds with the posterior of its body raised. This invasive insect causes serious damage to citrus plants and citrus plant relatives through its feeding activities (photos are by R. Anson Eaglin, APHIS). USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has declared August as Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month.  Invasive plant pests and diseases are not just a concern of scientists, farmers or horticulturalists; they concern us all.  Invasive pests and diseases of plants—such as Asian citrus pysllid, European grapevine moth, Mediterranean fruit fly, and sudden oak death—can transform communities, harm our economy, and impact human health. APHIS works to stop invasive pests and diseases of plants from arriving on our shores, and to address those that gained a foothold in our communities or that threaten agricultural resources, like citrus.  Through safeguarding activities overseas, on the border and across the country, APHIS helps to ensure a diverse natural ecosystem and an abundant and healthy food supply for all Americans. There have been successes.  Invasive pests now eradicated include the Asian longhorned beetle in Chicago and parts of New Jersey.  Mediterranean fruit fly and Asian Gypsy moth infestations in several states are now eradicated.  But the fight to regulate, contain or eradicate invasive pests continues.  In this effort APHIS works very closely with partners at the federal, state, county and local levels, and at universities, and nongovernmental organizations. But, the most important partner in protecting agricultural and forested resources from invasive pests and diseases are those most familiar with their communities—individuals like you.  By using available tools, you can join heroes like the Massachusetts homeowner who spied shiny black beetles spotted with white in her maples and searched the Internet for information out of concern for children handling the insects.  That Internet search and subsequent report to agricultural officials led to the detection of a significant Asian longhorned beetle infestation. Asian longhorned beetle infestations have been eradicated in Chicago, Illinois and northern New Jersey. This large, showy beetle appears similar to the white spotted sawyer, a native insect, but is a voracious consumer of many tree species, such as maples (photos are by R. Anson Eaglin, APHIS). This month, APHIS will post a series of blog entries here and also share invasive plant pest and disease information through our twitter feed.  Please follow us.  You can also use links and resources on our website to get involved.  Armed with knowledge, you can help.  It is a fight for our communities, our public lands, and for our agricultural resources.

"USDA and Peace Corps Team Up in Screwworm Eradication Efforts in Panama  Over the past few months, USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), as part of the U.S. Panama Commission for Eradication of Screwworm, has started to partner with Peace Corps Volunteers in Panama to enhance APHIS’ surveillance activities. Volunteers will be working in rural Panama and meeting with local communities to raise awareness about as well as report suspected cases of New World screwworm, one of the most costly and economically significant pests of livestock in South America. The New World screwworm is a parasite of warm-blooded animals, including humans. Female screwworms are attracted to and lay their eggs in exposed flesh wounds.  After eggs hatch, larvae burrow and feed on flesh, causing severe tissue damage and may even be lethal to the host. The screwworm was eradicated from the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Curacao and, finally, all of Central America in using the Sterile Insect Technique in which sterile male flies are released in massive numbers to mate with wild female populations. The mated female flies then lay non-viable eggs, leading to a decrease and subsequent eradication of screwworm populations. To prevent the screwworm from spreading north of South America, The Commission is maintaining a barrier at the Darien Gap between Panama and Colombia, by utilizing both preventive release of sterile flies and field surveillance.

"-Cooperative Service Administrator, Sam Rikkers in  Rural  Jan 12,  Kentucky Highlands Promise Zone invests in local foods. As a law student, I spent a summer working and living with the Sokoagon Band of the Chippewa, a Native American tribe located in rural Northern Wisconsin.  Tribal leaders and members extended to me their kindness, friendship, passion and laughter.  They are some of our country’s finest. But, make no mistake, the Sokoagon face challenges shared by many persistently poor rural communities across our country. That summer, I saw with new eyes the importance of dependable and consistent employment, housing, health care systems and education.  That summer I also saw that for many rural Americans these things, taken for granted by many, are luxuries. These agents of economic development are not only critical to a person’s economic success, they are necessary to the success and fate of all people and thriving communities. While our nation is in the heart of a strong economic recovery, too many of our rural communities continue to struggle to build a resilient middle-class. For decades, rural Americans have worked harder and harder, yet found it increasingly more difficult to get ahead in our modern economy.  As a means to uphold his commitment to rural America, the Promise Zone Initiative is part of President Obama’s plan to create a better bargain for the middle-class. This Initiative is driven by three core principles: 1) engage and partner with communities, 2) build community capacity for planning and implementation, and 3) learn from what worked and what didn’t. As we round out the holiday season and gear up for a new year, let’s first start by looking back on the past year and highlight our Promise Zones’ exceptional work. At the heart of the Promise Zone initiative are communities and middle- and low-income families. Many are on the cusp of success, but need the right tools to create jobs, expand educational opportunities, increase economic activity, leverage private investment, and reduce violent crime. Choctaw Youth visit with President Obama. Last year, President Obama emphasized that communities make the greatest progress when we “bring together local government and nonprofits and businesses and teachers and parents around a shared goal,” and when, “[All hold] themselves accountable by delivering measurable results.” Our first four rural and tribal Promise Zones, Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Kentucky Highlands, South Carolina Low Country, and Pine Ridge Reservation of the Oglala Sioux Tribe are yielding substantial results. Accessible local food is a staple in American culture. The Kentucky Highlands Promise Zone’s has seen enormous strides in developing a strong local food economy. In early July, local partners of the Kentucky Highlands Promise Zone announced the creation of a low-interest loan fund for small farmers in the 54-county SOAR region of eastern and southern Kentucky. Investments like these mean real opportunities for small growers who want to make strategic investments in expanding their operations. Like electricity was 80 years ago, access to broadband service in rural America can make or break a community.  Broadband is no longer a luxury, but a critical piece of infrastructure. In early July , President Obama announced the ConnectHome initiative, selecting the Choctaw Nation as one of the pilot areas where the federal government and the private sector would partner to expand high-speed broadband. Today, the ConnectHome initiative is making a real difference in people’s lives, linking homes and businesses to a world beyond the small communities of the Choctaw. A street sign highlights the budding South Carolina Low Country Promise Zone partnerships. Revitalizing a stagnant rural economy is tough without critical investments attracting good-paying dependable jobs. The South Carolina Low Country Promise Zone knows this first-hand. Recently, USDA invested over $8 million in water and waste infrastructure in Hampton County, South Carolina, supporting the development of a regional industrial park. In total, the Promise Zone a whopping $312 million in capital investment and 153 jobs created since September . For communities focused on the bread and butter of economic recovery, planning is fundamental. The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation is opening a planning office to ensure investments are harnessed and deployed effectively. The Pine Ridge Promise Zone has received federal technical assistance and investments to help build basic infrastructure such as water and waste systems and vital community facilities supporting a tribal college and the Oglala Sioux Tribe’s public safety system. As we look toward our third and final round of applicants, the impact of the Promise Zone initiative on these four American communities is powerful. Our communities, federal agencies, and partners will continue to work alongside one another, providing boots-on-the-ground partnership and access to the vital resources necessary to make good on our shared promise.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Food and Nutrition  Jul 03,   USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service started its Fourth of July “party” a little early this year, hosting a bilingual Twitter party on June 28 to answer its tweeps’ food safety questions in advance of any gatherings they are hosting. “Ask Karen,” FSIS’ virtual food safety representative, and her Spanish-language counterpart “Pregúntele a Karen” answered  questions from @USDAFoodSafety and @USDAFoodSafe_es about food safety around the Fourth of July holiday and summer in general.  Foodborne illness rises in summer because bacteria grow faster in warmer temperatures. Since Fourth of July celebrations center around food and the outdoors, FSIS took to the Twittersphere to reach a large audience about the importance of safe food handling and to clarify any confusion about cooking food, storing leftovers, and more.  Here is a wrap-up of the chat, which used the hashtag to facilitate the conversation: Q1 RT .@abbebrown_jail: What's the best way to defrost meat?  A1 .@abbebrown_jail: The best way to defrost is in the fridge! If you don't have time, microwave or cold H2O ow.ly/bTnF8  Q2 RT .@DCSpinman is it ok to grill burgers and chicken at the same time, or seperately?  A2 Chicken & burgers can grill at the same time! Cook poultry to 165F and burgers to 160F. Use a food thermometer.  Q3 .@ktaylorphotos: How long can potato salad stay out before it goes bad?

"Acting South Dakota State Director, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Jan 22,  Little Wound School students hold round table discussions on their vision of the future. Tribal elder Cecilia Fire Thunder facilitated. Recently USDA Rural Development staff in South Dakota spent two days at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, home of the Oglala Sioux, where they met with Tribal leaders, educators and other Federal partners.  They made this trip as part of a broader administration effort to change the way the federal government works with communities. This approach values residents’ knowledge of their communities’ strengths and needs; it also includes local leaders as essential partners and collaborators. Jennifer Irving, Director of Regional Equity for Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation, a local non-profit intimately involved in one-such effort at Pine Ridge said, “It is important to coordinate engagement of the Promise Zone stakeholders to ensure that Tribal Leadership’s vision and priorities are being met while optimizing Tribal commitment of time and resources.” Pine Ridge was designated a Promise Zone last April and in July a Presidential Disaster Declaration was received following severe summer storms. Since then the federal government, the Oglala Sioux Tribal government, and local organizations, such as Thunder Valley and other key partners have been working collaboratively to ensure activities, investments, and projects of the many entities across the reservation have broad-based community support and coordinated, and likely to yield results for residents. Dr. Richard Zephier provided an overview of the CEDS process and long term vision to develop a stronger economy for Pine Ridge. Visiting Rural Development staff were given an overview of the wide array of work underway including the Tribe’s work on a proposed Tribal Planning Office and a Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) that will lay out a long term vision for developing a stronger economy for Pine Ridge.  Other topics covered included recovery efforts underway in partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recovery efforts and an overview of the work two local organizations, Mazaska and Lakota Funds, are doing to identify housing and other finance-related needs. At Oglala Lakota College we met with President Shortbull who talked about work underway to develop an Ag Expo Center that would be instrumental in making local food a path for economic development. The College has already raised a substantial amount toward the expected total project need. A representative from each of the round table break-out sessions provided the entire group a synopsis of the top issues that were drawn out of the round table discussion at their respective table. This project will create educational opportunities in the community by increasing training and hands on experience for producers of all types of agricultural production on Pine Ridge. It will expand their economic opportunities by providing a place where producers can work in a commercial kitchen or work with large animals in a modern facility. This project has broad public support and holds significant potential for the Tribe and people living at Pine Ridge. While at Pine Ridge we also heard directly from Oglala Sioux youth at a roundtable with high school students at Little Wound School.  Of all of the meetings over the course of the two days, this opportunity to connect with the students at Little Wound that really hit home. The stories of hope, struggle and the students’ passion inspired us even more with the work ahead. Persistent poverty and lack of infrastructure investment have taken their toll at Pine Ridge. Now, these placed–based efforts aims to leverage investments, increase economic activity, improve educational opportunities and improve the quality of life in the area through focused work on the six goals the community has identified as instrumental to improve the economic health of the area, increase the quality of life and accelerate the work to create comprehensive community revitalization. First, accelerate job creation by building the foundation for new businesses including implementation of workforce development programs to ensure people are trained with the skills to fill new positions. Second, increase economic activity by addressing economic issues at the systemic level—like expanding increasing banking options and affordable housing for the workforce on the Reservation. Third, improve educational opportunities on the Reservation from primary school through the post-secondary level by offering Lakota immersion education, charter school options and opportunities at the Oglala Lakota College. Fourth, improve public safety Reservation by addressing substance abuse issues and strengthening the justice system. Fifth, provide affordable, low maintenance, energy efficient housing for residents of the Reservation, focusing on key issues like affordable rent, homeownership and middle income housing by developing the real estate market and increasing access to capital. Sixth, systematically develop infrastructure by providing the Tribal government with the ability to operate, maintain, and replace current infrastructure and facilitate future development. A representative from each of the round table break-out sessions provided the entire group a synopsis of the top issues that were drawn out of the round table discussion at their respective table. The Promise Zone Initiative is part of the President’s plan to partner with local communities, businesses and Tribes to create jobs, increase economic security, expand educational opportunities, increase access to quality, affordable housing and improve public safety.  To date, thirteen Promise Zones have been designated across the country; Pine Ridge is one of only two Tribal Promise Zones.  Seven more Promise Zones will be designated in and applications are currently being accepted. We know that increasingly, the community where a child grows up in impacts her odds of graduating high school, her health outcomes, and her lifetime economic opportunities. The Administration has been steadily embarking on a different approach to working with communities to ensure where a child is born never determines her destiny. The Promise Zone Initiative is one of the Administration’s community-based initiatives in action across the country.  In these places federal experts are working side by side with residents and local leaders to create customized solutions; bolstering coordination across agencies and improving how we interact with communities as a ‘one Government’ partner; and relying on valuable to help inform solutions and evaluate what’s working and what’s not. The Promise Zone designation enables USDA to work more collaboratively with other federal agencies in partnership with the Oglala Sioux and others across the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation on efforts to increase economic mobility and create opportunities across the entire region.  To view all active community-based initiatives in your community, visit www.whitehouse.gov/omb/place.

"Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Jul 03,  A family dinner of marinated chicken and grilled vegetables. Photo by Christopher Leonard.  With Independence Day just around the corner, families across the nation are making preparations to honor the day as the grill chef, king of Castle Suburbia, lord of the living room, master of the flames, marches forth. With a meaty feast to honor the day, the Fourth of July has become almost as much a celebration of grilling greatness as it is a celebration of the nation’s independence. However, all that glitters isn’t gold and an infection of Salmonellosis can quickly knock the grill king off his throne and onto another. Fittingly, the Fourth of July sits in the middle of grilling season. The amber flames roaring up between the grill grates can easily give the false impression of bringing death to all bacteria. However, don’t be misled. Preparing burgers on the grill is a quest that must be tackled safely. Taking the four oaths of food safety (clean, separate, cook and chill) will ensure a feast free from visits to the porcelain throne, or worse, a trip to the emergency room. The battle against foodborne illness begins on the way home from the store. Separating raw meat products from ready-to-eat products on the journey home is an essential step in preventing cross-contamination. Cooking hamburgers to 160 degrees will safely kill Salmonella and dangerous E. coli bacteria, but it does no good if you contaminated a salad with raw meat juice. And the specter of Salmonella isn’t constrained to poultry. No, the risk from this bug reaches to beef, pork and other meats as well as poultry. Ever hear the phrase “clean as you cook?” It’s sage advice considering cross contamination can ruin nearly any dish. Cutting boards, cabinet handles, countertops, basically anything you may touch with your dirty, meaty hands can potentially transmit pathogens. A recent FSIS-sponsored study asked 80 consumers to prepare a meal including a fruit salad and meat dish. The meat provided was inoculated with L. casei, a bacterium found in yogurt, to test average food safety preparation. Half of the group heard food safety messages and half did not. Despite this, 90 percent of the fruit salads were contaminated with the target bacteria. Kitchen towels were a major source of contamination, but the sink, refrigerator, oven and trash cabinet handles were also contaminated, just waiting to infect something else. Check back soon for more information on this study’s findings. If the grill king’s subjects use proper techniques (see FoodSafety.gov for tips), there is still the matter of cooking the meat. Despite the common advice of cooking to color or checking juices, the ONLY way of ensuring doneness is with a food thermometer. Nothing else, short of dragon fire will do. Finally, keep cool by keeping food cool. Don’t leave food out in the hot summer air without a way to chill it. Again, fightback.org is a good source for tips on what foods can stay out and for how long. Stick to these four oaths of food safety and the grill king and his guests will enjoy the feast to honor the day. Make it a safe one.

"Ensuring Healthy Meals during the Summer Helps Kids Head Back to Class Ready to Learn  Children who live in the Franklin Vista Apartments in Anthony, N.M., didn’t have to walk far to receive a healthy breakfast and lunch this summer, thanks to Gadsden ISD Food Service Director Demetrious Giovas.  He made sure children there were able to gather under the covered porch of the apartment community center for a nutritious meal.  The school district set up tables each day to ensure the kids had access to healthy food while school was out of session. For the first time, Gadsden ISD provided daily breakfasts and lunches to children at apartments through the Seamless Summer Option of the National School Lunch Program. Food was prepared at the local elementary school, where it was distributed to 14 sites including Franklin Vista Apartments, as well as churches, other community-based facilities and schools.  Throughout the summer, sites sponsored by the school district provided an average of 2,000 lunches and 1,900 breakfasts each weekday.

"Oconaluftee Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Initiatives  Nov 25,  Students at the Oconaluftee Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center in Cherokee practice their choreography for a new student-produced fitness video. (Photo courtesy of Holly Krake/OJCCCC) Pop music star Beyonce recently partnered with First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! initiative to create the Let’s Move! Flash Workout.  The Oconaluftee Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center in Cherokee, N.C. has embraced the Let’s Move! concept, and launched a Healthy Eating and Active Lifestyles program. Oconaluftee has gotten behind this national movement by producing a student fitness video using the music and choreography of the Let’s Move! Flash Workout.   As with many songs, the name ‘Move Your Body’ says it all. The flash workout is a dance, an exercise, and a fun activity that all students can participate in. Over 20 students performed the flash workout in front of the entire campus to show how simple and easy it is.  “It was truly amazing and I really enjoyed it” said student choreographer Kayosha Roseboro. For several days leading up to the showcase, students learned the steps, the rhythm changes, and how to coordinate movement in a large group. The flash workout also allowed for many styles of dance including Dancehall, Hip Hop, Salsa, ‘old school’ Running Man, and today’s top moves like ‘the Dougie’. Beyonce’s lyrics throughout the song ‘Move Your Body,’ encourage those who may be hesitant to get active, “a little sweat never hurt nobody” and that realize that there is no wrong way to get moving. “This whole campaign is about encouraging people around the country to move their body in any way, shape, or form but just move your body” concluded Roseboro. As an education and training program focused on young adults, Forest Service Job Corps can play a critical role in helping students make healthy choices as adults. “What we’re talking about is shifting a sedentary and unhealthy body mindset to one of smart food choices and energizing activities” said campus Trainee Employee Assistance Program Coordinator, Lakeisha Gallaspy.  “If a flash workout is what it takes in then that’s what we’ll do!” The Oconaluftee Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center works closely with the Forest Service’s National Forests in North Carolina. It is accredited by the Council on Occupational Education and currently serves 104 students. The mission of the U.S. Forest Service is to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations. Recreational activities on our lands contribute $14.5 billion annually to the U.S. economy. The agency manages 193 million acres of public land, provides assistance to state and private landowners, and maintains the largest forestry research organization in the world.

"Office of Communication, USDA Forest Service in  Forestry  Jul 03,  View of the Milky Way over Cathedral Rock, seen from the Cathedral Rock Trailhead on Back O' Beyond Road, Coconino National Forest, Sedona, Arizona, April 30, . (USDA Forest Service photo by Deborah Lee Soltesz) The country’s annual celebration of its independence is not complete without family gatherings, picnics, parades, and the sights and sounds of fireworks. Yet on national forests and grasslands, fireworks and other explosives are prohibited permanently. Public lands provide another option for celebrating the Fourth: Simply look up at night. Nature’s light show can provide its own “oohs and ahhs.” Stargazing, especially in areas where darkness is broken only by campfires, provides spectacular shows. Although fireworks are not allowed, national forests and grasslands are the perfect spaces to spend your holiday. They provide entertainment for everyone, from camping, to cookouts, to places to enjoy water recreation. If camping or picnicking is what you are planning, make sure you check with the local ranger district of your national forest or grassland for any bans on open flames, whether it’s a fire pit, grill or campfire. Even if there are no bans, please be cautious. The rule to ensuring your campfire is out is to drown, stir, drown and feel with the back of your hand to ensure the fire is fully out. Letting a campfire die out naturally is not safe. Hot embers could be smoldering underneath the ashes and could reignite. Remember, the ashes should be cold to the touch. You can also use a mesh dome over fire pits to help stop embers from flying in the air and landing on dry grass. These embers could spark a fire in an area further than your campsite. Other safety tips include being careful to not park on tall, dry grass. The heat from the car, or chains dragging along the ground if you are pulling something, could spark a fire.

USDA is ready to support the housing needs of all people living in rural and Tribal communities. Take, for instance, Norma Nix, a resident of Mineral Hills, New Mexico. When a forest fire destroyed her family home, USDA Rural Development stepped in to help. “I lost everything on Mother’s Day—my entire home, my photos, and of my children’s childhood memories,” Nix explained. Through the Rural Disaster Housing Repair Grant Program, Norma was able to apply for assistance and rebuild her new home. Stories like Norma’s highlight how USDA is helping rural and Tribal Americans and is committed to aiding families who lost their homes to disaster. USDA Rural Development’s number one program, Single Family Housing Direct Home Loans, enables qualified lower-income applicants to buy homes with no money down. Kailee Meyer, a recent graduate and resident of Jasper County, Iowa, realized her dream of homeownership through this program. “When I graduated from Central College in Pella, I wondered what I was going to do for housing,” said Meyer. “I never had to worry about it before”. Meyer researched USDA after a family friend introduced the idea to her and found the program that helped her purchase the home of her dreams. Since its inception, approximately 2.2 million families and individuals have purchased homes with USDA’s Single Family Housing Direct Loans program. President Biden announced a plan to increase affordable housing throughout the country, especially in rural areas. The plan aims to close America’s housing supply shortfall by creating and preserving hundreds of thousands of affordable housing units. It will also help renters struggling with high rental costs by focusing on building and preserving rental housing for low- and moderate-income families. For more information about homeownership, home repair, and rental assistance programs, visit the Single Family Housing program webpage or contact a Rural Development State Office to learn more about USDA homeownership programs near you.

"AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Dec 20,  Years ago, I spent my days watching pecan roots change the color of solutions from clear to red as they reduced iron for uptake. It may not sound exciting, but that was the topic of my undergraduate research internship at USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Children’s Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) in Houston, TX, under the direction of my mentor, ARS scientist Dr. Michael Grusak. Dr. Grusak taught me to consider the link between the laboratory and society. His lab focused on improving crop mineral uptake, which could benefit society by increasing the nutritional value of crops for humans. The emphasis on this connection between plant biology and society stimulated my interest in plant biology and, eventually, led me to pursue my own Ph.D. in plant physiology and genetics. Now, that summer job has led me back to USDA as a Science and Technology Policy Fellow through the American Association of the Advancement of Science in the USDA Office of the Chief Scientist, where I work directly to connect science to society. In my new role, I’m able to use science to inform agricultural policy making decisions by collaborating with others in USDA to develop science-based solutions to emerging issues, especially those related to improving agricultural resilience in response to climate change. As an undergraduate intern, I was excited to contribute to ARS research, but never imagined that the roots I put down at CNRC would lead me back to USDA, supporting priorities that help advance American agriculture and aid in an all-of-government approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change. ARS internship opportunities support future generations of the agricultural workforce. My internship introduced me to the importance of agricultural research and attracted me to a career where I could use science to inform agricultural policy.

"Regional Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Apr 23,  For the people living on Smith Island, the water matters. But it’s about more than the beautiful views of the Chesapeake Bay from the picturesque island ten miles from the mainland. The multi-generational residents depend on the surrounding Chesapeake Bay for their livelihoods. For many, crabbing, oystering, and ecotourism are what puts dollars in their bank accounts, and food on their tables. In rural communities like Smith Island, located in and along the Chesapeake Bay, aging wastewater facilities are in need of upgrades. Not only can this be an expensive problem for towns with small populations, but without the critical upgrades, the threat of combined sewer overflows from more frequent weather events and climate change could contribute to pollution of the Chesapeake Bay. So, what is being done to help these rural communities protect the environment and preserve a way of life that impacts so many? USDA Rural Development and partners are answering the call by investing in state-of-the art, modern wastewater treatment facilities in communities like Smith Island and many others located throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Smith Island Wastewater Treatment Facility Smith Island’s wastewater treatment facility consisted of two pump stations, serving the three communities that make up Smith Island: Ewell, Rhodes Point, and Tylerton. After four decades and prolonged exposure to the elements, the components of the wastewater treatment facility began to corrode, break down, and fail. This left the surrounding bay and wildlife vulnerable to combined sewer overflows. Federal, state, and local agencies collaborated on a solution: a new, modern wastewater treatment facility. Through the Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant Program, USDA Rural Development provided the community with $83,000 in loan, and $5,000,000 in grant funds, with other partners providing the balance, to help the community afford the $22.3 million Smith Island Wastewater Treatment Facility. Peter Bozick, Executive Vice President of George, Miles & Buhr, LLC, the engineer and architecture firm that designed the new facility said, “The island is sinking slowly due to climate change and rising sea levels, and the former infrastructure was susceptible to flooding. In addition to replacing the treatment facility with new materials that can resist corrosion, we raised the pumping stations about five feet higher in order to be above the 100-year flood zone.” Read more about how this significant investment in improving infrastructure on Smith Island is contributing to a positive outlook for the future of Smith Island.

Recognized every year on April 15, Titanic Remembrance Day honors the more than 1,500 people who lost their lives in the early hours of that day. Though experts still debate the main causes of the maritime catastrophe, we know some details about the voyage. For example, two copies of the first-class dinner menu from April 14 were recovered and preserved. Many restaurants in the United States recreate it in memory of the day. Below, USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service pairs some of the foods served then with current U.S. agricultural statistics: The meal started with oysters ($284.9 million in sales), cream of barley soup (1.9 million acres (, 2.1 ) of barley harvested in ), and poached salmon (the United States had 13 Atlantic salmon farms and two Pacific salmon farms in *).

There is a wealth of historical that’s inaccessible because today’s crop model software applications cannot easily interpret it. USDA’s National Agricultural Library (NAL) is working with the University of Florida and the Agricultural Research Network (ARDN) to solve this problem. ARDN is dedicated to making high value datasets from past research and experiments compatible with crop models and other analytical tools. With support from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), NAL and the University of Florida are piloting a “hackathon” approach to make this old useful. Experts gather several times a year to create standardized vocabulary and extract relevant information to use in the AgMIP Crop Experiment schema (ACE) – a widely used format for agricultural models. As part of the NIFA grant, the team will annotate four datasets using ARDN protocols. The initial datasets include research from projects at Iowa State University, University of Georgia, the University of Arizona, and the Kellogg Biological Station. These annotated datasets will be available on NAL’s Ag Commons website. NAL also supports ARDN by hosting VMapper software on the Ag Commons website. VMapper creates a file which contains the “road map” for translating the original into the ACE format.

"Survey Administration Branch Chief, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Research and Science  Oct 26,  Last week, the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) began collecting for its first ever Hemp Acreage and Production Survey. Hemp is a commodity that can be used for numerous industrial and horticultural purposes, including fabric, food products, cosmetics, and more. Yet, there is no comprehensive, national production for it. That’s where NASS comes in. NASS conducts hundreds of surveys each year as well as the Census of Agriculture, which is done every five years. As a result, the agency maintains the most comprehensive list of agricultural operations in the United States. NASS has extensive experience in not only using the list to conduct studies of various agricultural populations but also doing so securely and confidentially. For the hemp survey, NASS did more than just use its own comprehensive list of operations. The agency also gathered information from partners at USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service, Risk Management Agency, and Farm Service Agency as well as state departments of agriculture and other sources. Any records provided by these sources that were not found on the NASS list were included in the survey. To design the survey itself, NASS conducted cognitive interviews with hemp growers to determine correct terminology and understanding of questions. The result of this hard work will be survey that set the benchmark for hemp acreage and production, and provide needed to regulatory agencies, producers, state governments, processors, and other key industry entities. NASS is encouraging producers to respond online at agcounts.usda.gov.

"A Home for the Backbone of California Agriculture  California and agriculture go hand in hand; it’s hard to talk about one without mentioning the other. Similarly, we can’t talk about our farmers and ranchers and not mention the farm workers – the backbone of California’s agriculture industry.

"Posted by Doug O'Brien, Acting Under Secretary, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Technology  Oct 22,  A Matanuska Telephone Association Lineman works to bring high-speed broadband to Chickaloon and Glacier View. Photo courtesy MTA. Today, Secretary Vilsack announced over $190 million of investment in broadband projects through USDA's Community Connect program, the Public Television Digital Transition Grant, and the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program. Time and time again, we hear stories about the significant impact USDA’s investments have in the lives of hard working Americans, and we know that an investment in our rural communities is an investment in America. At the terminus of the majestic Matanuska Glacier in Southcentral Alaska sits the tiny community of Glacier View. It's better than an hour's drive northwest of Palmer, the headquarters of the Matanuska Telephone Association (MTA). With a population of fewer than 250 residents, the unincorporated community hosts a lodge, a gas station, and tourism-related businesses that provide visitors access to the massive glacier just south of  the community. Not far down the road you'll find Glacier View School, a K-12 public school that serves children in the area. Chickaloon is a half an hour down the road, and is home to tourism businesses, artisans manufacturing by hand uniquely Alaskan crafts, lodging and food, as well as the home of the Athabascan Nation Chickaloon Village. An aerial shot of the terminus of the Matanuska Glacier at Glacier View, Alaska. Photo courtesy U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service With the investment of a USDA Community Connect grant, MTA is adding Glacier View, Chickaloon, and others to the growing list of communities with access to high speed broadband. Matanuska Telephone Association was founded as a cooperative over 60 years ago, and has a service area covering over 10,000 square miles – larger than the entire state of Vermont. With a USDA Community Connect investment, and local investment from MTA, students, families, manufacturers, small businesses, and Native communities will have access to upwards of 10 Mbps upload and download speeds – that allows these very rural communities to connect and compete globally. Additionally, with the Community Connect grant, the folks that live along the Glenn Highway between Chickaloon and Glacier View will also have access to a brand new Community Connect Center providing free broadband access for the next two years. The Community Connect grant creates an opportunity for USDA to partner with our cooperatives and other public and private sector entities to provide rural residents access to advancing technology, to help educate students, and to give rural crafters and manufacturers access to a global customer base. As Secretary Vilsack said in today’s announcement, “Modern telecommunications and broadband access is as essential to the businesses and residents of Rural America as electricity was in the s.” Investing in rural America adds to the economic viability of rural communities, which strengthens the nation’s economy and helps all of America to thrive. In the words of President Obama, “Strong rural communities are key to a stronger America.” For more on how USDA investments are helping build a stronger rural America in your area, check your state fact sheet: usda.gov/opportunity.

"Already Planning to Feed More Kids than Ever During Summer   Now that summer has come and gone, I’m happy to announce that this season the USDA Rural Housing Service was able to partner with the USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to feed more kids than ever before. Three hundred and five Rural Housing Service Multi-Family Housing properties participated in FNS’ Summer Meal Programs, which provide low-income children with free, healthy meals during the summer when school is out. This is 121 more affordable housing communities we were able to serve than the year before, and almost triple the number from . This is a huge success, and I’m so proud of my team across the country for feeding more kids at our properties than ever before!

"International Trade and Development Branch, Economic Research Service and Gopi Munisamy, Director, Market and Trade Economics Division in  Research and Science  Trade  May 09,  In terms of employment growth, sectors outside of farming have been the major beneficiaries of agricultural exports in the past dozen years. Starting around , a divergence appears between the estimated numbers of farm and nonfarm jobs, with the latter accounting for a rising share of total employment supported by agricultural exports. Did you know that the United States is the world’s second largest agricultural exporter after the European Union? Agricultural trade supports American jobs and spurs non-farm economic activity. In , U.S. agricultural exports over one million full-time civilian jobs, including 764,000 jobs in the nonfarm sector. Each dollar of U.S. agricultural exports supported an additional $1.28 in farm and non-farm business activity. Moreover, U.S. agricultural trade surplus has historically helped to offset some of the trade deficit in non-agricultural sectors. Understanding agricultural trade trends, opportunities and challenges help inform policy decisions on trade. That is why the Economic Research Service (ERS) conducts research and analysis on the economic and policy factors underlying U.S. and global agricultural trade. Some ERS are broad in scope, focusing on factors that affect the international competitiveness of the U.S. food and agriculture sectors. The Global Landscape of Agricultural Trade, - explores growth and change in global agricultural trade and ways in which key policies have affected global trade patterns. During the last two decades, global agricultural trade volume has risen over 3.5 percent per year, and five countries—Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, and China—account for much of that increase in trade due to rising incomes and productivity growth. Other ERS research focuses on the export potential of key emerging markets and agricultural commodities of interest to U.S. producers. For example, India is the world’s largest producer and consumer of milk and has the world’s largest dairy herd. A recent ERS report, India’s Dairy Sector: Structure, Performance, and Prospects, finds that future production prospects depend heavily on productivity gains, primarily through improved breeding and feeding practices, and demand for feeds and improved genetics may offer opportunities for increased trade. Another recent ERS report, China’s Foreign Agriculture Investments, explores alternative motivations of China’s overseas investments in agriculture and their implications for U.S. agricultural exports to China. In addition, ERS works with USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) to provide forecasts for agricultural trade in the United States. These forecasts of current and next year U.S. exports and imports cover major agricultural commodities. ERS’s Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States (FATUS) provide monthly estimates of U.S. agricultural imports and exports—both value and volume—by country and commodity. Using U.S. farm-cash-receipts , ERS also estimates annual U.S. agricultural export values by State and commodity. To learn more about agricultural trade, visit the International Markets & U.S. Trade section of the ERS website and view a presentation on The Global Landscape of Agricultural Trade. Between and , world agricultural trade more than tripled in nominal terms (not adjusted for inflation) and nearly doubled in real terms (adjusted for inflation). Key factors driving this expansion include a more than 25-percent increase in the world’s population and about a 75-percent increase in the real size of the world’s economy. Other factors have also stimulated agricultural trade, including falling trade barriers and technological advances in agricultural production, transportation, information, and communications.

"Foreign Agricultural Service Public Affairs Specialist in  Trade  Aug 05,  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack speaks at the National Export Initiative (NEI) “New Markets, New Jobs” tour in Milwaukee, Wis. on Aug. 3, . The focus of the tour is to help small- and medium-sized businesses gain access to the resources they need to export their products internationally.  Earlier this year, the U.S. government kicked off the nationwide National Export Initiative “New Markets, New Jobs” tour designed to help connect small businesses with the resources they need to sell their products globally. The most recent stop on the tour took place in Milwaukee on August 3. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack hosted the event, which was collaboration between USDA, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), the U.S, Department of Commerce (DOC), the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Export-Import Bank (EXIM). Vilsack was in Wisconsin to focus on the state’s success story, as farm exports grew 36 percent over figures, delivering a record $2.4 billion in sales. Only Texas and Tennessee farm exports grew at a better rate. Wisconsin’s agriculture industry supports nearly 350,000 jobs in the state, or 1 in 10 jobs overall. In Milwaukee and other cities on the “New Markets, New Jobs” tour, small businesses learn about a variety of export assistance programs available to them. One such program is FAS’s Market Access Program (MAP). Through MAP, FAS helps agribusinesses with promotional efforts, technical assistance, market research and more. In alone, more than 625 new small businesses joined the thousands of companies already benefiting from MAP. Last year, WildRoots, a snack food company that is headquartered in Oklahoma and has productions facilities in Illinois and Nebraska, exported nearly $6.5 million worth of their healthy treats to Canada. While $6.5 million in exports may be a small feat for a major American food corporation, for a small agribusiness like WildRoots – who as of hadn’t begun exporting their products – achieving such a sale and gaining international customers is invaluable to the future of their business. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) like WildRoots are vital to achieving President Obama’s NEI goal of doubling all U.S. exports by the end of . As part of this initiative, the President is committed to helping U.S. farmers and small businesses expand their access to international markets. USDA and the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), which has been the department’s lead agency for accessing overseas markets for more than 50 years, have taken the President’s NEI challenge to heart. WildRoots used MAP for support with their marketing efforts in Canada. According to one of the company’s founders, without MAP “we simply would never have been able to compete with Canadian producers. It has moved our business to a new level.” MAP funding can also be used to help SMEs offset the cost of participating in USDA-endorsed international trade shows, which is another significant way FAS has helped SMEs boost international sales. In alone, USDA supported U.S. pavilions at 27 international food shows in 19 countries. Nearly 1,000 exhibitors – mostly SMEs – reported $179 million in on-site sales and more than $1 billion in 12-month sales, all resulting from their participation in these shows. Ultimately, by helping increase the agricultural exports among American SMEs, FAS is helping the United States stay on the road to economic recovery.  Even in this trying time in American economic history, agricultural exports continue to thrive. By the end of fiscal year , the United States is forecast to reach a record-breaking $137 billion in agricultural export sales. In calendar year , the first full year under NEI, U.S. agricultural exports reached $116 billion – an 18 percent increase over the previous year. For $1 billion in agricultural exports supports 8,400 American jobs and generates $1.31 billion in economic activity.  This means that increased exports for our nation’s agricultural small businesses is good for news for all Americans. “Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack speaks at the National Export Initiative (NEI) “New Markets, New Jobs” tour in Milwaukee, Wis. on Aug. 3, .

"Posted by acampbell in  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Research and Science  Apr 08,   During the third day of his visit to Japan, Agriculture Secretary Vilsack had another packed day – starting with a successful bilateral meeting with his Japanese counterpart, and concluding with a series of events commemorating the 50th anniversary of a ‘hog lift’ in which Iowa farmers sent 36 hogs to Yamanashi, Japan. Prior to traveling to Yamanashi, Secretary Vilsack met with the Minister of Agriculture Hirotaka Akamatsu to discuss a wide range of agriculture topics of interest to both the United States and Japan. During their meeting, they discussed science-based solutions to U.S. beef and beef products and global food security. Additionally, Vilsack reiterated the United States’ commitment to achieving an ambitious and balanced conclusion to the Doha Round and his belief that a Doha success can be achieved if all major economies—including Japan—are willing to come to the negotiating table. Vilsack said, “This [beef] issue remains a high priority for the United States and the U.S. objective remains a framework that is consistent with science and international standards. Minister Akamatsu and I concluded our meeting by confirming that the U.S. - Japan bilateral relationship in agriculture is a strong and positive one and vowed to continue in this direction.” On the heels of his meeting with Minister Akamatsu, Secretary Vilsack boarded a train traditionally used by the Emperor for a scenic two hour ride to Kofu in the Yamanashi Prefecture for the 50th Anniversary Celebration of the now-famous “hog lift” – when generous Iowa farmers sent a group of 36 hogs to Yamanashi after Japan’s hogs were nearly wiped out by a major typhoon.  Three years after the hogs’ arrival, the original hogs had multiplied to more than 500. Vilsack had previously traveled to Japan to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the event. Upon arrival in Kofu, the Secretary, his wife, and the rest of the U.S. delegation were greeted by local elementary school children singing and playing traditional Japanese taiko drums – an event that included Yamanashi Governor Shomei Yokouchi and other Prefecture officials. Secretary Vilsack then paid a visit to the Yamanashi Prefectural Museum of Art where he participated in a tree-planting ceremony of an oak tree—Iowa’s official state tree—on the grounds of the museum to mark the 50th anniversary.  In his dedication, Secretary Vilsack stressed the importance of the diplomatic bond that had been formed between the United States and Japan as a result of this event, noting that just as the tree planted today will continue to grow stronger roots and larger branches, so too would the relationship between Japan and the U.S. grow more solid over the next 50 years of friendship and cooperation. Later that evening, Vilsack offered congratulatory remarks at the 50th anniversary ceremony where he celebrated the sister-state relationship that has been formed between Iowa and Yamanashi and how this reminds us of the benefits of cooperation and trade.  After the traditional breaking of the sake barrel to begin the festivities, Iron Chef Yukio Hattori presented an award to the winners of contest to come up with the best recipe using products grown in Iowa and Yamanashi. Secretary Vilsack (second from the left) joined (l-r) U.S. Ambassador Roos, Iowa Governor Bill Northey, Yamanashi Governor Shomei Yokouchi, and the Speaker of the Yamanashi Diet to plant an oak tree—Iowa’s official state tree—on the grounds of the Yamanashi Prefectural Museum of Art to recognize the longstanding friendship between the two states and countries.

"WS District Supervisor, Rhinelander, WI in  Animals  Plants  Nov 22,  Seeding a lake with wild rice (photo provided by the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission) When summertime begins to transition to autumn in northern Wisconsin, towards the end of August and early September, Native Americans wait with anticipation for the Wild Rice Moon, the sign it is harvest time for the grain of such cultural importance to local tribes. The generations-old tradition of the wild rice harvest represents a significant cultural event in the lives of Wisconsin’s Ojibwe, Potawatomi and Menominee tribes.  At one time wild rice served as one of the most important Native foods for these northern tribes. Families would gather in camps at rice lakes to harvest and process the grain, as well as to rekindle social relationships. Today, wild rice is still collected by traditional methods. Canoes are poled through the rice bed as a second person uses cedar sticks to pull the stalks into the boat and knock the rice off. Unfortunately, the distribution of wild rice throughout northern Wisconsin has greatly diminished from its historic range, lessening the opportunities for successful harvest.  Reasons for the decline include the negative impacts of pollution, recreational boating, and the unintentional introduction of invasive plant species.  Perhaps the most significant reason for the diminished harvest is the fluctuations of water depth. Wild rice grows in shallow water under some very specific requirements. Even subtle changes to water depth during the critical early growing period can destroy a rice bed for a season.  Continued water depth problems eventually eliminate wild rice from a lake altogether.   Beaver dams blocking the outlets of rice lakes commonly contribute to fluctuating water depth. Removal of beaver dams often serve as a critical component of wild rice restoration. U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Wildlife Services (WS) in Wisconsin provides expertise in beaver damage management for wild rice recovery and maintenance, through a partnership with the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC), individual tribes, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR).  WS monitors 23 wild rice lakes spread across northern Wisconsin for the presence of beaver dams.  On-the-ground surveys of each lake are conducted in late winter or early spring, prior to the wild rice growing season.  Any beaver dams discovered at lake outlets are removed, thereby preventing unnecessary fluctuations of water depth and allowing the wild rice to grow naturally. Lakes are monitored throughout the growing season for any increase in beaver activity.  Similar projects are undertaken by WS in Minnesota for the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe and the Chippewa National Forest. WS’ efforts have contributed to the resurgence of wild rice beds on many lakes, helping to ensure successful wild rice harvests for the future.

"USDA, Helping Small Rural Businesses Grow and Create Jobs  Last month, I joined Secretary Vilsack in announcing National Small Business Week on behalf of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Louisiana. In support of rural small businesses, USDA announced several funding opportunities across the country for business owners to increase their capacity to hire new workers and expand their businesses. Small Businesses are the lifeblood of every community, but in a rural town one small business can mean the difference between a thriving main street and empty windows. This is why the work that USDA does on behalf of rural America is so important. The state office for Rural Development is located in Central Louisiana where I met State Director Clarence Hawkins and his staff before we headed out to visit local businesses. The first stop was Consolidated Energy Holdings in Pollock. A variety of waste sources is produced by the company. Later, I had the opportunity to speak at the Cenla Small Business Appreciation Luncheon at the Central Louisiana Business Incubator in Alexandria. I was so inspired by the business incubator, which the city started as a workforce training facility for those with the desire to grow and expand their businesses. The incubator provides business owners with growth strategies, financing options, resources, and administrative support to name a few. There is an industrial kitchen available to use for food based business opportunities and specialty food producers. This incubator is the epitome of what small communities across rural America should be doing, making investments in their own citizens to foster job growth.

"Minnesota USDA Public Information Officer in  USDA Results  Rural  May 23,   Walking through AGCO’s campus in Jackson, Minn., almost feels like walking through a small city. There are large buildings, busy people heading in different directions, vehicles humming up and down roads and the constant buzz of activity and production. If AGCO was its own city, it’d be growing. Officials from USDA Rural Development and Federated Rural Electric Cooperative recently visited AGCO to highlight how a Rural Economic Development Loan is partially financing an expansion project that will increase production and create about 200 jobs. The no-interest, 10-year loan is going toward a new 75,000 square-foot addition that will add a state-of-the-art visitor’s center and additional production space. The expansion is helping AGCO roll out production of the Massey Ferguson series and the Challenger MT600 series of high horsepower wheeled tractors. “We’re a part of the community here in Jackson and we’re proud to be expanding and adding more jobs in the region,” said Eric Fisher, AGCO’s Director of Operations. AGCO’s workforce is expected to grow from 850 to almost 1,100. The company is currently producing about 50 tractors per month of the new series.  Combined with current tractor production volumes the company will product over 2,500 tractors in Jackson this year. USDA Rural Development makes loans to local utility cooperatives which are passed through and re-loaned to area businesses for expansion and job creation projects. Federated Rural Electric and Rural Development have a strong partnership and have teamed to assist several local businesses in the region. Federated made the first Rural Economic Development loan in the nation in and has made $3.6 million in loans since.

"Public Affairs Specialist for USDA’s Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area in  Conservation  Research and Science  Technology  May 28,   To recognize the contribution that research in agriculture makes in our daily lives, we’re focusing this month’s Science Tuesday blogs on the successes that USDA science agencies have achieved for us all. For over a century, USDA research has spurred innovation and created many great products for our families, but we haven’t done it alone. Partnering with a vast network of university scientists -- as well as other federal agencies, private industry, and other groups -- the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supports agricultural research and extension through competitive grants on topics of great importance to us all. NIFA is also committed to educating our youth in science and agriculture, supporting opportunities for rural communities, 4-H, and scholars programs. So, today we’re focusing on the research of NIFA and its partners because “Ag Research Counts” every day, for every American. We’re continuing our trivia contest on Facebook with questions from past ‘Science Tuesday’ blogs. Feel free to participate on Twitter using the hashtag .

"Posted by Secretary of State John Kerry, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Dr. Rajiv ""Raj"" Shah, Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Sep 24,   From record droughts in Kansas to deadly wildfires in California, the United States is feeling the effects of climate change. These same conditions have a dire impact across the developing world, especially for poor, rural smallholder farmers whose very lives are threatened every time the rains arrive late, the floods rush in, or the temperature soars. By , the world’s population is expected to reach nine billion people. Feeding them will require at least a 60 percent increase in agricultural production. There is no greater challenge to meeting this need than climate change. It poses a range of unprecedented threats to the livelihoods of the world’s most vulnerable people and to the very planet that sustains us. In order to ensure that hundreds of millions of people are not born into a debilitating cycle of under-nutrition and hunger, we must address the urgent threat that climate change poses. That’s why today we’re announcing the launch of the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture. The idea was born eight months ago, when an international delegation of leaders—including many from the USDA, the State Department, and USAID—met in South Africa for the Global Conference on Climate Change, Food Security, and Agriculture. There, we charted a more sustainable path to food security—one that preserves the environment while driving broad-based economic growth. The Alliance's solutions will encompass every type of climate and agricultural system, including better crop, livestock, and aquaculture varieties that can tolerate extreme heat, drought, and floods. We are also testing and deploying innovative tools for farmers, like weather-indexed crop and livestock insurance to help communities build resilience to severe weather. The Alliance will advance a more inclusive, innovative, and evidence-based approach to food security. It will provide platforms for partners to collaborate on agricultural practices, make key investments, develop policies that empower producers to mitigate the impact of climate change and, through sustainable agriculture practices, contribute to a dramatic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. It will also provide farmers—particularly women—with greater economic opportunities. Joining the Alliance represents an ambitious step in the United States’ efforts to integrate climate change policies into every area of our work. The Alliance will work in concert with the U.S. Global Climate Change Initiative, drawing on its expertise and experience grappling with climate change challenges in more than 50 developing countries around the world. This climate-specific knowledge and practice being pioneered today will be critical to protect lives and livelihoods, and promote low-carbon growth and development around the world. As one of his Administration's first foreign policy acts, President Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton launched Feed the Future, the U.S. Government’s global hunger and food security initiative. Led by USAID—in partnership with USDA, the State Department, and eight other federal agencies—Feed the Future empowers vulnerable communities to move from dependency to self-sufficiency. In the last year alone, Feed the Future has improved the nutrition for 12.5 million children across 19 countries. At the same time, it has helped 7 million farmers grow their yields, raise their income, and begin the journey out of the devastating cycle of extreme poverty. In , President Obama rallied a group of global leaders at the G8 Summit at Camp David to launch the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, aimed to increase public-private partnerships and increase investment in agriculture. Today, we’ve leveraged $10 billion in investment from more than 200 companies—the majority from local African firms, including farmer-owned businesses. Here in the United States, we’ve taken steps to address climate change and its impact on agriculture, setting up seven climate hubs and three sub-hubs; launching the Soil Health Initiative (healthier soil captures more carbon and helps farmers succeed), engaging more farmers than any time in American history in land and water conservation efforts, and we’re contributing to the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gasses. Our experiences at home can provide lessons that are valuable for farmers around the world. We don’t have time to wait. From India to the United States, climate change poses drastic risks to every facet of our lives. Ground water supplies are vanishing faster than they can be replenished. Typhoons, wildfires, and floods are showing signs of becoming more frequent and more deadly. And with each day, families are pushed to the brink of survival—threatening our own prosperity and security in an increasingly connected world. Addressing climate change will not be an easy fix, and it won’t be simple. Long term global food security depends on us acting together now.  That’s why the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture is so critical. By joining together, we can design new technologies and create new alliances to effectively protect and manage the environment that supports us—and the thriving ecosystems that will sustain our world for generations to come.

"NRCS Mississippi in  Conservation  Mar 12,  Members of the Hinds County Earth Team group gathered at Van Winkle Elementary School to give an environmental education program. Trees are important natural resources—this is the lesson that a dedicated group of volunteers shared last week with Mississippi youngsters. Seventeen members of the Earth Team, the volunteer work force of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), read Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax to students at Van Winkle Elementary School in Jackson, Miss. last Friday. The children’s book promotes the importance of the conservation of natural resources, and it was a good way to connect the Hinds County Earth Team group with youngsters in their community. The book is about a character named the Once-ler, who is profitting from the harvest of Truffula trees. The Lorax pleads with the Once-ler to conserve the trees, warning that once all are removed, the environment will be in peril. This book, first published in , is a favorite of environmental educators. This Earth Team effort was coordinated with the National Education Association’s “Read Across America Day,” promoting the reading of The Lorax in classrooms across the U.S. The group read the same book last year. Volunteers wore The Cat in the Hat-style hats and left each of the 24 classrooms with a copy of the book and gave each student a bookmark. Volunteer Nancy Lau gave the school a DVD of the classic cartoon The Lorax. This volunteer effort also coincided with the March 2 debut of the movie The Lorax, based on the book, and Dr. Seuss’ birthday. Wyvette Robinson, district clerk of the Hinds County Soil and Water Conservation District, reads The Lorax to students in Jackson, Miss. Earth Team volunteers in Hinds County received state and regional accolades last year for their dedication to environmental education for youngsters. “We hope that one day, when it’s their turn to make policy and steer our nation, [these children] will be aware of our Nation’s unique—but sensitive—ecosystems,” said Porter, district administrator for the Hinds County Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD). Mississippi’s Arbor Day is held in February, and Earth Day is in April, making trees a popular subject this time of the year. The SWCD partners with the county’s NRCS employees and Earth Team to hold a tree giveaway in early February. This year, district employees visited 24 schools, giving trees to nearly 2,000 students to take home and plant. This event was followed by two weeks of educational programs in schools on the importance of trees and how to plant them. It originally started as “Tree Planting Week,” but because of its popularity, Porter and the SWCD extended it to two weeks. Find out how to become an Earth Team volunteer in your community.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Feb 17,  What is the Lorax? And why do we care? And why had the U.S. Forest Service taken us  from the far reaches of the forests to the carpets of Hollywood? Ask the Chief. He will be there. He knows. U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell will travel to California for the premier of the animated movie Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax, which includes the agency’s first Honorary Forest Ranger Betty White.  In the movie, a 12-year-old boy (Zac Efron) tries to win a young girl’s heart (Taylor Swift) by going in search of the Lorax, a grumpy yet charming character who fights to protect the world played by Danny DeVito. Betty White plays the role of the grandmother. The movie is adapted from the book of the same name, written in by Theodor Seuss Geisel, known by millions simply as Dr. Seuss. The book is narrated by the Once-ler, a faceless character who tells a young boy the story of the lost Truffula trees, which are nowhere to be found. But as he tells his story, the Once-ler says to the boy: Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot nothing is going to get better It’s not.* The Lorax then tosses the last Truffula tree seed, urging the boy to set out and plant the seed and help bring back a forest of Truffula trees as well as the Barb-ba-loots, Swoomee-Swans and Humming-Fish that relied on a healthy forest to survive. “Given the many threats to America’s private and public forests due to a changing climate, pests and pathogens, and land conversion, this children’s story can spur conversations about what has to happen today to restore the health and productivity of America’s forests,” Tidwell said. “This is an opportunity to start a dialogue about the inherent value of forests and the importance of sustainable management.” The nation’s 193 million acres of forest and grasslands provide a wealth of public benefits: clean air and water, wildlife habitat, recreation and the wood and paper products Americans use every day. “Forests matter to everyone, and we must use and care for them responsibly and sustainably,” Tidwell said. “The Forest Service, our state partners, family forest owners and the many partner organizations we work with are helping to protect more than 751 million acres of forest land in America. Ensuring that trees are part of America’s landscape is a goal we all share with The Lorax.” The Lorax also is an integral part of a public service campaign with the Forest Service and the Ad Council. The two agencies have worked together since on a public service campaign designed to inspire children and their families to unplug and reconnect with nature. The Ad Council helped the Forest Service join forces with Universal Pictures, which created pro bono a series of new English and Spanish television, radio and outdoor public service advertisements that feature characters from the movie, which will open nationwide March 2, Dr. Seuss’ 108th birthday. The PSAs encourage viewers to go Discover the Forest, an online site that helps children learn about how to discover the wonders of forests around them. *Excerpt from The Lorax by Dr. Seuss, Random House, .

"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication in  Forestry  Mar 05,   Imagine being a kid and having a senior government official come to your school to share the joy of reading and storytelling. Then imagine the excitement when an actual Dr. Seuss character enters the room! Arthur “Butch” Blazer and the Lorax. That’s what happened when Arthur “Butch” Blazer, USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, recently spoke to more than 300 students at James K. Polk Elementary School in Alexandria, Va. about the importance of trees and forests. “Why are trees important?” the former State Forester of New Mexico asked the students. “Do you know where you get your drinking water every day? Much of that water comes from the forest”. “It’s so important that we take care of our forests. Remember it’s important that we keep our forests healthy so we have good water to drink. If our forests go away, where will we find our water?” Blazer proceeded to share with the curious young faces the story about The Lorax, which revolves on the Dr. Seuss character’s quest to reinvigorate a forest filled with trees and their reliant ecosystems. Standing between the students and a drop-down screen that displayed accompanying images, Blazer, who was donning his cowboy hat, began reading The Lorax. The lights were dimmed and the school’s multipurpose room was quiet with the occasional bursts of giggles by students, whose grade ranges included kindergarten, fourth and fifth grades. The kindergarteners proudly wore paper hats made to mimic Dr. Seuss’ signature Cat in the Hat. After Blazer’s storytelling came to an end, the lights came on and the students’ applause grew thunderous when their school principal surprised them with another guest -- The Lorax himself, who entered the room to greet the excited students! This event coincides with the release of Universal Pictures’ film, The Lorax. Blazer’s reading of the story also served as a component of the National Education Association’s Read Across America Day, an annual event sponsored by the association to promote literacy among children in the United States. The character, The Lorax, has additionally been part of a major public service campaign, jointly led by the Forest Service and the Ad Council since , that encourages kids to Discover the Forest. “I hope that the students learn to share our love for the environment and our love for trees,” said Heidi McAllister, assistant director of the Forest Service’s Conservation Education program in Washington, D.C., who attended the school’s special event. “I hope that they establish a relationship with the environment that will grow over time and help sustain them throughout their lives.”  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Tags:  Butch Blazer  Forestry  The Lorax  U.S. Forest Service","What is the main takeaway from Arthur ""Butch"" Blazer's storytelling session with students, as part of the National Education Association's Read Across America Day and the US Forest Service's public service campaign?","The main takeaway from Arthur ""Butch"" Blazer's storytelling session was to educate students about the importance of trees and forests in providing clean water, and to promote a love for the environment that will grow over time."
"Davey Tree Expert Co. in  Forestry  Feb 16,   Like in many communities, tree care in Casper, Wyo. was largely reactive and just one of many duties performed by the Public Services Department staff. Year after year of seeing trees removed without a plan for replacement worried the city staff members who performed tree work. No one, however, had any basis for articulating an argument that Casper’s prized legacy—their tree canopy—was poised for imminent decline. The last large scale tree planting initiative in Casper was at the end of World War II and their urban forest, full of Siberian elms, was not aging gracefully. For a few staff members, finding a way to make a compelling argument to care for community trees that was cost effective, accessible and credible became their personal charge. “After considering our options, we felt that i-Tree would not only give us a comprehensive picture of our urban forest, but also tell us what it was doing for the community,” recalls Jim Gerhart, a member of the staff. “We needed to make a case for funding an urban forestry program and a person to run that program…we wanted to have information that would help that person hit the ground running!” Gerhart attended an i-Tree workshop in , and used his new know-how to train staff and volunteers to begin studying the value and benefits of Casper’s trees. In all, 243 tenth-acre plots located throughout the city were inventoried in this highly visible effort. The Casper Urban Forest Effects report provided a scientifically credible snapshot of Casper’s entire urban forest: street trees, park trees, and those on private lands. The results not only confirmed the vulnerability of an aging and homogenous urban forest, but also put economic values on the city’s “green” capital and the benefits it provides. Using the , city staff were able to illustrate, with certainty, that Casper’s trees were not only a valuable asset, but a fragile one too. More startling than the hundreds of thousands of dollars in energy and air quality benefits the forest produces yearly, is the investment the city found it would need to replace this component of the infrastructure if all was lost: $243 million dollars! After seeing the  i-Tree results, the city committed $450,000 to launch and administer a pilot urban forestry program over three years, and they hired the first City Forester of Casper, William Scott. “Every day we use the baseline i-Tree to determine what trees we plant and where the priorities are,” said Scott. “It really has enabled us to not only diversify the city’s tree resource, but the emerging resource that cares for the trees: the newly founded Urban Forestry Section. Our i-Tree project has allowed us to build external and internal relationships with other departments such as engineering, planning and community development that didn’t exist two years ago.” i-Tree was developed in partnership between the Forest Service, the Davey Tree Expert Company, the National Arbor Day Foundation, the Society of Municipal Arborists, the International Society of Arboriculture and Casey Trees.

Urban trees make up an important part of the framework of green canopy in metropolitan areas connected with national, public and private lands and they are important to the health of the environment we share. The tour had eight stops focusing on: Viewing US Capitol across National Mall. (Photo courtesy of DDOT) Efforts to promote large street-tree survival Incorporation of Low Impact Design (LID) practices including trees and green roofs at the D.C. Consolidated Forensic Labs to minimize stormwater runoff Rubber sidewalk installations to reduce tree root damage Recycling and using urban wood in metro Washington, D.C. Removal of impervious surfaces  to provide new tree planting areas and increase urban tree canopy Restoration of a riparian  buffer near an armored stream Innovative approaches to increasing tree canopy health and survival Recycled urban wood use at the People’s Garden at the USDA “At the Forest Service, we recognize that our responsibilities go beyond the national forests,” said Tidwell. “We have a role to play, directly or indirectly, and that includes the nation’s 100 million acres of urban forests. Our goal is a continuous network of healthy forested landscapes, from remote wilderness areas to the urban neighborhoods where most people live.” Many of the projects highlighted on the tour were supported in part by the U.S. Forest Service’s State and Private Forestry grants in partnership with the Government of the District of Columbia or other NGO partners. Brian LeCouteur, principal environmental planner with Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, provided an overview of COG's grant project with the Wood Education Resource Center called ""The National Capital Urban Timber Recovery Project"" at lunch. This project diverts urban trees from landfills for use as lumber and woodworking in the District and Maryland. Lunch was sourced from a local farm-to-table caterer. The Urban Forestry Administration (UFA) is an administration within the District Department of Transportation.  UFA’s duties include planting, pruning, removing, and maintaining the health of the District of Columbia’s public space tree canopy, specifically street trees and other trees on District parkland and recreational properties.

"Meeting the China E-Commerce Challenge  In the United States, farming and technology go hand-in-hand in production agriculture. Technology helps improve productivity, efficiency and safety. Now, we’re discovering new ways that technology and digital strategies can offer similar benefits when marketing U.S. farm and food products overseas. I recently led a group of women agricultural leaders on a trade mission to Shanghai and Hong Kong in China. One of the most interesting things we saw and learned was how e-commerce is paving the way for Chinese consumers to gain quick and easy access to high-value U.S. food and agricultural products. As a young, Chinese shopper explained to me, he purchases nearly 80 percent of his groceries online – skipping the trip to a traditional wet market or Western-style grocery store.

"As the Weather Cools, Your Firewood Choices Matter  This October, the Nature Conservancy’s Don’t Move Firewood campaign and Hungry Pests, an initiative from APHIS, are partnering to present the first-ever Firewood Awareness Month. The cooler nights and quickly approaching fall season brings an increase in RV camping, hunting, and home heating. Firewood Awareness Month looks to raise public awareness about the potential danger of firewood movement as a pest and disease pathway at this high-risk time of year. Tree-killing invasive insects and diseases can lurk both inside, and on the surface, of firewood. While these insects and diseases don’t travel far on their own, transporting firewood allows them to move hundreds of miles and start infestations in new places, explains APHIS Deputy Administrator Osama El-Lissy.

"New Land Ownership Add Value to Many Policy and Research Questions  Whether they farm the land themselves or rent it out to others to farm, those who own agricultural land are taking measures to keep the land in their families. This is good news for those who worry about the United States losing agricultural land to competing pressures. At USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, we just released the findings from a survey of agricultural landowners conducted earlier this year. It confirmed some things we know already and generated lots of new information that farmers, policymakers, businesses and others will use to understand more about who owns farmland, who has and will have access to farmland in the future, what kinds of conservation and production decision landowners are making, and lots more.

"The President's New Executive Order on Climate Preparedness: Another Step to Support American Agriculture  Today, President Obama established a Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience to advise the Administration on how the Federal Government can respond to the needs of communities facing the impacts of climate change. This is an important step in our shared effort to respond to climate change - and like the President's broader Climate Action Plan, it will help American agriculture mitigate and adapt to the impacts of a changing climate. America's farmers, ranchers and landowners have long been tremendous stewards of our environment. At USDA, we have worked with a record number of producers and landowners over the course of the Obama Administration to help conserve the soil and water, and clean our air - more than half a million over the past four and a half years. Meanwhile, in support of the Climate Action Plan, USDA put forward a series of new policies in June to help agriculture develop new climate solutions in the months and years to come. We have taken steps to create seven new regional climate hubs that will aid in sharing climate information for farmers and ranchers. We released the results of the Rapid Carbon Assessment - the largest-ever survey of soil carbon to help improve research efforts.

The Norman E. Borlaug International Agricultural Science and Technology Fellowship Program, funded by USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), is a six to 12 week training program that pairs up-and-coming researchers from selected countries with mentors from a U.S. land-grant institution or government agency. Sugri, one of 36 FAS Borlaug Fellows in , was assigned to the University of Florida with the specific goal of reducing post-harvest losses of tomatoes by better understanding climate-relevant, low-tech methods of extending shelf life of fresh fruits and vegetables. When he returned to Ghana, Sugri put his fellowship training to immediate use. Collaborating with fellow researchers at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research – Savannah Agricultural Research Institute (CSIR-SARI), based in Bawku, Ghana, he published fact sheets for local farmers describing optimal harvest and storage conditions. Sugri even included his mobile phone number so he could accept field questions and provide clarification.  He also worked with extension agents to train producers on post-harvest loss avoidance techniques and their economic benefits. At Sugri’s urging, SARI hired a dedicated food scientist to focus additional research on the topic.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Texas in  Conservation  Jul 25,  Simon Winston and his family recently won the national Leopold Conservation Award for their conservation work. In deep East Texas, pine trees are king. Towering pines line the roads and blanket the rolling countryside and national forests. Loblolly and slash pine dominate the landscape in contrast to the area’s historic longleaf pine trees that once reigned. The reduced number of longleaf pines has not gone unnoticed by landowners and conservationists. In response to the striking loss of longleaf pine trees from Texas to Florida, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) launched the national Longleaf Pine Initiative, which provides technical and financial assistance for conservation practices that help restore longleaf pine forests and enhance existing pine stands. Working alongside NRCS, Simon Winston of Winston 8 Ranch of Nacogdoches, Texas, is one landowner who is doing his part to help restore longleaf pine to its native habitat. In turn, his stewardship efforts are also benefiting native grasses and wildlife populations. “What I like about them is that when they are young you can burn in them,” Winston said. “Loblolly you can’t burn in them until they are bigger.” Prescribed burns are a conservation practice used on longleaf pine forests. Fire reduces moisture and nutrient competition. The elimination of brush and other woody species also allows for native grasses and foraging plants to thrive. In turn, wildlife are drawn to the understory of longleaf pine forests. “We’re getting wild plums and seeing more deer. There’s something for them to eat and for the birds to nest in,” Winston said. “Burning helps establish bluestem grasses which are good nesting habitat for turkeys and quail.” Longleaf pine restoration continues on the Winston 8 Ranch. But the cost of establishing longleaf pine trees can be greater than other pine species. Longleaf seedlings can cost more, and site preparation is a vital component for establishment success. This is where NRCS in partnership with private landowners makes a difference on the landscape. Through the initiative, Winston was able to recover some of the costs associated with seedling establishment and site preparation. In fact, Winston said the financial assistance made a difference in what he was able to accomplish on his ranch. “We’re just trying to make better conservation and do what’s right,” Winston said. “That’s what we do everyday. It’s naturally what we do.” Winston’s dedication to environmental stewardship recently caught the attention of the Sand County Foundation, which honored Winston with the national Leopold Conservation Award. Longleaf pine once covered 90 million acres from Texas to Florida. Today, an estimated 3 percent of these forests remain. Partnerships between NRCS and landowners like Winston can result in improved ecological diversity, wildlife habitat, and increased longleaf pine trees on the landscape of East Texas. NRCS and its many conservation partners are working to reverse the century-long decline in longleaf pine forests through the America’s Longleaf Restoration Initiative. Earlier this week, NRCS joined fellow partners in this initiative to mark the five-year anniversary of creation of the initiative’s Range-wide Conservation Plan for Longleaf Pine.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Working in science can be a real pleasure, especially when your research translates into a life changing experience. The following note from Arion Thiboumery, Vice President of Lorentz Meats and one of the Sustainable Agriculture Research & Education’s (SARE) early Graduate Student grants, submitted a very modest proposal to establish a small-meat processors working group and publish a guide of useful resources. He accomplished that and much more. Read on... About halfway through working on my Ph.D., I came across a recurring problem. My dissertation focused on helping small-scale meat processors expand, upgrade, and build new facilities, essential for allowing smaller, diversified farms to access meat markets and for creating more demand for meat processing. The problem was that butchers were getting older and looking to retire and finding someone young to take over was challenging. The trade of butchering, a practice even older than agriculture itself, was fading due to a lack of job appeal among people my age . With a USDA Sustainable Agriculture Research & Education grant, I developed a training program and resource guides, and helped form one of the most active stakeholder networks in livestock agriculture, now called the Niche Meat Processor Assistance Network. Yet one question haunted me: How could I convince young people to take on this task of being the noble and honest butcher, when I couldn’t convince myself to do it? So I finished my Ph.D. and took a job as a meat processor. That was not an easy decision. Going through 22 years of schooling to slaughter animals for a living might not strike folks as the best use of an education, but I disagree: As we seek to build a more sustainable future, all of us—regardless of profession—need to contribute our talents to build that future. If those of us who feel strongly about butchering don’t contribute, who will? There’s much work to be done in many vocations. And I’m glad to have contributed to this one.

"Economist at the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 13,  Families Projected to Spend an Average of $233,610 Raising a Child Born in . USDA recently issued Expenditures on Children by Families, . This report is also known as “The Cost of Raising a Child.” USDA has been tracking the cost of raising a child since and this analysis examines expenses by age of child, household income, budgetary component, and region of the country. Based on the most recent from the Consumer Expenditures Survey, in , a family will spend approximately $12,980 annually per child in a middle-income ($59,200-$107,400), two-child, married-couple family. Middle-income, married-couple parents of a child born in may expect to spend $233,610 ($284,570 if projected inflation costs are factored in*) for food, shelter, and other necessities to raise a child through age 17. This does not include the cost of a college education. Where does the money go? For a middle-income family, housing accounts for the largest share at 29% of total child-rearing costs.  Food is second at 18%, and child care/education (for those with the expense) is third at 16%. Expenses vary depending on the age of the child. As families often need more room to accommodate children, housing is the largest expense. We did the analysis by household income level, age of the child, and region of residence. Not surprising, the higher a family’s income the more was spent on a child, particularly for child care/education and miscellaneous expenses. Expenses also increase as a child ages.  Overall annual expenses averaged about $300 less for children from birth to 2 years old, and averaged $900 more for teenagers between 15-17 years of age. Teenagers have higher food costs as well as higher transportation costs as these are the years they start to drive so insurance is included or a maybe a second car is purchased for them. Regional variation was also observed. Families in the urban Northeast spent the most on a child, followed by families in the urban West, urban South, and urban Midwest.  Families in rural areas throughout the country spent the least on a child—child-rearing expenses were 27% lower in rural areas than the urban Northeast, primarily due to lower housing and child care/education expenses. Child-rearing expenses are subject to economies of scale. That is, with each additional child, expenses on each declines. For married-couple families with one child, expenses averaged 27% more per child than expenses in a two-child family.  For families with three or more children, per child expenses averaged 24% less on each child than on a child in a two-child family.  This is sometimes referred to as the “cheaper by the dozen” effect. Each additional child costs less because children can share a bedroom; a family can buy food in larger, more economical quantities; clothing and toys can be handed down; and older children can often babysit younger ones. Food costs have decreased over the years thanks to increased efficiency in American agriculture. This report is one of many ways that USDA works to support American families through our programs and work. It outlines typical spending by families from across the country, and is used in a number of ways to help support and education American families.  Courts and state governments use this to inform their decisions about child support and foster care payments.  Financial planners use the information to provide advice to their clients, and families can access our Cost of Raising a Child calculator, which we update with every report on our website, to look at spending patterns for families similar to theirs. This Calculator is one of many tools available on MyMoney.gov, a government research and clearinghouse related to financial education. This year we released the report at a time when families are thinking about their plans for the New Year.  We’ve been focusing on nutrition-related New Year’s resolutions – or what we are referring to as Real Solutions - on our MyPlate website, ChooseMyPlate.gov.  This report and the updated calculator can help families as they focus on financial health resolutions.  This report will provide families with a greater awareness of the expenses they are likely to face while raising children. In addition to the report and the calculator, we also have a dedicated section on ChooseMyPlate.gov that provides tips and tools to aid families and individuals in making healthy choices while staying on a budget. For strategies beyond food, our friends at MyMoney.gov offer a wealth of information to help Americans plan for their financial future.

"Honoring my Teachers, Sharing Traditions on the San Carlos Apache Reservation  With more than 40 years of professional experience working in the field of natural resources, I am sometimes asked to share the personal outdoor experiences I had as a tribal member growing up on my reservation. When the request involves children, and those children are Native American, I am especially honored because in my culture the elders share traditional teachings of how we are connected to nature, both through stories and traditional songs. As we celebrate Earth Day , I am reminded of a recent invitation from the U.S. Forest Service Tonto National Forest and Smokey Bear to speak at a career day on the San Carlos Apache Reservation in Arizona. I had an audience of 180 tribal fourth graders from Rice Elementary School to share my experiences growing up on a reservation and the lessons I learned about the outdoors.

"FNCS in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Dec 15,  Sixth Grade cheerleaders from Sumrall Middle School perform a “healthy eating” cheer during a HealthierUS School Challenge awards ceremony where their school received a Gold level award from USDA FNCS Deputy Under Secretary Dr. Janey Thornton.  I was privileged to go to the State of Mississippi on Dec. 9, for a HealthierUS School Challenge event.  Actually, I was there for three events and 11 schools received either USDA’s Gold of Distinction Awards or Gold Awards.  One of the six schools that was recognized for the Gold of Distinction Award was Purvis High School in Purvis, Miss.  This school is actually the first high school in the country to win this award and counting the other five Gold of Distinction award winners; these six schools are the first in Mississippi to be recognized for this particular award. Certainly nutrition staff, along with parents, teachers and students, have played a huge role in Lamar County School District’s success. The Child Nutrition Department for the district has a centralized menu providing daily:  four entrees, chef or specialty salads, three to four fruit and vegetable choices, and whole grain bread and croutons baked daily.  An annual PTO Academy is conducted keeping parents and faculty abreast of wellness policy regulations and fresh ideas on healthier snacks and fundraising. In addition, some of the schools have their own gardens. Some require walking a few laps around the track or field before starting free play at recess.  The Child Nutrition Staff has a lot of training every year in food preparation and presentation, and whole grain breads are baked from scratch daily at all of the schools. I think you can readily see why Lamar County School District is an outstanding organization that encourages wellness.  So many of its schools are providing an excellent nutrition environment and exercise opportunities for their students.  I was encouraged by what I saw and I hope many more schools will follow Lamar County School District’s example.      USDA’s HealthierUS School Challenge recognizes schools that create and maintain healthy school environments by promoting good nutrition and physical activity.  It’s a key component of First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! campaign to end childhood obesity within a generation.

"USDA Food & Nutrition Service, Midwest Region in  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Feb 14,  A recent USDA HUSSC event featured a rousing finale in which the entire gymnasium-filled with jumping and cheering students, teachers, administrators and partners- were showered with gold confetti.  We don’t often associate rock music with school nutrition, but perhaps that’s changed after a fun-filled, rollicking event I attended at Golfview Elementary in Carpentersville, Illinois. Even the effects of a historic Midwest blizzard couldn’t keep students, star athletes, representatives from a few federal agencies, nutrition service staff, professional athletes–and a self-proclaimed New York City rockstar–from celebrating a momentous occasion on February 4th – a USDA HealthierUS School Gold of Distinction award ceremony. Golfview and School District 300, Illinois’s sixth largest school district, decided they would seek to qualify for USDA’s HUSSC Gold of Distinction by improving the nutrition of their school meals and providing more physical activity. And to celebrate their receipt of a plaque from USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, the school and district hosted an action-packed event.  At the same time, the event commemorated the one-year anniversary of First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! initiative, of which HUSSC is a cornerstone.  The event featured USDA’s Power Panther and other mascots, a jazz combo that kicked things off with a sophisticated version of the national anthem, a team of cheerleaders, speakers, a nutrition and fitness activity led by professional figure skaters and Olympic hopefuls Rockne and Collin Brubaker, an inspirational video-taped message and music video from rockstar nutritionist Jill Jayne and a glittery, rousing finale in which the entire gymnasium–filled with jumping and cheering students, teachers, administrators and partners–were showered with gold confetti. From beginning to end, Golfview and District 300’s celebration was golden, and all for a good cause–the arrival of more nutritious school meals, more physically active school children, and ultimately, healthier children. Congratulations to Golfview Elementary and District 300- you rock! Please follow USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service on Twitter.
